IMPORTANT WARNING:
Clopidogrel must be changed inside your body to start working. Some bodies do not do this as well as others. If the medication does not work well, you may have a higher chance of having a heart attack or stroke. There are tests available to identify people who have trouble activating clopidogrel. Talk to your doctor about whether you should be tested. If you are found to have difficulty converting clopidogrel, your doctor may change your dose of clopidogrel or tell you not to take clopidogrel.
Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the Medication Guide. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit
https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm
to obtain the Medication Guide.
Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking clopidogrel.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Clopidogrel is used to prevent repeat heart attacks or strokes in people who have had a stroke, heart attack,  severe chest pain or peripheral arterial disease (poor  blood flow in the blood vessels that bring blood to your legs). Clopidogrel is in a class of medications called antiplatelet medications. It works by preventing platelets (a type of blood cell) from collecting and forming clots that may cause a heart attack or stroke.
How should this medicine be used?
Clopidogrel comes as a tablet to take by mouth. Take once a day with or without food. Take clopidogrel at around the same time every day. Take clopidogrel exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Clopidogrel will help prevent serious problems with your heart and blood vessels only as long as you take the medication. Continue to take clopidogrel even if you feel well. Do not stop taking clopidogrel without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking clopidogrel, there is a higher risk that you may have a heart attack or stroke. If you have a stent, stopping clopidogrel too soon can also raise the risk of a blood clot forming in the stent.
Other uses for this medicine
Clopidogrel is also sometimes used to prevent blood clots in people with atrial fibrillation (a condition in which the heart beats irregularly). Talk to your doctor about the possible risks of using this medication for your condition.
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking clopidogrel,
tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to this drug, any part of this drug, or any other drugs, foods or substances. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about the allergy and what symptoms you had.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking clopidogrel. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
The following nonprescription products may interact with clopidogrel: omeprazole; esomeprazole; aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking clopidogrel. Do not start any of these medications while taking clopidogrel without discussing with your healthcare provider.
tell your doctor if you have bleeding ulcers (sores in the lining of the stomach or small intestine), bleeding in the brain, or any other condition that causes severe bleeding. Your doctor may tell you that you should not take clopidogrel.
tell your doctor if you were recently hurt, or if you have or have ever had liver or kidney disease. Also tell them if you have any condition that could cause bleeding, like stomach problems or ulcers.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking clopidogrel, call your doctor.
if you are having surgery, including dental surgery, tell the doctor or dentist that you are taking clopidogrel. Your doctor may tell you to stop taking clopidogrel at least 5 days prior to your surgery to avoid excessive bleeding during surgery. Your doctor will tell you when to start taking clopidogrel again after your surgery.
you should know that you may bleed more easily or for a longer time than usual while you are taking clopidogrel. Be careful not to cut or hurt yourself while you are taking clopidogrel.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Take the missed dose as soon as you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
