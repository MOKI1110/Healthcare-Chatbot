IMPORTANT WARNING:
Donanemab-azbt injection may cause a serious or life-threatening reaction called amyloid related imaging abnormalities (ARIA; a condition that may cause swelling and bleeding in the brain). If you experience any of the following symptoms, tell your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: headache, confusion, dizziness, vision changes, nausea, difficulty walking or loss of balance, muscle weakness, difficulty speaking, or seizures.
Always carry identification stating that you are receiving donanemab-azbt injection. If you need an identification card, ask your pharmacist or doctor how to get one.
The chance that you will develop ARIA during your treatment with donanemab-azbt may be higher if you have a genetic (inherited) risk factor. Your doctor may order a blood test to help decide if this medication is right for you. Tell your doctor if you are taking medications that may cause bleeding.
Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor will order certain tests such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI; a medical test that uses powerful magnets to take pictures of the inside of the body) scans before and during treatment to check your body's response to donanemab-azbt.
You will be given the Medication Guide. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit

Why is this medication prescribed?
Donanemab-azbt injection is used to treat early Alzheimer's disease. Donanemab-azbt is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It works by reducing amyloid beta plaques, abnormal proteins that develop in the brain and contribute to the progression of Alzheimer's disease.
How should this medicine be used?
Donanemab-azbt comes as a solution (liquid) to be given intravenously (into the vein) by a doctor or a nurse at a hospital or clinic. It is given over 30 minutes every 4 weeks.
Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of donanemab-azbt  and gradually increase your dose.
Donanemab-azbt injection may cause serious reactions during or shortly after the infusion. A doctor or nurse will watch you carefully while you are receiving the medication. You may be given other medications to help prevent and treat reactions. If you experience any of the following symptoms, tell your doctor immediately: chills, sweating, nausea, vomiting, redness or irritation of the skin, headache, chest pain, or difficulty breathing or shortness of breath.
Your doctor may need to interrupt your treatment or stop your treatment depending on your response to the medication and any side effects that you experience. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment.
Donanemab-azbt controls Alzheimer's disease but does not cure it. Do not stop receiving donanemab-azbt without talking to your doctor.
