IMPORTANT WARNING:
Medications such as citalopram may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and actions. This increase was found in children, teenagers, and young adults (less than 24 years of age). The risk may be more likely with the first few months of treatment and when the dose is increased.
Call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: new or worsening depression; thinking about harming or killing yourself, or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; panic attacks; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; aggressive behavior; irritability; acting without thinking; severe restlessness; and frenzied abnormal excitement. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to do so.
The doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with citalopram. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You also can obtain the Medication Guide from the FDA website:
https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm
.
Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking citalopram.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Citalopram is used to treat depression.
Citalopram is in a class of antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). It works by increasing the amount of serotonin, a natural substance in the brain that helps maintain mental balance.
How should this medicine be used?
Citalopram comes as a capsule, a tablet, and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth.
Take once a day, with or without food. Take citalopram at around the same time every day.
Take citalopram exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Your doctor may start you on a low dose of citalopram and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once a week.
It may take several weeks before you notice the full benefit of citalopram.  Do not stop taking citalopram without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking citalopram, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as mood changes,
irritability,
agitation,
dizziness,
numbness, tingling or electric shock-like sensations in the hands or feet,
anxiety,
confusion,
headache,
tiredness,
nausea,  sweating,
shaking,
frenzied or abnormally excited mood,
and difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep.
Tell your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms.
