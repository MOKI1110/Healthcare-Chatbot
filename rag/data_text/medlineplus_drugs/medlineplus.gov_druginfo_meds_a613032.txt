IMPORTANT WARNING:
If you have atrial fibrillation (a condition where the heart beats irregularly and can lead to blood clots and stroke) and are taking apixaban to help prevent strokes or serious blood clots, you are at a higher risk of having a stroke after you stop taking this medication. Do not stop taking apixaban without talking to your doctor. Continue to take apixaban even if you feel well. Be sure to refill your prescription before you run out of medication so that you will not miss any doses of apixaban. If you need to stop taking apixaban, your doctor may prescribe another anticoagulant ('blood thinner') to help prevent blood clots and lower your risk of stroke.
If you have epidural or spinal anesthesia or a shot in your spine while taking a 'blood thinner' such as apixaban, you could get a blood clot near your spine that can cause paralysis. Tell your doctor if you have a tube in your spine, or if you have had spine problems, back surgery, or more than one spinal shot. Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking any of the following: anagrelide; aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen
Â®
, indomethacin, ketoprofen, and naproxen; cilostazol; clopidogrel; dipyridamole; eptifibatide; heparin; prasugrel; ticagrelor; ticlopidine; tirofiban, and warfarin. Call your doctor immediately if you experience muscle weakness (especially in your legs and feet), numbness or tingling (especially in your legs), or trouble controlling your bladder or bowels.
Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with apixaban and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (
https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm
) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.
Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking apixaban.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Apixaban is used to:
prevent strokes or blood clots in people who have atrial fibrillation (a condition where the heart beats irregularly and can lead to clots and stroke) in adults.
prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT; a blood clot, usually in the leg) and pulmonary embolism (PE; a blood clot in the lung) in certain situations.
treat DVT and PE
Apixaban is in a class of medications called factor Xa inhibitors. It works by blocking a natural substance that helps blood clots to form.
How should this medicine be used?
Apixaban comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It also comes as a tablet and capsule to be mixed with water and given as a suspension to take by mouth. Take with or without food twice a day.  Take apixaban at around the same times every day. Your doctor will tell you when to start apixaban and how long to take it based on the reason it is being used.
Take apixaban exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
If you are unable to swallow the tablets, you can crush them and mix with water, apple juice, or applesauce. Swallow the mixture right after you prepare it. Apixaban can also be given in certain types of feeding tubes. Ask your doctor if you should place this medication in your feeding tube. Follow your doctor's directions carefully.
If you are receiving the tablet or capsule for suspension (liquid mixture), you will receive instructions on how to mix and give the medicine with your prescription. Read it carefully. Take the  suspension within 2 hours of making. This suspension can be given in certain types of feeding tubes. Ask your doctor if you should take this medication in your feeding tube. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions on how to give the suspension.
Continue to take apixaban even if you feel well. Do not stop taking apixaban without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking apixaban, your risk of a blood clot may increase.
