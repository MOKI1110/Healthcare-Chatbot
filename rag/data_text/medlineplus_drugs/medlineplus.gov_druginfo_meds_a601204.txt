IMPORTANT WARNING:
Butorphanol nasal spray may be habit forming. Use butorphanol nasal spray exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it, use it more often, stop using it suddenly, or use it in a different way than directed by your doctor.  Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family drinks or has ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, uses or has ever used street drugs, or has overused prescription medications, or has had an overdose, or if you have or have ever had depression or another mental illness.
Butorphanol nasal spray may cause serious or life-threatening breathing problems, especially during the first 24 to 72 hours of your treatment and any time your dose is increased.  If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: slowed breathing, long pauses between breaths, or shortness of breath.
Butorphanol nasal spray may harm or cause death to other people who use your medication, especially children. Keep butorphanol nasal spray in a safe place so that no one else can take it accidentally or on purpose.
Taking certain other medications, drinking alcohol, or using street drugs with butorphanol nasal spray may increase the risk of serious or life-threatening breathing problems. Tell your doctor and pharmacist  what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, and nutritional supplements you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medication and will monitor you carefully.
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you use butorphanol nasal spray regularly during your pregnancy, your baby may experience life-threatening withdrawal symptoms after birth.
Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the Medication Guide. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit
https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm
to obtain the Medication Guide.
Talk to your doctor about the risks of using butorphanol nasal spray for your condition.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Butorphanol nasal spray is used to relieve severe pain. Butorphanol is in a class of medications called opioid agonist-antagonists. It works by changing the way the body senses pain.
How should this medicine be used?
Butorphanol nasal spray comes as a solution (liquid) to spray in the nose. Use it as needed for pain every 3 to 4 hours.
Butorphanol nasal spray should relieve your pain soon after you use it. Your doctor may tell you to use a second dose if you still have pain 60 to 90 minutes after your first dose. Do not use this second dose unless your doctor tells you that you may do so. Tell your doctor if you feel that your pain is not controlled or if your pain increases, becomes worse, or if you have new pain or an increased sensitivity to pain during your treatment with butorphanol nasal spray. Do not use more of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. You may receive a dangerous overdose if you use more medication or use your medication more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about access to rescue medicines, naloxone or nalmefene,
while using butorphanol. Rescue medications can reverse the life-threatening effects of an
opioid overdose and are available over the counter or with a prescription. Make sure that you
and your family members and people usually around you know how to recognize an overdose,
how to use naloxone or nalmefene, and what to do until emergency medical help arrives. Your
doctor or pharmacist will show you and others how to use it. If symptoms of an overdose occur,
they should give the first dose of naloxone, call 911 immediately, and stay with you and watch
you closely until emergency medical help arrives. If your symptoms return, the person should
give you another dose of the rescue medication. Additional doses may be given every 2 to 3
minutes, if symptoms return before medical help arrives.
Do not stop using butorphanol nasal spray without talking to your doctor. If you suddenly stop using butorphanol nasal spray, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as nervousness, agitation, shakiness, diarrhea, chills, sweats, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, loss of coordination, confusion, or hallucinations (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist). Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.
Before you use butorphanol nasal spray for the first time, read the written directions provided by the manufacturer. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about how to use butorphanol nasal spray.
To use butorphanol nasal spray, follow these directions:
Gently blow your nose.
Remove the clear cover and protective clip from the bottle.
If you are using a new pump or a pump that has not been used in 48 hours or longer, you must prime the pump before use. Hold the bottle so that the nozzle is between your first and second fingers and your thumb is on the bottom. Be sure that the bottle is aimed away from you, other people, and animals. Pump the bottle firmly and quickly (up to 8 strokes) until a fine spray appears.
Insert the tip of the sprayer approximately 1/2 inch (1 cm) into one nostril, pointing the tip toward the back of your nose.
Close your other nostril with your finger and tilt your head slightly forward.
Pump the spray firmly and quickly one time and sniff gently with your mouth closed.
Remove the sprayer from your nose. Tilt your head backward and sniff gently for a few seconds.
Replace the protective clip and cover on the spray bottle. Put the bottle back in the child-resistant storage container.
Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with butorphanol nasal spray and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (
