Why is this medication prescribed?
The combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole is in a class of drugs called antiplatelet agents. It works by preventing excessive blood clotting. It is used to reduce the risk of stroke in patients who have had or are at risk of stroke.
How should this medicine be used?
The combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day, one capsule in the morning and one in the evening. Aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole should be swallowed whole. Do not open, crush, break, or chew the capsules.
Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
The combination of aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole decreases the risk of having a stroke but does not eliminate that risk. Continue to take aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole even if you feel well. Do not stop taking aspirin and extended-release dipyridamole without talking to your doctor.
