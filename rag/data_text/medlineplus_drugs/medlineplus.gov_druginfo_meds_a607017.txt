Why get vaccinated?
Influenza vaccine, inactivated or recombinant may prevent influenza illness (flu) that may occur with infection due to the influenza virus.
Flu is a contagious disease that spreads around the United States every year, usually between October and May. Anyone can get the flu, but it is more dangerous for some people.
Flu can cause fever and chills, sore throat, muscle aches, fatigue, cough, headache, and runny or stuffy nose. Flu can cause other complications such as sinus infections and pneumonia and can lead to hospitalization and death.
Influenza vaccine, inactivated or recombinant does not contain the influenza virus. It works by triggering your immune system to build a defense to the influenza virus when it comes in contact with it.
There are many variants of the influenza virus and the vaccine will need to be reformulated periodically to cover the current circulating variants.
How is the vaccine given?
Influenza Vaccine, Inactivated or Recombinant comes as a suspension (liquid) to be given intramuscularly (into the muscle) by a healthcare provider.
Influenza Vaccine, Inactivated or Recombinant is given as a single dose each season. Some individuals may have a second dose recommended based on age and prior history of vaccine. If it is recommended that you receive 2 doses, they should be given at least 4 weeks apart.
What should you tell the person who is giving the vaccine?
Tell your vaccine provider if you:
have had an allergic reaction to this vaccine, any part of this vaccine, any other vaccine or any drug, food or substance. Tell your vaccine provider about the allergy and what symptoms you had.

have ever fainted in association with an injection.

However, flu has been associated with adverse outcomes during pregnancy including early labor and delivery. Talk to your doctor about the right time to receive influenza vaccine during pregnancy.
In some cases, your health care provider may decide to postpone vaccination to a future visit.
