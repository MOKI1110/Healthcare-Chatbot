Why is this medication prescribed?
Migalastat is used to treat Fabry disease (an inherited condition in which a type of fatty substance builds up in the body, resulting in nerve and organ damage). Migalastat is in a class of medications called alpha-galactosidase A (alpha-Gal A) pharmacological chaperones. It works by improving the function of a protein in the body to help break down fatty substances in the body.
