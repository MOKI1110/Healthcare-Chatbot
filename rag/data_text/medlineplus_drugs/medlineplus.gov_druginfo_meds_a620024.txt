IMPORTANT WARNING:
People who are treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (other than aspirin) such as meloxicam injection may have a higher risk of having a heart attack or a stroke than people who do not take these medications. These events may happen without warning and may cause death. This risk may be higher for people who take NSAIDs for a long time. Do not take an NSAID such as meloxicam if you have recently had a heart attack, unless directed to do so by your doctor. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has or has ever had heart disease, a heart attack, a stroke, if you smoke, and if you have or have ever had high cholesterol, high blood pressure, or diabetes. Get emergency medical help right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: chest pain, shortness of breath, weakness in one part or side of the body, or slurred speech.
If you will be undergoing a coronary artery bypass graft (CABG; a type of heart surgery), you should not receive meloxicam injection right before or right after the surgery.
NSAIDs such as meloxicam injection may cause ulcers, bleeding, or holes in the stomach or intestine. These problems may develop at any time during treatment, may happen without warning symptoms, and may cause death. The risk may be higher for people who take NSAIDs for a long time, are older in age, have poor health, smoke cigarettes, or drink alcohol while using meloxicam injection.  Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had ulcers or bleeding in your stomach or intestines, or other bleeding disorders. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: stomach pain, heartburn, vomit that is bloody or looks like coffee grounds, blood in the stool, or black and tarry stools.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while receiving meloxicam injection. Make sure you tell your doctor if you are taking medications that may increase your risk of bleeding. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
Your doctor will monitor your symptoms carefully and may order certain tests to check your body's response to meloxicam injection. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling so that your doctor can prescribe the right amount of medication to treat your condition with the lowest risk of serious side effects.
Talk to your doctor about the risk(s) of receiving meloxicam injection.
