Why is this medication prescribed?
Chlorthalidone, a  is used to treat high blood pressure and fluid retention.
Chlorthalidone is in a class of medications called diuretics ('water pills'). It causes the kidneys to get rid of unneeded water and salt from the body into the urine.
High blood pressure is a common condition, and when not treated it can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.
How should this medicine be used?
Chlorthalidone comes as a tablet to take by mouth.

Take chlorthalidone at around the same time every day, preferably in the morning.
Take chlorthalidone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Chlorthalidone controls high blood pressure but does not cure it. Continue to take chlorthalidone even if you feel well. Do not stop taking chlorthalidone without talking to your doctor.
