Why is this medication prescribed?
Donidalorsen injection is used to prevent attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE; genetic condition causing recurrent episodes of severe swelling). Donidalorsen is in a class of medications called prekallikrein-directed antisense oligonucleotides. It works by blocking the production of the protein that  causes the swelling in patients with HAE.
How should this medicine be used?
Donidalorsen injection comes as a solution in an autoinjector (a prefilled syringe designed to autoinject a single dose of medicine) to be given subcutaneously (under the skin) by yourself or a caregiver. Give every 4 to 8 weeks as prescribed by your doctor.
Use donidalorsen injection exactly as directed.   Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Your healthcare provider will show you or your caregiver how to use the autoinjector. You will also be given instructions for use that come with step by step directions on how to give your injection. Ask your healthcare provider if you aren't sure on how to use the autoinjector.
Before injecting donidalorsen, remove the autoinjector from the refrigerator and let it warm to room temperature for 30 minutes. Do not try to warm by running under warm water, using a microwave, boiling or any other method. Inspect the autoinjector carefully to make sure the solution is clear and colorless to yellow. Do not use if there is cloudiness, particulate matter, or discoloration. Donidalorsen injection can be given into the abdomen or upper thigh. The back of the upper arm can be used if a caregiver is giving the injection.
