IMPORTANT WARNING:
The combination of acetaminophen and codeine may be habit forming. Take acetaminophen and codeine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it, take it more often, stop taking it suddenly, or take it in a different way than directed by your doctor.  Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family drinks or has ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, uses or has ever used street drugs, or has overused prescription medications, or has had an overdose, or if you have or have ever had depression or another mental illness.
The combination of acetaminophen and codeine may cause serious or life-threatening breathing problems, especially during the first 24 to 72 hours of your treatment and any time your dose is increased.
If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: slowed breathing, long pauses between breaths, or shortness of breath.
Taking too much acetaminophen (as found in this combination preparation) can cause liver damage, sometimes serious enough to require liver transplantation or cause death.  Do not take more than 4,000 mg of acetaminophen per day.  If you need to take more than one product that contains acetaminophen, calculate the total amount of acetaminophen you are taking. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to help you.
Acetaminophen and codeine may harm or cause death to other people who take your medication, especially children. Store acetaminophen and codeine in a safe place so that no one else can take it accidentally or on purpose.
Taking certain medications, drinking alcohol, or using street drugs during your treatment with acetaminophen and codeine may increase the risk that you will experience breathing problems or other serious, life-threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma. Tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the dosages of your medications and will monitor you carefully.
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you take acetaminophen and codeine regularly during your pregnancy, your baby may experience life-threatening withdrawal symptoms after birth.
Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with acetaminophen and codeine and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (
https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm
) or the manufacturer's website to obtain the Medication Guide.
Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking acetaminophen and codeine.
Why is this medication prescribed?
The combination of acetaminophen and codeine is used to relieve pain. Acetaminophen is in a class of medications called analgesics (pain relievers) and antipyretics (fever reducers).
It works by changing the way the body senses pain and by cooling the body.
Codeine belongs to a class of medications called opiate (narcotic) analgesics.
When codeine is used to treat pain, it works by changing the way the brain and nervous system respond to pain.
How should this medicine be used?
The combination of acetaminophen and codeine comes as a tablet, capsule, and liquid to take by mouth.
Take every 4 hours as needed.
Your doctor may adjust your dose during your treatment, depending on how well your pain is controlled and on the side effects that you experience. Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment with acetaminophen and codeine. Tell your doctor if you feel that your pain is not controlled or if your pain increases, becomes worse, or if you have new pain or an increased sensitivity to pain during your treatment with acetaminophen and codeine. Do not take more of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about access to rescue medicines, naloxone or nalmefene,
while taking acetaminophen and codeine. Rescue medications can reverse the life-threatening effects of an
opioid overdose and are available over the counter or with a prescription. Make sure that you
and your family members and people usually around you know how to recognize an overdose,
how to use naloxone or nalmefene, and what to do until emergency medical help arrives. Your
doctor or pharmacist will show you and others how to use it. If symptoms of an overdose occur,
they should give the first dose of naloxone, call 911 immediately, and stay with you and watch
you closely until emergency medical help arrives. If your symptoms return, the person should
give you another dose of the rescue medication. Additional doses may be given every 2 to 3
minutes, if symptoms return before medical help arrives.
If you have taken acetaminophen and codeine for several weeks or longer, do not stop taking the medication without talking to your doctor. Your doctor may decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking acetaminophen and codeine, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as restlessness, widened pupils (black circles in the center of the eyes), teary eyes, irritability, anxiety, runny nose, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, yawning, sweating, fast breathing, fast heartbeat, chills, nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, or muscle aches.
If you are taking acetaminophen and codeine oral solution, do not use a household spoon to measure your dose. Use the measuring cup or spoon that came with the medication or use a spoon that is made especially for measuring medication. Ask your pharmacist if you have any question about how much medication you should take or how to use the dosing cup or syringe.
