IMPORTANT WARNING:
Midazolam injection may cause serious or life-threatening breathing problems.  Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking medications for pain or cough.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Midazolam injection is used before medical procedures and surgery and during surgery to cause drowsiness, relieve anxiety, and avoid any memory of the event.  Midazolam injection is also used in seriously ill people in intensive care units (ICU) who are breathing with the help of a machine. Midazolam injection is in a class of medications called benzodiazepines. It works by slowing activity in the brain to allow relaxation and decreased consciousness.
How should this medicine be used?
Midazolam injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be given intramuscularly (into the muscle) or intravenously (into the vein) by a doctor or nurse in a hospital or clinic. It is given as needed or as frequently as your doctor determines you need it.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before receiving midazolam injection,
tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to this drug, any part of this drug, or any other
drugs, foods or substances. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about the allergy and what
symptoms you had.
some medications should not be taken with midazolam injection. Other medications may cause dosing changes or extra monitoring when taken with midazolam injection. Make sure you have discussed any medications you are currently taking or plan to take before starting midazolam injection with your doctor and pharmacist. Before starting, stopping, or changing any medications while taking midazolam injection, please get the advice of your doctor or pharmacist.
the following nonprescription or herbal products may interact with midazolam injection: cimetidine. Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking this medication before you start receiving midazolam injection.
tell your doctor if you have glaucoma (increased pressure in the eyes that may cause gradual loss of vision). Your doctor may decide not to give you midazolam injection.
tell your doctor if you drink large amounts of alcohol or if you have or have ever had kidney or liver disease.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding.
you should know that midazolam may make you very drowsy and may affect your memory, thinking, and movements. Do not drive a car or do other activities that require you to be fully alert for the period of time described by your doctor. If your child received midazolam injection, watch him or her carefully to be sure that he or she does not fall while walking during this time.
talk to your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages after your treatment with midazolam. Alcohol can make the side effects from midazolam injection worse.
you should know that repeated or lengthy use (>3 hours) of general anesthetic or sedation drugs in infants and children <3 years of age or in women in the last few months of their pregnancy may affect the child's brain development. Other studies in infants and toddlers show that a single, short exposure to anesthetic and sedation drugs is unlikely to have negative effects on behavior or learning. However, further research is needed. Parents and caregivers of children <3 years of age and pregnant women should talk to their doctors about the risks of anesthesia on brain development.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
