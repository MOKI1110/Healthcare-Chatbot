Why is this medication prescribed?
Latanoprost ophthalmic is used to treat glaucoma (a condition in which increased pressure in the eye can lead to gradual loss of vision) and ocular hypertension (a condition which causes increased pressure in the eye).
Latanoprost is in a class of medications called prostaglandin analogs. It lowers pressure in the eye by increasing the flow of natural eye fluids out of the eye.
How should this medicine be used?
Latanoprost ophthalmic comes as a solution (liquid) to instill in the eye.
Instill  one drop  to the affected eye(s) once a day in the evening.
Use latanoprost eye drops exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Latanoprost eye drops should be given at least 5 minutes before or after any other eye drops.
Latanoprost eye drops come in single-use containers (small bottles to be used for one dose) and in a multi-dose bottle (a bottle that can be used more than once). If you are using the single-use container, use the liquid from the container immediately after opening, and throw away the container with any remaining liquid when you are finished. Do not save the liquid left in the container for your next dose.
Latanoprost controls glaucoma but does not cure it. Continue to use latanoprost eye drops even if you feel well. Do not stop using latanoprost eye drops without talking to your doctor.
To instill the eye drops, follow these steps:
Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.
When using the multi-dose bottle, remove the cap from the bottle..
When using the single-use container, pull off one container of medication from the strip of containers. Put the rest of the containers back into the foil pouch. Hold the container upright. Be sure that twist off tab is at the top of the container. Open the container by twisting off the tab at the top of the container.
Avoid touching the dropper tip against your eye or anything else; eye drops and droppers must be kept clean.
While tilting your head back, pull down the lower lid of your eye with your index finger to form a pocket.
Hold the dropper (tip down) with the other hand, as close to the eye as possible without touching it.
Brace the remaining fingers of that hand against your face.
While looking up, gently squeeze the dropper so that a single drop falls into the pocket made by the lower eyelid. Remove your  index finger from the lower eyelid.
Close your eye for 2 to 3 minutes and tip your head down as though looking at the floor. Try not to blink or squeeze your eyelids.
Replace the cap on the multi-use bottle. Discard the single-use container even if it is not empty.
Wipe off any excess liquid from your cheek with a clean tissue.
Wash your hands to remove any medication.
If you still have symptoms of glaucoma (eye pain or blurred vision) after using this medication for a couple of days, call your doctor.
