Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the manufacturer's patient information sheet (Medication Guide) when you begin treatment with betrixaban and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website (
https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm

Talk to your doctor about the risk of taking betrixaban.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Betrixaban is used to prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT; a blood clot, usually in the leg) and pulmonary embolism (PE; a blood clot in the lung) in people who are hospitalized for serious illnesses and are at risk of developing a clot due to decreased ability to move around or other risk factors. Betrixaban is in a class of medications called factor Xa inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of a certain natural substance that helps blood clots to form.
How should this medicine be used?
Betrixaban comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with food once a day for 35 to 42 days. Take betrixaban at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take betrixaban exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Continue to take betrixaban even if you feel well. Do not stop taking betrixaban without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking betrixaban, your risk of a blood clot may increase.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.

Â®
, in Rifamate
Â®
, Rifater
Â®
). Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects. Many other medications may also interact with betrixaban, so be sure to tell your doctor about all the medications you are taking, even those that do not appear on this list.

What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?

What side effects can this medication cause?
Betrixaban may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:
