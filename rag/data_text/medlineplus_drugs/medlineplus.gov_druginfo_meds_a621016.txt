Notice:
On September 22, 2025, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), issued a safety warning indicating that taking or using acetaminophen while pregnant may be associated with the development of neurological conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or Attention Hyperactivity Deficit Disorder (ADHD) in children. Although no evidence to date has been able to show that acetaminophen use in pregnancy causes these disorders, some studies have shown an association. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits or using acetaminophen during pregnancy.
IMPORTANT WARNING:
Taking or using too much acetaminophen can cause liver damage, sometimes serious enough to require liver transplantation or cause death. You might accidentally receive or use too much acetaminophen if you do not follow the directions on the prescription or package label carefully, or if you take or use more than one product that contains acetaminophen.
To be sure that you take or use acetaminophen safely, you should
not take or use more than one product that contains acetaminophen at a time. Read the labels of all the prescription and nonprescription medications you are taking or using to see if they contain acetaminophen. Be aware that abbreviations such as APAP, AC, Acetaminophen, Acetaminoph, Acetaminop, Acetamin, or Acetam may be written on the label in place of the word acetaminophen. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for help determining if the product you are taking or using contains acetaminophen.
take or use acetaminophen exactly as directed on the prescription or package label. Do not take or use more acetaminophen or take it or use it more often than directed, even if you still have fever or pain.
do not take or receive more than 4000 mg of acetaminophen per day from all sources. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you need help determining how much acetaminophen you can take.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease.
not take or use acetaminophen if you drink three or more alcoholic drinks every day. Talk to your doctor about the safe use of alcohol while you are taking acetaminophen.
stop taking or using your medication and call your doctor right away if you think you have taken or received too much acetaminophen, even if you feel well.
Talk to your pharmacist or doctor if you have questions about the safe use of acetaminophen or acetaminophen-containing products.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Acetaminophen rectal is used to relieve mild to moderate pain and to reduce a fever.
Acetaminophen is in a class of medications called analgesics (pain relievers) and antipyretics (fever reducers). It works by changing the way the body senses pain and by cooling the body.
How should this medicine be used?
Acetaminophen rectal comes as a suppository to use rectally. Acetaminophen rectal is available without a prescription, but your doctor may prescribe acetaminophen to treat certain conditions.
Follow the directions on the package or prescription label carefully. Do not use more than directed on the label.
If you are giving acetaminophen rectal to your child, read the package label carefully to make sure that it is the right product for the age of the child. Do not give children acetaminophen products that are made for adults.
Many acetaminophen products also come in combination with other medications such as those to treat cough and cold symptoms. Check product labels carefully before using two or more products at the same time. These products may contain the same active ingredient(s) and taking or using them together could cause you to receive an overdose.
Stop giving acetaminophen rectal to your child and call your child's doctor if your child develops new symptoms, including redness or swelling, or your child's pain lasts for longer than 5 days, or fever get worse or lasts longer than 3 days.
To insert an acetaminophen suppository into the rectum, follow these steps:
Wash your hands.
Remove the wrapper.
Lie down on your left side and raise your right knee to your chest. (A left-handed person should lie on the right side and raise the left knee.)
Using your finger, insert the suppository into the rectum, about 1/2 to 1 inch (1.25 to 2.5 centimeters) in infants and children and 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) in adults. Hold it in place for a few moments.
Remain lying down for 5 minutes to prevent the suppository from coming out.
Wash your hands thoroughly and resume your normal activities.
Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.
Other uses for this medicine

What special dietary instructions should I follow?

What should I do if I forget a dose?
