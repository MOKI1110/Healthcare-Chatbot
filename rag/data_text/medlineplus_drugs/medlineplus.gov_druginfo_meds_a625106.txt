Why is this medication prescribed?
Paltusotine is used to treat certain patients with acromegaly (rare condition that causes bones, organs and tissues to grow bigger). Paltusotine is in a class of medications called somatostatin receptor agonists. It works by stopping the production of growth hormone that causes the bones and tissues to grow bigger.
How should this medicine be used?
Paltusotine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. Take without food once a day, at least 6 hours after and 1 hour before a meal, and with water. Take paltusotine at around the same time every day.
Take paltusotine exactly as directed.   Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of paltusotine and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 2 to 4 weeks.
Paltusotine controls acromegaly but does not cure it. It may take a while before you feel the full benefit of paltusotine. Continue to take paltusotine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking paltusotine without talking to your doctor.
