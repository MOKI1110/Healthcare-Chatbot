Why is this medication prescribed?
Simethicone is used to treat the symptoms of gas such as uncomfortable or painful pressure, fullness, and bloating.
This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
How should this medicine be used?
Simethicone comes as regular tablets, chewable tablets, capsules, and liquid to take by mouth. It usually is taken four times a day, after meals and at bedtime. Follow the directions on the package or on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take simethicone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Swallow the regular tablets and capsules whole. Chewable tablets should be chewed thoroughly before being swallowed; do not swallow them whole. Do not take more than six simethicone tablets or eight simethicone capsules each day unless your doctor tells you to. The liquid may be mixed with 1 ounce (30 milliliters) of cool water or infant formula.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking simethicone,
tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are allergic to simethicone or any other drugs.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breast-feeding. If you become pregnant while taking simethicone, call your doctor.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
If you are taking simethicone on a regular schedule, take the missed dose as soon you remember it. However, if it is almost time for the next dose, skip the missed dose and continue your regular dosing schedule. Do not take a double dose to make up for a missed one.
What side effects can this medication cause?
When taken as directed, simethicone usually has no side effects.
What should I know about storage and disposal of this medication?
Keep this medication in the container it came in, tightly closed, and out of reach of children. Store it at room temperature and away from excess heat and moisture (not in the bathroom).
Keep all medication out of sight and reach of children as many containers are not child-resistant. Always lock safety caps. Place the medication in a safe location â one that is up and away and out of their sight and reach.

for more information.
What other information should I know?
Ask your doctor or pharmacist any questions you have about taking this medicine.
Keep a written list of all of the prescription and nonprescription (over-the-counter) medicines, vitamins, minerals, and dietary supplements you are taking. Bring this list with you each time you visit a doctor or if you are admitted to the hospital. You should carry the list with you in case of emergencies.
