IMPORTANT WARNING:
Temazepam may cause serious or life-threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma if used along with certain medications. Tell your doctor if you are taking or plan to take medications for cough or for pain. Call your doctor immediately or seek emergency medical care if you experience: unusual dizziness, lightheadedness, extreme sleepiness, slowed or difficult breathing, or unresponsiveness. Be sure that your caregiver or family members know which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor or emergency medical care if you are unable to do so.
Temazepam may be habit forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or for a longer time than your doctor tells you to. Tell your doctor if you have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, if you use or have ever used street drugs, or have overused prescription medications.  Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had depression or another mental illness.
Do not stop taking this medication or take fewer doses without talking to your doctor. Call your doctor or get emergency medical treatment if you experience any of the following symptoms: unusual movements; ringing in your ears; anxiety; memory problems; difficulty concentrating; sleep problems; seizures; shaking; muscle twitching; changes in mental health; depression; burning or prickling feeling in hands, arms, legs or feet; seeing or hearing things that others do not see or hear; thoughts of harming or killing yourself or others; overexcitement; or losing touch with reality.

Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking temazepam.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Temazepam is used to treat insomnia (difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep). Temazepam is in a class of medications called benzodiazepines. It works by slowing activity in the brain to allow sleep.
How should this medicine be used?
Temazepam comes as a capsule to take by mouth. Take as needed at bedtime.
Take temazepam exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Plan to go to bed right after you take temazepam and to stay in bed for 7 to 8 hours. Do not take temazepam if you will be unable to remain asleep for 7 to 8 hours after taking the medication. If you get up too soon after taking temazepam, you may experience memory problems.
Your sleep problems should improve within 7 to 10 days after you start taking temazepam. Call your doctor if your sleep problems do not improve during this time, if they get worse at any time during your treatment, or if you notice any changes in your thoughts or behavior.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking temazepam,
tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to this drug, any part of this drug, or any other
drugs, foods or substances. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about the allergy and what
symptoms you had.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while taking temazepam. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
the following nonprescription products may interact with temazepam: allergy medications (diphenhydramine, loratadine, fexofenadine, chlorpheniramine or cetirizine). Be sure to let your doctor and pharmacist know that you are taking these medications before you start taking temazepam. Do not start any of these medications while taking temazepam without discussing with your healthcare provider.
tell your doctor if you have ever thought about killing yourself or tried to do so, and if you have or have ever had any condition that affects your breathing, seizures, or kidney or liver disease.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding.  If you become pregnant while taking temazepam, call your doctor immediately. Temazepam may harm the fetus.
talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking temazepam if you are 65 years of age or older. Older adults should usually take lower doses of temazepam because higher doses may not be more effective and are more likely to cause serious side effects.
you should know that this medication may make you drowsy during the daytime, may decrease your mental alertness, and may increase the risk that you could fall. Take extra care to be sure you do not fall, especially if you get out of bed in the middle of the night. Do not drive a car or operate machinery until you know how this medication affects you.
talk to your doctor about the safe use of alcoholic beverages during your treatment with temazepam. Alcohol can make the side effects of temazepam worse.
you should know that some people who took medications for sleep got out of bed and drove their cars, prepared and ate food, had sex, made phone calls, or were involved in other activities while partially asleep. After they woke up, these people were usually unable to remember what they had done. Call your doctor right away if you find out that you have been driving or doing anything else while you were sleeping.
you should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways while you are taking this medication.  Tell your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: aggressiveness, strange or unusually outgoing behavior, hallucinations (seeing things or hearing voices that do not exist), feeling as if you are outside of your body, memory problems, difficulty concentrating, new or worsening depression, thinking about killing yourself, confusion, and any other changes in your usual thoughts, mood, or behavior. Be sure that your family knows which symptoms may be serious so that they can call the doctor if you are unable to do so.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
Temazepam should only be taken at bedtime. If you did not take temazepam at bedtime and you are unable to fall asleep, you may take temazepam if you will be able to remain in bed for 7 to 8 hours afterwards. Do not take temazepam if you are not ready to go to sleep right away and stay asleep for at least 7 to 8 hours.
What side effects can this medication cause?
Temazepam may cause side effects. Tell your doctor if any of these symptoms are severe or do not go away:

drowsiness
