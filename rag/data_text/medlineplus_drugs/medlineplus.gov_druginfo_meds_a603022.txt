Why is this medication prescribed?
Dihydroergotamine injection is used to treat migraine headaches (severe, throbbing headaches that sometimes are accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to sound and light) and cluster headaches (severe headaches usually on one side of the head or around one eye). Dihydroergotamine is in a class of medications called ergot alkaloids. It works by tightening blood vessels in the brain and by stopping the release of natural substances in the brain that cause swelling.
How should this medicine be used?
Dihydroergotamine injection comes as a solution (liquid) in a prefilled autoinjector or an ampule to inject subcutaneously (under the skin).
Dihydroergotamine injection also comes as a solution to inject intramuscularly (in a muscle) or intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a medical facility.
If you are injecting dihdyroergotamine subcutaneously, use at the first sign of a migraine headache. If your headache comes back after at least 1 hour, you may inject up to 2 more doses given at least 1 hour apart. Do not use more than three doses in a 24-hour period or 6 doses in a 7-day period. Your doctor will tell you the maximum number of headaches you should treat with dihdyroergotamine injection in a 30-day period.
Use dihydroergotamine injection exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
If you use dihdyroergotamine injection more often or for longer than the recommended period of time, your headaches may get worse or may occur more often. Call your doctor if your headaches do not get better or occur more frequently after using dihdyroergotamine injection.
You may receive your first dose of dihydroergotamine injection in your doctor's office so that your doctor can monitor your reaction to the medication.
After that, you may inject dihydroergotamine at home.   Read the written instructions for use that comes with the medication. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions about how to inject the medication.
Use each injection only once and inject all the solution in the syringe or autoinjector.
