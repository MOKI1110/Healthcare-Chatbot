Notice:
On September 22, 2025, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), issued a safety warning indicating that taking or receiving acetaminophen while pregnant may be associated with the development of neurological conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) or Attention Hyperactivity Deficit Disorder (ADHD) in children. Although no evidence to date has been able to show that acetaminophen in pregnancy causes these disorders, some studies have shown an association. Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits or using acetaminophen during pregnancy.
IMPORTANT WARNING:
Receiving too much acetaminophen can cause liver damage, sometimes serious enough to require liver transplantation or cause death. You might accidentally receive too much acetaminophen if you take acetaminophen by mouth or more than one product that contains acetaminophen while receiving acetaminophen intravenously (into the vein).
Why is this medication prescribed?
Acetaminophen injection is used to relieve mild to moderate pain and to reduce fever. Acetaminophen injection is also used in combination with opioid (narcotic) medications to relieve moderate to severe pain. Acetaminophen is in a class of medications called analgesics (pain relievers) and antipyretics (fever reducers). It works by changing the way the body senses pain and by cooling the body.
How should this medicine be used?
Acetaminophen injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected into a vein over 15 minutes. It is usually given every 4 to 6 hours as needed to relieve pain or reduce fever.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
