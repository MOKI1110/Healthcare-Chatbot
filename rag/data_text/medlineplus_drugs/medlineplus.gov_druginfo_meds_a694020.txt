IMPORTANT WARNING:
Medications such as venlafaxine may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and actions. This increase was found in children, teenagers, and young adults (less than 24 years of age). The risk may be more likely with the first few months of treatment and when the dose is increased.
Call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: new or worsening depression; thinking about harming or killing yourself, or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; panic attacks; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; aggressive behavior; irritability; acting without thinking; severe restlessness; and frenzied abnormal excitement. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to do so.
The doctor or pharmacist will give you the Medication Guide. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You also can obtain the Medication Guide from
https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm
.
Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking venlafaxine.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Venlafaxine is used to treat depression, generalized anxiety disorder (GAD; excessive worrying that is difficult to control), social anxiety disorder (extreme fear of interacting with others or performing in front of others that interferes with normal life), and panic disorder (sudden, unexpected attacks of extreme fear and worry about these attacks). Venlafaxine is in a class of medications called selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs).
It works by increasing the amounts of serotonin and norepinephrine, natural substances in the brain that help maintain mental balance.
How should this medicine be used?
Venlafaxine comes as a tablet or extended-release capsule to take by mouth.
Take the tablet two or three times a day with food. Take the extended-release capsule once daily in the morning or evening with food. Take venlafaxine at around the same time(s) every day.
Take venlafaxine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often or for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor.
Swallow the extended-release capsule whole; do not split, chew, or crush it, or place it in water. If you cannot swallow the extended-release capsule, you may carefully open the capsule and sprinkle the entire contents on a spoonful of applesauce. Swallow (without chewing) this mixture immediately after preparation. Then drink a glass of water to make sure that you have swallowed all of the medication.
Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of venlafaxine and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every 4 to 7 days.
It may take several weeks or longer for you to feel the full benefit of this medication. Do not stop taking venlafaxine without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking venlafaxine, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as agitation;
anxiety;
tiredness; confusion;
mood changes;
headache;
dizziness;
irritability;
frenzied or abnormal excitement;
lack of coordination;
trouble falling asleep or staying asleep;
nightmares;
nausea;
vomiting;
loss of appetite;
diarrhea;
dry mouth;
sweating;
uncontrollable shaking of a part of the body;
ringing in the ears;
blurred vision;
seizures;
or burning, tingling, numbness, or electric shock-like feelings in any part of the body.
Tell your doctor if you experience any of these symptoms.
Other uses for this medicine
Venlafaxine is also sometimes used to treat hot flashes (hot flushes; sudden strong feelings of heat and sweating) in women who have experienced menopause ('change of life'; the end of monthly menstrual periods) or who are taking medication to treat breast cancer.
