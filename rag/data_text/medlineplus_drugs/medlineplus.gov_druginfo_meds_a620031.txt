Why is this medication prescribed?
Rimegepant is used to prevent and treat migraine headaches  (severe, throbbing headaches that sometimes are accompanied by nausea and sensitivity to sound or light). Rimegepant is in a class of medications called calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonists. It works by blocking the action of a certain natural substance in the body that causes migraine headaches.
How should this medicine be used?
Rimegepant comes as an orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) to place on or underneath the tongue and allow to dissolve. If used to prevent a migraine, take every other day. If used to treat a migraine, take as a single dose at the first sign of a migraine headache. Do not take more than one dose in a 24-hour period to treat a migraine. Your doctor will tell you the maximum number of migraine headaches you should treat with rimegepant tablets in a 30-day period.
Take rimegepant exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Do not push the orally disintegrating tablet through the foil packaging. Instead, use dry hands to peel back the foil. Immediately take out the tablet and place it on or under your tongue. The tablet will quickly dissolve and can be swallowed with saliva. No water is needed to swallow disintegrating tablets.
Call your doctor if your headaches do not get better or occur more often after taking rimegepant.
Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.
