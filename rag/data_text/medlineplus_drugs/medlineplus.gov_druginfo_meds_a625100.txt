Why is this medication prescribed?
Gemcitabine intravesical system is used to treat a certain type of bladder cancer. Gemcitabine is in a class of medications called antimetabolites. It works by slowing or stopping the growth of cancer cells.
How should this medicine be used?
Gemcitabine intravesical system comes as a flexible tube to be inserted inside of the bladder by a health-care provider. Gemcitabine intravesical system is left in place in the bladder for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks, the system is removed from your bladder by a health-care provider. Gemcitabine intravesical system is inserted into the bladder every 3 weeks for up to 6 months (8 doses) and then every 12 weeks for up to 6 more doses thereafter. The length of treatment depends on how well your body responds to the medication and any side effects you have.
Do not empty your bladder before the procedure to insert gemcitabine intravesical system. After the system is inserted into your bladder, you can urinate normally. Do not hold your urine.
Drink 6 to 7 cups of fluids every day during your treatment to produce enough urine for the medicine to be released from the system into your bladder.
Avoid contact of your urine with skin while the system is in place in your bladder and for at least 24 hours after it is removed. Sit down on a toilet to urinate. Flush the toilet after each use. Wash your hands with soap and water and wash your genital area with water  each time you urinate. Wash clothing soiled with urine separately from other clothing.
