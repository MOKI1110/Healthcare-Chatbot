Why is this medication prescribed?
Brivaracetam is used  to  treat partial onset seizures (seizures that involve only one part of the brain). Brivaracetam is in a class of medications called anticonvulsants. It works by decreasing abnormal electrical activity in the brain.
How should this medicine be used?
Brivaracetam comes as a tablet and solution (liquid) to take by mouth. Take with or without food twice daily. Take brivaracetam at around the same times every day.
Take brivaracetam exactly as directed.   Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Swallow the tablets whole with liquid; do not split, chew, or crush them.
If you are taking the liquid, do not use a household spoon to measure your dose. Use the measuring spoon or cup that came with the medication or use a spoon made for measuring medication.
Your doctor may increase or decrease your dose depending on how well the medication works for you, and the side effects you experience.  Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment with brivaracetam.
Brivaracetam may be habit forming. Do not take a larger dose, take it more often, or take it for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor.
Brivaracetam may help control your condition but will not cure it. Continue to take brivaracetam even if you feel well. Do not stop taking brivaracetam without talking to your doctor, even if you experience side effects such as unusual changes in behavior or mood. If you suddenly stop taking brivaracetam, your seizures may become worse. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually.
You will be given the Medication Guide when you begin treatment with brivaracetam and each time you refill your prescription. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit
https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm
to obtain the Medication Guide.

What special precautions should I follow?
Before taking brivaracetam,
tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to this drug, any part of this drug, or any other drugs, foods or substances. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about the allergy and what symptoms you had.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor if you currently drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, used street drugs, or over-used prescription medications. Also tell your doctor if you have or have ever had depression, mood problems, suicidal thoughts or behavior, kidney disease that was treated with dialysis (treatment to clean the blood outside the body when the kidneys are not working well), or liver disease.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding. If you become pregnant while taking brivaracetam, call your doctor.

Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
