IMPORTANT WARNING:
If you have atrial fibrillation (a condition where the heart beats irregularly and can lead to blood clots and stroke) and are taking rivaroxaban to help prevent strokes or serious blood clots, you are at a higher risk of having a stroke after you stop taking this medication. Do not stop taking rivaroxaban without talking to your doctor. Continue to take rivaroxaban even if you feel well. Be sure to refill your prescription before you run out of medication so that you will not miss any doses of rivaroxaban. If you need to stop taking rivaroxaban, your doctor may prescribe another anticoagulant (''blood thinner'') to help prevent blood clots and lower your risk of stroke.
If you have epidural or spinal anesthesia or a shot in your spine while taking a 'blood thinner' such as rivaroxaban, you could get a blood clot near your spine that can cause paralysis. Tell your doctor if you have a tube in your spine or if you have had spine problems, back surgery, or have had more than one spinal shot. Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking medications that may cause bleeding including anticoagulants (blood thinners) such as warfarin, heparin, or other medications to treat or prevent blood clots or aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, indomethacin, ketoprofen, naproxen; or clopidogrel. Call your doctor immediately if you experience back pain, muscle weakness (especially in your legs and feet), numbness or tingling (especially in your legs), trouble controlling your bowels or bladder, or not being able to move your legs.
Talk to your doctor about the risk of taking rivaroxaban.
Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the Medication Guide. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit
https://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/DrugSafety/UCM280333.pdf
to obtain the Medication Guide.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Rivaroxaban is used to:
prevent and treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT; a blood clot) and pulmonary embolism (PE; a blood clot in the lung).
lower the risk of a heart attack, stroke, or death in people with coronary artery disease (narrowing of the blood vessels that bring blood to the heart) or peripheral arterial disease (poor blood flow to the arms and legs).
Rivaroxaban is in a class of medications called factor Xa inhibitors. It works by blocking a natural substance that helps blood clots to form.
How should this medicine be used?
Rivaroxaban comes as a tablet and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is taken 1 to 2 times daily with or without food as prescribed by your doctor. Take at the same time(s) each day. Follow the instructions on your prescription label carefully and take exactly as directed. Do not take more or less than prescribed.
If you are unable to swallow the tablets, you can crush them and mix with applesauce. Swallow the mixture right after you prepare it. Rivaroxaban can also be given in certain types of feeding tubes. Ask your doctor if you should take this medication in your feeding tube. Follow your doctor's directions carefully.
If a child is unable to swallow rivaroxaban tablets, talk to their doctor about rivaroxaban suspension. Rivaroxaban tablets should not be crushed, split or chewed.
If you vomit or spits up within 30 minutes of taking a dose of rivaroxaban oral suspension, take another full dose as soon as possible after the vomiting episode and then take your next dose at the regularly scheduled time.
To measure rivaroxaban oral suspension, follow these steps:
Use the oral syringe that came with the medication for measuring the liquid. Do not use a household spoon to measure your dose. Household teaspoons are not accurate measuring devices.
Shake the bottle gently for 10 seconds before use. If there are remaining granules at the bottom of the bottle, shake gently again for another 10 seconds. Do not shake the bottle too fast to avoid foaming.
Remove the bottle cap by pushing down on the cap, then turn it counterclockwise (to the left). Do not remove the adaptor from the top of the bottle.
Push all the air from the oral syringe into the bottle by pushing down on the plunger. Then insert the open tip of the oral syringe into the adaptor.
While holding the oral syringe in place, carefully turn the bottle upside down. Draw some of the medication out of the bottle into the oral syringe by pulling back on the plunger. Be careful not to pull the plunger all the way out.
You will see a small amount of air near the end of the plunger in the oral syringe. Push on the plunger so the medication goes back into the bottle and the air disappears. Pull back on the plunger to draw your correct medication dose into the oral syringe.
While still holding the oral syringe in the bottle, carefully turn the bottle upwards so the syringe is on top. Remove the oral syringe from the bottle neck adaptor without pushing on the plunger. Take the medication right after you draw it into the oral syringe.
Place the open tip of the oral syringe into one side of your child's mouth and push on the plunger slowly as the liquid goes into your child's mouth; have your child swallow the medication slowly as it goes into their mouth.
If your dose is more than 5 mL, you will need to use the same syringe more than one time and you will need to repeat steps 3 through 7.
Leave the adaptor in the bottle. Place the cap back on the bottle and turn it clockwise (to the right) to tighten it.
Rinse the oral syringe with clean tap water and allow it to air dry after each use.
Continue to take rivaroxaban even if you feel well. Do not stop taking rivaroxaban without talking to your doctor. If you stop taking rivaroxaban, your risk of a blood clot may increase.
