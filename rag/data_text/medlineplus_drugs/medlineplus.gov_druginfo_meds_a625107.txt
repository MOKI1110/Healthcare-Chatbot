Why is this medication prescribed?
Nerandomilast is used to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF; scarring of the lungs with an unknown cause). Nerandomilast  is in a class of medications called phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitors. It works by  blocking the action of a certain natural substance in the body that is involved in causing fibrosis.
How should this medicine be used?
Nerandomilast  comes as a tablet to take by mouth. Take with or without food two times a day, about 12 hours apart. Take nerandomilast at around the same times every day.
Take nerandomilast exactly as directed.   Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Swallow the tablets whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.
If you cannot swallow the tablets whole, place the tablets in a glass of 3 to 4 ounces (100 mL) of non-carbonated, room temperature water. Do not use any other liquids other than water. Stir until the tablets are in small pieces (about 15 to 20 minutes). Do not crush the tablets; they will not completely dissolve. Drink the mixture right away or within 2 hours of preparing. If you do not take the mixture immediately, stir again before drinking. Do not chew pieces of the tablet. Rinse the glass with an additional 3 to 4 ounces (100 mL) of water and drink to make sure that you have taken the full dose.
Ask your pharmacist or doctor for a copy of the manufacturer's information for the patient.
