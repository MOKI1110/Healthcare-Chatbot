Why get vaccinated?
RSV Vaccine, mRNA is used to prevent lower respiratory tract disease (LRTD) that may occur with infection due to Respiratory Synctial Virus (RSV).
RSV is a common virus that causes mild, cold-like symptoms such as runny nose, decrease in appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever, and wheezing. However, LRTD can be more serious in infants and older adults. Those older adults at higher risk of severe disease from RSV disease include those:
with chronic heart or lung diseases
with weakened immune systems
nursing home or long-term care facility residents
LRTD may cause shortness of breath and low oxygen levels or may also worsen chronic heart or lung disease, leading to a hospital stay and even potentially death.
RSV Vaccine does not contain the RSV virus. The vaccine works by getting the body's cells to produce a piece of the virus that will stimulate antibodies prepared to fight the virus if exposed so severe illness is less likely to occur.
How is the vaccine given?
RSV Vaccine, mRNA comes as a suspension (liquid) to be given intramuscularly by a healthcare provider.
RSV Vaccine, mRNA is given as single dose recommended for the following individuals:
all people 60 years of age or older
all people between the ages of 18 and 59 years of age with high risk of LRTD
What should you tell the person who is giving the vaccine?
Tell your vaccine provider if you:
have had an allergic reaction to this vaccine, any part of this vaccine, any other vaccine or any drug, food or substance. Tell your vaccine provider about the allergy and what symptoms you had.
have a weakened immune system due to a condition or medication.
have fainted following an injection
have a fever or are feeling unwell
are pregnant or breastfeeding.
In some cases, your health care provider may decide to postpone vaccination to a future visit.
What are the risks from vaccination?
Side effects that have been reported with the RSV Vaccine include:
pain, bruising, redness or swelling at the site of injection
underarm swelling or tenderness
fever, chills, headache, muscle or joint pain
tiredness
Some side effects can be serious. If you experience any of these symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment:
rash, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, swelling of face or throat
People sometimes faint after medical procedures, including vaccination. Tell your provider if you feel dizzy or have vision changes or ringing in the ears.
Adverse reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your health care provider will usually file this report, or you can do it yourself. Visit

VAERS is only for reporting reactions, and VAERS staff members do not give medical advice.
