Biological weapons
Skip to main content
Overview
Biological and toxin weapons are either microorganisms like virus,
bacteria or fungi, or toxic substances produced by living organisms that
are produced and released deliberately to cause disease and death in
humans, animals or plants.
Biological agents like anthrax,
botulinum toxin and plague can pose a difficult public health challenge
causing large numbers of deaths in a short amount of time. Biological
agents which are capable of secondary transmission can lead to
epidemics. An attack involving a biological agent may mimic a natural
event, which may complicate the public health assessment and response.
In case of war and conflict, high-threat pathogens laboratories can be
targeted, which might lead to serious public health consequences.
Biological
weapons form a subset of a larger class of weapons sometimes referred
to as unconventional weapons or weapons of mass destruction, which also
includes chemical, nuclear and radiological weapons. The use of
biological agents is a serious concern, and the risk of using these
agents in a terrorist attack is thought to be increasing.
Preparedness
WHO focuses on the possible public health consequences of an incident
due to a biological agent, regardless of whether it is characterized as
a deliberate act or a naturally occurring event.
When a Member
State is concerned about biological agents and wants to be better
prepared, WHO advises strengthening public health surveillance and
response activities, with an emphasis on:
more effective
national surveillance of outbreaks of illness, including alert and
response systems at all levels that can detect diseases that may be
deliberately caused;
improved biosafety and biosecurity throughout the health sector;
better
communication between multiple sectors, including public health, animal
health, water supply, food safety, poison control, civil protection,
law enforcement, and security services;
improved assessments of
vulnerability, and effective communication about risks and threats to
both professionals and the public;
preparation for handling the psychosocial consequences of the deliberate use of pathogens to cause harm; and
contingency plans for an enhanced response capacity by all sectors.
WHO’s
global alert and response activities and the Global Outbreak Alert and
Response Network (GOARN) represent a major pillar of global health security
aimed at the detection, verification and containment of epidemics. In
the event of the intentional release of a biological agent, these
activities would be vital to effective international containment
efforts.
Response
With the occurrence of a potential, suspected or confirmed deliberate
biological event, WHO would, upon the invitation of the affected Member
State(s), work closely with the Member State government(s), other UN
agencies, and other international partners as appropriate, support the
event response, and assess and mitigate the public health
consequences. These activities could include:
working with relevant international or national organizations to better characterize the nature, scope and impact of the event;
facilitating
the public health investigation of the event, including referral to
appropriate laboratories for confirmation and characterization of the
pathogen;
offering targeted training to public health responders;
facilitating
the identification and acquisition of necessary materials (such as
personal protective equipment) appropriate to the event;
supporting the continued delivery of essential health services; and
developing guidance material specific to the pathogen or toxin in question.
