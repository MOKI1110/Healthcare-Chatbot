Drowning
Skip to main content
Overview
Drowning is the process of experiencing respiratory impairment from immersion in liquid. Outcomes are classified as death, morbidity and no morbidity.
Drowning is a leading killer. The Global status report on drowning prevention shows that over 300 000 people lost their lives to drowning in 2021, Drowning disproportionately impacts children and young people. Children aged under 5 years account for nearly a quarter of all drowning deaths, and more than half of deaths occur among people aged under 30 years.
Over 90% of drowning deaths occur in low- and middle-income countries. Drowning prevention interventions range from community-based solutions, such as day care for children and barriers controlling access to water, to effective national policies and legislation around water safety, including setting and enforcing boating, shipping and ferry regulations.
While significant progress has been made in reducing drowning deaths, much more needs to be done. Everyone should have safe access to water and be able to enjoy water safely.
Prevention
There are many actions to prevent drowning. Installing barriers (e.g. covering wells, using doorway barriers and playpens, fencing swimming pools etc.) to control access to water hazards, or removing water hazards entirely greatly reduces water hazard exposure and risk.
Community-based, supervised child care for pre-school children can reduce drowning risk and has other proven health benefits. Teaching school-age children basic swimming, water safety and safe rescue skills is another approach. But these efforts must be undertaken with an emphasis on safety, and an overall risk management that includes a safety-tested curricula, a safe training area, screening and student selection, and student-instructor ratios established for safety.
Effective policies and legislation are also important for drowning prevention. Setting and enforcing safe boating, shipping and ferry regulations is an important part of improving safety on the water and preventing drowning. Building resilience to flooding and managing flood risks through better disaster preparedness planning, land use planning, and early warning systems can prevent drowning during flood disasters.
Developing a national water safety strategy can raise awareness of safety around water, build consensus around solutions, provide strategic direction and a framework to guide multisectoral action and allow for monitoring and evaluation of efforts.
WHO response
WHO produces a range of technical
resources to guide and inform drowning prevention efforts around the world.
These include the
Global status report on
drowning prevention
, which
details the scale of global drowning
fatalities and progress made in advancing strategies and actions to reduce
drowning,
Practical
guidelines on the provision of day-care, basic swimming and water safety
skills, and safe rescue and resuscitation training
, and the
first
investment case on drowning prevention
, which highlights the financial
return of two crucial measures: teaching school-aged children swimming and
water safety skills and providing safe spaces with adult supervision for
pre-school children.
At the regional level, WHO
organizes training programmes and convenes workshops to bring together
representatives of governments, NGOs and UN agencies working on drowning
prevention. At the country level, WHO works with Ministries of Health to
prevent drowning through the use of barriers controlling access to water and
the establishment of day care centres for pre-school children. In addition, WHO
has funded research in low-income countries exploring priority questions
related to drowning prevention.

World Drowning Prevention Day
World Drowning Prevention Day, declared through the April 2021 UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/75/273 “Global drowning prevention”, is held annually on 25 July. This global advocacy event serves as an opportunity to highlight the tragic and profound impact of drowning on families and communities and offer life-saving solutions to prevent it. An estimated 236,000 people drown every year, and drowning is among the ten leading causes of death for children aged 5-14 years. More than 90% of drowning deaths occur in rivers, lakes, wells, domestic water storage vessels and swimming pools in low- and middle-income countries, with children and adolescents in rural areas disproportionately affected.
