Magnesium deficiency

Magnesium deficiency is a condition in which the amount of magnesium in the blood is lower than normal. The medical name of this condition is hypomagnesemia.
Causes
Every organ in the body, especially the heart, muscles, and kidneys, needs the mineral magnesium. It also contributes to the makeup of teeth and bones. Magnesium is needed for many functions in the body. This includes the physical and chemical processes in the body that convert or use energy (
metabolism
).
When the level of magnesium in the body drops below normal, symptoms may develop due to low magnesium.
Common causes of low magnesium include:
Alcohol use
Burns that affect a large area of the body
Chronic
diarrhea
Excessive urination (polyuria), such as in uncontrolled
diabetes
and during recovery from
acute kidney injury
Hyperaldosteronism
(disorder in which the adrenal gland releases too much of the hormone aldosterone into the blood)
Kidney tubule disorders
Malabsorption
syndromes, such as
celiac disease
and inflammatory bowel disease
Malnutrition
Medicines including amphotericin, antibodies targeting the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor, cisplatin, cyclosporine, diuretics, proton pump inhibitors, tacrolimus, and aminoglycoside antibiotics
Pancreatitis (swelling and inflammation of the pancreas)
Excessive sweating
Symptoms
Common symptoms include:
Abnormal eye movements (
nystagmus
)
Convulsions
Fatigue
Muscle spasms or cramps
Muscle weakness
Numbness
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will do a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.
Tests that may be ordered include an
electrocardiogram
(ECG).
A
blood test
will be ordered to check your magnesium level. Normal range is 1.3 to 2.1 mEq/L (0.65 to 1.05 mmol/L).
Other blood and urine tests that may be done include:
Calcium blood test
Comprehensive metabolic panel
Potassium blood test
Urine magnesium test
Treatment
Treatment depends on the severity of the low magnesium problem and may include:
Fluids given through a vein (IV)
Magnesium by mouth or through a vein
Medicines to relieve symptoms
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome depends on the condition that is causing the problem.
Possible Complications
Untreated, this condition can lead to:
Cardiac arrest
Respiratory arrest
Death
When to Contact a Medical Professional
When your body's magnesium level drops too much, it can be a life-threatening emergency. Call your provider right away if you have symptoms of this condition.
Prevention
Treating the condition that is causing low magnesium can help.
If you play sports or do other vigorous activity, drink fluids such as sports drinks. They contain
electrolytes
to keep your magnesium level in a healthy range.
