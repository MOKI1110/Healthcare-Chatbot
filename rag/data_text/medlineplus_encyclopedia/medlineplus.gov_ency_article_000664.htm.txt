Cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia is a viral infection of the lungs that can occur in people who have a suppressed immune system.
Causes
CMV is a member of a group of herpes-type viruses. Infection with CMV is very common. Most people are exposed to CMV in their lifetime, but typically only those with weakened immune systems become ill from CMV infection.
Serious CMV infections can occur in people with weakened immune systems as a result of:
HIV/AIDS
Bone marrow transplantation
Chemotherapy
or other treatments that suppress the immune system
Organ transplant (especially
lung transplant
)
In people who have had organ and bone marrow transplants, the risk for infection is greatest 5 to 13 weeks after the transplant.
Symptoms
In otherwise healthy people, CMV usually produces no symptoms, or it produces a temporary mononucleosis-type illness. However, those with a weakened immune system can develop serious symptoms. Symptoms may include:
Cough
Fatigue
Fever
General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (
malaise
)
Loss of appetite
Muscle aches
or
joint pains
Shortness of breath
Sweating, excessive (night sweats)
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. In addition, the following tests may be done:
Venous and/orÂ
arterial blood gas
Oximetry
Blood culture
Blood tests to detect and measure substances specific to CMV infection
Bronchoscopy
(may include
biopsy
)
Chest x-ray
CT scan of chest
Urine culture (clean catch)
Sputum Gram stain
and
culture
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to use antiviral medicines to stop the virus from copying itself in the body. Some people with CMV pneumonia need IV (
intravenous
) medicines. Some people may need oxygen therapy and breathing support with a ventilator to maintain oxygen until the infection is brought under control.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Antiviral medicines stop the virus from copying itself, but do not destroy it. The CMV suppresses the immune system, and may increase your risk for other infections.
Low oxygen level in the blood of people with CMV pneumonia often predicts death, especially in those who need to be placed on a breathing machine.
Possible Complications
Complications of CMV infection in people with HIV/AIDS include spread of disease to other parts of the body, such as the esophagus, intestine, or
eye
.
Complications of CMV pneumonia include:
Kidney function impairment (from medicines used to treat the condition)
Low
white blood cell count
(from medicines used to treat the condition)
Overwhelming infection that doesn't respond to treatment
Resistance of CMV to standard treatment
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of CMV pneumonia.
Prevention
The following have been shown to help prevent CMV pneumonia in certain people:
Using organ transplant donors who don't have CMV
Using CMV-negative blood products for transfusion
Using CMV-immune globulin in certain people
Preventing HIV/AIDS avoids certain other diseases, including CMV, that can occur in people who have a weakened immune system.
