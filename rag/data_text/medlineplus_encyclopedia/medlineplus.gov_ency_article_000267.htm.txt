Achalasia
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
The tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach is the esophagus or food pipe. Achalasia makes it harder for the esophagus to move food into the stomach.
Causes
There is a muscular ring at the point where the esophagus and stomach meet. It is called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Normally, this muscle relaxes when you swallow to allow food to pass into the stomach. In people with achalasia, it does not relax as it should. In addition, the normal muscle activity of the esophagus (peristalsis) is reduced or absent.
This problem is caused by damage to the nerves of the esophagus.
Other problems can cause similar symptoms, such as cancer of the esophagus or upper stomach, and a parasite infection that causes
Chagas disease
, which is more common in Mexico and Central and South America.
Achalasia is rare. It may occur at any age, but is most common in people ages 25 to 60. In some people, the problem may be inherited.
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Backflow (regurgitation) of food
Chest pain
, which may increase after eating, or may be felt as pain in the back, neck, and arms
Cough
Difficulty swallowing liquids and solids
Heartburn
Unintentional weight loss
Exams and Tests
Physical exam may show signs of
anemia
or
malnutrition
.
Tests include:
Esophageal manometry
, a test to measure if your esophagus is working properly.
Functional luminal imaging probe (FLIP). Creates a high resolution 3D image of your esophagus and its movements.
EGD
or upper endoscopy, a test to examine the lining of the stomach and esophagus. It uses a flexible tube and camera.
Upper GI x-ray
.
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to reduce the pressure at the sphincter muscle and allow food and liquids to pass easily into the stomach. Therapy may involve:
Injection with botulinum toxin (Botox) -- This may help relax the sphincter muscles. However, the benefit wears off within a few weeks or months.
Medicines, such as long-acting nitrates or calcium channel blockers -- These medicines can be used to relax the lower esophagus sphincter. But there is rarely a long-term solution with medicines to treat achalasia.
Surgery (called a myotomy) -- In this procedure, the lower sphincter muscle is cut. This procedure is usually performed using a laparoscope. It can now sometimes be performed during EGD instead of traditional surgery.
Widening (dilation) of the esophagus -- This is done during EGD by stretching the LES with a balloon dilator.
Your health care provider can help you decide which treatment is best for you.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcomes of surgery and non-surgical treatments are similar. However, depending on the type of achalasia you have, your provider may recommend a particular procedure. More than one treatment is sometimes necessary.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Backflow (regurgitation) of acid or food from the stomach into the esophagus (reflux)
Breathing food contents into the lungs (aspiration), which can cause pneumonia
Tearing (perforation) of the esophagus
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
You have trouble swallowing or painful swallowing
Your symptoms continue, even with treatment for achalasia
Prevention
Many of the causes of achalasia cannot be prevented. However, treatment may help to prevent complications.
