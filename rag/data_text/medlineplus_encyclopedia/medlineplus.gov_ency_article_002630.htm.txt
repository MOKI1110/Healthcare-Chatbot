If the medicine was prescribed for the person

This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the container to the hospital with you, if possible.
The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.
Tests that may be done include:
Blood and urine tests
Chest x-ray
Electrocardiogram
(ECG)
Endoscopy
-- camera placed down the throat to check for burns in the esophagus and stomach
Treatment may include:
Fluids through a vein (by IV)
Medicine to treat stomach pain, inflammation and bleeding, or breathing problems
Activated charcoal
Laxative
Tube through the mouth into the stomach if vomiting contains blood
Breathing support, including a tube through the mouth and connected to a
breathing machine
(ventilator)
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well someone does depends on how much diclofenac sodium was swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster the medical help is received, the better the chance for recovery.
A mild overdose of this medicine does not usually cause serious problems. There may be some stomach pain and vomiting (possibly with blood).
However, a large amount of internal bleeding is possible, and a blood transfusion may be needed. Endoscopy may be needed to stop the internal bleeding.
In rare cases, there can be ringing in the ears and a bad headache. But these symptoms will likely pass as well.
If kidney damage is severe, dialysis (kidney machine) may be needed until kidney function returns. In some cases, the damage is permanent.
A large overdose can be very harmful to children and adults. Death may occur.
