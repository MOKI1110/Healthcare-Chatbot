Prolactin is a hormone released by the pituitary gland. The prolactin blood test measures the amount of prolactin in the blood.
How the Test is Performed
A fastingÂ
blood sample is needed
.
How to Prepare for the Test
No special preparation is necessary.
How the Test will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.
Why the Test is Performed
Prolactin is a hormone released by the pituitary gland. The pituitary is a small gland at the base of the brain. It regulates the body's balance of many hormones.
Prolactin stimulates breast development and milk production in women. There is no known normal function for prolactin in men.
Prolactin is usually measured when checking for pituitary tumors and the cause of:
Breast milk production that is not related to childbirth (
galactorrhea
)
Decreased sex drive (libido) in men and women
Erection problems in men
Not able to get pregnant (
infertility
Â in women)
Irregular or no menstrual periods (
amenorrhea
)
Normal Results
The normal values for prolactin are:
Men: less than 20 ng/mL (20 Âµg/L)
Nonpregnant women: less than 25 ng/mL (25 Âµg/L)
Pregnant women: less than 500 ng/mL (500 Âµg/L)
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
People with the following conditions may have high prolactin levels:
Chest wall injury or irritation
Presence of nipple rings
Disease of an area of the brain called the
hypothalamus
Thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone (
hypothyroidism
)
Kidney disease
Pituitary tumor that makes prolactin (
prolactinoma
)
Other pituitary tumors and diseases in the area of the pituitary
Abnormal clearance of prolactin molecules (macroprolactin)
Certain medicines can also raise prolactin level, including:
Antidepressants
Butyrophenones
Estrogens
H2 blockers
Metoclopramide
Opioid medicines
Phenothiazines
Risperidone
Verapamil
Marijuana products can also raise prolactin level.
If your prolactin level is high, the test may be repeated in the early morning after an 8-hour fast.
The following can temporarily increase prolactin levels:
Emotional or physical stress (occasionally)
High-protein meals
Intense breast stimulation
Recent breast exam
Recent exercise
Interpretation of an abnormally high prolactin blood test is complicated. In most case, your provider will need to refer you to an endocrinologist, a doctor who specializes in hormone problems.
Risks
There is little risk in having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:
Excessive bleeding
Multiple punctures to locate veins
Fainting or feeling lightheaded
Hematoma
(blood buildup under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
Alternative Names
PRL; Galactorrhea - prolactin test; Infertility - prolactin test; Amenorrhea - prolactin test; Breast leakage - prolactin test; Prolactinoma - prolactin test; Pituitary tumor - prolactin test
