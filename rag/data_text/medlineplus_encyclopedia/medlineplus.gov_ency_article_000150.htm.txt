Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome (KTS) is a rare condition that is typically present at birth. The syndrome often involves port wine stains, excess growth of bones and soft tissue, and varicose veins.
Causes
KTS is caused by a genetic variation that occurs during fetal development. Why this occurs is unknown.
Symptoms
Symptoms of KTS include:
Many
port wine stains
or other blood vessel problems, including dark spots on the skin
Varicose veins
(may be seen in early infancy, but are more likely to be seen later in childhood or adolescence)
Unstable gait due to limb-length difference (involved limb is longer)
Bone, vein, or nerve pain
Other possible symptoms:
Bleeding from the rectum
Blood in the urine
Exams and Tests
People with this condition may have excessive growth of bones and soft tissue. This occurs most commonly in the legs, but it also may affect the arms, face, head, or internal organs.
Various imaging techniques can be used to find out any change in body structures due to this condition. These also help in deciding the plan of treatment. These may include:
MRA
Endoscopic thermal ablation therapy
X-rays
CT scans
or CT venography
MRI
Color duplex ultrasonography
Rarely would an
ultrasound
during pregnancy help detect the condition.
Support Groups
More information and support for people with KTS and their families can be found at:
The Klippel-Trenaunay Syndrome Support Group --

Vascular Birthmarks Foundation --

Outlook (Prognosis)
Most people with KTS do well, although the condition may affect their appearance.
