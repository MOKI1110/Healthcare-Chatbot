A cyst is a closed pocket or pouch of tissue. It can be filled with air, fluid, pus, or other material.
Considerations
Cysts may form within any tissue in the body. Most cysts in the lungs are filled with air. Cysts that form in the
lymph system
, liver,Â  or kidneys are fluid-filled. Certain parasites, such as some types of roundworms and tapeworms, can form cysts within the muscles, liver, brain, lungs, and eyes.
Cysts are common on the skin. They can develop when
acne
causes a sebaceous gland to clog, or they can form around something that is stuck in the skin. These cysts are not cancer (benign), but can cause pain and changes in appearance. At times, they can become inflamed or infected and need treatment due to pain and swelling.
Cysts can be drained or removed with surgery, depending on their type and location.
Sometimes, a cyst looks like a
skin cancer
and may need to be removed to be tested.
A
pilonidal dimple
or cyst is a type of skin cyst at the top of the buttocks in the midline of the body.
