Rhinophyma is a large red-colored (ruddy) nose. The nose has a bulb shape.
Causes
Rhinophyma was once thought to be caused by heavy alcohol use. This is not correct. Rhinophyma occurs equally in people who do not use alcohol and in those who drink heavily. The problem is much more common in men than in women.
The cause of rhinophyma is unknown. It may be a severe form of a skin disease called
rosacea
. It is an uncommon disorder.
Symptoms
Symptoms include changes in the nose, such as:
Bulb-like (bulbous) shape
Many oil glands
Reddish color (possible)
Thickening of the skin
Waxy, yellow surface
Exams and Tests
Most of the time, your health care provider can diagnose rhinophyma without any tests. Sometimes a
skin biopsy
may be needed.
Treatment
The most common treatment is surgery to reshape the nose. Surgery may be done with a
laser
, scalpel, or rotating brush (
dermabrasion
). Certain acne medicines may also help treat the condition.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Rhinophyma can be corrected with surgery. The condition may return.
Possible Complications
Rhinophyma can cause emotional distress. This is because of the way it looks.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of rhinophyma and would like to talk about treatment.
Alternative Names
