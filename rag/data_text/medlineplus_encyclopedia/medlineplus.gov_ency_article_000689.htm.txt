Axillary nerve dysfunction is nerve damage that can lead to a loss of movement or sensation in the shoulder.
Causes
Axillary nerve dysfunction is a form of
peripheral neuropathy
. It occurs when there is damage to the axillary nerve. This is the nerve that helps control the deltoid muscles of the shoulder and the skin around it. A problem with just one nerve, such as the axillary nerve, is called
mononeuropathy
.
The usual causes are:
Direct injury
Long-term pressure on the nerve
Pressure on the nerve from nearby body structures (entrapment)
Shoulder injury
Entrapment creates pressure on the nerve where it passes through a narrow structure.
The damage can destroy the myelin sheath that covers the nerve or part of the nerve cell (the axon). Damage of either type reduces or prevents the movement of signals through the nerve.
Conditions that can lead to axillary nerve dysfunction include:
Body-wide (systemic) disorders that cause nerve inflammation
Deep infection
Fracture of the upper arm bone (humerus)
Pressure from casts or splints
Improper use of crutches
Shoulder dislocation
In some cases, no cause can be found.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Numbness
over part of the outer shoulder
Pain in the shoulder region
Shoulder
weakness
, especially when lifting the arm up and away from the body (shoulder abduction)
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine your neck, arm, and shoulder. Weakness of the shoulder can cause difficulty moving your arm.
The deltoid muscle of the shoulder may show signs of
muscle atrophy
(loss of muscle tissue and thinning).
Tests that may be used to check axillary nerve dysfunction include:
Electromyography
Â (EMG) and nerve conduction tests will likely be normal right after the injury and should be done several weeks after the injury or symptoms start
MRI
,
ultrasound
, or
x-rays
of the shoulder
Treatment
Depending on the cause of the nerve disorder, some people do not need treatment. The problem may get better on its own. The rate of recovery is different for everyone. It can take many months to recover.
Anti-inflammatory medicines may be given if you have any of the following:
Sudden symptoms
Small changes in sensation or movement
No history of injury to the area
No signs of nerve damage
These medicines reduce swelling and pressure on the nerve. They may be injected directly into the area or taken by mouth.
Other medicines include:
Over-the-counter pain medicines may be helpful for mild pain.
Medicines to help reduce stabbing pain (
neuralgia
).
Opioid pain relievers are rarely helpful for neuropathic pain.
If your symptoms continue or get worse, you may need surgery. If a trapped nerve is causing your symptoms, surgery to release the nerve may help you feel better.
Physical therapy can help maintain muscle strength. Job changes, muscle retraining, or other forms of therapy may be recommended.
Outlook (Prognosis)
It may be possible to make a full recovery if the cause of the axillary nerve dysfunction can be identified and successfully treated.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Deformity of the arm, shoulder
contracture
, or
frozen shoulder
Partial
loss of sensation
in the arm (uncommon)
Partial shoulder
paralysis
Repeated injury to the arm
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider for an appointment if you have symptoms of axillary nerve dysfunction. Early diagnosis and treatment increase the chance of controlling symptoms.
Prevention
Preventive measures vary, depending on the cause. Avoid putting pressure on the underarm area for long periods. Make sure casts, splints, and other appliances fit properly. When you use crutches, learn how to avoid putting pressure on the underarm.
