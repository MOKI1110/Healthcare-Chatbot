Seborrheic keratosis is a condition that causes colored growths on the skin that sometimes resemble warts. The growths are noncancerous (
benign
).
Causes
A seborrheic keratosis is a benign form of skin
tumor
. The cause is unknown.
The condition commonly appears after age 40. It tends to run in families.
Symptoms
Symptoms of seborrheic keratosis are skin growths that:
Are located on the face, chest, shoulders, back, or other areas, except the lips, palms, and soles
Are painless, but may become irritated and
itchy
Are most often tan, brown, or black
Have a slightly raised, flat surface
May have a rough texture (like a wart)
Often have a waxy surface
Are round or oval
May look like a piece of bee's wax that has been pasted-on the skin
Often appear in clusters
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will look at the growths to determine if you have the condition. You may need a
skin biopsy
to confirm the diagnosis.
Treatment
You generally do not need treatment unless growths get irritated or affect your appearance.
Growths may be removed with
surgery
or freezing (
cryotherapy
).
Outlook (Prognosis)
Removing the growths is simple and generally does not cause scars. You may have patches of lighter skin where growths on the torso have been removed.
Growths usually do not return after they are removed. You may develop more growths in the future if you are prone to the condition.
Possible Complications
These complications may occur:
Irritation, bleeding, or discomfort of growths
Mistake in diagnosis (growths may look like
skin cancers
)
Distress due to physical appearance
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of seborrheic keratosis.
Also contact if you have new symptoms, such as:
A change in the appearance of the skin growth
New growths
A growth that looks like seborrheic keratosis, but occurs by itself or has ragged borders and irregular color. Your provider will need to examine it for skin cancer.
