To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Morphine is a very strong painkiller. It is one of a number of chemicals called opioids or opiates, which were originally derived from the opium poppy plant and used for pain relief or their calming effects. Morphine overdose occurs when a person intentionally or accidentally takes too much of the medicine.
This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with has overdosed, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

Home Care
In most states, naloxone, the antidote for opiate overdose, is available from the pharmacy without a prescription.
Naloxone is available as an intranasal spray, as well as an intramuscular injection and other FDA-approved product forms.
Seek immediate medical help. DO NOT make a person throw up unless told to do so by poison control or a health care professional. Perform
mouth-to-mouth breathing
if the person stops breathing.
Before Calling Emergency
If possible, determine the following information:
Person's age, weight, and condition (for example, is the person awake or alert?)
Name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known)
Time it was swallowed
Amount swallowed
However, DO NOT delay calling for help if this information is not immediately available.
Poison Control
The local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

What to Expect at the Emergency Room
If you go to the emergency room, take the container with you, if possible.Â
Your health care provider will measure and monitor your vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.
Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. You may receive:
Activated charcoal
Airway support, including oxygen, breathing tube through the mouth (intubation), and breathing machine (ventilator)
Blood and urine tests
CT scan of the head
Chest x-ray
Electrocardiogram
(ECG)
Fluids through a vein (
intravenous
or IV)
Laxative
Medicines to treat symptoms, including naloxone, an antidote to reverse the effect of the poison; many doses may be needed
Tube through the mouth into the stomach to wash out the stomach (gastric lavage), if unable to swallow medicines
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well the person does depends on the severity of the overdose and how quickly treatment is received. If the proper narcotic antagonist (medicine to counteract the effects of narcotics) can be given, recovery from an acute overdose occurs within 24 to 48 hours. However, if there has been prolonged coma and
shock
(damage to multiple internal organs), a more serious outcome is possible.
