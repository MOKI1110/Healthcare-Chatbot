Hypotonia means decreased muscle tone.
Considerations
Hypotonia is often a sign of a worrisome problem. The condition can affect children or adults.
Infants with this problem seem floppy and feel like a "rag doll" when held. They rest with their elbows and knees loosely extended. Infants with normal tone tend to have flexed elbows and knees. They may have poor head control. The head may fall to the side, backward, or forward.
Infants with normal tone can be lifted with the adult's hands placed under the armpits. Hypotonic infants tend to slip between the hands.
Causes
Muscle tone and movement involve the brain, spinal cord, nerves, and muscles. Hypotonia may be a sign of a problem anywhere along the pathway that controls muscle movement. Causes may include:
Brain damage, due to lack of oxygen before or right after birth, or problems with brain formation
Disorders of the muscles, such as
muscular dystrophy
Disorders that affect the nerves that supply muscles
Disorders that affect the ability of nerves to send messages to the muscles
Infections
Genetic or chromosomal disorders, or defects that may cause brain and nerve damage include:
Down syndrome
Spinal muscular atrophy
Prader-Willi syndrome
Tay-Sachs disease
Trisomy 13
Other disorders that can lead to the condition include:
Achondroplasia
Being born with hypothyroidism
Poisons or toxins
Spinal cord injuries that occur around the time of birth
Home Care
Take extra care when lifting and carrying a person with hypotonia to avoid causing an injury.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your health care provider will do a physical exam including a detailed examination of the nervous system and muscle function.
In most cases,Â a neurologist (specialist in brain and nerve disorders) will help evaluate the problem. Geneticists may help diagnose certain disorders. If there are also other medical problems, a number of different specialists will help care for the child.
Which diagnostic tests are done depends on the suspected cause of the hypotonia. Most of the conditions associated with hypotonia also cause other symptoms that can help make the diagnosis.
Many of these disorders require ongoing care and support. Physical therapy may be recommended to help children improve their development.
