Menkes disease is a genetic disorder in which the body has a problem absorbing and distributing copper to bodily organs. The disease affects mental and physical development.
Causes
Menkes disease is caused by a defect in the
ATP7A
gene. The defect makes it hard for the body to properly distribute (transport) copper throughout the body. As a result, the brain and other parts of the body do not get enough copper, while it builds up in the small intestine and kidneys. A low copper level can affect the structure of bone, skin, hair, and blood vessels, and interfere with nerve function.
Menkes syndrome is usually inherited, which means it runs in families. The gene is on the X chromosome, so if a mother carries the non-working copy of the gene, each of her sons has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of developing the disease, and 50% of her daughters will be a carrier of the disease. This kind of gene inheritance is called
X-linked recessive
.
In some people, the disease is not inherited from the parents. Instead, the genetic change occurs at the time the baby is conceived.
Symptoms
Common symptoms of Menkes disease in infants are:
Brittle, kinky, steely, sparse, or tangled hair
Pudgy, rosy cheeks, sagging facial skin
Feeding difficulties
Irritability
Decreased muscle tone (
hypotonia
), floppiness
Low body temperature
Intellectual disability and developmental delay
Seizures
Skeletal changes
Exams and Tests
Once Menkes disease is suspected, tests that may be done include:
Ceruloplasmin blood test
(substance that transports copper in the blood)
Copper blood test
Skin cell culture
X-ray of the skeleton
or
x-ray of the skull
Gene testing to check for a variation of the
ATP7A
gene
Treatment
Treatment usually only helps when started very early in the course of the disease. Injections of copper into a vein or under the skin have been used with mixed results and depend on whether the
ATP7A
gene still has some activity.
Support Groups
More information and support for people with Menkes syndrome and their families can be found at:

Outlook (Prognosis)
Most children with this disease die within the first few years of life.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Talk to your provider if you have a family history of Menkes syndrome and you plan to have children. A baby with this condition will often show symptoms early in infancy.
Prevention
See a
genetic counselor
if you want to have children and you have a family history of Menkes syndrome. Maternal relatives (relatives on the mother's side of the family) of a boy with this syndrome could be seen by a geneticist to find out if they are carriers.
