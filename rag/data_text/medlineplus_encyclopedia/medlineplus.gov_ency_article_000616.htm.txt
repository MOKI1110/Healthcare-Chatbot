Legionnaires disease

Legionnaires disease is an infection of the lungs and airways. It is caused by
Legionella
bacteria.
Causes
The bacteria that cause Legionnaires disease have been found in water delivery systems. They can survive in the warm, moist air conditioning systems of large buildings, including hospitals.
Most cases are caused by the bacteria
Legionella pneumophila
. The rest of the cases are caused by other
Legionella
species.
Spread of the bacteria from person to person has not been demonstrated.
Most infections occur in middle-aged or older people. In rare cases, children can get the infection. When they do, the disease is less severe.
Risk factors include:
Alcohol use
Cigarette smoking
Chronic illnesses, such as
kidney failure
or
diabetes
Long-term (chronic) lung disease, such as
COPD
Long-term use of a breathing machine (ventilator)
Medicines that suppress the immune system, including
chemotherapy
and steroid medicines
Older age
Symptoms
Symptoms tend to get worse during the first 4 to 6 days. They most often improve in another 4 to 5 days.
Symptoms may include:
General discomfort, loss of energy, or ill feeling (malaise)
Headache
Fever, shaking chills
Joint pain, muscle aches and stiffness
Chest pain
Cough that does not produce much sputum or mucus (dry cough)
Coughing up blood (rare)
Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain
Shortness of breath
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. Abnormal sounds, called crackles, may be heard when listening to the chest with a stethoscope.
Tests that may be done include:
Arterial blood gases
Blood cultures or other tests to identify the bacteria
Bronchoscopy
to view the airways and diagnose lung disease
Chest x-ray
or
CT scan
Complete blood count
(CBC), including
white blood cell count
Liver blood tests
Tests and cultures on sputum to identify
Legionella
bacteria
Urine tests to check for
Legionella pneumophila
bacteria
Molecular tests with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Treatment
Antibiotics are used to fight the infection. Treatment is started as soon as Legionnaire disease is suspected, without waiting for results of any lab test.
Other treatments may include receiving:
Fluids through a vein (IV)
Oxygen, which is given through a mask or breathing machine
Medicines that are breathed in to ease breathing
Outlook (Prognosis)
Legionnaires disease can be life threatening. The risk of dying is higher in people who:
Have long-term (chronic) diseases or compromised immune systems
Become infected while in the hospital
Are older adults
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider right away if you have any type of breathing problem and think you have symptoms of Legionnaires disease.
