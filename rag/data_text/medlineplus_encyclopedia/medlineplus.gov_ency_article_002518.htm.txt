Para-aminobenzoic acid

Para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) is a natural substance. It is often used in sunscreen products. PABA is sometimes called vitamin Bx, but it is not a true vitamin.
This article discusses reactions to PABA, such as
overdose
and allergic response. PABA overdose occurs when someone uses more than the normal or recommended amount of this substance. This can be by accident or on purpose.
Increased outdoor leisure time, decreased clothing coverage, a diminishing stratospheric ozone layer, and the rise in popularity of indoor tanning have added up to a significant increase in ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure in the last century.
When used appropriately, PABA-containing products can reduce the incidence of several types of skin cancers by reducing the amount of harmful radiation which can act upon the skin.
This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose . If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.
Poisonous Ingredient
Para-aminobenzoic acid (also known as 4-aminobenzoic acid)Â can be harmful in large amounts.
Where Found
PABA is used in certain sunscreen and skin-care products.
It may also naturally occur in these foods:
Brewer's yeast
Liver
Molasses
Mushrooms
Spinach
Whole grains
Other products may also contain PABA.
Symptoms
Symptoms of an allergic reaction to PABA or PABA overdose include:Â
Diarrhea
Dizziness
Eye irritation if it touches the eyes
Fever
Liver failure
Nausea, vomiting
Rash (in allergic reactions)
Shortness of breath
Slowed breathing
Stupor
(altered thinking and decreased level of consciousness)
Coma
(unresponsiveness)
Note: Most PABA reactions are due to allergic reactions, not overdoses.
Home Care
Seek medical help right away. Do not make a person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to. If the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.
If the chemical was swallowed, give the person water or milk right away, unless a provider tells you not to. Do not give anything to drink if the person has symptoms that make it hard to swallow. These include vomiting,
convulsions
, or a
decreased level of alertness
.
Before Calling Emergency
Have this information ready:
The person's age, weight, and condition
Name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known)
Time it was swallowed or used on the skin
Amount swallowed or used on the skin
Poison Control
Your local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.
Your provider will measure and monitor your vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.
Tests that may be done include:
Blood and urine tests
Chest x-ray
Electrocardiogram
(ECG)
Treatment may include:
Activated charcoal by mouth or tube through the nose into the stomach
Breathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the lungs, and breathing machine (ventilator)
Fluids through a vein (IV)
Medicine to treat symptoms
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.
Swallowing sunscreen products containing PABA rarely causes symptoms, except in very large doses. Some people may be allergic to PABA.
