Sodium in diet

Sodium is an element that the body needs to work properly. Salt contains sodium.
Function
The body uses sodium to control blood pressure and blood volume. Your body also needs sodium for your muscles and nerves to work properly.
Food Sources
Sodium occurs naturally in most foods. The most common form of sodium is sodium chloride, which is table salt. Milk, beets, and celery also naturally contain sodium. Drinking water also contains sodium, but the amount depends on the source.
Sodium is also added to many food products. Some of these added forms are monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium benzoate. These are in items such as Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, onion salt, garlic salt, and bouillon cubes.
Processed meats like bacon, sausage, and ham, along with canned soups and vegetables also contain added sodium. Processed baked goods such as packaged cookies, snack cakes, and doughnuts are also often high in sodium. Fast foods are generally very high in sodium.
Side Effects
Too much sodium in the diet may lead to:
High blood pressure in some people
A serious buildup of fluid in people with
heart failure
,
cirrhosis
of the liver, or kidney disease
Recommendations
Sodium in the diet (called dietary sodium) is measured in milligrams (mg). Table salt is 40% sodium. One teaspoon (5 milliliters) of table salt contains 2,300 mg of sodium.
Healthy adults should limit sodium intake to 2,300 mg per day. Adults with high blood pressure should have no more than 1,500 mg per day. Those with congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and kidney disease may need much lower amounts.
There are no specific sodium restrictions for infants, children, and teens. However, certain levels of daily adequate intake for healthy growth have been established. These include:
Infants younger than 6 months: 110 mg
Infants age 6 to 12 months: 370 mg
Children ages 1 to 3 years: 800 mg
Children ages 4 to 8 years: 1,000 mg
Children and teens ages 9 to 13 years: 1,200 mgÂ
Children and teens ages 14 to 18 years: 1,500 mg
Eating habits, taste, and attitudes about food that are formed during childhood are likely to influence food choices for life. For this reason,
it is a good idea for children to avoid consuming too much sodium
.
