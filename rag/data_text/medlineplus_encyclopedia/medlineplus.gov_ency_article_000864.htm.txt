Ecthyma is a skin infection. It is similar to
impetigo
, but occurs deep inside the skin. For this reason, ecthyma is often called deep impetigo.
Causes
Ecthyma is most often caused by the streptococcus bacteria. Sometimes, staphylococcus bacteria cause this skin infection on its own or in combination with streptococcus.
The infection may start in skin that has been injured due to a scratch, rash, or insect bite. The infection often develops on the legs. People with diabetes or a weakened immune system are more prone to ecthyma.
Symptoms
The main symptom of ecthyma is a small
blister
with a red border that may be filled with pus. The blister is similar to that seen with
impetigo
, but the infection spreads much deeper into the skin.
After the blister goes away, a crusty ulcer appears.
Exams and Tests
YourÂ healthÂ care providerÂ can usually diagnose this condition simply by looking at your skin. In rare cases, the fluid inside the blisterÂ is sent to a lab for closer examination, or a
skin biopsy
Â needs toÂ be done.
Treatment
YourÂ provider will usually prescribe antibiotics that you need to take by mouth (oral antibiotics). Very early cases may be treated with antibiotics that you apply to the affected area (topical antibiotics).Â Serious infectionsÂ may need antibiotics given through a vein (intravenous antibiotics).
Placing a warm, wet cloth over the area can help remove ulcer crusts. YourÂ provider may recommend antiseptic soap or peroxide washes to speed recovery.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Ecthyma can sometimes result in scarring.
Possible Complications
This condition may lead to:
Spread of infection to other parts of the body
Permanent skin damage with scarring
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Make an appointment with your provider if you have symptoms of ecthyma.
Prevention
Carefully clean the skin after an injury, such as a bite or scratch.Â Do not scratch orÂ pick at scabs and sores.
