The RBC urine test measures the number of red blood cells in a urine sample.
How the Test is Performed
A random sample of urine is collected. Random means that the sample is collected at any time either at the lab or at home.
A
clean-catch urine sample
is needed. The clean-catch method is used to prevent germs from the penis or vagina from getting into a urine sample. To collect your urine, your health care provider may give you a special clean-catch kit that contains a cleansing solution and sterile wipes. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate.
How to Prepare for the Test
No special preparation is necessary for this test.
How the Test will Feel
The test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.
Why the Test is Performed
This test is done as part of a
urinalysis test
.
Normal Results
A normal result is 4 red blood cells per high power field (RBC/HPF) or less when the sample is examined under a microscope.
The example above is a common measurement for a result of this test. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test result.
What Abnormal Results Mean
A higher than normal number of RBCs in the urine may be due to:
Kidney and other urinary tract problems, such as infection, or stones
Kidney inflammation or
injury
Prostate problems
Bladder, kidney, or urinary tract cancer
Risks
There are no risks with this test.
