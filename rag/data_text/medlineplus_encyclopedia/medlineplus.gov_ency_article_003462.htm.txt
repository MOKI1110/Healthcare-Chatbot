Your health care provider may ask you to not eat or drink for 8 hours before the test.
How the Test will Feel
You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.
Why the Test is Performed
This test is done to evaluate:
Kidney function
Blood acid/base balance
Sodium and potassium levels
Blood sugar levels
Blood calcium level
Normal Results
The basic metabolic panel typically measures these blood chemicals. The following are normal ranges for the substances tested:
BUN
: 6 to 20 mg/dL (2.14 to 7.14 mmol/L)
CO2 (carbon dioxide)
: 23 to 29 mmol/L
Creatinine
: 0.8 to 1.2 mg/dL (70.72 to 106.08 micromol/L)
Glucose
: 64 to 100 mg/dL (3.55 to 5.55 mmol/L)
Serum chloride
: 96 to 106 mmol/L
Serum potassium
: 3.7 to 5.2 mEq/L (3.7 to 5.2 mmol/L)
Serum sodium
: 136 to 144 mEq/L (136 to 144 mmol/L)
Serum calcium: 8.5 to 10.2 mg/dL (2.13 to 2.55 millimol/L)
Key to abbreviations:
L = liter
dL = deciliter = 0.1 liter
mg = milligram
mmol = millimole
mEq = milliequivalents
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.
What Abnormal Results Mean
