Horner syndrome is a rare condition that affects the nerves to the eyes and face.
Causes
Horner syndrome can be caused by any interruption in a set of nerve fibers that start in the part of the brain called the hypothalamus and travel to the face and eyes. These nerve fibers are involved with sweating, the pupils in your eyes, and the upper and lower eyelid muscles.
Damage of the nerve fibers can result from:
Injury to the carotid artery, one of the main arteries to the brain
Injury to nerves at the base of the neck called the brachial plexus or nerve roots
Migraine
or
cluster headaches
Stroke
, tumor, or other damage to a part of the brain called the brainstem
Tumor or infection in the top of the lung, between the lungs, and neck
Injections or surgery done to interrupt the nerve fibers and relieve pain (sympathectomy)
Spinal cord injury
In rare cases, Horner syndrome is present at birth. The condition may occur with a lack of color (pigmentation) of the iris (colored part of the eye).
Symptoms
Symptoms of Horner syndrome may include:
Decreased sweating on the affected side of the face
Drooping eyelid
(ptosis)
Sinking of the eyeball into the face
Different sizes of pupils of the eyes (
anisocoria
) with the affected side pupil being smaller
There may also be other symptoms, depending on the location of the affected nerve fiber. These may include:
Vertigo
(sensation that surroundings are spinning) with nausea and vomiting
Double vision
Lack of muscle control and coordination
Arm pain, weakness and numbness
One sided neck and ear pain
Hoarseness
Hearing loss
Bladder and bowel difficulty
Overreaction of the involuntary (autonomic) nervous system to stimulation (
hyperreflexia
)
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms.
An eye exam may show:
Changes in how the pupil opens or closes
Constricted pupil
Eyelid drooping
Red eye
Depending on the suspected cause, tests may be done, such as:
Blood tests
Blood vessel tests of the head (
angiogram
)
Chest x-ray
or
chest CT scan
MRI
or
CT scan of the brain
or cervical spine
Spinal tap
(lumbar puncture)
Electromyography
and
nerve conduction studies
if nerve root or brachial plexus injury is suspected
You may need to be referred to a provider who specializes in vision problems related to the nervous system (neuro-ophthalmologist).
Treatment
Treatment depends on the underlying cause of the condition. There is no treatment for Horner syndrome itself. Ptosis is very mild and in rare cases affects vision in Horner syndrome. This can be corrected by cosmetic surgery or treated with eyedrops. Your provider can tell you more.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome depends on whether treatment of the cause is successful.
Possible Complications
There are no direct complications of Horner syndrome itself. But, there may be complications from the disease that caused Horner syndrome or from its treatment.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of Horner syndrome.
