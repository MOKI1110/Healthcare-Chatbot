Seborrheic dermatitis
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Seborrheic dermatitis is a common inflammatory skin condition. It causes flaky, white to yellowish
scales
to form on oily areas such as the scalp, face, or inside the ear. It can occur with or without reddened skin.
Cradle cap
is the term used when seborrheic dermatitis affects the scalp of infants.
Causes
The exact cause of seborrheic dermatitis is unknown. It may be due to a combination of factors:
Oil gland activity
Yeasts called Malassezia, which live on the skin, mainly in areas with more oil glands
Changes in skin barrier function
Your genes
Risk factors include:
Stress or fatigue
Weather extremes
Oily skin, or skin problems such as acne
Heavy alcohol use, or using lotions that contain alcohol
Obesity
Nervous system disorders, including
Parkinson disease
, traumatic brain injury, or
stroke
Having HIV/AIDS
Symptoms
Seborrheic dermatitis can occur on several body areas. It often forms where the skin is oily or greasy. Common areas include the scalp, eyebrows, eyelids, creases of the nose, lips, behind the ears, in the outer ear, and middle of the chest.
In general, symptoms of seborrheic dermatitis include:
Skin lesions
with scales
Plaques
over large area
Greasy, oily areas of skin
Skin scales -- white and flaking, or yellowish, oily, and sticky dandruff
Itching -- may become more itchy if infected
Mild redness
Exams and Tests
Diagnosis is based on the appearance and location of the skin lesions. Further tests, such as
skin biopsy
, are rarely needed.
Treatment
Flaking and dryness can be treated with over-the-counter dandruff or medicated shampoos. You can buy these at the drugstore without a prescription. Look for a product that says on the label it treats seborrheic dermatitis or dandruff. Such products contain ingredients such as salicylic acid, coal tar, zinc, resorcinol, ketoconazole, or selenium sulfide. Use the shampoo according to label instructions.
For severe cases, your health care provider will likely prescribe a shampoo, cream, ointment, or lotion containing either a stronger dose of the above medicines or containing any of the following medicines:
Ketoconazole
Ciclopirox
Sodium sulfacetamide
A corticosteroid
Tacrolimus or pimecrolimus (medicines that suppress the immune system)
Phototherapy, a medical procedure in which your skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light, may be needed.
Sunlight may improve seborrheic dermatitis. In some people, the condition gets better in the summer, especially after outdoor activities.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic (life-long) condition that comes and goes, but it can be controlled with treatment.
Severity of seborrheic dermatitis can be lessened by controlling risk factors and paying careful attention to skin care.
Possible Complications
The condition may result in:
Psychological distress, low self-esteem, embarrassment
Secondary bacterial or fungal infections
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Call for an appointment with your provider if your symptoms don't respond to self-care or over-the-counter treatments.
Also call if patches of seborrheic dermatitis drain fluid or pus, form crusts, or become very red or painful.
