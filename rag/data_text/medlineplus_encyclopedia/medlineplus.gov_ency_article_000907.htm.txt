A threatened miscarriage is a condition that indicates the potential for a miscarriage or early pregnancy loss. It might take place before the 20th week of pregnancy.
Causes
Some pregnant women have some
vaginal bleeding
Â during the first 3 months of pregnancy. Bleeding may occurÂ with or without abdominal cramps. When the symptoms indicate a miscarriage is possible, the condition is called a "threatened abortion." (This refers to a natural event that is not due to a medical or surgical abortion.)
Miscarriage
is common. Small falls, injuries or stress during the first trimester of pregnancy can cause threatened miscarriage. It occurs in almost one half of all pregnancies. The chance of miscarriage is higher in older women. About one half of women who have bleeding in the first trimester will have a miscarriage.
Symptoms
Symptoms of a threatened miscarriage include:
Vaginal bleeding during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy (last menstrual period was less than 20 weeks ago). Vaginal bleeding occurs in almost all threatened miscarriages.
Abdominal cramps may also occur. If abdominal cramps occur in the absence of significant bleeding, consult your health care provider to check for other problems besides threatened miscarriage.
Note: During a miscarriage, low back pain or abdominal pain (dull to sharp, constant to intermittent) can occur. Tissue or clot-like material may pass from the
vagina
.
Exams and Tests
Your provider may perform an abdominal or vaginal ultrasound to check the baby's development and heartbeat, and the amount of bleeding. A pelvic exam may also be done to check your cervix.
Blood tests done may include:
Beta HCG (quantitative) test
(pregnancy test)
over a period of days or weeks to confirm whether the pregnancy is continuing
Complete blood count
(CBC) to determine the presence of anemia
Progesterone level
White blood count
(WBC) with
differential
to check for infection
Treatment
Apart from controlling the blood loss, you may not need any particular treatment. If you are
Rh Negative
, then you may be given immune globulin. You may be told to avoid or restrict some activities. Not having sexual intercourse is often recommended until the warning signs have disappeared.Â
Outlook (Prognosis)
Most women with a threatened miscarriage go on to have a normal pregnancy.
Women who have had two or more miscarriages in a row may be more likely than other women to miscarry again.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Anemia
from moderate to heavy blood loss, which may require a blood transfusion.
Infection.
Miscarriage.
The provider will want to ensure that the symptoms are not due to an ectopic pregnancy. This is a potentially life-threatening complication.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
If you know you are (or are likely to be) pregnant and you have any symptoms of threatened miscarriage, contact your prenatal provider right away.
Prevention
Most miscarriages cannot be prevented. The most common cause of a miscarriage is a random genetic abnormality in the developing fetus. If you have two or more repeated miscarriages, you should consult a specialist to look for an underlying condition that is causing the problem. Women who get prenatal care have better pregnancy outcomes for themselves and their babies.
A healthy pregnancy is more likely when you avoid things that are harmful to your pregnancy, such as:
Alcohol
Infectious diseases
High caffeine intake
Recreational drugs
X-rays
Taking a prenatal vitamin or folic acid supplement before becoming pregnant and throughout your pregnancy can lower your chance of miscarriage and improve the chance of delivering a healthy baby.
It is better to treat health problems before you get pregnant than to wait until you are already pregnant. Miscarriages caused by diseases that affect your whole body, such as high blood pressure, are rare. But you can prevent these miscarriages by detecting and treating the disease before becoming pregnant.
Other factors that can increase your risk for miscarriage include:
Obesity
Thyroid problems
Uncontrolled diabetes
