Toxic shock syndrome

Toxic shock syndrome is a serious and potentially life-threatening disease that involves fever,
shock
, and problems with several body organs.
Causes
Toxic shock syndrome is caused by a toxin produced by some types of staphylococcus bacteria. A similar problem, called toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS), can be caused by a toxin from streptococcal bacteria. Very few staph or strep infections cause toxic shock syndrome.
The earliest cases of toxic shock syndrome involved women who used tampons during their menstrual periods. However, today less than one half of cases are linked to tampon use. Toxic shock syndrome can also occur with skin infections, burns, and after surgery. The condition can also affect children, postmenopausal women, and men.
Risk factors include:
Recent childbirth
Infection with
Staphylococcus aureus
(
S aureus
), commonly called a staph infection
Foreign bodies or packings (such as those used to stop nosebleeds) inside the body
Recent surgery
Tampon use (with higher risk if you leave one in for a long time)
Wound infection after surgery
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Confusion
Diarrhea
General ill feeling
Headaches
High fever, sometimes accompanied by chills
Low blood pressure
Muscle aches
Nausea and vomiting
Organ failure (most oftenÂ
kidneys
and liver)
Redness of eyes, mouth, throat
Seizures
Widespread red rash that looks like a sunburn -- skin peeling occurs 1 or 2 weeks after the rash, particularly on the palms of the hand or bottom of the feet
Exams and Tests
No single test can diagnose toxic shock syndrome.
The health care provider will look for the following factors:
Fever
Low blood pressure
Rash that peels after 1 to 2 weeks
Problems with the function of at least 3 organs
In some cases, blood cultures may be positive for growth of
S aureus
or
Streptococcus pyogenes
.
Treatment
Treatment includes:
Removal of materials, such as tampons, vaginal sponges, or nasal packing
Drainage of infection sites (such as a surgical wound)
The goal of treatment is to maintain important body functions. This may include:
Antibiotics for any infection (may be given through an IV)
Dialysis (if severe kidney problems are present)
Fluids through a vein (IV)
Medicines to control blood pressure
Intravenous gamma globulin in severe cases
Staying in the hospital intensive care unit (ICU) for monitoring
Outlook (Prognosis)
Toxic shock syndrome may be deadly in up to 50% of cases. The condition may return in those who survive.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Organ damage including kidney,
heart
, and liver failure
Shock
Death
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Toxic shock syndrome is a medical emergency. Seek medical help right away if you develop a rash, fever, and feel ill, particularly during menstruation and tampon use or if you have had recent surgery.
Prevention
You can lower your risk for menstrual toxic shock syndrome by:
Avoiding highly absorbent tampons
Changing tampons frequently (at least every 8 hours)
Only using tampons onceÂ in awhile during menstruation
Alternative Names
Staphylococcal toxic shock syndrome; Toxic shock-like syndrome; TSLS
