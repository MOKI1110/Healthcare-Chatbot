Pancreatic pseudocyst
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
A pancreatic pseudocyst is a fluid-filled sac in the abdomen that arises from the pancreas. It may also contain tissue from the pancreas, enzymes, and blood.
Causes
The pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach. It produces chemicals (called enzymes) needed to digest food. It also produces the hormones insulin and glucagon.
Pancreatic pseudocysts most often develop after an episode of severe pancreatitis.
Pancreatitis
happens when your pancreas gets inflamed. There are many causes of this problem.
This problem may sometimes occur:
In someone with long-term (chronic)
swelling of the pancreas
(pancreatitis), most often due to alcohol abuse
After trauma to the belly, more often in children
The pseudocyst happens when the ducts (tubes) in the pancreas are damaged and fluid with enzymes cannot drain.
Symptoms
Symptoms can occur within days to months after an attack of pancreatitis. They include:
Bloating of the abdomen
Constant pain or deep ache in the abdomen, which may also be felt in the back
Nausea and vomiting
Loss of appetite
Difficulty eating and digesting food
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will feel your abdomen for a pseudocyst. It will feel like a lump in the middle or left upper abdomen.
Tests that may help detect pancreatic pseudocyst include:
Abdominal CT scan
Abdominal MRI
Abdominal ultrasound
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)
Treatment
Treatment depends on the size of the pseudocyst and whether it is causing symptoms. Many pseudocysts go away on their own. Those that remain for more than 6 weeks and are larger than 5 centimeters (about 2 inches) in diameter may need treatment.Â However, size and duration do not always mean treatment is needed, especially in a person without any symptoms and whose pseudocyst is not getting bigger.
Possible treatments include:
Drainage through the skin using a needle, most often guided by a CT scan.
Endoscopic
-assisted drainage using an endoscope. In this, a tube containing a camera and a light is passed down into the stomach).
Surgical drainage of the pseudocyst. A connection is made between the cyst and the stomach or small intestine. This may be done using a laparoscope.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome is generally good with treatment. It is important to make sure that it is not a pancreatic cancer that starts in a cyst, which has a worse outcome.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
A
pancreatic abscess
can develop if the pseudocyst becomes infected.
The pseudocyst can break open (rupture). This can be a serious complication because
shock
and excess bleeding (hemorrhage) may develop.
The pseudocyst may press down on (compress) nearby organs.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
If you are known to have a pseudocyst, rupture of the pseudocyst is a medical emergency. Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you develop symptoms of bleeding or shock, such as:
Fainting
Fever and chills
Rapid heartbeat
Severe abdominal pain
Prevention
The way to prevent pancreatic pseudocysts is by preventing pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is caused by
gallstones
, the provider will perform surgery to remove the gallbladder (cholecystectomy).
When pancreatitis occurs due to alcohol abuse, you must stop drinking alcohol to prevent future attacks.
When pancreatitis occurs due to high blood triglycerides, this condition should be treated.
