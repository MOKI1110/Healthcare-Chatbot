Subdural effusion

A subdural effusion is a collection of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) trapped between the surface of the brain and the outer lining of the brain (the dura matter). If this fluid becomes infected, the condition is called a subdural empyema.
Causes
A subdural effusion is a rare complication of
meningitis
caused by bacteria. Subdural effusion is more common in infants.
It may also occur after head trauma.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
Outward curving of a baby's skull's soft spot (
bulging fontanelle
)
Abnormally wide spaces in the bony joints of a baby's skull (
separated sutures
)
Increased head circumference
Low energy (
lethargy
)
Persistent fever
Seizures
Vomiting
Weakness or loss of movement on both sides of the body
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms.
To detect the subdural effusion, tests that may be done include:
CT scan of the head
Head size (circumference) measurements
MRI scan of the head
Ultrasound
of the head
Treatment
Surgery to drain the effusion is often necessary. The fluid is usually tested. In rare cases, a permanent drainage device (shunt) is needed to drain fluid. Antibiotics may need to be given through a vein.
Treatment may include:
Surgery to drain the effusion
Drainage device, called a shunt, left in place for a short time or longer time
Antibiotics given through a vein to treat an infection
Outlook (Prognosis)
Full recovery from a subdural effusion is expected. If nervous system problems continue, they are generally due to the meningitis, not the effusion. Long-term antibiotics are usually not needed.
Possible Complications
Complications of surgery may include:
Bleeding
Brain damage
Infection
