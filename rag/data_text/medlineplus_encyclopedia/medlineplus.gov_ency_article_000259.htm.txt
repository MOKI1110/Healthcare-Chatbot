Pseudomembranous colitis

Pseudomembranous colitis refers to swelling or inflammation of the large intestine (colon) due to an overgrowth of
Clostridioides difficile
(
C difficile
) bacteria.
This infection is a common cause of diarrhea after antibiotic use. Not all cases of diarrhea associated with antibiotic use are due to
C difficile
or will progress to pseudomembranous colitis.
Causes
The
C difficile
bacteria normally lives in the intestine. However, too much of these bacteria may grow when you take antibiotic medicines. The bacteria give off a strong toxin that causes inflammation and bleeding in the lining of the colon.
Any antibiotic can cause this condition. The medicines responsible for the problem most of the time are ampicillin, clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins.
Health care providers in the hospital may pass this bacteria from one patient to another.
Pseudomembranous colitis is uncommon in children, and rare in infants. It is most often seen in people who are in the hospital. However, it is becoming more common in people who take antibiotics and are not in a hospital.
Risk factors include:
Older age
Antibiotic use
Use of medicines that weaken the immune system (such as chemotherapy medicines)
Recent surgery
History of pseudomembranous colitis
History of
ulcerative colitis
,
Crohn disease
, and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
C difficile
can happen in IBD patients even without taking antibiotics.
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Abdominal cramps
(mild to severe)
Bloody stools
Fever
Urge to have a bowel movement
Watery
diarrhea
(often 5 to 10 times per day)
Exams and Tests
The following tests may be done:
Colonoscopy
or flexible sigmoidoscopy
Immunoassay for
C difficile toxin
in the stool
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for
C difficile
toxin in the stool
CT scan if complications are suspected
Treatment
The antibiotic or other medicine causing the condition should be stopped. Fidaxomicin and vancomycin are most often used to treat the problem. Metronidazole is also effective, but it is no longer a first line choice in the US.
Electrolyte solutions
or fluids given through a vein may be needed to treat dehydration due to diarrhea. In rare cases, surgery is needed to treat infections that get worse or do not respond to antibiotics.
Long term antibiotics may be needed if the
C difficile
infection returns. A treatment called fecal microbiota transplant ("stool transplant") has also been effective for infections that come back.
Your provider may also suggest that you take probiotics if the infection returns.
An antibody treatment may be needed in patients with very high risk of recurrent
C difficile
to lessen the risk of recurrence.Â
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outlook is good in most cases, if there are no complications. However, up to 1 in 5 infections may return and need more treatment.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Dehydration with electrolyte imbalance
Perforation of (hole through) the colon
Toxic megacolon
Death
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have the following symptoms:
Any bloody stools (especially after taking antibiotics)
Five or more episodes of diarrhea per day for more than 1 to 2 days
Severe abdominal pain
Signs of dehydration
Prevention
People who have had pseudomembranous colitis should tell their providers before taking antibiotics again. It is also very important to wash hands well to prevent passing the germ to other people. Alcohol sanitizers do not always work on
C difficile
.
