Hematocrit is a blood test that measures how much of a person's blood is made up of red blood cells as opposed to plasma. This measurement depends on
the number of and size of the red blood cells
.
How the Test is Performed
A
blood sample
is needed.
How to Prepare for the Test
No special preparation is necessary for this test.
How the Test will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.
Why the Test is Performed
The hematocrit is almost always done as part of a complete blood count (
CBC
).
Your health care provider may recommend this test if you have signs of or are at risk for anemia. These include having:
Before and after major surgery
Blood in your stools, or vomit (if you throw up)
Chronic medical problems, such as kidney disease or certain types of arthritis
During pregnancy
Fatigue, poor health, or unexplained weight loss
Headaches
Heavy menstrual periods
Leukemia or other problems in the bone marrow
Monitoring during treatment for cancer
Monitoring medicines that may cause anemia or low blood counts
Monitoring of anemia and its cause
Poor nutrition
Problems concentrating
Normal Results
Normal results vary, but in general they are:
Male: 40.7% to 50.3%
Female: 36.1% to 44.3%
For babies, normal results are:
Newborn: 45% to 61%
Infant: 32% to 42%
The examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Low hematocrit may be due to:
Anemia
Bleeding
Bone marrow being unable to produce new red blood cells. This may be due to leukemia, other cancers, medicine toxicity, radiation therapy, infection, or bone marrow disorders
Chronic illness
Chronic kidney disease
Destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis)
Leukemia
Malnutrition
Pregnancy
Too little iron, folate, vitamin B12, and vitamin B6 in the diet
Too much water in the body
High hematocrit may be due to:
Bone marrow disease that causes abnormal increase in RBCs (polycythemia vera)
Cigarette smoking
Dehydration (for example, from severe diarrhea)
Failure of the right side of the heart (cor pulmonale)
Kidney tumor (renal cell carcinoma)
Low blood oxygen level (hypoxia)
Problem with heart's structure and function that is present at birth (congenital heart disease)
Scarring or thickening of the lungs (pulmonary fibrosis)
Your hematocrit will increase for several weeks when you are in a higher altitude.
Risks
There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:
Excessive bleeding
Fainting or feeling lightheaded
Multiple punctures to locate veins
Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
Alternative Names
HCT
