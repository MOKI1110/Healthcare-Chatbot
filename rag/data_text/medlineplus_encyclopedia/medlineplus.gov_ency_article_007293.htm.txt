Iontophoresis is the process of passing a weak electrical current through the skin. Iontophoresis has a variety of uses in medicine. This article discusses the use of iontophoresis to decrease sweating by blocking sweat glands.
Description
The area to be treated is placed into water. A gentle current of electricity passes through the water. A technician carefully and gradually increases the electrical current until you feel a light tingling sensation.
The therapy lasts about 30 minutes and requires several sessions each week.
How iontophoresis works is not exactly known. It is thought that the process somehow plugs the sweat glands and temporarily prevents you from sweating.
Iontophoresis units are also available for home use. If you use a unit at home, be sure to follow the instructions that come with the machine.
Why the Procedure is Performed
Iontophoresis may be used to treat excessive sweating (
hyperhidrosis
) of the hands, underarms, and feet.
Risks
Side effects are rare but may include skin irritation, dryness, and blistering. Tingling may continue even after the treatment has ended.
Alternative Names
Hyperhidrosis - iontophoresis; Excessive sweating - iontophoresis
