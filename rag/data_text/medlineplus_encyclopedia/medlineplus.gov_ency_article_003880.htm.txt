Slit-lamp exam

The slit-lamp examination looks at structures that are at the front of the eye.
How the Test is Performed
The slit-lamp is a low-power microscope combined with a high-intensity light source that can be focused as a thin, slit-like beam.
You will sit in a chair with the instrument placed in front of you. You will be asked to rest your chin and forehead on a support to keep your head steady.
The health care provider will examine your eyes, especially the eyelids, cornea, conjunctiva, sclera, and iris. Often a orange dye (fluorescein) is used to help examine the cornea and tear layer. The dye is added either by touching a small strip of paper to your eye or by adding it as an eyedrop. The dye rinses out of the eye with tears as you blink.
Next, drops may be placed in your eyes to widen (dilate) your pupils. The drops take about 15 to 20 minutes to work. The slit-lamp examination is then repeated using another small lens held close to the eye, so the back of the eye can be examined.
How to Prepare for the Test
No special preparation is needed for this test.
How the Test will Feel
Your eyes will be sensitive to light for a few hours after the exam if dilating drops are used.
Why the Test is Performed
This test is used to examine the:
Conjunctiva
(the thin membrane that covers the inner surface of the eyelid and the white part of the eyeball)
Cornea (the clear outer lens on the front of the eye)
Eyelids
Iris
(colored part of the eye between the cornea and lens)
Lens
Sclera
(the white outer coating of the eye)
Normal Results
Structures in the eye are found to be normal.
What Abnormal Results Mean
The slit lamp exam may detect many diseases of the eye, including:
Clouding of the lens of the eye (
cataract
)
Injury to the cornea
Dry eye syndrome
Macular degeneration
Separation of the retina from its supporting layers (
retinal detachment
)
Blockage in a small artery or vein that carries blood to or from the retina (
retinal vessel occlusion
)
Inherited degeneration of the retina (
retinitis pigmentosa
)
Swelling and irritation of the uvea (
uveitis
), the middle layer of the eye
This list does not include all possible diseases of the eye that may be detected with a slit lamp.
Risks
If you receive drops to dilate your eyes for the ophthalmoscopy, your vision will be blurred.
Wear sunglasses to protect your eyes from sunlight, which can damage your eyes.
Have someone drive you home.
The drops usually wear off in several hours.
In rare cases, the dilating eyedrops cause:
An attack of narrow-angle
glaucoma
Dizziness
Dryness of the mouth
Flushing
Nausea and vomiting
