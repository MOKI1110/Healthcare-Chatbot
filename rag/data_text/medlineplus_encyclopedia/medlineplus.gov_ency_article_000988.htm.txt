Tracheitis is a bacterial infection of the windpipe (trachea).
Causes
Bacterial tracheitis is most often caused by the bacteria
Staphylococcus aureus.
It often follows a
viral upper respiratory infection
. It affects mostly young children. This may be due to their tracheas being smaller and more easily blocked by swelling.
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Deep
cough
(similar to that caused by
croup
)
Difficulty breathing
High
fever
High-pitched breathing sound (
stridor
)
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will perform a physical exam and listen to the child's lungs. The muscles between the ribs may pull in as the child tries to breathe. This is called
intercostal retractions
.
Tests that may be done to diagnose this condition include:
Blood oxygen level
Nasopharyngeal culture
to look for bacteria
Tracheal culture to look for bacteria
X-ray
of the trachea or neck
Tracheoscopy
Treatment
The child often needs to have a tube placed into the airways to help with breathing. This is called an endotracheal tube. Bacterial debris often needs to be removed from the trachea at that time.
The child will receive antibiotics through a vein. The health care team will closely monitor the child's breathing and use oxygen, if needed.
Outlook (Prognosis)
With prompt treatment, the child should recover.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Airway obstruction
(can lead to death)
Toxic shock syndrome
if the condition was caused by the bacteria staphylococcus
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Tracheitis is an emergency medical condition. Go to the emergency room right away if your child has had a recent upper respiratory infection and suddenly has a high fever, a cough that gets worse, or trouble breathing.
