Periorbital cellulitis is an infection of the eyelid or skin around the eye.
Causes
Periorbital cellulitis can occur at any age, but more commonly affects children younger than 5 years old.
This infection can occur after a scratch, injury, or bug bite around the eye, which allows germs to enter the wound. It can also extend from a nearby site that is infected, such as the sinuses.
Periorbital cellulitis is different than
orbital cellulitis
, which is an infection of the fat and muscles around the eye. In contrast to periorbital cellulitis, orbital cellulitis is a dangerous infection, which can cause lasting problems and deeper infections.
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Redness around the eye or in the white part of the eye
Swelling of the eyelid, whites of eyes, and surrounding area
This condition usually does not affect vision or cause eye pain.
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine the eye, especially, eye movements and test for vision, and ask about the symptoms.
Tests that may be ordered include:
Blood culture
Complete blood count
Â (CBC)
CT scan
MRI scan
Treatment
Antibiotics are given by mouth, by shots, or through a vein (
intravenously
; IV) to help fight the infection.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Periorbital cellulitis almost always improves with treatment. In rare cases, the infection spreads into the eye socket, resulting in orbital cellulitis.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider right away if:
The eye becomes red or swollen
Symptoms get worse after treatment
Fever develops along with eye symptoms
It is difficult or painful to move the eye
The eye looks like it is sticking (bulging) out
There are vision changes
Alternative Names
Preseptal cellulitis
