Restrictive cardiomyopathy

Restrictive cardiomyopathy refers to a set of changes in how the heart muscle functions. These changes cause the heart to fill poorly (more common) or squeeze poorly (less common). Sometimes, both problems are present.
Causes
In a case of restrictive cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle is of normal size or slightly enlarged. Most of the time, it also pumps normally. However, it does not relax normally during the time between heartbeats when the blood returns from the body (diastole).
Although the main problem is abnormal filling of the heart, the heart may not pump blood strongly when the disease progresses. The abnormal heart function can affect the lungs, liver, and other body systems. Restrictive cardiomyopathy may affect either or both of the lower heart chambers (ventricles). Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a rare condition. The most common causes are amyloidosis and scarring of the heart from an unknown cause. It also can occur after a heart transplant.
Other causes of restrictive cardiomyopathy include:
Cardiac amyloidosis
Carcinoid heart disease
Diseases of the heart lining (endocardium), such as endomyocardial fibrosis and Loeffler syndrome (rare)
Iron overload (hemochromatosis)
Sarcoidosis
Scarring after radiation or chemotherapy
Scleroderma
Tumors of the heart
Symptoms
Symptoms of
heart failure
are most common. These symptoms often develop slowly over time. However, symptoms sometimes start very suddenly and are severe.
Common symptoms are:
Cough
Breathing problems that occur at night, with activity or when lying flat
Fatigue and inability to exercise
Loss of appetite
Swelling of the abdomen
Swelling of the feet and ankles
Uneven or rapid pulse
Other symptoms may include:
Chest pain
Inability to concentrate
Low urine output
Need to urinate at night (in adults)
Exams and Tests
A physical exam may show:
Enlarged (distended) or bulging neck veins
Enlarged liver
Lung crackles and abnormal or distant
heart sounds
in the chest heard through a stethoscope
Fluid backup into the hands and feet
Signs of
heart failure
Tests for restrictive cardiomyopathy include:
Cardiac catheterization
and
coronary angiography
Chest CT scan
Chest x-ray
Electrocardiogram
Â (ECG)
Echocardiogram
and Doppler study
MRI of the heart
Nuclear heart scan (MUGA, RNV, PET)
Serum iron studies
Serum and
urine protein
tests
Restrictive cardiomyopathy may appear similar to
constrictive pericarditis
. Cardiac catheterization may help confirm the diagnosis. Rarely, a
biopsy of the heart
may be required.
Treatment
The condition causing the cardiomyopathy is treated when it can be found.
Few treatments are known to work well for restrictive cardiomyopathy. The main goal of treatment is to control symptoms and improve quality of life.
The following treatments may be used to control symptoms or prevent problems:
Blood thinning medicines
Chemotherapy (in some situations)
Diuretics to remove fluid and help improve breathing
Medicines to prevent or control abnormal heart rhythms
Other treatments that may be used depending on the specific type of cardiomyopathy include:
Chemotherapeutic agents
Medicines such as tafamidis that target abnormal proteins (amyloid fibrils)Â
Liver transplantationÂ
Additional treatments are also under investigation.
A
heart transplant
may be considered if the heart function is very poor and symptoms are severe.
Outlook (Prognosis)
People with this condition often develop heart failure that gets worse. Problems with heart rhythm or "leaky" heart valves may also occur.
People with restrictive cardiomyopathy may be heart transplant candidates. The outlook depends on the cause of the condition, but it is usually poor. Survival after diagnosis may exceed 10 years.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you have symptoms of restrictive cardiomyopathy.
