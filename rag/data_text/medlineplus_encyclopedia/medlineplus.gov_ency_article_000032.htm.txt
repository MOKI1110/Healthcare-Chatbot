Marine animal stings or bites
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Marine animal stings or bites refer to venomous bites or stings from any form of sea life, including jellyfish.
There are about 1200 species of animals found in the ocean that are venomous. Many can cause serious illness or death.
The number of injuries caused by these animals has gone up in recent years because more people are taking part in scuba diving, snorkeling, surfing, and other water sports. These animals are most often not aggressive. Many are anchored to the ocean floor. Venomous marine animals in the United States are most often found along the California, Gulf of Mexico, and southern Atlantic coasts.

First Aid
Follow these steps to provide first aid:
Wear gloves, if possible, when removing stingers.
Brush off tentacles and stingers with a credit card or similar object if possible.
If you do not have a card, you can gently wipe off stingers or tentacles with a towel. Do not rub the area roughly.
Wash the area with salt water.
Soak the
wound
in hot water no hotter than 113Â°F (45Â°C) for 30 to 90 minutes, if told to do so by trained personnel. Always test water temperature before applying it to a child.
Box jellyfish stings should be immediately rinsed with vinegar.
Fish stings and stings by Portuguese man-of-war should be immediately rinsed with hot water.
DO NOT
Follow these cautions:
Do not attempt to remove stingers without protecting your own hands.
Do not raise the affected body part above the level of the heart.
Do not allow the person to exercise.
Do not give any medicine, unless told to do so by your health care provider.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Seek medical help (call 911 or the local emergency number) if the person has difficulty breathing, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, or uncontrolled bleeding; if the sting site develops swelling or discoloration, or for other bodywide (generalized) symptoms.
Some bites and stings can result in serious tissue damage. This may require specialized wound management and surgery. It may also cause significant scarring.
Prevention
Things you can do to prevent a marine animal sting or bite include:
Swim in an area patrolled by a lifeguard.
Observe posted signs that may warn of danger from jellyfish or other hazardous marine life.
Do not touch unfamiliar marine life. Even dead animals or severed tentacles may contain poisonous venom.
If wading in water where stingrays are known to live, keep your feet on the bottom and shuffle them as you move forward.
Wear a protective suit.
