Cardiogenic shock

Cardiogenic shock takes place when the heart is unable to supply enough blood and oxygen to the organs of the body.
Causes
The most common causes of cardiogenic shock are serious heart conditions. Many of these occur during or after a
heart attack
(myocardial infarction). These complications include:
A large section of heart muscle that no longer moves well or does not move at all
Breaking open (rupture) of the heart muscle due to damage from the heart attack
Dangerous heart rhythms, such as
ventricular tachycardia
,
ventricular fibrillation
, or
supraventricular tachycardia
Pressure on the heart due to a buildup of fluid around it (pericardial tamponade)
Tear or rupture of the muscles or tendons that support the heart valves, especially the mitral valve
Tear or rupture of the wall (septum) between the left and right ventricles (lower heart chambers)
Very slow heart rhythm (bradycardia) or problem with the electrical system of the heart (heart block)
Cardiogenic shock occurs when the heart is unable to supply as much blood as the body needs. It can happen even if there hasn't been a heart attack. For example, if one of these problems listed above occurs and your heart function drops suddenly. Or if a valve becomes obstructed or if a combination of problems occurs.
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Chest pain or pressure
Coma
Decreased urination
Fast breathing
Fast pulse
Heavy sweating
, moist skin
Lightheadedness
Loss of alertness and ability to concentrate
Restlessness,
agitation
,
confusion
Shortness of breath
Skin that feels cool to the touch
Pale skin color or blotchy skin
Weak (thready) pulse
Exams and Tests
An exam will show:
Low blood pressure (most often less than 90 mmHg systolic [the first number])
Blood pressure that drops more than 10 points when you stand up after lying down (orthostatic hypotension)
Weak (thready) pulse
Cold and clammy skin
To diagnose cardiogenic shock, a catheter (tube) may be placed in the lung artery (
right heart catheterization
). Tests may show that blood is backing up into the lungs and the heart is not pumping well.
Tests include:
Cardiac catheterization
Chest x-ray
Coronary angiography
Echocardiogram
Electrocardiogram
Nuclear scan of the heart
Other tests may be done to find out why the heart is not working properly.
Lab tests include:
Arterial blood gas
Blood chemistry
(
chem-7
,
chem-20
,
electrolytes
, lactic acid level)
Cardiac enzymes (troponin, CKMB)
Complete blood count
(CBC)
Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH)
Treatment
Cardiogenic shock is a medical emergency. You will need to stay in the hospital, most often in the Intensive or Coronary Care Unit (ICU). The goal of treatment is to find and treat the cause of shock to save your life.
You may need medicines to increase blood pressure and improve heart function, including:
Dobutamine
Dopamine
Epinephrine
Levosimendan
Milrinone
Norepinephrine
Vasopressin
These medicines may help in the short-term. They are not often used for a long time.
When a heart rhythm disturbance (dysrhythmia) is serious, urgent treatment may be needed to restore a normal heart rhythm. This may include:
Electrical "shock" therapy (defibrillation or cardioversion)
Implanting a temporary pacemaker
Medicines given through a vein (IV)
You may also receive:
Pain medicine
Oxygen
Fluids, blood, and blood products through a vein (IV)
Other treatments for shock may include:
Cardiac catheterization
with
coronary angioplasty and stenting
Heart monitoring to guide treatment
Heart surgery (
coronary artery bypass surgery
,
heart valve replacement
, left
ventricular assist device
)
Intra-aortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP) to help the heart work better
Pacemaker
Ventricular assist device or other mechanical support
Outlook (Prognosis)
In the past, the death rate from cardiogenic shock ranged from 80% to 90%. In more recent studies, this rate has decreased to 50% to 75%.
When cardiogenic shock is not treated, the outlook is very poor.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Brain damage
Kidney damage
Liver damage
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have symptoms of cardiogenic shock. Cardiogenic shock is a medical emergency.
Prevention
You may reduce the risk for developing cardiogenic shock by:
Quickly treating its cause (such as heart attack or heart valve problem)
Preventing and treating the risk factors for heart disease, such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and triglycerides, or tobacco use
