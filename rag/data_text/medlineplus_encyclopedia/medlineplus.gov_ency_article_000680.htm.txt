Meningitis

Meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. This covering is called the meninges.
Causes
The most common causes of meningitis are viral infections. These infections usually get better without treatment. Bacterial meningitis infections, however, are very serious. They may result in death or brain damage, even if treated. A
lumbar puncture
(or spinal tap) is required to determine the specific cause.
Meningitis may also be caused by:
Chemical irritation
Medicine allergies
Fungi
Parasites
Tumors
Many types of viruses can cause meningitis:
Enteroviruses: These are viruses that also can cause intestinal illness.
Herpes viruses: These are the same viruses that can cause
cold sores
and
genital herpes
. However, people with cold sores or genital herpes do not have a higher chance of developing herpes meningitis.
HIV: This virus can cause meningitis during the early stages of HIV infection.
Mumps virus
: This virus causes a contagious disease that leads to painful swelling of the salivary glands. Meningitis is a complication of a mumps infection.
West Nile virus
: This virus is spread by mosquito bites and is an important cause of viral meningitis in most of the United States.
Symptoms
Enteroviral meningitis occurs more often than bacterial meningitis and is milder. It usually occurs in the late summer and early fall. It most often affects children and adults under age 30. Symptoms may include:
Headache
Sensitivity to light (
photophobia
)
Slight fever
Upset stomach and diarrhea
Fatigue
Bacterial meningitis is an emergency. You will need immediate treatment in a hospital. Symptoms usually come on quickly, and may include:
Fever and chills
Mental status changes
Nausea and vomiting
Sensitivity to light
Severe headache
Stiff neck
Other symptoms that can occur with this disease:
Agitation
Bulging fontanelles
in babies
Decreased alertness
Poor feeding or irritability in children
Rapid breathing
Unusual posture, with the head and neck arched backward (
opisthotonos
)
You cannot tell if you have bacterial or viral meningitis by how you feel. Your health care provider must find out the cause. Go to a hospital emergency department right away if you think you have symptoms of meningitis.
Exams and Tests
Your provider will examine you. This may show:
Fast heart rate
Fever
Mental status changes
Stiff neck
If your provider thinks you have meningitis, a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) should be done to remove a sample of spinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF) for testing.
Other tests that may be done include:
Blood culture
Chest x-ray
CT scan of the head
Treatment
Antibiotics are used to treat bacterial meningitis. Antibiotics do not treat viral meningitis. However, antiviral medicine may be given to those with herpes meningitis.
Other treatments will include:
Fluids through a vein (
intravenous
)
Medicines to treat symptoms, such as brain swelling,
shock
, and
seizures
Outlook (Prognosis)
Early diagnosis and treatment of bacterial meningitis is essential to prevent permanent neurological damage. Viral meningitis is usually not serious, and symptoms should disappear within 2 weeks with no lasting complications.
Possible Complications
Without prompt treatment, meningitis may result in the following:
Brain or neurologic damage
Buildup of fluid between the skull and brain (
subdural effusion
)
Hearing loss
Buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling (
hydrocephalus
)
Seizures
Death
When to Contact a Medical Professional
If you think that you or your child has symptoms of meningitis, get emergency medical help immediately. Early treatment is key to a good outcome.
Prevention
Certain vaccines can help prevent some types of bacterial meningitis:
Haemophilus vaccine (
HiB vaccine
) is given to children.
Pneumococcal vaccine is given to
children
and
adults
.
Meningococcal vaccine is given to
children and adults
; some communities hold vaccination campaigns after an outbreak of meningococcal meningitis.
Household members and others in close contact with people who have meningococcal meningitis should receive antibiotics to prevent becoming infected.
