Uterine artery embolization (UAE) is a procedure to treat
fibroids
without surgery. Uterine fibroids are noncancerous (benign) tumors that develop in the uterus (womb).
During the procedure, the blood supply to the fibroids is cut off. This typically causes the fibroids to shrink.
Description
UAE is done by a specially trained doctor called an interventional radiologist.
You will be awake, but you will not feel pain. This is called conscious sedation. The procedure takes about 30 to 90 minutes.
The procedure is usually done this way:
You receive a sedative. This is medicine that makes you relaxed and sleepy.
A local painkiller (anesthetic) is applied to the skin around your groin or wrist. This numbs the area so you do not feel pain.
The radiologist makes a tiny cut (incision) in your skin. A thin tube (catheter) is inserted into your femoral artery. This artery is at the top of your leg.
The doctor threads the catheter into your uterine artery. This artery supplies blood to the uterus.
Small plastic or gelatin particles are injected through the catheter into the blood vessels that supply blood to the fibroids. These particles block the blood supply to the tiny arteries that carry blood to the fibroids. Without this blood supply, the fibroids shrink and die.
UAE is done in both your left and right uterine arteries through the same incision. Multiple fibroids can be treated.
Why the Procedure is Performed
UAE is an effective way to treat symptoms caused by fibroids. Discuss with your health care provider whether this procedure is likely to be successful for you.
Women who benefit from UAE may:
Have symptoms of fibroids including bleeding and low red blood count (anemia). In some cases, it may help with pelvic pain or pressure, and waking up at night to urinate.
Have already tried medicines or hormones to reduce symptoms
Sometimes have UAE after childbirth to treat very heavy vaginal bleeding
Risks
UAE is generally safe.
Risks of any invasive procedure are:
Bleeding
A bad
reaction
to the anesthetic or medicine that is used
Infection of the uterus
Bruising
Risks of UAE are:
Injury to an artery or to the uterus.
Failure to shrink the fibroids or effectively treat the symptoms.
Possible problems with a future pregnancy. Women who want to become pregnant should carefully discuss this procedure with their provider, since it may reduce the chances of a successful pregnancy.
Lack of menstrual periods.
Problems with ovarian function or premature menopause.
Failure to diagnose and remove a rare type of cancer that can grow in fibroids (leiomyosarcoma). Most fibroids are noncancerous (benign), but leiomyosarcomas occur in a small number of fibroids. Embolization will not treat or diagnose this condition.
Before the Procedure
You will have various medical tests, including a pelvic ultrasound, an MRI, and a sampling of the lining of your uterus.
Tell your provider and radiologist or nurse if:
You are or could be pregnant.
You are taking any medicines, including medicines, drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.
You have been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 or 2 drinks a day.
Planning for your surgery:
If you have
diabetes
,
heart disease
, or other medical conditions, your radiologist may ask you to see the provider who treats you for these conditions.
If you smoke, it's important to cut back or quit.
Smoking can slow healing and increase the risk of blood clots
. Ask your provider for help
quitting smoking
.
If needed,
prepare your home
to make it easier to recover after surgery.
Ask your radiologist if you need to arrange to have someone drive you home after your procedure.
During the week before your procedure:
You may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.
Ask your radiologist which medicines you should still take on the day of your procedure.
Let your radiologist know about any illness you may have before your surgery. This includes
COVID-19
, a
cold
,
flu
, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness. If you do get sick, your procedure may need to be postponed.
On the day of UAE:
Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.
Take the medicines your radiologist told you to take with a small sip of water.
Arrive at the hospital on time.
After the Procedure
You may stay in the hospital overnight. Or you may go home the same day.
You will receive pain medicine. You will be instructed to lie flat for 4 to 6 hours after the procedure.
Follow any other instructions about taking care of yourself after you go home.
Moderate to severe abdominal and pelvic cramps are common for the first 24 hours after the procedure. They may last for a few days to 2 weeks. Cramps may be severe and may last more than 6 hours at a time.
Most women recover quickly and are able to return to normal activities within 7 to 10 days. Sometimes portions of the treated fibroid tissue may pass through your vagina.
Outlook (Prognosis)
UAE works well to decrease pain, pressure, and bleeding from fibroids in most women who have the procedure.
UAE is less invasive than surgical treatments for uterine fibroids. Many women may return more quickly to activities than after surgery.
Similar to a myomectomy or any procedure where the uterus is not removed, there is a small risk of recurrence of bleeding from fibroids. If this occurs, the symptoms can be treated with
hysterectomy
(surgery to remove the uterus), myomectomy (surgery to remove the fibroid), or repeating the UAE.
