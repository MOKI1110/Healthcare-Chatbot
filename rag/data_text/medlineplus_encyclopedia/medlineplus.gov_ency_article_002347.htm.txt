The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine. It is located between the stomach and the middle part of the small intestine, or jejunum.
After foods mix with
stomach acid
, they move into the duodenum, where they mix with
bile
from the gallbladder and digestive juices from the pancreas.
The absorption of vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients begins in the duodenum.
