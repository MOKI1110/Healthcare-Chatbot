Pierre Robin sequence is a condition in which an infant has a smaller than normal lower jaw, a tongue that falls back in the throat, and difficulty breathing. It is present at birth.
Causes
The exact causes of Pierre Robin sequence are unknown. It may be part of many genetic syndromes.
The lower jaw develops slowly before birth, but may grow faster during the first few years of life.
Symptoms
Symptoms of this condition include:
Cleft palate
High-arched palate
Jaw that is very small with a small chin
Jaw that is far back in the throat
Repeated ear infections
Small opening in the roof of the mouth, whichÂ may cause choking or liquids coming back out through the nose
Teeth that appear when the baby is born
Tongue that is large compared to the jaw
Exams and Tests
A health care provider can often diagnose this condition during a physical exam. Consulting with a genetic specialist can rule out other problems linked to this condition.
Treatment
Talk to your child's provider about safe sleeping positions. Some infants with Pierre-Robin sequence need to sleep on their stomachs instead of their back to prevent their tongue from falling back into their airway. This is different than the usual sleeping recommendations for infants.
In moderate cases, the child will need to have a tube placed through the nose and into the airway to avoid airway blockage. In severe cases, surgery is needed to prevent a blockage in the upper airway. Some children need surgery to make a hole in their airway or to move their jaw forward.
Feeding must be done very carefully to avoid choking and breathing liquids into the airways. The child may need to be fed through a tube to prevent choking.

Outlook (Prognosis)
Choking and feeding problems may go away on their own over the first few years as the lower jaw grows to a more normal size. There is a high risk for problems if the child's airways are not kept from getting blocked.
Possible Complications
These complications can occur:
Breathing difficulties, especially when the child sleeps
Choking episodes
Congestive heart failure
Death
Feeding difficulties
Low blood oxygen and brain damage (due to difficulty breathing)
Type of high blood pressure called pulmonary hypertension
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Babies born with this condition are often diagnosed at birth.
Contact your provider if your child has choking episodes or breathing problems. A blockage of the airways may cause a high-pitched noise when the child breathes in. It can also lead to blueness of the skin (cyanosis).
Also contact your provider if your child has other breathing problems.
Prevention
There is no known prevention. Treatment may reduce breathing problems and choking.
