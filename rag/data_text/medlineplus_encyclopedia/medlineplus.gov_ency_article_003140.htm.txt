Frequent urination means needing to urinate more often than usual. Urgent urination is a sudden, strong need to urinate. This causes a discomfort in your bladder. Urgent urination makes it difficult to delay using the toilet.
A frequent need to urinate at night is called
nocturia
. Most people can sleep for 6 to 8 hours without having to urinate.
Causes
Common causes of these symptoms are:
Urinary tract infection
(UTI)
Enlarged prostate
in middle-aged and older men
Swelling and infection of the urethra
Vaginitis (swelling of or discharge from the vulva and vagina)
Nerve related problems
Caffeine intake
Less common causes include:
Alcohol use
Anxiety
Bladder cancer
(not common)
Spine problems
Diabetes that is not well controlled
Pregnancy
Interstitial cystitis
Medicines such as water pills (diuretics)
Overactive bladder syndrome
Radiation therapy to the pelvis, which is used to treat certain cancers
Stroke and other brain or nervous system diseases
Tumor or growth in the pelvis
Home Care
Follow the advice of your health care provider to diagnose and treat the cause of the problem.
It may help to write down the times when you urinate and the amount of urine you produce. Bring this record to your visit with the provider. This is called a voiding diary.
In some cases, you may have problems controlling urine (
incontinence
) for a period of time. You may need to take steps to protect your clothing and bedding.
For nighttime urination, avoid drinking too much fluid before going to bed. Cut down on the amount of liquids you drink that contain alcohol or caffeine.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider right away if:
You have fever, back or side pain, vomiting, or shaking chills
You have increased thirst or appetite, fatigue, or sudden weight loss
Also contact your provider if:
You have urinary frequency or urgency, but you are not pregnant and you are not drinking large amounts of fluid.
You have incontinence or you have changed your lifestyle because of your symptoms.
You have bloody or cloudy urine.
There is a discharge from the penis or vagina.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will take a medical history and do a physical exam.
Tests that may be done include:
Urinalysis
Urine culture
Cystometry
or urodynamic testing (a measurement of the pressure within the bladder and the flow of urine)
Cystoscopy
Nervous system tests (for some urgency problems)
Ultrasound
(such as an
abdominal ultrasound
or a
pelvic ultrasound
)
Treatment depends on the cause of the urgency and frequency. You may need to take antibiotics and medicine to ease your discomfort.
