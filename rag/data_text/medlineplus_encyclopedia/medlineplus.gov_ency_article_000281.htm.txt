Alcoholic liver disease is damage to the liver and its function due to
alcohol abuse
.
Causes
Alcoholic liver disease most often occurs after years of heavy drinking. Over time, scarring and
cirrhosis
can occur. Cirrhosis is the final phase of alcoholic liver disease.
Alcoholic liver disease does not occur in all heavy drinkers. The chances of getting liver disease go up the longer you have been drinking and more alcohol you consume. You do not have to get drunk for the disease to happen.
The disease is most common in people between 40 and 50 years of age. Men are more likely to have this problem. However, women may develop the disease after less exposure to alcohol than men. Some people may have an inherited risk for the disease.
Symptoms
There may be no symptoms, or symptoms may come on slowly. This depends on how well the liver is working. Symptoms tend to be worse after a period of heavy drinking.
Early symptoms include:
Loss of energy
Poor appetite and weight loss
Nausea
Belly pain
Small, red spider-like blood vessels on the skin
As liver function worsens, symptoms may include:
Fluid buildup of the legs (edema) and in the abdomen (
ascites
)
Yellow color in the skin, mucous membranes, or eyes (
jaundice
)
Redness on the palms of the hands
In men, impotence, shrinking of the testicles, and breast swelling
Easy bruising and abnormal bleeding
Confusion or problems thinking
Pale or clay-colored stools
Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will do a physical exam to look for:
An enlarged liver or spleen
Excess breast tissue in men
Swollen abdomen, as a result of too much fluid
Reddened palms
Red spider-like blood vessels on the skin
Small testicles
Widened veins in the wall of the abdomen
Yellow eyes or skin (jaundice)
Tests you may have include:
Complete blood count (CBC)
Liver function tests
Coagulation studies
Liver biopsy
Tests to rule out other diseases include:
Abdominal CT scan
Blood tests for other causes of liver disease
Ultrasound of the abdomen
Ultrasound elastography
Treatment
LIFESTYLE CHANGES
Some things you can do to help take care of your liver disease are:
Stop drinking alcohol.
Eat a healthy diet that is low in salt.
Get vaccinated for diseases such as influenza, hepatitis A and hepatitis B, and pneumococcal pneumonia.
Talk to your provider about all medicines you take, including herbs and supplements and over-the-counter medicines.
MEDICINES FROM YOUR DOCTOR
"Water pills" (diuretics) to get rid of fluid buildup
Vitamin K or blood products to prevent excess bleeding
Medicines for mental confusion
Antibiotics for infections
OTHER TREATMENTS
Endoscopic treatments for enlarged veins in the esophagus (esophageal varices)
Removal of fluid from the abdomen (paracentesis)
Placement of a
transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
(TIPS) to repair blood flow in the liver
When cirrhosis progresses to end-stage liver disease, a
liver transplant
may be needed. Liver transplantation for alcoholic liver disease is only considered in people who have completely avoided alcohol for 6 months.
Support Groups
More information and support for people with alcoholic liver disease and their families can be found by joining support groups for
alcoholism
or

Outlook (Prognosis)
Alcoholic liver disease is treatable if it is caught before it causes severe damage. However, continued excessive drinking can shorten your lifespan.
Cirrhosis further worsens the condition and can lead to serious complications. In case of severe damage, the liver cannot heal or return to normal function.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Bleeding disorders (coagulopathy)
Buildup of fluid in the abdomen (ascites) and infection of the fluid (spontaneous bacterial peritonitis - SBP)
Enlarged veins in the esophagus, stomach, or intestines that bleed easily (esophageal varices)
Increased pressure in the blood vessels of the liver (portal hypertension)
Kidney failure (hepatorenal syndrome)
Liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma)
Mental confusion, change in the level of consciousness, or coma (
hepatic encephalopathy
)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you:
Develop symptoms of alcoholic liver disease
Develop symptoms after a long period of heavy drinking
Are worried that drinking may be harming your health
Get emergency medical help right away if you have:
Abdominal or chest pain
Abdominal swelling or ascites that is new or suddenly becomes worse
A fever (temperature greater than 101Â°F, or 38.3Â°C)
Diarrhea
New confusion or a change in alertness, or it gets worse
Rectal bleeding, vomiting blood, or blood in the urine
Shortness of breath
Vomiting more than once a day
Yellowing skin or eyes (jaundice) that is new or gets worse quickly
Prevention
Talk openly to your provider about your alcohol intake. The provider can counsel you about how much alcohol is safe for you.
