A denture is a removable plate or frame that can replace missing teeth. It can be made up of plastic or a combination of metal and plastic.
You can have full or partial dentures, depending on the number of missing teeth.
Information
Ill-fitting dentures can cause discomfort or irritation by moving. These are called sore spots. Denture adhesive may help cut down on this movement. Dental implants may be recommended in most cases. Implants help stabilize the denture, minimize their movement and prevent sores. They should only be placed by a well-trained dentist skilled in dental implant placement.
See a dentist if your dentures do not fit correctly. They may need to be adjusted or relined.
Other denture tips:
Scrub your dentures with plain soap and lukewarm water after eating. Do not clean them with toothpaste or mouthwash.
Take out your dentures overnight to prevent sores, infections, and inflammation.
Keep your dentures in a denture cleaner overnight.
Clean, rest, and massage your gums regularly. Rinse daily with lukewarm salt water to help clean your gums.
Do not use toothpicks when wearing dentures.
