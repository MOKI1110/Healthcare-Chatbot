Factor IX assay

The factor IX assay is a blood test that measures the activity of factor IX. This is one of the proteins in the body that helps the blood clot.
How the Test is Performed
A
blood sample
is needed.
How to Prepare for the Test
You may need to stop taking some medicines before this test. Your health care provider will tell you which ones.
How the Test will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.
Why the Test is Performed
This test is used to find the cause of too much bleeding (decreased blood clotting). Or, it may be ordered if a family member is known to have
hemophilia B
. The test may also be done to see how well treatment for hemophilia B is working.
Normal Results
A normal value is 50% to 200% of the lab control or reference value.
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Decreased factor IX activity may be related to:
Hemophilia B
(a bleeding disorder caused by a lack of blood clotting factor IX)
Disorder in which the proteins that regulate blood clotting become overactive (
disseminated intravascular coagulation
)
Fat
malabsorption
(not absorbing enough fat from your diet)
Liver disease
(such as
cirrhosis
)
Vitamin K
deficiency
Taking certain blood thinners
Risks
There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:
Excessive bleeding
Fainting or feeling lightheaded
Multiple punctures to locate veins
Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
This test is most often done on people who have
bleeding problems
. The risk of excessive bleeding is slightly more than for people without bleeding problems.
