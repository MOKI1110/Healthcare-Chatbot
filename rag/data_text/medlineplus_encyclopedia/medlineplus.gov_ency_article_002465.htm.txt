A vegetarian diet does not include any meat, poultry, or seafood. It is a meal plan made up of foods that come mostly from plants. These include:
Vegetables
Fruits
Whole grains
Legumes
Seeds
Nuts
May include eggs and/or milk if lacto-ovo vegetarian
A vegetarian diet contains no animal proteins (unless lacto-vegetarian or lacto-ovo vegetarian). A semi-vegetarian diet is a meal plan that contains little animal protein, but mostly plant-based foods. Vegetarians do not eat:
Fowl
Seafood
Beef
Pork
Lamb
Other animal meats, such as bison, or exotic meats like ostrich or alligator
Vegetarians also do not eat products containing gelatin or rennin (an enzyme found in calf's stomachs that is used to produce many cheeses).
Here are the different types of vegetarian diets:
Vegan: Includes only plant-based foods. No animal proteins or animal by-products such as eggs, milk, or honey.
Lacto-vegetarian: Includes plant foods plus some or all dairy products.
Lacto-ovo vegetarian: Includes plant foods, dairy products, and eggs.
Semi- or partial vegetarian: Includes plant foods and may include chicken or fish, dairy products, and eggs. It does not include red meat.
Pescatarian: Includes plant foods and seafood.

Food Sources
PLAN TO GET PLENTY OF NUTRIENTS
If you follow a vegetarian diet, you need to make sure you get proper nutrition. You need to eat a variety of foods to get all the calories and nutrients needed for growth and good health. Certain groups of people may need to plan carefully, such as:
Young children and teens
Pregnant or breastfeeding women
Older adults
People with cancer and some chronic illnesses
Vegetarian diets that include some dairy products and eggs have all the nutrition you need. But the more restrictive your diet, the harder it can be to get certain nutrients.
If you choose to avoid most or all animal foods, pay close attention to make sure you get all of the following nutrients.
Vitamin B12
: You need this vitamin to help prevent anemia and have normal nerve function. Eggs and dairy foods have the most B12, so people who follow a vegan diet may have a hard time getting enough. You can get B12 from these foods:
Eggs
Milk, yogurt, low-fat cheese, cottage cheese, and other dairy products
Foods that have B12 added to them (fortified), such as cereal and soy products
Nutritional yeast
Seafood such as clams, salmon, and tuna (this only applies to those who follow a pescetarian or semi-vegetarian diet)
Vitamin D
: You need this vitamin for bone health. You can get vitamin D from sun exposure. But you should limit sun exposure due to skin cancer concerns. Depending on where you live and other factors, you most likely will not be able to get enough from sun exposure. You can get vitamin D from these foods:
Fatty fish, such as sardines, salmon, and mackerel (this only applies to those who follow a pescetarian or semi-vegetarian diet)
Egg yolks
Foods that are fortified with vitamin D, such as orange juice, cow's milk, soy milk, rice milk, and cereals
Zinc
: Zinc is important for the immune system and cell growth, especially in teens. Your body does not absorb zinc from plant foods as well as from meat and other animal foods. You can get zinc from these foods:
Beans and legumes, such as chickpeas, kidney beans, and baked beans
Nuts and seeds, such as almonds, peanuts, and cashews
Seafood, such as oysters, crab, and lobster (this only applies to those who follow a pescetarian or semi-vegetarian diet)
Yogurt and cheese
Foods fortified with zinc, such as milk and cereals
Iron
: You need iron for your red blood cells. Your body does not absorb the type of iron found from plant foods as well as from the type found in meat and other animal foods. You can get iron from these foods:
Beans and legumes, such as white beans, lentils, and kidney beans
Green vegetables, such as broccoli, spinach, kale, and collard greens
Dried fruit, such as prunes, raisins, and apricots
Whole grains
Foods fortified with iron, such as cereals and breads
Eating foods that are high in vitamin C at the same meal as iron-rich foods increase iron absorption. Vitamin C helps the body absorb iron. Foods high in vitamin C include, tomatoes, potatoes, citrus fruits, bell peppers, and strawberries.
Calcium
: Foods high in calcium help keep bones strong. Dairy products have the highest amount of calcium. If you do not eat dairy, it can be hard to get enough. Oxalates, a substance found in plant foods inhibits calcium absorption. Foods that are high in both oxalates and calcium are not good sources of calcium. Examples include, spinach, Swiss chard, and beet greens.
You can get calcium from these foods:
Sardines and canned salmon with bones (this only applies to those who follow a pescetarian or semi-vegetarian diet)
Dairy products, such as milk, yogurt, cottage cheese, and cheese
Green vegetables, such as collard greens, kale, bok choy, and broccoli
Oranges and figs
Tofu
Almonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, tahini, and white beans
Foods fortified with calcium, such as cereal, orange juice, and soy, almond and rice milk
Omega-3 fatty acids
: Omega-3s may be important for your heart and brain health. You can get omega-3s from these foods:
Fatty fish, such as halibut, mackerel, salmon, herring, and sardines (this only applies to those who follow a pescetarian or semi-vegetarian diet)
Nuts and seeds, such as walnuts, pumpkin seeds, ground flaxseed, canola oil, chia seeds
Soybeans and soy oil
Foods fortified with omega-3s, such as bread, eggs, juice, and milk
Protein
: It is easy to get plenty of protein even if you do not eat any animal products. If you eat fish and/or eggs and dairy getting enough protein will not be a concern for most people. You can also get protein from these foods:
Soy foods, such as soy nuts, soy milk, tempeh and tofu.
Seitan (made of gluten).
Vegetarian meat substitutes. Just watch for products that are high in sodium.
Legumes, beans, and lentils.
Nuts, nut butters, seeds, and whole grains.
Dairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cottage cheese.
You do not need to combine these foods at the same meal to get enough protein.
Teens and pregnant women should work with a registered dietitian to make sure they are getting enough protein and other key nutrients.

DIETARY TIPS FOR VEGETARIANS
When following a vegetarian diet, keep in mind the following:
Eat different kinds of foods, including vegetables, fruits, beans, nuts, seeds, whole grains, and low-fat or fat-free dairy and eggs if your diet includes these.
Choose fortified foods, such as cereals, breads, soy or almond milk, and fruits juices to get a full range of nutrients.
Limit foods that are high in sugar, salt (sodium), and fat.
Include a protein source with all meals.
If your diet lacks certain vitamins and minerals, take supplements.
Learn to read the Nutrition Facts Label on food packages. The label tells you the ingredients and nutrition contents of the food product.
If you follow a more restrictive diet, you may want to work with a dietitian to make sure you are getting enough nutrients.
