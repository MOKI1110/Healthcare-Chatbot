Liver metastases refer to cancer that has spread to the liver from somewhere else in the body.
Liver metastases are not the same as cancer that starts in the liver, which is called
hepatocellular carcinoma
.
Causes
Almost all types of cancer can spread to the liver. Cancers that often spread to the liver include:
Breast cancer
Colorectal cancer
Esophageal cancer
Lung cancer
Melanoma
Pancreatic cancer
Stomach cancer
The risk for cancer spreading to the liver depends on the location (site) of the original cancer. A liver metastasis may be present when the original (primary) cancer is diagnosed or it may occur months or years after the primary tumor is removed.
Symptoms
In some cases, there are no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include:
Decreased appetite
Confusion
Fever, sweating
Jaundice
(yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)
Nausea
Pain, often in the upper right part of the abdomen
Weight loss
Exams and Tests
Tests that may be done to diagnose liver metastases include:
CT scan
of the abdomen
Liver function tests
Liver biopsy
MRI of the abdomen
PET scan
Ultrasound
of the abdomen
Treatment
Treatment depends on:
The primary cancer site
How many liver tumors you have and their location in the liver
Whether the cancer has spread to other organs
Your overall health
Types of treatments that may be used are described below.
SURGERY
When the tumor is only in one or a few areas of the liver, it may be removed with surgery.
CHEMOTHERAPY
When the cancer has spread to the liver and other organs, whole-body (systemic)
chemotherapy
is usually used. The type of chemotherapy used depends on the original type of cancer.
When the cancer has only spread to the liver, systemic chemotherapy may still be used.
Chemoembolization is a type of chemotherapy to one area. A thin tube called a catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin. The catheter is threaded into an artery in the liver. Cancer-killing medicine is sent through the catheter. Then another medicine is sent through the catheter to block blood flow to the part of the liver with the tumor. This "starves" the cancer cells.
OTHER TREATMENTS
Alcohol (ethanol) injected into the liver tumor -- A needle is sent through the skin directly into the liver tumor. The alcohol kills cancer cells.
Heat, using radio or microwave energy -- A large needle called a probe is placed into the center of the liver tumor. Energy is sent through thin wires called electrodes, which are attached to the probe. The cancer cells are heated and die. This method is called radiofrequency ablation when radio energy is used. It is called microwave ablation when microwave energy is used.
Freezing, also called cryotherapy -- A probe is placed in contact with the tumor. A chemical is sent through the probe that causes ice crystals to form around the probe. The cancer cells are frozen and die.
Radioactive beads/spheres -- These beads/spheres deliver radiation to kill the cancer cells.
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well you do depends on the location of the original cancer and how much it has spread to the liver or anywhere else. In rare cases, surgery to remove the liver tumors leads to a cure. This is usually only possible when there are a limited number of tumors in the liver.
In most cases, cancer that has spread to the liver cannot be cured. People whose cancer has spread to the liver often die of their disease. However, treatments may help shrink tumors, improve life expectancy, and relieve symptoms.
Possible Complications
Complications are often the result of tumors spreading to a large area of the liver.
They can include:
Blockage of the flow of
bile
Decreased appetite
Fever
Liver failure (usually only in the late stages of disease)
Pain
Weight loss
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Anyone who has had a type of cancer that can spread to the liver should be aware of the signs and symptoms listed above, and contact their health care provider if any of these develop.
Prevention
Early detection of some types of cancer may prevent the spread of these cancers to the liver.
Alternative Names
Metastases to the liver; Metastatic liver cancer; Liver cancer - metastatic; Colorectal cancer - liver metastases; Colon cancer - liver metastases; Esophageal cancer - liver metastases; Lung cancer - liver metastases; Melanoma - liver metastases
