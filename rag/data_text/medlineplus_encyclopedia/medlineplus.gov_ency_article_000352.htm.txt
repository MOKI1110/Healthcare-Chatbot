Anaplastic thyroid carcinoma is a rare and aggressive form of cancer of the thyroid gland.
Causes
Anaplastic thyroid cancer is an invasive type of
thyroid cancer
that grows very rapidly. It occurs most often in people over age 60. It is more common in females than in males. The cause is unknown.
Anaplastic cancer accounts for only about less than 1% of all thyroid cancers in the United States.
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Cough
Coughing up blood
Difficulty swallowing
Hoarseness or changing voice
Loud breathing
Lower neck lump, which often grows quickly
Pain in the neck
Vocal cord paralysis
Overactive thyroid (
hyperthyroidism
)
Exams and Tests
A physical exam almost always shows a growth in the neck region. Other exams may include:
An
MRI
or
CT scan
of the neck may show a tumor growing from the thyroid gland.
A thyroid
biopsy
makes the diagnosis. The tumor tissue can be checked for genetic markers that may suggest targets for treatment, preferably within a clinical trial.
An examination of the airway with a fiberoptic scope (
laryngoscopy
) may show a paralyzed vocal cord.
A
thyroid scan
shows this growth to be "cold," meaning it does not absorb a radioactive substance.
Thyroid function blood tests are normal in most cases.
Treatment
This type of cancer cannot be cured by surgery.
Surgery combined with radiation therapy and chemotherapy may have a significant benefit.
Surgery to place a tube in the throat to help with breathing
(tracheostomy
) or in the stomach to help with eating (gastrostomy) may be needed during treatment.
For some people, enrolling in a clinical trial of new thyroid cancer treatments based on the genetic changes in the tumor may be an option.
The presence of a mutation in the BRAF gene is treatable with targeted medicines and may improve outcomes.
Support Groups
You can often ease the stress of illness by joining a support group of people sharing common experiences and problems.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outlook with this disease is poor. Most people do not survive longer than 6 months because the disease is aggressive and there is a lack of effective treatment options.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Spread of tumor within the neck
Metastasis
(spread) of cancer to other body tissues or organs
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you notice:
A persistent lump or mass in the neck
Hoarseness or changes in your voice
Cough or coughing up blood
