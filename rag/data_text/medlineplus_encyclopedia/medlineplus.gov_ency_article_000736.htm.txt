Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome is an eye problem that is similar to
conjunctivitis
("pink eye"). It most often affects only one eye. It occurs with
swollen lymph nodes
and an illness with a fever.
Note
: Parinaud syndrome (also called upgaze paresis) is a different disorder in which you have trouble looking upward. The latter can be caused by a brain tumor, and requires an evaluation by your health care provider very promptly.Â
Causes
Parinaud oculoglandular syndrome (POS) is caused by an infection with bacteria, a virus, fungus, or parasite.
The most common causes are
cat scratch disease
and
tularemia
(rabbit fever). The bacteria that cause either condition can infect the eye. The bacteria can directly enter the eye (on a finger or other object), or air droplets that carry the bacteria can land on the eye.
Other infectious diseases may spread the same way, or through the bloodstream to the eye.
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Red, irritated, and painful eye (looks like "pink eye")
Fever
General ill feeling
Increased tearing (possible)
Swelling of nearby lymph glands (often in front of the ear)
Exams and Tests
An exam shows:
Fever and other signs of illness
Red, tender, inflamed eye
Tender lymph nodes may be present in front of the ear
There may be growths (conjunctival nodules) on the inside of the eyelid or the white of the eye
Blood tests will be done to check for infection. The
white blood cell
count may be high or low, depending on the cause of the infection.
A blood test to check antibody levels is the main method used to diagnose many of the infections that cause POS. Other tests may include:
Biopsy of the lymph node
Laboratory culture of eye fluids, lymph node tissue, or blood
Treatment
Depending on the cause of the infection, antibiotics may be helpful. Surgery may be needed in rare cases to clean away the infected tissues.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outlook depends on the cause of the infection. In general, if the diagnosis is made early and treatment starts right away, the outcome of POS can be very good.
Possible Complications
Serious complications are rare.
The conjunctival nodules can sometimes form sores (ulcers) during the healing process. The infection can spread to nearby tissues or into the bloodstream.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you develop a red, irritated, painful eye.
Prevention
Frequent hand washing can reduce the likelihood of getting POS. Avoid being scratched by a cat, even a healthy cat. You can avoid tularemia by not having contact with wild rabbits, squirrels, or ticks.
