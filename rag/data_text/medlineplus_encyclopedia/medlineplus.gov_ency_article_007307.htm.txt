Pediatric myocarditis is inflammation of the heart muscle in an infant or young child.
Causes
Myocarditis is rare in young children. It is slightly more common in older children and adults. It is often worse in newborns and young infants than in children over age 2.
Most cases in children are caused by a virus that reaches the heart. These can include:
Influenza (flu)
virus
Coxsackie virus
Parovirus
Adenovirus
SARS-CoV-2 virus (the virus that causes
COVID-19)
It may also be caused by bacterial infections such as
Lyme disease
.
Other causes of pediatric myocarditis include:
Allergic reactions to certain medicines
Exposure to chemicals in the environment
Infections due to fungus or parasites
Radiation
Some diseases (autoimmune disorders) that cause inflammation throughout the body
Some drugs
Myocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination has been reported, but is very rare.
The heart muscle may be directly damaged by the virus or the bacteria that infect it. The body's immune response can also damage the heart muscle (called the myocardium) in the process of fighting the infection. This can lead to symptoms of heart failure.
Symptoms
Symptoms may be mild at first and hard to detect. Sometimes in newborns and infants, symptoms may appear suddenly.
Symptoms may include:
Anxiety
Failure to thrive
or poor weight gain
Feeding difficulties
Fever and other symptoms of infection
Listlessness
Low urine output (a sign of decreasing kidney function)
Pale, cool hands and feet (a sign of poor circulation)
Rapid breathing
Rapid heart rate
Symptoms in children over age 2 may also include:
Belly area pain and nausea
Chest pain
Cough
Fatigue
Shortness of breath
Swelling (edema) in the legs, feet, and face
Exams and Tests
Pediatric myocarditis can be hard to diagnose because the signs and symptoms often mimic those of other heart and lung diseases, or a bad case of the flu.
The health care provider may hear a rapid heartbeat or abnormal heart sounds while listening to the child's chest with a stethoscope.
A physical exam may show:
Fluid in the lungs and swelling in the legs in older children.
Signs of infection, including fever and rashes.
A chest x-ray can show enlargement (swelling) of the heart. If the provider suspects myocarditis based on the exam and chest x-ray, an electrocardiogram may also be done to help make the diagnosis.
Other tests that may be needed include:
Blood cultures to check for infection
Blood tests to look for antibodies against viruses or the heart muscle itself
Blood tests to check liver and kidney function
Complete blood count
Heart biopsy (the most accurate way to confirm the diagnosis, but not always needed)
Special tests to check for the presence of viruses in the blood (viral PCR)
Treatment
There is no cure for myocarditis. The heart muscle inflammation will often go away on its own.
The goal of treatment is to support heart function until the inflammation goes away. Many children with this condition are admitted to a hospital. Activity often needs to be limited while the heart is inflamed because it can strain the heart.
Treatment may include:
Antibiotics to fight bacterial infection
Anti-inflammatory medicines called steroids to control inflammation
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a medicine made of substances (called antibodies) that the body produces to fight infection, to control the inflammatory process
Mechanical support using a machine to help the heart function (in extreme cases)
Medicines to treat symptoms of heart failure
Medicines to treat abnormal heart rhythms
Outlook (Prognosis)
Recovery from myocarditis depends on the cause of the problem and the child's overall health. Most children recover completely with proper treatment. However, some may have permanent heart disease.
Newborns have the highest risk for serious disease and complications (including death) due to myocarditis. In rare cases, severe damage to the heart muscle requires a heart transplant.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Enlargement of the heart that leads to reduced heart function (dilated cardiomyopathy)
Heart failure
Heart rhythm problems
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your child's provider if signs or symptoms of this condition occur.
Prevention
There is no known prevention. However, prompt testing and treatment mayÂ reduce the disease risk.
