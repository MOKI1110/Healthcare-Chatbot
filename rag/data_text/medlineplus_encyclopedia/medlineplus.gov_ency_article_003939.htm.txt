A vesicle is a small fluid-filled blister on the skin.
Considerations
A vesicle is small. It may be as tiny as the top of a pin or up to 5 millimeters wide. A larger blister is called a bulla.
In many cases, vesicles break easily and release their fluid onto the skin. When this fluid dries, yellow crusts may remain on the skin surface.
Causes
Many diseases and conditions can cause vesicles. Common examples include:
Allergic reactions to drugs
Atopic dermatitis (
eczema
)
Autoimmune disorders such as
bullous pemphigoid
or
pemphigus
Blistering skin diseases including
porphyria
cutanea tarda and
dermatitis herpetiformis
Chickenpox
Contact dermatitis
(may be caused by poison ivy)
Herpes simplex (cold sores,
genital herpes
)
Herpes zoster
(shingles)
Bacterial infections
Fungal infections
Burns
Friction
Treatment with cryotherapy (to treat a wart for example)
Home Care
It is best to have your health care provider examine any skin rashes, including vesicles.
Over-the-counter treatments are available for certain conditions that cause vesicles, including poison ivy and cold sores.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Call your provider if you have any unexplained blisters on your skin.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will look at your skin. Some vesicles can be diagnosed simply by how they look.
In many cases, additional tests are needed. The fluid inside a blister may be sent to a lab for closer examination. In particularly difficult cases, a
skin biopsy
may be needed to make or confirm a diagnosis.
Treatment will depend on the cause of the vesicles.
