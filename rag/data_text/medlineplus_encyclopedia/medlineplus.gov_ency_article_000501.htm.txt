Acute kidney failure
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Acute kidney failure is the rapid (less than 2 days) loss of your kidneys' ability to remove waste and help balance fluids and
electrolytes
in your body.
Causes
There are many possible causes of kidney damage. They include:
Acute tubular necrosis
(ATN; damage to the tubule cells of the kidneys)
Autoimmune kidney disease
Blood clot in the blood vessels to the kidneys
Decreased blood flow from cholesterol (cholesterol emboli)
Decreased blood flow due to very low blood pressure, which can result from
burns
,
dehydration
, hemorrhage, injury,
septic shock
, serious illness, or surgery
Disorders that cause clotting within the kidney blood vessels
Infections that directly injure the kidney, such as acute
pyelonephritis
or
septicemia
Pregnancy complications, including
placental abruption
or
placenta previa
Urinary tract blockage
Illicit drugs such as cocaine and heroin
Medicines including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), certain antibiotics and blood pressure medicines, intravenous contrast (dye), some cancer and HIV medicines
Symptoms
Symptoms of acute kidney failure may include any of the following:
Blood in the stools
Blood in the urine
Breath odor
and metallic taste in the mouth
Bruising easily
Changes in mental status
or mood
Decreased appetite
Decreased sensation
, especially in the hands or feet
Fatigue
or slow sluggish movements
Flank pain
(between the ribs and hips)
Hand tremor
Heart murmur
High blood pressure
Nausea or vomiting, may last for days
Nosebleeds
Persistent hiccups
Prolonged bleeding
Seizures
Shortness of breath
Swelling
due to the body keeping in fluid (may be seen in the legs, ankles, and feet)
Urination changes, such as little or no urine,
excessive urination at night
, or urination that stops completely
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine you.
Tests to check how well your kidneys are working include:
BUN
Â (blood urea nitrogen)
Creatinine clearance
Serum creatinine
Serum potassium
Â and electrolyte levels
Urinalysis
Other blood tests may be done to find the underlying cause of kidney failure.
A kidney or abdominal ultrasound is the preferred test for diagnosing a blockage in the urinary tract.
X-ray
,
CT scan
, or
MRI of the abdomen
can also tell if there is a blockage.
Treatment
Once the cause is found, the goal of treatment is to help your kidneys work again and prevent fluid and waste from building up in your body while they heal. Usually, you willÂ have to stay overnight in the hospital for treatment.
The amount of liquid you drink will be limited to the amount of urine you can produce. You will be told what you may and may not eat to reduce the buildup of toxins that the kidneys would normally remove. Your diet may need to be high in
carbohydrates
and low in
protein
, salt, and potassium.
You may need antibiotics to treat or prevent infection. Water pills (diuretics) may be used to help remove fluid from your body.
Medicines will be given through a vein to help control your blood potassium level.
You may need
dialysis
. This is a treatment that does what healthy kidneys normally do -- rid the body of harmful wastes, extra salt, and water. Dialysis can save your life if your potassium levels are dangerously high. Dialysis will also be used if:
Your mental status changes
You develop
pericarditis
You retain too much fluid
You cannot remove nitrogen waste products from your body
Dialysis will most often be short term. In some cases, the kidney damage is so great that dialysis is needed permanently.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if your urine output slows or stops or you have other symptoms of acute kidney failure.
Prevention
To prevent acute kidney failure:
Health problems such as high blood pressure or diabetes should be well controlled.
Avoid drugs and medicines that can cause kidney injury.
