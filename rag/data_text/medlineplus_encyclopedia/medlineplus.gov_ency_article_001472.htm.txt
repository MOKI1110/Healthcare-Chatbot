Dermal melanocytosisÂ is the name of a kind of
birthmark
that is flat and blue, or blue-gray in color. They appear at birth or in the first few weeks of life.Â Dermal melanocytosis was formerly called Mongolian blue spots.
Causes
Dermal melanocytosis isÂ common among people of Asian, Native American, Hispanic, East Indian, and African descent.
The color of the birth mark is from a collection of melanocytes in the deeper layers of the skin. Melanocytes are cells that make the pigment (color) in the skin.
Symptoms
Dermal melanocytosis isÂ not cancerous and is not associated with disease. The markings may cover a large area of the back.
The markings are usually:
Blue or blue-gray spots on the back, buttocks, base of spine, shoulders, or other body areas
Flat with irregular shape and unclear edges
Normal in skin texture
2 to 8 centimeters wide or larger
Dermal melanocytosis isÂ sometimes mistaken for
bruises
. This can raise a question about possible child abuse. It is important to recognize that dermal melanocytosisÂ is a birthmark, not bruises.
Exams and Tests
No tests are needed. Your health care provider can diagnose this condition by looking at the skin.
If your provider suspects an underlying disorder, further tests will be done.
Treatment
No treatment isÂ needed when dermal melanocytosisÂ is a normal birthmark. If treatment is needed, lasers may be used.
SpotsÂ may beÂ a sign of an underlying disorder. If so,Â treatment for that problem will likely be recommended. Your provider can tell you more.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Spots that are normal birthmarks often fade in a few years. They are almost always gone by the teen years.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
All birthmarks should be examined by a provider during the routine newborn examination.
Alternative Names
