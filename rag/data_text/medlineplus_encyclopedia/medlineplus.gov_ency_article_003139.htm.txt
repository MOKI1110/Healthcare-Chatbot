The usual color of urine is straw-yellow. Abnormally-colored urine may be cloudy, dark, or blood-colored.
Causes
Abnormal urine color may be caused by infection, disease, medicines, or food you eat.
Cloudy or milky urine is a sign of a urinary tract infection, which may also cause a bad smell. Milky urine may also be caused by bacteria, crystals, fat, white or red blood cells, or mucus in the urine.
Dark brown but clear urine is a sign of a liver disorder such as
acute viral hepatitis
or
cirrhosis
, which causes excess bilirubin in the urine. It can also indicate severe dehydration or a condition involving the breakdown of muscle tissue known as
rhabdomyolysis
.
Pink, red, or lighter brown urine can be caused by:
Beets, blackberries, or certain food colorings
Hemolytic anemia
Injury to the kidneys or urinary tract
Medicines
Porphyria
Urinary tract disorders that cause bleeding
Blood from vaginal bleeding
Tumor in the bladder or kidneys
Dark yellow or orange urine can be caused by:
B complex vitamins or carotene
Medicines such as phenazopyridine (used to treat urinary tract infections), rifampin, and warfarin
Recent laxative use
Green or blue urine is due to:
Artificial colors in foods or medicines
Bilirubin
Medicines, including methylene blue
