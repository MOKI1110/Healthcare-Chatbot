Retroperitoneal fibrosis is a rare disorder that blocks the tubes (ureters) that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder.
Causes
Retroperitoneal fibrosis occurs when extra fibrous tissue forms in the area behind the stomach and intestines. The tissue forms a mass (or masses) or tough fibrotic tissue. It can block the tubes that carry urine from the kidney to the bladder.
The cause of this problem is mostly unknown. It is most common in people aged 40 to 60. Men are twice as likely to develop the condition as women.
Symptoms
Early symptoms:
Dull pain in the abdomen or flank that increases with time
Pain and change of color in the legs (due to decreased blood flow)
Swelling of one leg
Later symptoms:
Decreased urine output
No urine output (anuria)
Nausea
, vomiting, changes in mental status caused by kidney failure and build-up of toxic chemicals in the blood
Severe abdominal pain with blood in the stool (due to death of intestinal tissue)
Exams and Tests
Abdominal CT scan
is the best way to find a retroperitoneal mass.
Other tests that can help diagnose this condition include:
BUN
and
creatinine blood tests
Intravenous pyelogram
(IVP), not as commonly used
Kidney ultrasound
MRI of the abdomen
CT scan of the abdomen
and retroperitoneum
A biopsy of the mass may also be done to check for cancer.
Treatment
Corticosteroids are tried first. SomeÂ health care providersÂ also prescribe a medicine called tamoxifen.
If corticosteroid treatment does not work, a biopsy should be done to confirm the diagnosis. Other medicines to suppress the immune system can be prescribed.
When medicine does not work, surgery and
stents
(draining tubes) are needed.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outlook will depend on the extent of the problem and the amount of damage to the kidneys.
The
kidney damage
may be temporary or permanent.
Possible Complications
The disorder may lead to:
Ongoing blockage of the tubes leading from the kidney on one or both sides
Chronic kidney disease or failure
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have lower abdomen or flank pain and less output of urine.
Prevention
Try to avoid long-term use of medicines that contain methysergide, ergot alkaloids, or dopamine agonists. These medicines have been shown to rarely cause retroperitoneal fibrosis.
Alternative Names
