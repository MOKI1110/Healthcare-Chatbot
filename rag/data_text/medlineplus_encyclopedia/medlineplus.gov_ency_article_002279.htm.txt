The penis is the male organ used for urination and sexual intercourse. The penis is located above the
scrotum
. It is made of spongy tissue and blood vessels.
The shaft of the penis surrounds the urethra and is connected to the pubic bone.
The foreskin covers the head (glans) of the penis. The foreskin is removed if the boy is
circumcised
. This is often done shortly after birth, but can be done later in life for various medical and religious reasons.
Information
During puberty, the penis lengthens. The ability to ejaculate begins at around age 12 to 14. Ejaculation is the release of sperm-containing fluid from the penis during an orgasm.
Conditions of the penis include:
Chordee -- downward curve of the penis
Epispadias
-- urethra opening is on the top of the penis, rather than the tip
Hypospadias
-- urethra opening is on the underside of the penis, rather than at the tip
Palmatus or webbed penis -- the penis is enclosed by the scrotum
Peyronie disease
-- a curve during an erection
Buried penis -- the penis is hidden by a pad of fat
Micropenis -- the penis does not develop and is small
