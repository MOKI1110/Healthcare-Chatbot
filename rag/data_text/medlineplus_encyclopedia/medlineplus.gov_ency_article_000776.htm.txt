Autonomic neuropathy is a group of symptoms that occur when there is damage to the nerves that manage normally automatic body functions. These functions include blood pressure, heart rate, sweating, bowel and bladder emptying, and digestion. The nerves are part of the autonomic nervous system.
Causes
Autonomic neuropathy has a group of symptoms. It is not a specific disease. There are many causes.
Autonomic neuropathy involves damage to the nerves that carry information from the brain and spinal cord. The information is then carried to the heart, blood vessels, bladder, intestines, sweat glands, and pupils.
Autonomic neuropathy may be seen with:
Alcohol overuse
Diabetes
(diabetic neuropathy)
Disorders involving scarring of tissues around the nerves
Guillain BarrÃ© syndrome
or other diseases that inflame nerves
HIV/AIDS
Inherited nerve disorders
Multiple sclerosis
Parkinson disease
Spinal cord injury
Surgery or injury involving the nerves
Symptoms
Symptoms vary, depending on the nerves affected. They usually develop slowly over years.
Stomach and intestine symptoms may include:
Constipation
(hard stools)
Diarrhea
(loose stools)
Feeling full after only a few bites (
early satiety
)
Nausea after eating
Problems regulating and controlling bowel movements
Swallowing problems
Swollen abdomen
Vomiting of undigested food
Heart and lungs symptoms may include:
Abnormal heart rate or rhythm
Blood pressure drop with position that causes dizziness when standing
High blood pressure
Shortness of breath with activity or exercise
Bladder symptoms may include:
Difficulty beginning to urinate
Feeling of incomplete bladder emptying
Leaking urine
Other symptoms may include:
Sweating too much or not enough
Heat intolerance
brought on with activity and exercise
Sexual problems, including
erection problems
in men and vaginal dryness and orgasm difficulties in women
Abnormal pupil reaction in one or both eyes or trouble adjusting to bright lights
Weight loss without trying
Exams and Tests
Signs of autonomic nerve damage are not always seen when your health care provider examines you. Your blood pressure or heart rate may change when lying down, sitting, or standing.
Special tests to measure sweating and heart rate may be done. This is called autonomic nervous system testing.
Other tests depend on what type of symptoms you have.
Treatment
Treatment to reverse nerve damage is most often not possible. As a result, treatment and self-care are focused on managing your symptoms and preventing further problems.
Your provider may recommend:
Extra salt in the diet or taking salt tablets to increase fluid volume in blood vessels
Fludrocortisone or similar medicines to help your body retain salt and fluid
Medicines to treat irregular heart rhythms
Pacemaker
Sleeping with the head raised
Wearing
compression stockings
The following may help your intestines and stomach work better:
Daily bowel care program
Medicines that help the stomach move food through faster
Sleeping with the head raised
Small, frequent meals
Medicines and self-care programs can help you if you have:
Urinary incontinence
Neurogenic bladder
Erection problems
Stool incontinence
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well you do will depend on the cause of the problem and if it can be treated.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of autonomic neuropathy. Early symptoms might include:
Becoming faint or lightheaded when standing
Changes in bowel, bladder, or sexual function
Unexplained nausea and vomiting when eating
Early diagnosis and treatment may control symptoms.
Autonomic neuropathy may hide the warning signs of a heart attack. Instead of feeling chest pain, if you have autonomic neuropathy, during a heart attack you may only have:
Sudden fatigue
Sweating
Shortness of breath
Nausea and vomiting
Prevention
Prevent or regulate associated disorders to reduce the risk for neuropathy. For example, people with diabetes should closely
regulate blood sugar levels
