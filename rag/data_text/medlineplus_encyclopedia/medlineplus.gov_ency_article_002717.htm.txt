Shaving cream poisoning
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Shaving cream is a cream applied to the face or body before shaving the skin. Shaving cream poisoning occurs when someone eats shaving cream. This can be by accident or on purpose.
This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.
Poisonous Ingredient
The ingredients in shaving cream that can be harmful are:
Anionic surfactants (soaps)
Nonionic surfactants (soaps)
Symptoms
Shaving cream is not very poisonous. Most symptoms are from allergic reactions or if shaving cream touches the eyes. Symptoms may include:
Blurred vision
Breathing difficulty
Burning pain in the throat
Burns to the eye
Diarrhea
(watery, bloody)
Stomach pain
Rash
Vomiting
Home Care
Seek medical help right away. DO NOT make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to.
If the person swallowed shaving cream, give them water or milk right away, unless a provider tells you not to. DO NOT give anything to drink if the person has symptoms that make it hard to swallow. These include vomiting, convulsions, or a decreased level of alertness.
Before Calling Emergency
Have this information ready:
Person's age, weight, and condition
Name of the product (ingredients, if known)
Time it was swallowed
Amount swallowed
Poison Control
Your localÂ
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the shaving cream with you to the hospital, if possible.
The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated.
The person may receive:
Breathing support, including a tube through the mouth into the lungs, and a breathing machine (ventilator)
Chest x-ray
Fluids through a vein (by IV)
Medicine to treat symptoms
Laxatives
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well someone does depends on how much shaving cream they swallowed or got in their eyes, and how quickly they receive treatment. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.
Shaving cream is not very toxic, so recovery is very likely.
