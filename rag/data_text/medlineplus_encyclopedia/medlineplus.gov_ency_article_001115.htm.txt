Total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR) is a heart disease in which the 4 veins that take blood from the lungs to the heart do not attach normally to the left atrium (left upper chamber of the heart). Instead, they attach to another blood vessel or the wrong part of the heart. It is present at birth (
congenital heart disease
).
Causes
The cause of total anomalous pulmonary venous return is unknown.
In normal circulation, blood is sent from the right ventricle to pick up oxygen in the lungs. It then returns through the pulmonary (lung) veins to the left side of the heart, which sends blood out through the aorta and around the body.
In TAPVR, oxygen-rich blood returns from the lungs to the right atrium or to a vein flowing into the right atrium, instead of the left side of heart. In other words, blood simply circles to and from the lungs and never gets out to the body.
For the infant to live, an
atrial septal defect
(ASD) or
patent foramen ovale
(passage between the left and right atria) must exist to allow oxygenated blood to flow to the left side of the heart and the rest of the body.
How severe this condition is depends on whether the pulmonary veins are blocked or obstructed as they drain. Obstructed TAPVR causes symptoms early in life and can be deadly very quickly if it is not found and corrected with surgery.
Symptoms
The infant may appear very sick and may have the following symptoms:
Bluish color to the skin (cyanosis)
due to low oxygen level in the blood
Frequent respiratory infections
Lethargy
Poor feeding
Poor growth
Rapid breathing
Note: Sometimes, no symptoms may be present in infancy or early childhood.
Exams and Tests
Tests may include:
Cardiac catheterization
can confirm the diagnosis by showing that the blood vessels are abnormally attached
ECG
shows enlargement of the ventricles (ventricular hypertrophy)
Echocardiogram
may show that the pulmonary vessels are attached
MRI
or
CT scan
of the heart can show the connections between the pulmonary vessels
X-ray of the chest
shows a normal to small heart with fluid in the lungs
Treatment
Surgery to repair the problem is needed as soon as possible. In surgery, the pulmonary veins are connected to the left atrium and the defect between the right and left atrium is closed.
Outlook (Prognosis)
If this condition is not treated, the heart will get larger, leading to heart failure. Repairing the defect early provides excellent results if there is no blockage of the pulmonary veins at the new connection into the heart. Infants who have obstructed veins have worsened survival.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Breathing difficulties
Heart failure
Irregular, fast heart rhythms (arrhythmias)
Lung infections
Pulmonary hypertension
When to Contact a Medical Professional
This condition may be apparent at the time of birth. However, symptoms may not be present until later.
Contact your health care provider if you notice symptoms of TAPVR. Prompt attention is required.
Prevention
Women who plan to become pregnant should be immunized against rubella if they are not already immune. Rubella infection in a pregnant woman can cause congenital heart disease.
Women who are pregnant should get good prenatal care:
Avoid alcohol and illegal drugs during pregnancy.
Tell your provider that you are pregnant before taking any new medicines.
Have a blood test early in your pregnancy to see if you are immune to rubella. If you are not immune, avoid any possible exposure to rubella and get vaccinated right after delivery.
Pregnant women who have diabetes should try to get good control over their blood sugar level.
Some inherited factors may play a role in congenital heart disease. Many family members may be affected. If you are planning to get pregnant, talk to your provider about screening for genetic diseases.
