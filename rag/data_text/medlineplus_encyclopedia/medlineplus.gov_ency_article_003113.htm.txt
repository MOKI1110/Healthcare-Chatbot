Flank pain is pain in one side of the body between the upper belly area (abdomen) and the back.
Considerations
Flank pain can be a sign of a kidney problem. But, since many organs are in this area, other causes are possible. If you have flank pain and fever, chills, blood in the urine, or frequent or urgent urination, then a kidney problem is the likely cause. It could be a sign ofÂ
kidney stones
.
Causes
Flank pain may be caused by any of the following:
Arthritis or infection of the spine
Back problem, such as disk disease
Gallbladder disease
Gastrointestinal disease
Liver disease
Muscle spasm
Kidney stone
, infection, or abscess
Shingles
(pain with one-sided
rash
)
Spinal fracture
Home Care
Treatment depends on the cause.
Rest, physical therapy, and exercise may be recommended if the pain is caused by muscle spasm. You will be taught how to do these exercises at home.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and physical therapy may be prescribed for flank pain caused by spinal arthritis.
Antibiotics are used to treat most kidney infections. You will also receive fluids and pain medicine. You may need to stay in the hospital.
