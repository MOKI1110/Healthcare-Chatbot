Hantavirus is a life-threatening viral infection spread to humans by rodents.
Causes
Hantavirus is carried by rodents, particularly deer mice. The virus is found in their urine and feces, but it does not make the animal sick.
It is believed that humans can get sick with this virus if they breathe in contaminated dust from mice nests or droppings. You may come in contact with such dust when cleaning homes, sheds, or other enclosed areas that have been empty for a long time.
Hantavirus does not seem to spread from human to human.
Symptoms
The early symptoms of hantavirus disease are similar to the flu and include:
Chills
Fever
Muscle aches
People with hantavirus may begin to feel better for a very short time. But within 1 to 2 days, it becomes hard to breathe. The disease gets worse quickly. Symptoms include:
Dry cough
General ill feeling (
malaise
)
Headache
Nausea and vomiting
Shortness of breath
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may reveal:
Abnormal lung sounds as a result of inflammation
Kidney failure
Low blood pressure (
hypotension
)
Low blood oxygen levels, which cause the skin to turn a blue color (
cyanosis
)
The following tests may be done:
Blood tests to check for signs of hantavirus (presence of antibodies to the virus)
Complete blood count
(CBC) with
white blood cell differential
Comprehensive metabolic panel
(includes kidney and liver function tests)
Urinalysis
X-ray of the chest
CT scan of the chest
Treatment
People with hantavirus are admitted to the hospital, often to the intensive care unit (ICU).
Treatments include:
Oxygen
Breathing tube or breathing machine (mechanical ventilation) in severe cases
Special machines to add oxygen to the blood
Other supportive care to treat symptoms
There are no antivirals that work against hantavirus.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Hantavirus is a serious infection that gets worse quickly. Lung failure can occur and may lead to death. Even with aggressive treatment, 38% of people who have this disease in their lungs die.
Possible Complications
Complications of hantavirus may include:
Kidney failure
Heart and lung failure
These complications can lead to death.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you develop flu-like symptoms after you come in contact with rodent droppings or rodent urine, or dust that is contaminated with these substances.
Prevention
Avoid exposure to rodent urine and droppings.
Drink disinfected water.
When camping, sleep on a ground cover and pad.
Keep your home clean. Clear out potential nesting sites and clean your kitchen.
If you must work in an area where contact with rodent urine or feces is possible, follow these recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):
When opening an unused cabin, shed, or other building, open all the doors and windows, leave the building, and allow the space to air out for 30 minutes.
Return to the building and spray the surfaces, carpet, and other areas with a disinfectant. Leave the building for another 30 minutes.
Spray mouse nests and droppings with a 10% solution of chlorine bleach or similar disinfectant. Allow it to sit for 30 minutes. Using rubber gloves, place the materials in plastic bags. Seal the bags and throw them in the trash or an incinerator. Dispose of gloves and cleaning materials in the same way.
Wash all potentially contaminated hard surfaces with a bleach or disinfectant solution. Avoid vacuuming until the area has been thoroughly decontaminated. Then, vacuum the first few times with enough ventilation. Surgical masks may provide some protection.
If you have a heavy infestation of rodents, call a pest control company. They have special cleanup equipment and methods.
