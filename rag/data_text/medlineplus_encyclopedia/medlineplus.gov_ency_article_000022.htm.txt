Unconsciousness - first aid
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Unconsciousness is when a person is unable to respond to people and activities. Health care providers often call this a
coma
or being in a comatose state.
Other changes in awareness can occur without becoming unconscious. These are called altered mental status or changed mental status. They include sudden confusion, disorientation, or stupor.
Unconsciousness or any other sudden unexplained change in mental status must be treated as a medical emergency.
Causes
Unconsciousness can be caused by nearly any major illness or injury. It can also be caused by substance (medicine or drug) and alcohol use.
Choking on an object can result in unconsciousness
as well.
Brief unconsciousness (or
fainting
) is often a result from dehydration,
low blood sugar
, or temporary low blood pressure. It can also be caused by serious heart or nervous system problems. A provider can determine if the affected person needs tests to diagnose their fainting.
Other causes of fainting include straining during a bowel movement or urination, coughing very hard, breathing very fast (
hyperventilating
), or vasovagal syncope.
Symptoms
The person will be unresponsive (does not respond to activity, touch, sound, or other stimulation).
The following symptoms may occur after a person has been unconscious:
Amnesia
(not remembering) for events before, during, and even after the period of unconsciousness
Confusion
Drowsiness
Headache
Inability to speak or move parts of the body (
stroke
symptoms)
Lightheadedness
Loss of bowel or bladder control (incontinence)
Rapid heartbeat (
palpitations
)
Slow heartbeat
Stupor
(severe confusion and weakness)
If the person is unconscious from choking, symptoms may include:
Inability to speak
Difficulty breathing
Noisy breathing or high-pitched sounds while inhaling
Weak, ineffective coughing
Bluish skin color
(cyanosis)
Being asleep is not the same as being unconscious. A sleeping person will respond to loud noises or gentle shaking. An unconscious person will not.
First Aid
If someone is awake but less alert than usual, ask a few simple questions, such as:
What is your name?
What is the date?
How old are you?
Wrong answers or not being able to answer the question suggest a change in mental status.
If a person is unconscious or has a change in mental status, follow these first aid steps:
Call or tell someone to call 911 or the local emergency number.
Check the person's airway, breathing, and pulse frequently. If necessary, begin
CPR
.
If the person is breathing and lying on their back, and you do not think there is a
spinal injury
, carefully roll the person toward you onto their side. Bend the top leg so both hip and knee are at right angles. Gently tilt their head back to keep the airway open. If breathing or pulse stops at any time, roll the person onto their back and begin CPR.
If you think there is a spinal injury, leave the person where you found them (as long as breathing continues). If the person vomits, roll the entire body at one time to their side. Support their neck and back to keep the head and body in the same position while you roll.
Keep the person warm until medical help arrives.
If you see a person fainting, try to prevent a fall. Lay the person flat on the floor and raise their feet about 12 inches (30 centimeters).
If fainting is likely due to
low blood sugar
, give the person something sweet to eat or drink only when they become conscious.
If the person is unconscious from choking:
Begin
CPR
. Chest compressions may help dislodge the object.
If you see something blocking the airway and it is loose, try to remove it. If the object is lodged in the person's throat, do not try to grasp it. This can push the object farther into the airway.
Continue CPR and keep checking to see if the object is dislodged until medical help arrives.
DO NOT
Do not give an unconscious person any food or drink.
Do not leave the person alone.
Do not place a pillow under the head of an unconscious person.
Do not slap an unconscious person's face or splash water on their face to try to revive them.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Call 911 or the local emergency number if the person is unconscious and:
Does not return to consciousness quickly (within a minute)
Has fallen down or been injured, especially if they are bleeding
Has diabetes
Has seizures
Has lost bowel or bladder control
Is not breathing
Is pregnant
Is over age 50
Call 911 or the local emergency number if the person regains consciousness, but:
Feels chest pain, pressure, or discomfort, or has a pounding or irregular heartbeat
Cannot speak, has vision problems, or cannot move their arms and legs
Prevention
To prevent becoming unconscious or fainting:
Avoid situations where your
blood sugar level
gets too low.
Avoid standing in one place too long without moving, especially if you are prone to fainting.
Get enough fluid, particularly in warm weather.
If you feel like you are about to faint, lie down or sit with your head bent forward between your knees.
If you have a medical condition, such as
diabetes
, always wear a medical alertÂ necklace or bracelet.
