Emergency airway puncture is the placement of a hollow needle into the airway through the skin of the throat. It is done to treat life-threatening choking.
Description
Emergency airway puncture is done in an emergency situation, when someone is
choking
and all other efforts to assist with breathing have failed.
A hollow needle or tube can be inserted into the throat, just below the Adam's apple (thyroid cartilage), into the airway. The needle passes through the skin between the thyroid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage.
In a hospital, before inserting the needle, a small cut may be made in the skin and the membrane between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages.
Why the Procedure is Performed
A needle cricothyrotomy is an emergency procedure to relieve an
airway obstruction
until surgery can be done to place a breathing tube (
tracheostomy or surgical cricothyrotomy
).
If the airway blockage occurs with trauma to the head, neck, or spine, care must be taken to avoid further injury to the person.
Risks
Risks for this procedure include:
Injury to the voice box (larynx), thyroid gland, or esophagus
Risks for any surgery are:
Bleeding
Infection
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well the person does depends on the cause of the airway blockage and how quickly the person receives proper breathing support. Emergency airway puncture provides enoughÂ breathing support for only a very short period of time.
