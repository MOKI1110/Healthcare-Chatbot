Takayasu arteritis
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Takayasu arteritis is an inflammation of large arteries such as the aorta and
its major branches
. The aorta is the artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body.
Causes
The cause of Takayasu arteritis is not known. The disease occurs mainly in children and women between the ages of 20 to 40. It is more common in people of East Asian, Indian or Mexican descent. However, it is now being seen more often in other parts of the world. Several genes that increase the chance of having this problem were recently found.
Takayasu arteritis appears to be an autoimmune condition. This means the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in the blood vessel wall. The condition may also involve other organ systems.
This condition has many features that are similar to giant cell arteritis or
temporal arteritis
in older people.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
Arm weakness or pain with use
Chest pain
Dizziness
Fatigue
Fever
Lightheadedness
Muscle or joint pain
Skin rash
Night sweats
Vision changes
Weight loss
Decreased radial pulses (at the wrist)
Difference in blood pressure between the two arms
High blood pressure (
hypertension
)
There may also be signs of inflammation (
pericarditis
or
pleuritis
).
Exams and Tests
There is no blood test available to make a definite diagnosis. The diagnosis is made when a person has symptoms and imaging tests show blood vessel abnormalities suggesting inflammation.
Possible tests include:
Angiogram
, including coronary angiography
Complete blood count
(CBC)
C-reactive protein
(CRP)
Electrocardiogram
(ECG)
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR)
Magnetic resonance angiography
(MRA)
Magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI)
Computed tomography angiography
(CTA)
Positron emission tomography (PET)
Ultrasound
X-ray of the chest
Treatment
Treatment of Takayasu arteritis is difficult. However, people who have the right treatment can improve. It is important to identify the condition early. The disease tends to be chronic, requiring long-term use of anti-inflammatory medicines.
MEDICINES
Most people are first treated with high doses of corticosteroids such as prednisone. As the disease is controlled the dose of prednisone is decreased.
In almost all cases, immunosuppressive medicines are added to reduce the need for long-term use of prednisone and yet maintain control of the disease.
Conventional immunosuppressive medicines such as methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide, or leflunomide are often added.
Biologic medicines may also be effective. These include TNF inhibitors such as infliximab, etanercept, and tocilizumab.
SURGERY
Surgery or angioplasty may be used to open up narrowed arteries
to supply blood or open up the constriction.
Aortic valve replacement may be needed in some cases.
Outlook (Prognosis)
This disease can be fatal without treatment. However, a combined treatment approach using medicines and surgery has reduced death rates. Adults have a better chance of survival than children.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Blood clot
Heart attack
Heart failure
Pericarditis
Aortic valve insufficiency
Pleuritis
Stroke
Gastrointestinal bleeding or pain from blockage of bowel blood vessels
When to Contact a Medical Professional
