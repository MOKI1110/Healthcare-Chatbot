Meningitis
is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. This covering is called the meninges.
Bacteria are one type of germ that can cause meningitis. The meningococcal bacteria are one kind of bacteria that causes meningitis.
Causes
Meningococcal meningitis is caused by the bacteria
Neisseria meningitidis
(also known as meningococcus).
Meningococcus is the most common cause of bacterial meningitis in children and teens. It is a leading cause of bacterial meningitis in adults.
The infection occurs more often in winter or spring. It may cause local epidemics at boarding schools, college dormitories, or military bases.
Risk factors include recent exposure to someone with meningococcal meningitis, complement deficiency, use of eculizumab, spleen removal or a spleen that does not function, and exposure to cigarette smoking.
Symptoms
Symptoms usually come on quickly, and may include:
Fever and chills
Mental status changes
Nausea and vomiting
Purple, bruise-like areas (
purpura
)
Rash
, pinpoint red spots (
petechiae
)
Sensitivity to light (
photophobia
)
Severe headache
Stiff neck
Other symptoms that can occur with this disease:
Agitation
Bulging fontanelles
in infants
Decreased consciousness
Poor feeding or irritability in children
Rapid breathing
Unusual posture with the head and neck arched backwards (
opisthotonus
)
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. Questions will focus on symptoms and possible exposure to someone who might have the same symptoms, such as a stiff neck and fever.
If your provider thinks meningitis is possible, a lumbar puncture (
spinal tap
) will likely be done to obtain a sample of spinal fluid for testing.
Other tests that may be done include:
Blood culture
Chest x-ray
CT scan of the head
Complete blood count
(CBC)
Gram stain
or, other special stains, and
culture of the spinal fluid
Treatment
Antibiotics will be started as soon as possible.
Ceftriaxone is one of the most commonly used antibiotics.
Penicillin in high doses can be effective for susceptible bacteria.
If there is an allergy to penicillin, chloramphenicol may be used.
Sometimes, corticosteroids may be given.
People who have been in close contact with someone who has meningococcal meningitis should be given antibiotics to prevent infection.
Such people include:
Household members
Roommates in dormitories
Military personnel who live in close quarters
Those who come into close and long-term contact with an infected person
Outlook (Prognosis)
Early treatment improves the outcome. Death is possible. Young children and adults over age 50 have the highest risk of death.
Possible Complications
Long-term complications may include:
Brain damage
Hearing loss
Buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling (
hydrocephalus
)Â
Buildup of fluid between the skull and brain (
subdural effusion
)
Inflammation of the heart muscle (
myocarditis
)
Seizures
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Call 911 or the local emergency number or go to an emergency room if you suspect meningitis in a young child who has the following symptoms:
Feeding difficulties
High-pitched cry
Irritability
Persistent unexplained fever
Meningitis can quickly become a life-threatening illness.
Prevention
Close contacts in the same household, school, or day care center should be watched for early signs of the disease as soon as the first person is diagnosed. All family and close contacts of this person should begin antibiotic treatment as soon as possible to prevent spread of the infection. Ask your provider about this during the first visit.
Always use good hygiene habits, such as washing hands before and after changing a diaper or after using the toilet.
Vaccines for meningococcus
are effective for controlling spread and minimizing the severity of infection. They are currently recommended for:
Adolescents
College students in their first year living in dormitories
Military recruits
Travelers to certain parts of the world
Although rare, people who have been vaccinated can still develop the infection.
