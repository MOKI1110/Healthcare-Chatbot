Movement - unpredictable or jerky
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Jerky body movement is a condition in which a person makes fast movements that they cannot control and that have no purpose. These movements interrupt the person's normal movement or posture.
When abnormal movements are excessive, they are called hyperkinetic movements and include myoclonus (jerking and twitching), ballismus (violent flinging of extremities), chorea (slow, twisting, or continued movements), among others.
Considerations
This condition can affect one or both sides of the body. Typical movements of chorea include:
Bending and straightening the fingers and toes
Grimacing in the face
Raising and lowering the shoulders
They can look like they are being done on purpose. But the movements are not under the person's control. A person with chorea may look jittery or restless.
Chorea can be a painful condition, making it hard to do daily living activities.
Causes
There are many possible causes of unpredictable, jerky movements, including:
Antiphospholipid syndrome
(disorder that involves abnormal blood clotting)
Benign hereditary chorea (a rare inherited condition)
Disorders of calcium, glucose, or sodium metabolism
Degenerative diseases (disorders that involve breakdown of nerve cells in the brain), such as
Alzheimer disease
and
Huntington disease
Medicines (such as levodopa, antidepressants, anticonvulsants)
Polycythemia rubra vera
(bone marrow disease)
Sydenham chorea
(movement disorder that occurs most often in children after infection with bacteria called group A streptococcus)
Wilson disease
(disorder that involves too much copper in the body)
Pregnancy (chorea gravidarum)
Stroke
or lack of oxygen to the brain (hypoxic brain injury)
Systemic lupus erythematosus
(disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue)
Tardive dyskinesia
(a condition that can be caused by medicines such as antipsychotic medicines)
Thyroid disease
Other rare disorders
Home Care
Treatment is aimed at the cause of the movements.
If the movements are due to a medicine, the medicine should be stopped, if possible.
If the movements are due to a disease, the disorder should be treated.
If the movements are severe and affect the person's life, medicines may help control them.
Excitement or fatigue can make hyperkinetic movement worse. Rest helps improve chorea. Try to reduce emotional stress.
Safety measures should also be taken to prevent injury from the involuntary movements.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you have unexplained body motions that are unpredictable and do not go away.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed exam of the nervous and muscle systems.
You'll be asked about your medical history and symptoms, including:
What kind of movement occurs?
What part of the body is affected?
What other symptoms do you have?
Is there irritability?
Is there
weakness
or
paralysis
?
Is there
restlessness
?
Are there emotional problems?
Are there
facial tics
?
Tests that may be ordered include:
Blood tests such as
metabolic panel
,
complete blood count
(CBC),
blood differential
Blood tests for heavy metals, ceruloplasmin, and copper
CT scan of the head
or affected area
Electroencephalogram
Â (EEG), (in rare cases)
Electromyography
Â (EMG) and
nerve conduction velocity
(in rare cases)
Genetic studies to help diagnose certain diseases, such as Huntington disease
Lumbar puncture
MRI of the head
or affected area
Urinalysis
Treatment is based on the type of hyperkinetic movement disorder the person has. If medicines are used, your provider will decide which medicine to prescribe based on the person's symptoms and test results.
