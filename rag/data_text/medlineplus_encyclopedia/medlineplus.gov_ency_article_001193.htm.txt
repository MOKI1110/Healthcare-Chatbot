Neonatal hypothyroidism

Neonatal hypothyroidism is decreased thyroid hormone production in a newborn. In very rare cases, no thyroid hormone is produced.Â The condition is also called congenital hypothyroidism. Congenital means present from birth.
Causes
The thyroid gland is an important organ of the
endocrine system
. It is located at the front of the neck, just above where the collarbones meet. The thyroid makes hormones that control the way every cell in the body uses energy. This process is called
metabolism
.
Hypothyroidism in the newborn may be caused by:
A missing or poorly developed thyroid gland
A pituitary gland that does not stimulate the thyroid gland
Thyroid hormones that are poorly formed or do not work
Medicines the mother took during pregnancy
Lack of iodine in the mother's diet during pregnancy
Antibodies
made by the mother's body that block the baby's thyroid function
A thyroid gland that is not fully developed is the most common defect. Girls are affected twice as often as boys.
Symptoms
Most affected infants have few or no symptoms. This is because their thyroid hormone level is only slightly low. Infants with severe hypothyroidism often have a unique appearance, including:
Dull look
Puffy face
Thick tongue that sticks out
This appearance often develops as the disease gets worse.
The child may also have:
Poor feeding, choking episodes
Constipation
Dry, brittle hair
Hoarse cry
Jaundice
(skin and whites of the eyes look yellow)
Lack of muscle tone (
floppy
infant)
Low hairline
Short height
Sleepiness
Sluggishness
Exams and Tests
A physical exam of the infant may show:
Decreased muscle tone
Slow growth
Hoarse-sounding cry or voice
Short arms and legs
Very large soft spots on the skull (fontanelles)
Wide hands with short fingers
Widely separated skull bones
Blood tests are done to check thyroid function. Other tests may include:
Thyroid ultrasound scan
X-ray of the
long bones
Treatment
Early diagnosis is very important. Most of the effects of hypothyroidism are easy to reverse. For this reason, most US states require that all newborns be screened for hypothyroidism.
Thyroxine is usually given to treat hypothyroidism. Once the child starts taking this medicine, blood tests are regularly done to make sure thyroid hormone levels are in a normal range.
Referral to a pediatric endocrinologist is recommended for care.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Getting diagnosed early usually leads to a good outcome. Newborns diagnosed and treated in the first month or so usually have normal intelligence.
Untreated mild hypothyroidism can lead to severe
intellectual disability
and growth problems. The nervous system goes through important development during the first few months after birth. Lack of thyroid hormones can cause damage that cannot be reversed.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if:
You feel your infant shows signs or symptoms of hypothyroidism
You are pregnant and have been exposed to antithyroid medicines or procedures
Prevention
If a pregnant woman takes radioactive iodine for thyroid cancer, the thyroid gland may be destroyed in the developing fetus. Infants whose mothers have taken such medicines should be observed carefully after birth for signs of hypothyroidism.Â Also, pregnant women should not avoid iodine-supplemented salt.
Most states require a routine
screening test
to check all newborns for hypothyroidism.Â If your state does not have this requirement, ask your provider if your newborn should be screened.
