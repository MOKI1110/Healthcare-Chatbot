Injury - kidney and ureter

Injury to the kidney and ureter is damage to the organs of the upper urinary tract.
Causes
The kidneys are located in the flank at either side of the spine. The flank is the back of the upper abdomen. They are protected by the spine, lower rib cage, and strong muscles of the back. This location protects the kidneys from many outside forces. The kidneys are also surrounded by a layer of fat. The fat helps to cushion them.
The kidneys have a large blood supply. Any injury to them, can lead to severe bleeding. The many layers of padding help prevent kidney injury.
Kidneys may be injured by damage to the blood vessels that supply or drain them, including:
Aneurysm
Arterial blockage
Arteriovenous
fistula
Renal vein thrombosis
(clotting)
Trauma
Kidney injuries may also be caused by:
Angiomyolipoma, a noncancerous tumor, if the tumor is very large
Autoimmune disorders
Bladder outlet obstruction
Cancer of the kidney, pelvic organs (ovaries or uterus in women), or colon
Diabetes
Buildup of body waste products such as uric acid (which can occur with
gout
or treatment of bone marrow, lymph node, or other disorders)
Exposure to toxic substances such as lead, cleaning products, solvents, fuels, certain antibiotics, or long-term use of pain medicines (
analgesic nephropathy
)
High blood pressure and other medical conditions that affect the kidneys
Inflammation caused by immune responses to medicines, infection, or other disorders
Medical procedures such as
kidney biopsy
, or nephrostomy tube placement
Ureteropelvic junction obstruction
Ureteral obstruction
Kidney stones
The ureters are the tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder. Ureteral injuries may be caused by:
Complications from medical procedures
Diseases such as
retroperitoneal fibrosis
, retroperitoneal sarcomas, or cancers that spread to the lymph nodes near the ureters
Kidney stones
Radiation
to the belly area
Trauma
Symptoms
Emergency symptoms may include:
Abdominal pain
and swelling
Severe flank pain and back pain
Blood in the urine
Drowsiness,
decreased alertness
, including coma
Decreased urine output or inability to urinate
Fever
Increased heart rate
Nausea, vomiting
Skin that is pale or cool to touch
Sweating
Long-term (chronic) symptoms may include:
Malnutrition
High blood pressure
Kidney failure
If only one kidney is affected and the other kidney is healthy, you may not have any symptoms.
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will examine you. Let them know about any recent illness or if you have come into contact with toxic substances.
The exam may show:
Excess bleeding (hemorrhage)
Extreme tenderness over the kidney
Shock
, including rapid heart rate or falling blood pressure
Signs of kidney failure
Tests that may be done include:
Abdominal CT scan
Abdominal MRI
Abdominal ultrasound
Angiography
of the kidney artery or vein
Blood
electrolytes
Blood tests to look for toxic substances
Complete blood count
(CBC)
Intravenous pyelogram
(IVP)
Kidney function tests
Kidney x-ray
Retrograde pyelogram
Renal scan
Urinalysis
Urodynamic study
Voiding cystourethrogram
Treatment
The goals are to treat emergency symptoms and prevent or treat complications. You may need to stay in a hospital.
Treatments for a kidney injury may include:
Bed rest for 1 to 2 weeks or until bleeding is reduced
Close observation and treatment for symptoms of kidney failure
Diet changes
Medicines to treat damage caused by toxic substances or illnesses (for example, chelation therapy for lead poisoning or allopurinol to lower the uric acid level in the blood)
Pain medicines
Eliminating medicines or exposure to substances that may have injured the kidney
Medicines such as corticosteroids or immunosuppressants if the injury was caused by inflammation
Treatment of acute kidney failure
Sometimes, surgery is needed. This may include:
Repairing a "fractured" or torn kidney, torn blood vessels, torn ureter, or similar injury
Removing the entire kidney (
nephrectomy
), draining the space around the kidney, or stopping the bleeding via arterial catheterization (angioembolization)
Placing a stent
Removing a blockage or relieving an obstruction
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well you do depends on the cause and severity of the injury.
Sometimes, the kidney starts working properly again. Sometimes, kidney failure occurs.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Sudden kidney failure
, one or both kidneys
Bleeding (may be minor or severe)
Bruising of the kidney
Chronic kidney failure
, one or both kidneys
Infection (
peritonitis
,
sepsis
)
Pain
Renal artery stenosis
Renal hypertension
Shock
Urinary tract infection
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of an injury to the kidney or ureter. Contact the provider if you have a history of:
Exposure to toxic substances
Illness
Infection
Physical injury
Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have decreased urine output after a kidney injury. This may be a symptom of kidney failure.
Prevention
You can help prevent injury to the kidneys and ureter by taking these steps:
Be aware of substances that can cause lead poisoning. These include old paints, vapors from working with lead-coated metals, and alcohol distilled in recycled car radiators.
Take all your medicines properly, including ones you buy without a prescription (over-the-counter).
Treat gout and other illnesses as instructed by your provider.
Use safety equipment during work and play.
Use cleaning products, solvents, and fuels as directed. Make sure the area is well-ventilated, because the fumes may also be toxic.
Wear seat belts and drive safely.
