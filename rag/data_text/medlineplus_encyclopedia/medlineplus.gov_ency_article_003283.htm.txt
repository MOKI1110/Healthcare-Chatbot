Splinter hemorrhages

Splinter hemorrhages are small areas of bleeding (hemorrhage) under the fingernails or toenails.
Considerations
Splinter hemorrhages look like thin, red to reddish-brown lines of blood under the nails. They run in the direction of nail growth.
They are named splinter hemorrhages because they look like a splinter under the fingernail. The hemorrhages may be caused by tiny clots that damage the small capillaries under the nails.
Splinter hemorrhages can occur with infection of the heart valves (
endocarditis
). They may be caused by vessel damage from swelling of the blood vessels (
vasculitis
) or tiny clots that damage the small capillaries (microemboli).
Causes
Causes may include:
Bacterial endocarditis
Injury to the nail
Home Care
There is no specific care for splinter hemorrhages. Follow your health care provider's instructions for treating endocarditis.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you notice splinter hemorrhages and you haven't had any recent injury to the nail.
Splinter hemorrhages most often appear late in endocarditis. In most cases, other symptoms will cause you to visit your provider before splinter hemorrhages appear.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will examine you to look for the cause of splinter hemorrhages. You may be asked questions such as:
When did you first notice this?
Have you had an injury to the nails recently?
Do you have endocarditis, or does your provider suspect that you have endocarditis?
What other symptoms do you have, such as shortness of breath, fever, general ill feeling, or muscle aches?
The physical exam may include special attention to the heart and blood circulation systems.
Laboratory studies may include:
Blood cultures
Complete blood count
(CBC)
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR)
In addition, your provider may order:
Chest x-ray
Electrocardiogram (
ECG
)
Echocardiogram
After seeing your provider, you may want to add a diagnosis of splinter hemorrhages to your personal medical record.
