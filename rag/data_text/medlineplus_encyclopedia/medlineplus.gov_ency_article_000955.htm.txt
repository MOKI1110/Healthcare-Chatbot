Somatic symptom disorder

Somatic symptom disorder (SSD) occurs when a person feels extreme, exaggerated anxiety about physical symptoms. The person has such intense thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to the symptoms, that they feel they cannot do some of the activities of daily life. They may believe routine medical problems are life threatening. This anxiety may not improve despite normal medical evaluations and test results and reassurance from their health care provider.
A person with SSD is not faking their symptoms. Their pain and other symptoms are real. They may be caused by a medical problem. Often, no physical cause can be found. However, it is the extreme reaction and behaviors about the symptoms that are the main problem.
Causes
SSD usually begins by age 30. It occurs more often in women than in men. It's not clear why some people develop this condition. Certain factors may be involved:
Having a negative outlook
Being more physically and emotionally sensitive to pain and other sensations
Family history or upbringing
Genetics
People who have a history of physical or sexual abuse may be more likely to have this disorder. But not everyone with SSD has a history of abuse.
SSD is similar toÂ
illness anxiety disorder
(hypochondria). This is when people are overly anxious about becoming sick or developing a serious disease. They fully expect they will become very ill at some point. Unlike SSD, with illness anxiety disorder, there are few or no actual physical symptoms.
Symptoms
Common physical symptoms that occur with SSD include:
Pain
Fatigue or weakness
Shortness of breath
Symptoms may be mild to severe. There may be one or more symptoms of any type. They may come and go or change over time. Symptoms may be due to a medical condition but they also may have no clear cause.
How people feel and behave in response to these physical sensations are the main symptoms of SSD. These reactions must persist for 6 months or more. People with SSD may:
Feel extreme anxiety about symptoms
Feel concern that mild symptoms are a sign of serious disease
Go to the provider for multiple tests and procedures, but not believe the results if they are normal
Feel that the provider does not take their symptoms seriously enough or has not done a good job treating the problem
Spend a lot of time and energy dealing with health concerns
Have trouble functioning because of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors about symptoms
Exams and Tests
You will have a complete physical exam. Your provider may do certain tests to find any physical causes of your symptoms. The types of tests that are done depend on what symptoms you have.
Your provider may refer you to a mental health provider. The mental health provider may do further testing.
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to control your symptoms and help you function in life.
Having a supportive relationship with your provider is vital for your treatment.
You should have only one primary care provider. This will help you avoid having unneeded, and sometimes, potentially hazardous tests, procedures, and treatments.
You should see your provider regularly to review your symptoms and how you are coping.
You may also see a mental health provider (therapist). It's important to see a therapist who has experience treating SSD. Cognitive behavioral therapy is a type of talk therapy that can help treat SSD. Working with a therapist can help relieve your pain and other symptoms. During therapy, you will learn to:
Look at your feelings and beliefs about health and your symptoms
Find ways to reduce stress and anxiety about symptoms
Stop focusing as much on your physical symptoms
Recognize what seems to make the pain or other symptoms worse
Cope with the pain or other symptoms
Stay active and social, even if you still have pain or other symptoms
Function better in your daily life
Your therapist will also treat
depression
or other mental health illnesses you may have. You may take antidepressants to help reduce anxiety and depression.
You should not be told that your symptoms are imaginary or all in your head. Your provider should work with you to manage both physical and emotional symptoms.
Possible Complications
If not treated, you may have:
Trouble functioning in life
Problems with family, friends, and work
Poor health
An increased risk for depression and
suicide
Money problems due to the cost of medical care
SSD is a long-term (chronic) condition. Working with your providers and following your treatment plan is important for managing this disorder.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
You should contact your provider if you:
Feel so concerned about physical symptoms that you can't function
Have symptoms of anxiety or depression
If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat
988lifeline.org
. You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night.
You can also call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the hospital emergency room. DO NOT delay.
If someone you know has attempted suicide, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. DO NOT leave the person alone, even after you have called for help.
Prevention
Counseling may help people who are prone toÂ SSD learn other ways of dealing with stress. This may help reduce the intensity of symptoms.
