Mucopolysaccharidosis type III

Mucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III) is a rare disease in which the body is missing or does not have enough of certain
enzymes
needed to break down long chains of sugar molecules. These chains of molecules are called glycosaminoglycans (formerly called mucopolysaccharides). As a result, the molecules build up in different parts of the body and cause various health problems.
The condition belongs to a group of diseases called
mucopolysaccharidoses
(MPSs). MPS III is also known as Sanfilippo syndrome.
There are several other types of MPSs, including:
MPS I
(Hurler syndrome; Hurler-Scheie syndrome; Scheie syndrome)
MPS II
(Hunter syndrome)
MPS IV
(Morquio syndrome)
Causes
MPS III is an inherited disorder. This means it is typically passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of a gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease. This is called an
autosomal recessive
trait.
MPS III occurs when the enzymes needed to break down the heparan sulfate sugar chain are missing or defective.
There are four main types of MPS III. The type a person has depends on which enzyme is affected.
Type A is caused by a defect in the
SGSH
gene and is the most severe form. People with this type do not have a normal form of the enzyme called heparan
N
-sulfatase.
Type B is caused by a defect in the
NAGLU
gene. People with this type are missing or do not produce enough alpha-
N
-acetylglucosaminidase.
Type C is caused by a defect in the
HGSNAT
gene. People with this type are missing or do not produce enough acetyl-CoA:alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase.
Type D is caused by a defect in the
GNS
gene. People with this type are missing or do not produce enough
N
-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfatase.
Symptoms
Symptoms often appear after the first year of life. A decline in learning ability typically occurs between ages 2 and 6. The child may have normal growth during the first few years, but final height is below average. Delayed development is followed by worsening mental status.
Other symptoms may include:
Behavioral problems, including
hyperactivity
Coarse facial features with heavy eyebrows that meet in the middle of the face above the nose
Chronic diarrhea
Enlarged liver
and
spleen
Sleep difficulties
Stiff joints that may not extend fully
Vision problems and hearing loss
Walking problems
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam.
Urine tests will be done. People with MPS III have a large amount of a mucopolysaccharide called heparan sulfate in the urine.
Other tests may include:
Blood enzyme level
Echocardiogram
Genetic testing
Slit lamp eye exam
Skin fibroblast culture
X-rays of the bones
Treatment
Treatment of MPS III is aimed at managing the symptoms. There is no specific treatment for this disease. New research is under development for gene therapy and enzyme replacement.

Outlook (Prognosis)
MPS III causes significant nervous system symptoms, including severe
intellectual disability
. Most people with MPS III live into their teenage years. Some live longer, while others with severe forms die at an earlier age. Symptoms are most severe in people with type A.
Possible Complications
These complications can occur:
Blindness
Inability to care for self
Intellectual disability
Nerve damage that slowly gets worse and eventually requires wheelchair use
Seizures
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your child's provider if your child does not seem to be growing or developing normally.
See your provider if you plan to have children and you have a family history of MPS III.
Prevention
Genetic counseling
is recommended for couples who want to have children and who have a family history of MPS III. Prenatal testing is available.
