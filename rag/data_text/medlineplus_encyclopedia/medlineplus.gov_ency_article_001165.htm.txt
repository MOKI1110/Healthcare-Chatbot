Ovarian overproduction of androgens

Ovarian overproduction of androgens is a condition in which the ovaries make too much
testosterone
. This leads to the development of male characteristics in a woman. Androgens from other parts of the body can also cause male characteristics to develop in women.
Causes
In healthy women, the ovaries and adrenal glands produce about 40% to 50% of the body's testosterone. Tumors of the ovaries and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can both causeÂ too muchÂ androgen production.
Cushing disease is a problem with the pituitary gland thatÂ leads toÂ excess amounts of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids may cause masculine body changes in women. Tumors in the adrenal glands can also cause too much production of androgens and can lead to male body characteristics in women.
Symptoms
High levels of androgens in a female can cause:
Acne
Changes in female body shape
Decrease in breast size
Increase in body hair in a male pattern, such as on the face, chin, and abdomen (called hirsutism)
Lack of menstrual periods (amenorrhea)
Oily skin
These changes may also occur:
Increase in the size of the clitoris
Deepening of the voice
Increase in muscle mass
Thinning hair and hair loss at the front of the scalp on both sides of the head
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. Any blood and imaging tests ordered will depend on your symptoms, but may include:
17-hydroxyprogesterone test
ACTH stimulation test (unusual)
Cholesterol blood tests
CT scan
DHEA blood test
Glucose test
Insulin test
Pelvic ultrasound
Prolactin test
(if periods come less often or not at all)
Testosterone test (both free and total testosterone)
TSH test
(if there is hair loss)
Treatment
Treatment depends on the problem that is causing the increased androgen production. Medicines can be given to decrease hair production in women with excess body hair, or to regulate menstrual cycles. In some cases, surgery may be needed to remove an ovarian or adrenal tumor.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Treatment success depends on the cause of excess androgen production. If the condition is caused by an ovarian tumor, surgery to remove the tumor may correct the problem. Most ovarian tumors are not cancerous (benign) and will not come back after they have been removed.
In polycystic ovary syndrome, the following measures can reduce symptoms caused by high androgen levels:
Careful monitoring
Weight loss
Dietary changes
Medicines
Regular vigorous exercise
Possible Complications
Infertility and complications during pregnancy may occur.
Women with polycystic ovary syndrome may be at increased risk for:
Diabetes
High blood pressure
High cholesterol
Obesity
Uterine cancer
Prevention
Women who have polycystic ovary syndrome can reduce their chances of long-term complications by maintaining a normal weight through healthy diet and regular exercise.
