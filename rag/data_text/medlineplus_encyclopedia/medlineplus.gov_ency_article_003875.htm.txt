Left heart ventricular angiography is a procedure to look at the left-sided heart chambers and the function of the left-sided valves. It is sometimes combined with coronary angiography.
How the Test is Performed
Before the test, you will be given medicine to help you relax. You will be awake and able to follow instructions during the test.
An
intravenous
line is placed in your arm. A cardiologist cleans and numbs an area on your arm or groin. Then the doctor makes a small cut in the area, and inserts a thin flexible tube (catheter) into an artery. Using x-rays as a guide, they carefully move the thin tube (catheter) into your heart.
When the tube is in place, dye is injected through it. The dye flows through the blood vessels, making them easier to see.
X-rays
are taken as the dye moves through the blood vessels. These x-ray pictures create a "movie" of the left ventricle as it contracts rhythmically.
The procedure will usually last less than one hour, but may take be considerably longer, especially if combined with other procedures.
How to Prepare for the Test
You will be told not to eat or drink for 6 to 8 hours before the test. The procedure takes place in the hospital or a specialized procedure unit. Some people may need to stay in the hospital the night before the test.
Your cardiologist will explain the procedure and its risks. You must sign a consent form for the procedure.
How the Test will Feel
You will feel a sting and burn when the local anesthetic is injected. You may feel pressure when the catheter is inserted. Occasionally, a flushing sensation or a feeling that you need to urinate occurs when the dye is injected.
Why the Test is Performed
Left heart angiography is performed to assess the blood flow through the left side of the heart.
Normal Results
A normal result shows normal blood flow through the left side of the heart. Blood volumes and pressures are also normal.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Abnormal results may be due to:
A hole in the heart (
ventricular septal defect
) or other abnormal connections (congenital heart disease)
Abnormalities of the left heart valves
An
aneurysm
of the heart wall
Areas of the heart that are not contracting normally
Blood flow problems on the left side of the heart
Heart-related blockages
Weakened pumping function of the left ventricle
Coronary angiography
may be needed when blockage of the coronary arteries or other coronary abnormalities is suspected.
Risks
Risks associated with this procedure include:
Abnormal heartbeats (
arrhythmias
)
Allergic reaction to dye or sedating medicines
Artery or vein damage
Cardiac tamponade
Embolism from
blood clots
at the tip of the catheter
Heart failure due to the volume of the dye
Infection
Kidney failure from the dye
Low blood pressure
Heart attack
Hemorrhage
Stroke
Considerations
Right heart catheterization
may be combined with this procedure.
Left heart ventricular angiography has some risk because it is an invasive procedure. Other imaging techniques may carry less risk, such as:
CT scans
Echocardiography
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart
Radionuclide ventriculography
Your cardiologist may decide to perform one of these procedures instead of left heart ventricular angiography.
Alternative Names
Angiography - left heart; Left ventriculography
Images
Heart valves - anterior view
Heart valves - superior view
