Trigeminal neuralgia

Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a nerve disorder. It causes a stabbing or electric shock-like pain in parts of the face.
Causes
The pain of TN comes from the trigeminal nerve. This nerve carries the sensations of touch and pain from the face, eyes, sinuses, and mouth to the brain.
TN may be caused by:
Multiple sclerosis
(MS) or other diseases that damage the protective covering
myelin
of the nerves
Pressure on the trigeminal nerve from a swollen blood vessel or
tumor
Injury to the trigeminal nerve, such as from trauma to the face or from oral or sinus surgery
Often, no exact cause is found. TN usually affects adults above age 50 years, but it can occur at any age. Women are affected more often than men. When TN affects people younger than 40, it is often due to MS or a tumor.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Very painful, sharp electric-like spasms that are usually brief. The spasms may occur close together such that it feels like they last from several seconds to minutes. Pain can become constant.
Pain is usually only on one side of the face, often around the eye, cheek, and lower part of the face.
There is usually no loss of sensation or movement of the affected part of the face.
Pain may be triggered by touch or sounds.
Painful attacks of TN can be triggered by common, everyday activities, such as:
Talking
Smiling
Brushing teeth
Chewing
Drinking
Eating
Exposure to hot or cold temperature
Touching the face
Shaving
Wind
Applying make-up
The right side of the face is mostly affected. In some cases, TN goes away on its own.
Exams and Tests
A brain and nervous system (neurologic) exam is often normal. Tests that are done to look for the cause may include:
Complete blood count
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR)
MRI of the head
MRA (angiography) of brain
or
CTA
Eye examination (to rule out intraocular disease)
Spinal tap
(lumbar puncture)
CT scan of head
(who cannot undergo MRI)
Trigeminal reflex testing (in rare cases)
Treatment
Your primary care provider, a neurologist, or a pain specialist may be involved in your care.
Certain medicines sometimes help reduce pain and the rate of attacks. These medicines include:
Anti-seizure medicines, such as carbamazepine
Muscle relaxants, such as baclofen
Tricyclic antidepressants
If you are found to have MS as a cause of TN, your health care provider will discuss medicines that can treat the underlying MS.
Short-term pain relief occurs through surgery, but is associated with risk of complications. One surgery is called microvascular decompression (MVD) or the Jannetta procedure. During surgery, a sponge-like material is placed between the nerve and the blood vessel that is pressing on the nerve.
Trigeminal nerve block (injection) with local anesthetic and steroid is an excellent treatment option to rapidly relieve pain while waiting for medicines to take effect.
Other techniques involve destroying or cutting parts of the trigeminal nerve root. Methods used include:
Radiofrequency ablation (uses high-frequency heat)
Injection of glycerol or alcohol
Balloon microcompression
Radiosurgery
(uses high power energy)
If a tumor is the cause of TN, surgery is done to remove it.
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well you do depends on the cause of the problem. If there is no disease causing the problem, treatment can provide some relief.
In some people, the pain becomes constant and severe.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Side effects of medicines used to treat TN
Problems caused by procedures, such as loss of feeling in the treated area
Weight loss from not eating to avoid triggering pain
Avoiding other people if talking triggers pain
Depression
, suicide
High levels of anxiety during acute attacks
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of TN, or your TN symptoms get worse.
