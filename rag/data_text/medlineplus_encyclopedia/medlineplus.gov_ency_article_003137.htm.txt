Abdominal sounds

Abdominal sounds are the noises made by the intestines.
Considerations
Abdominal sounds (bowel sounds) are made by the movement of the intestines as they push food through. The intestines are hollow, so bowel sounds echo through the abdomen much like the sounds heard from water pipes.
Most bowel sounds are normal. They simply mean that the gastrointestinal tract is working. However, there are some cases in which abnormal sounds can indicate a problem. A health care provider can check abdominal sounds by listening to the abdomen with a stethoscope (
auscultation
).
Ileus
is a condition in which there is a lack of intestinal activity. Many medical conditions may lead to ileus. This problem can cause gas, fluids, and the contents of the intestines to build up and break open (rupture) the bowel wall. The provider may be unable to hear any bowel sounds when listening to the abdomen.
Reduced (hypoactive) bowel sounds include a reduction in the loudness, tone, or regularity of the sounds. They are a sign that intestinal activity has slowed.
Hypoactive bowel sounds are normal during sleep. They also occur normally for a short time after the use of certain medicines and after abdominal surgery. Decreased or absent bowel sounds often indicate constipation.
Increased (
hyperactive
) bowel sounds can sometimes be heard even without a stethoscope. Hyperactive bowel sounds mean there is an increase in intestinal activity. This may happen with diarrhea or after eating.
Abdominal sounds are always evaluated together with symptoms such as:
Gas
Nausea
Presence or absence of bowel movements
Vomiting
If bowel sounds are hypoactive or hyperactive and there are other abnormal symptoms, you should continue to follow-up with your provider.
For example, no bowel sounds after a period of hyperactive bowel sounds can mean there is a rupture of the intestines, or strangulation of the bowel and death (
necrosis
) of the bowel tissue.
Very high-pitched bowel sounds may be a sign of early
bowel obstruction
.
Causes
Most of the sounds you hear in your stomach and intestines are due to normal digestion. They are not a cause for concern. Many conditions can cause hyperactive or hypoactive bowel sounds. Most are harmless and do not need to be treated.
The following is a list of more serious conditions that can cause abnormal bowel sounds.
Hyperactive, hypoactive, or missing bowel sounds may be caused by:
Blocked blood vessels prevent the intestines from getting proper blood flow. For example,
blood clots
can cause
mesenteric artery occlusion
.
Mechanical
bowel obstruction
is caused by
hernia
,
tumor
,
adhesions
, or similar conditions that can block the intestines.
Paralytic ileus
is a problem with the nerves to the intestines.
Other causes of hypoactive bowel sounds include:
Medicines that slow down movement in the intestines such as opioids (including codeine), anticholinergics, and phenothiazines
General anesthesia
Radiation to the abdomen
Spinal anesthesia
Surgery in the abdomen
Other causes of hyperactive bowel sounds include:
Crohn disease
Diarrhea
Food allergy
GI bleeding
Infectious
enteritis
Ulcerative colitis
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have any symptoms such as:
Bleeding from your rectum
Nausea
Diarrhea or constipation that continues
Vomiting
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
The provider will examine you and ask you questions about your medical history and symptoms. You may be asked:
What other symptoms do you have?
Do you have
abdominal pain
?
Do you have diarrhea or constipation?
Do you have
abdominal distention
?
Do you have
excessive or absent gas (flatus)
?
Have you noticed any bleeding from the rectum or black stools?
You may need the following tests:
Abdominal CT scan
Abdominal x-ray
Blood tests
Endoscopy
If there are signs of an emergency, you will be sent to the hospital. A tube may be placed through your nose or mouth into the stomach or the upper intestine. This empties your stomach or upper intestine. In most cases, you will not be allowed to eat or drink anything so your intestines can rest. You will be given fluids through a vein (intravenously).
You may be given medicine to reduce symptoms and to treat the cause of the problem. The type of medicine will depend on the cause of the problem. Some people may need surgery right away.
