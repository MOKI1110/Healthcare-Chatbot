Abdominal bloating is a condition in which the belly (abdomen) feels full and tight. Your belly may look swollen (distended).
Causes
Common causes include:
Swallowing air
Constipation
Gastroesophageal reflux disease
(GERD)
Irritable bowel syndrome
Lactose intolerance
and problems digesting other foods
Overeating
Small bowel bacterial overgrowth
Weight gain
You may have bloating if you take the oral diabetes medicine acarbose. Some other medicines or foods containing lactulose or sorbitol, may cause bloating. Many foods high in fructose and related compounds cause gas.
More serious disorders that may cause bloating are:
Ascites
and abdominal tumors
Celiac disease
Dumping syndrome
Ovarian cancer
Problems with the pancreas not producing enough digestive enzymes (pancreatic insufficiency)
Home Care
You may take the following steps:
Avoid chewing gum or carbonated drinks. Stay away from foods with high levels of fructose or sorbitol.
Avoid foods that can produce gas, such as Brussels sprouts, turnips, cabbage, onions, garlic, beans, and lentils.
Do not eat too quickly.
Stop smoking.
Get treatment for constipation if you have it. However, insoluble fiber such as bran can cause more bloating and gas. Soluble fiber supplements such as psyllium are usually better tolerated.
You may try simethicone and other medicines that you can buy at the drugstore to help with gas. Charcoal caps can also help. Be aware that charcoal will turn your stool black. It is not harmful, but it is good to be aware of this effect.
Watch for foods that trigger your bloating so you can start to avoid those foods. These may include:
Milk and other dairy products that contain
lactose
Certain carbohydrates, including fructose (fruit sugar), that are fermentable and thus can produce gas. These carbohydrates are known as FODMAPs.
