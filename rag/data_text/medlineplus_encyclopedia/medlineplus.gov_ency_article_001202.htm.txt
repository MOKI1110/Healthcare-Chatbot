Hypothalamic dysfunction

Hypothalamic dysfunction is a problem with part of the brain called the
hypothalamus
. The hypothalamus helps control the pituitary gland and regulates many body functions.
Causes
The hypothalamus helps keep the body's internal functions in balance. It helps regulate:
Appetite and weight
Body temperature
Childbirth
Emotions, behavior, memory
Growth
Production of breast milk
Salt and water balance
Sex drive
Sleep-wake cycle and the body clock
Another important function of the hypothalamus is to control the pituitary gland. The pituitary is a small gland at the base of the brain. It lies just below the hypothalamus. The pituitary, in turn, controls the:
Adrenal glands
Ovaries
Testes
Thyroid gland
There are many causes of hypothalamic dysfunction. The most common are:
Surgery
Brain injury
Brain tumors
Radiation treatment to the brain
Other causes include:
Nutrition problems, such as eating disorders (
anorexia
), extreme weight loss
Blood vessel problems in the brain, such as
aneurysm
,
pituitary apoplexy
,Â
subarachnoid hemorrhage
Genetic disorders, such as
Prader-Willi syndrome
, familial
diabetes insipidus
, Kallmann syndrome
Infections and swelling (inflammation) due to certain immune system diseases
Symptoms
Symptoms are usually due to the hormones or brain signals that are missing. In children, there may be growth problems, either too much or too little growth. In other children, puberty occurs too early or too late.
Tumor symptoms may include headache or loss of vision.
If the thyroid is affected, there may be symptoms of an underactive thyroid (
hypothyroidism
). Symptoms may include feeling cold all the time, constipation,
fatigue
, or
weight gain
, among others.
If the adrenal glands are affected, there may be symptoms of low adrenal function. Symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, poor appetite, weight loss, and lack of interest in activities.
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about your symptoms.
Blood or urine tests may be ordered to determine levels of hormones such as:
Cortisol
Estrogen
Growth hormone
Pituitary hormones
Prolactin
Testosterone
Thyroid
Sodium
Blood
and
urine
osmolality
Other possible tests include:
Hormone injections followed by timed blood samples
MRI
or
CT
scans of the brain
Visual field eye exam
(if there is a tumor)
Treatment
Treatment depends on the cause of the hypothalamic dysfunction:
For tumors, surgery or radiation may be needed.
For hormonal deficiencies, missing hormones need to be replaced by taking medicine. This is effective for pituitary problems and for salt and water balance.
Medicines are usually not effective for changes in temperature or sleep regulation.
Some medicines may help with problems related to appetite regulation and weight gain.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Many causes of hypothalamic dysfunction are treatable or reversible. Most of the time, missing hormones can be replaced.
Possible Complications
Complications of hypothalamic dysfunction depend on the cause.
BRAIN TUMORS
Permanent blindness
Problems related to the brain area where the tumor occurs
Vision disorders
Problems controlling salt and water balance
HYPOTHYROIDISM
Heart problems
High cholesterol
ADRENAL INSUFFICIENCY
Inability to deal with stress (such as surgery or infection), which can be life threatening by causing low blood pressure
SEX GLAND DEFICIENCY
Heart disease
Erection problems
Infertility
Thin bones (
osteoporosis
)
Problems breast feeding
Problems with uterine contractions during delivery
GROWTH HORMONE DEFICIENCY
High cholesterol
Osteoporosis
Short stature
(in children)
Weakness
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have:
Headaches
Symptoms of hormone excess or deficiency
Vision problems
Prevention
If you have symptoms of a hormonal deficiency, discuss replacement therapy with your provider.
