Osteomyelitis is a bone infection caused by bacteria or other germs.
Causes
A bone infection is most often caused by bacteria. It can also be caused by fungi or other germs. In children, the
long bones
of the arms or legs are most often involved.
When a child has osteomyelitis:
Bacteria or other germs may spread to the bone from infected skin, muscles, or tendons next to the bone. This may occur under a skin sore.
The infection can start in another part of the body and spread through the blood to the bone.
The infection can be caused by an injury that breaks the skin and bone (open
fracture
). Bacteria can enter the skin and infect the bone.
The infection can also start after bone surgery. This is more likely if the surgery is done after an injury, or if metal rods or plates are placed in the bone.
Other risk factors include:
Premature birth or delivery complications in newborns
Diabetes
Poor blood supply
Recent injury
Sickle cell disease
Infection due to a foreign body
Pressure ulcers
Human bites
or
animal bites
Weakened immune system
Symptoms
Osteomyelitis symptoms include:
Bone pain
Excessive sweating
Fever and chills
General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (
malaise
)
Local
swelling
, redness, and warmth
Pain at the infection site
Swelling of the ankles, feet, and legs
Refusing to walk (when leg bones are involved)
Infants with osteomyelitis may not have a fever or other signs of illness. They might avoid moving the infected limb due to pain.
Exams and Tests
Your child's health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms your child is having.
Tests that your child's provider may order include:
Blood cultures
Bone biopsy
(the sample is cultured and examined under a microscope)
Bone scan
Bone x-ray
Complete blood count
(CBC)
C-reactive protein (CRP)
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
MRI
of the bone
Needle aspiration
of the area of the affected bones
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to stop the infection and reduce damage to the bone and surrounding tissues.
Antibiotics are given to destroy the bacteria causing the infection:
Your child may receive more than one antibiotic at a time.
Antibiotics are taken for at least 4 to 6 weeks, often
at home through an IV
(intravenously, meaning through a vein). At some point, your child's provider may switch the medicine to antibiotic pills.
Surgery may be needed to remove dead bone tissue if the child has an infection that does not go away.
If there are metal plates near the infection, they may need to be removed.
The open space left by the removed bone tissue may be filled with
bone graft
or packing material. This promotes the growth of new bone tissue.
If your child was treated in the hospital for osteomyelitis, be sure to follow your provider's instructions on how to care for your child at home.
Outlook (Prognosis)
With treatment, the outcome for acute osteomyelitis is usually good.
The outlook is worse for those with long-term (
chronic
) osteomyelitis. Symptoms may come and go for years, even with surgery.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your child's provider if:
Your child develops symptoms of osteomyelitis
Your child has osteomyelitis and the symptoms continue, even with treatment
