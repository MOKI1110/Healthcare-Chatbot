Drug-induced pulmonary disease is lung disease brought on by a bad reaction to a medicine.Â Pulmonary means related to the lungs.
Causes
Many types of lung injury can result from medicines. It is usually impossible to predict who will develop lung disease from a medicine.
Types of lung problems or diseases that may be caused by medicines include:
Allergic reactions
--
asthma
,
hypersensitivity pneumonitis
, or
eosinophilic pneumonia
Bleeding into the lung air sacs, called alveoli (alveolar hemorrhage)
Swelling and inflamed tissue in the main passages that carry air to the lungs (
bronchitis
)
Damage to lung tissue (
interstitial fibrosis
)
Drugs that cause the immune system to mistakenly attack and destroy healthy body tissue, such as
drug-induced lupus erythematosus
Granulomatous lung disease -- a type of inflammation in the lungs
Inflammation of the lung air sacs (pneumonitis or infiltration)
Lung vasculitis (inflammation of lung blood vessels)
Lymph node swelling
Swelling and irritation (inflammation) of the chest area between the lungs (
mediastinitis
)
Abnormal buildup of fluid in the lungs (
pulmonary edema
)
Buildup of fluid between the layers of tissue that line the lungs and chest cavity (
pleural effusion
)
Abnormal pressure of the arteries that bring blood to the lungs (pulmonary hypertension)
Many medicines and substances are known to cause lung disease in some people. These include:
Antibiotics, such as nitrofurantoin and sulfa drugs
Heart medicines, such as amiodarone
Chemotherapy
drugs such as bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate
Immunotherapy drugs that are used to treat cancer
Street drugs
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Bloody sputum
Chest pain
Cough
Fever
Shortness of breath
Wheezing
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will perform a physical exam and listen to your chest and lungs with a stethoscope. Abnormal breath sounds may be heard.
Tests that may be done include:
Arterial blood gases
Blood test to check for an
autoimmune
disorder
Blood chemistry
Bronchoscopy
Complete blood count
with
blood differential
Chest CT scan
Chest x-ray
Lung biopsy
(in rare cases)
Lung function tests
Thoracentesis
(if pleural effusion is present)
Treatment
The first step is to stop theÂ medicine that is causing the problem. Other treatments depend on your specific symptoms. For example, you may need oxygen until the drug-induced lung disease improves. Anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids are most often used to quickly reverse the lung inflammation.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Acute
episodes usually go away within 48Â to 72 hours after the medicine has been stopped.
Chronic
symptoms may take longer to improve.
Some drug-induced lung diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis, may never go away and can worsen, even after the medicine or substance is stopped and can lead to severe lung disease and death.
Possible Complications
Complications that may develop include:
Diffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis
Hypoxemia (low blood oxygen)
Respiratory failure
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of this disorder.
Prevention
Note any past reaction you have had to a medicine, so that you can avoid the medicine in the future. Wear a medical alert bracelet if you have known drug reactions. Stay away from street drugs.
