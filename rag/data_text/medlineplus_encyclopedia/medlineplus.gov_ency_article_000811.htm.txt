Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a problem in which your breathing pauses during sleep. This occurs because of narrowed or blocked airways.
Causes
When you sleep, all of the muscles in your body become more relaxed. This includes the muscles that help keep your throat open so air can flow into your lungs.
Normally, your throat remains open enough during sleep to let air pass by. Some people have a narrow throat. When the muscles in their upper throat relax during sleep, the tissues close in and block the airway. This stop in breathing is called apnea.
Loud
snoring
is a telltale symptom of OSA. Snoring is caused by air squeezing through the narrowed or blocked airway. Not everyone who snores has OSA.

Other factors also may increase your risk of sleep apnea:
A lower jaw that is short compared to your upper jaw
Certain shapes of the roof of your mouth (palate) or airway that cause it to collapse more easily
Large neck or collar size, 17 inches (in) or 43 centimeters (cm) or more in men and 16 in (41 cm) or more in women
Large tongue, which may fall back and block the airway
Obesity
Large
tonsils
and
adenoids
that can block the airway
Sleeping on your back can also cause your airway to become blocked or narrowed.
Central sleep apnea
is a different
sleep disorder
during which breathing also can stop. It occurs when the brain temporarily stops sending signals to the muscles that regulate breathing.
Symptoms
If you have OSA, you usually begin snoring heavily soon after falling asleep.
The snoring often becomes very loud.
Snoring may be interrupted by a long silent period while your breathing stops.
The silence is followed by a loud snort and gasp, as you attempt to breathe.
This pattern repeats throughout the night.
Most people with OSA do not know their breathing starts and stops during the night. Usually, a sleep partner or other family members hear the loud snoring, gasping, and snorting. Snoring can be loud enough to hear through walls. Sometimes, people with OSA wake up gasping for air.
People with sleep apnea may:
Wake up unrefreshed in the morning
Feel sleepy or drowsy throughout the day
Act grumpy, impatient, or irritable
Be forgetful
Fall asleep while working, reading, or watching TV
Feel sleepy while driving, or even fall asleep while driving
Have hard-to-treat headaches
Other problems that may occur include:
Depression
Hyperactive
behavior, especially in children
Difficult to treat
high blood pressure
Headaches
, especially in the morning
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will take your medical history and do a physical exam.
Your provider will check your mouth, neck, and throat.
You may be asked about daytime sleepiness, how well you sleep, and bedtime habits.
You will need to have a
sleep study
to confirm OSA. This testing can be done in your home or in a sleep lab.
Other tests that may be performed include:
Arterial blood gases
Electrocardiogram
(ECG)
Echocardiogram
Pulse oximetry
Thyroid function studies
Treatment
Treatment helps keep your airway open while you sleep so your breathing does not stop.
Lifestyle changes may help relieve symptoms in people with mild sleep apnea, such as:
Avoid alcohol or medicines that make you sleepy before bedtime. They can make symptoms worse.
Avoid sleeping on your back.
Lose excess weight.
Continuous positive airway pressure
(CPAP) devices work well to treat OSA in most people.
You wear a mask over your nose or over your nose and mouth while you sleep.
The mask is connected by a hose to a small machine that sits at the side of your bed.
The machine pumps air under pressure through the hose and mask and into your airway while you sleep. This helps keep your airway open.
It can take some time to get used to sleeping with CPAP therapy. Good follow-up and support from a sleep center can help you overcome any problems using CPAP.
Dental devices may help some people. You wear them in your mouth while you sleep to keep your jaw forward and the airway open.
Other treatments may be available, but there is less evidence that they work. It is best to talk with a provider who specializes in sleep problems before trying them.
In December 2024, the medicine tirzepatide (Zepbound) was approved by the US Food and Drug administration for treating moderate to severe OSA.
Surgery may be an option for some people. It is often a last resort if other treatments did not work and you have severe symptoms. Surgery may be used to:
Remove extra tissue at the back of the throat.
Correct problems with the structures in the face.
Create an opening in the windpipe to bypass the blocked airway if there are physical problems.
Remove the tonsils and adenoids.
Implant a pacemaker-like device that stimulates the muscles of the throat to stay open during sleep.
Surgery may not completely cure OSA and may have long-term side effects.
Outlook (Prognosis)
If not treated, sleep apnea may cause:
Anxiety and depression
Loss of interest in sex
Poor performance at work or school
Daytime sleepiness because of sleep apnea can increase the risk of:
Motor vehicle accidents from driving while sleepy
Industrial accidents from falling asleep on the job
In most cases, treatment completely relieves symptoms and problems from sleep apnea.
Possible Complications
Untreated OSA may lead to or worsen heart disease, including:
Heart arrhythmias
Heart failure
Heart attack
High blood pressure
Stroke
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
You feel very tired and sleepy during the day
You or your family notice symptoms of OSA
Symptoms do not improve with treatment, or new symptoms develop
