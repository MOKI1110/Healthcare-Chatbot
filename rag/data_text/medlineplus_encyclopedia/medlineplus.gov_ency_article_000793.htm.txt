Increased intracranial pressure

Increased intracranial pressure is a rise in the pressure inside the skull that can result from or cause brain injury.
Causes
Increased intracranial pressure can be due to a rise in the pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid. This is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. An increase in intracranial pressure can also be due to a rise in pressure within the brain itself. This can be caused by a mass (such as a tumor), bleeding into the brain or fluid around the brain, or swelling of the brain.
An increase in intracranial pressure may be a serious and life-threatening medical problem. The pressure can damage the brain or spinal cord by pressing on important structures and by restricting blood flow into the brain.
Many conditions can increase intracranial pressure. Common causes include:
Aneurysm
rupture and
subarachnoid hemorrhage
Brain tumor
Irritation and swelling, or inflammation of the brain (
encephalitis
)
Head injury
Increased fluid within the brain (
hydrocephalus
)
Bleeding in the brain from high blood pressure (hypertensive brain hemorrhage)
Bleeding into the fluid-filled areas, or ventricles, inside the brain (intraventricular hemorrhage)
Infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (
meningitis
)
Bleeding between the covering of the brain and the surface of the brain (
subdural hematoma
)
Bleeding between the inside of the skull and the outer covering of the brain (
epidural hematoma
)
Seizure
Stroke
Brain injury following a cardiac arrest
Clots in the veins of the brain (sinus thrombosis)
Idiopathic intracranial hypertension
Symptoms
Infants:
Drowsiness
Separated sutures
on the skull
Bulging of the soft spot on top of the head (bulging fontanelle)
Vomiting
Older children and adults:
Behavior changes
Decreased alertness
Headache
Lethargy
Nervous system symptoms, including weakness, numbness, eye movement problems, and double vision
Seizures
Vision changes or vision problems
Vomiting
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will usually make the diagnosis at your bedside in an emergency room or hospital. Primary care providers may sometimes spot early symptoms of increased intracranial pressure such as headache, seizures, or other nervous system problems.
An
MRI
or
CT scan
of the head can usually determine the cause of increased intracranial pressure and confirm the diagnosis.
Intracranial pressure may be measured during a
spinal tap
(lumbar puncture). It can also be measured directly by using a
device
that is drilled through the skull or a tube (catheter) that is inserted into a hollow area in the brain called the ventricle.
Treatment
Sudden increased intracranial pressure is an emergency. You will be treated in the intensive care unit of the hospital. Your health care team will measure and monitor your neurological and vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.
Treatment may include:
Breathing support
Draining of cerebrospinal fluid to lower pressure in the brain
Medicines to decrease swelling
Removal of part of the skull, especially in the first 2 days of a stroke that involves brain swelling
If a tumor, hemorrhage, or other problem has caused the increase in intracranial pressure, these problems will be treated.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Sudden increased intracranial pressure is a serious and often life-threatening condition. Prompt treatment results in a better outlook.
If the increased pressure pushes on important brain structures and blood vessels, it can lead to serious, permanent problems or even death.
Long-lasting increased intracranial pressure (such as with idiopathic intracranial hypertension) can result in permanent vision loss.
Prevention
Traumatic brain injury risk can be reduced by wearing appropriate protective headgear for contact sports, while riding a bicycle, and during similar activities. Otherwise, this condition usually cannot be prevented. If you have a persistent headache, blurred vision, changes in your level of alertness, nervous system problems, or seizures, seek medical help right away.
