Polycystic kidney disease

Polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is a kidney disorder passed down through families. In this disease, many cysts form in the kidneys, causing them to become enlarged.
Causes
PKD is passed down through families (inherited). The two inherited forms of PKD areÂ
autosomal dominant
Â and
autosomal recessive
.
People with PKD have many clusters of cysts in the kidneys. What exactly triggers the cysts to form is unknown.Â
PKD is associated with the following conditions:
Aortic aneurysms
Brain
aneurysms
Cysts in the liver, pancreas, and
testes
Diverticula
of the colon
As many as half of people with PKD have cysts in the liver.
Symptoms
Symptoms of PKD may include any of the following:
Abdominal pain
or tenderness
Blood in the urine
Excessive urination at night
(nocturia)
Flank pain
on one or both sides
Drowsiness
Joint pain
Nail abnormalities
Exams and Tests
An examination may show:
Abdominal tenderness
over the liver
Enlarged kidneys
Enlarged liver
Heart murmurs
or other signs of
aortic insufficiency
or mitral insufficiency
High blood pressure
Growths in the abdomen
Tests that may be done include:
Cerebral angiography
Complete blood count
(CBC) to check for anemia
Liver tests (blood)
Urinalysis
People with a personal or family history of PKD who have headaches should be tested to determine if cerebral aneurysms are the cause.
PKD and
cysts
on the liver or other organs may be found using the following tests:
Abdominal CT scan
Abdominal MRI
scan
Abdominal ultrasound
Intravenous pyelogram
(IVP)
If several members of your family have PKD, genetic tests can be done to determine whether you carry the PKD gene.
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to control symptoms and prevent complications. Treatment may include:
Blood pressure medicines
Diuretics (water pills)
Low-salt diet
Any urinary tract infection should be treated quickly with antibiotics.
Cysts that are painful, infected, bleeding, or causing a blockage may need to be drained. There are usually too many cysts to make it practical to remove each cyst.
Surgery to remove one or both kidneys may be needed. Treatments for
end-stage kidney disease
may include
dialysis
or a
kidney transplant
.
Support Groups
More information and support for people with polycystic kidney disease and their families can be found at aÂ
kidney disease support group
.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The disease gets worse slowly. Eventually, it may lead to end-stage
kidney failure
. It is also associated with
liver disease
, including infection of liver cysts.
Treatment may relieve symptoms for many years.
People with PKD who don't have other diseases may be good candidates for a kidney transplant.
Possible Complications
Health problems that may result from PKD include:
Anemia
Bleeding or rupture of cysts
Long-term (chronic) kidney disease
End-stage kidney disease
High blood pressure
Infection of liver cysts
Kidney stones
Liver failure (mild to severe)
Repeated
urinary tract infections
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if:
You have symptoms of PKD
You have a family history of PKD or related disorders and you are planning to have children (you may want to have genetic counseling)
Prevention
Currently, no treatment can prevent the cysts from forming or enlarging.
