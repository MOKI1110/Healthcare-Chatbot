Bile duct stricture

A bile duct stricture is an abnormal narrowing, most often of the common bile duct. This is a tube that moves
bile
from the liver to the small intestine. Bile is a substance that helps with digestion.
Causes
A bile duct stricture is often caused by injury to the bile ducts during surgery. For example, it may occur after surgery to remove the gallbladder.
Other causes of this condition include:
Cancer of the bile duct, liver or pancreas
Damage and scarring due to a
gallstone in the bile duct
Damage or scarring after gallbladder removal
Pancreatitis
Primary sclerosing cholangitis
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Abdominal pain
on the upper right side of belly
Chills
Fever
Itching
General feeling of discomfort
Loss of appetite
Jaundice
Nausea and vomiting
Pale or clay-colored stools
Exams and Tests
The following tests can help diagnose this condition:
Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)
Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram
(PTC)
Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)
Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS)
The following blood tests can help reveal a problem with the
biliary system
.
Alkaline phosphatase
(ALP) is higher than normal.
GGT enzyme level is higher than normal.
Bilirubin
level is higher than normal.
This condition may also alter the results of the following tests:
Amylase level
Lipase level
Urine bilirubin
Prothrombin time (
PT
)
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to correct theÂ narrowing. This will allow bile to flow from the liver into the intestine.
This may involve:
Surgery
Endoscopic or percutaneous dilation of the stricture or insertion of stents through the stricture
If surgery is done, the stricture is removed. The common bile duct will be rejoined with the small intestine.
In some cases, a tiny metal or plastic mesh tube (
stent
) is placed across the bile duct stricture to keep it open.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Treatment is successful most of the time. Long-term success depends on the cause of the stricture.
Possible Complications
Inflammation and narrowing of the biliary duct may return in some people. There is a risk for infection above the narrowed area. Strictures that remain for a long period can lead to liver damage (
cirrhosis
).
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if symptoms recur after pancreatitis,
cholecystectomy
, or other biliary surgery.
