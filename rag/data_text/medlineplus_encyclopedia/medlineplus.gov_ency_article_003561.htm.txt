Catecholamine blood test
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
This test measures the levels of catecholamines in the blood. Catecholamines are hormones made by the adrenal glands. The three catecholamines are epinephrine (adrenaline), norepinephrine, and dopamine.
Catecholamines are more often measured with a
urine test
than with a blood test.
How the Test is Performed
A
blood sample
is needed.
How to Prepare for the Test
You will likely be told not to eat anything (fast) for 10 hours before the test. You may be allowed to drink water during this time.
The accuracy of the test can be affected by certain foods and medicines. Foods that can increase catecholamine levels include:
Coffee
Tea
Bananas
Chocolate
Cocoa
Citrus fruits
Vanilla
You should not eat these foods for several days before the test. This is especially true if both blood and urine catecholamines are to be measured.
You should also avoid stressful situations and vigorous exercise. Both can affect the accuracy of the test results.
Medicines and substances that can increase catecholamine measurements include:
Acetaminophen
Albuterol
Aminophylline
Amphetamines
Buspirone
Caffeine
Calcium channel blockers
Cocaine
Cyclobenzaprine
Levodopa
Methyldopa
Nicotine
Nicotinic acid
(large doses)
Phenoxybenzamine
Phenothiazines
Pseudoephedrine
Reserpine
Tricyclic antidepressants
Medicines that can decrease catecholamine measurements include:
Clonidine
Guanethidine
Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors
If you take any of the above medicines, check with your health care provider before the blood test about whether you should stop taking your medicine.
How the Test will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel slight pain. Others feel a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.
Why the Test is Performed
Catecholamines are released into the blood when a person is under physical or emotional stress. The main catecholamines are dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine (which used to be called adrenalin).
This test is used to diagnose or check for certain rare tumors, such as
pheochromocytoma
or
neuroblastoma
. It may also be done in people with those conditions to determine if treatment is working.
Normal Results
The normal range for epinephrine is 0 to 140 pg/mL (0 to 764.3 pmol/L).
The normal range for norepinephrine is 70 to 1700 pg/mL (413.8 to 10048.7 pmol/L).
The normal range for dopamine is 0 to 30 pg/mL (0 to 195.8 pmol/L).
Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Higher-than-normal levels of blood catecholamines may suggest:
Acute anxiety
Ganglioblastoma
(very rare tumor)
Ganglioneuroma
(very rare tumor)
Neuroblastoma (rare tumor)
Pheochromocytoma (rare tumor)
Severe stress
Additional conditions under which the test may be performed include
multiple system atrophy
.
Risks
There is little risk in having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:
Excessive bleeding
Fainting or feeling lightheaded
Multiple punctures to locate veins
Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
Alternative Names
Norepinephrine - blood; Epinephrine - blood; Adrenaline - blood; Dopamine - blood
