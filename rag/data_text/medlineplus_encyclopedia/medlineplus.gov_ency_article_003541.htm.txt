Serum immunoelectrophoresis is a lab test that measures proteins called immunoglobulins in the blood. Immunoglobulins are proteins that function as
antibodies
, which fight infection. There are many types of immunoglobulins that fight different types of infections. Some immunoglobulins can be abnormal and may be due to some types of
cancer
.
Immunoglobulins can also be measured in the
urine
.
How the Test is Performed
A
blood sample is needed
.
How to Prepare for the Test
There is no special preparation for this test.
How the Test will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.
Why the Test is Performed
This test is most often used to check the types and amounts of immunoglobulins when certain cancers and other disorders are present or suspected.
Normal Results
A normal (negative) result means that the blood sample had normal types and amounts of immunoglobulins. The level ofÂ one immunoglobulin was not higher than any other.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Abnormal results may be due to:
Amyloidosis
(buildup of abnormal proteins in tissues and organs)
Leukemia
(cancer of the bone marrow)
WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia
(a type of lymphoma)
Lymphoma (cancer of the lymph tissue)
Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS, a type of blood disorder)
Multiple myeloma
(a type of blood cancer)
Other cancers
Infection
Risks
There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size fromÂ one person to another and fromÂ one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:
Excessive bleeding
Fainting
or feeling lightheaded
Multiple punctures to locate veins
Hematoma
(blood accumulating under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
Alternative Names
IEP - serum; Immunoglobulin electrophoresis - blood; Gamma globulin electrophoresis; Serum immunoglobulin electrophoresis; Amyloidosis - electrophoresis serum; Multiple myeloma - serum electrophoresis; WaldenstrÃ¶m - serum electrophoresis
