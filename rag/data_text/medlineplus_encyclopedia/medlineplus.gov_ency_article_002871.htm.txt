Your local
poison control center

This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive:
Activated charcoal
Blood and urine tests
Chest x-ray
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Fluids by IV (though the vein)
Laxatives
Medicines to treat symptoms

How well you do depends on the amount of poison swallowed, and how quickly treatment is received. The faster you get medical help, the better the chance for recovery.
Symptoms most often get better within 1 to 3 days, but hospitalization may be necessary. Death is uncommon.
DO NOT touch or eat any unfamiliar plant. Wash your hands after working in the garden or walking in the woods.
