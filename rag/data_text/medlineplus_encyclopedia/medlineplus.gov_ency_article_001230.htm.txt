Bone tumor

A bone
tumor
is an abnormal growth of cells within a bone. A bone tumor may be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (
benign
).
Causes
The cause of bone tumors is unknown. They often occur in areas of the bone that grow rapidly. Possible causes include:
Genetic defects passed down through families
Radiation
Injury
In most cases, no specific cause is found.
Osteochondromas are the most common noncancerous (benign) bone tumors. They occur most often in young people between the ages of 10 and 20.
Cancers that start in the bones are called primary bone tumors. Bone cancers that start in another part of the body (such as the breast, lungs, or colon) are called secondary or
metastatic
bone tumors. They behave very differently from primary bone tumors.
Cancerous primary bone tumors include:
Chondrosarcoma
Ewing sarcoma
Fibrosarcoma
Osteosarcoma
Cancers that most often spread to the bone are cancers of the:
Breast
Kidney
Lung
Prostate
Thyroid
These forms of cancer usually affect older people.
Bone cancer is more common in people who have a family history of cancers.
Symptoms
Symptoms of a bone tumor may include any of the following:
Bone fracture, especially from slight injury (trauma)
Bone pain
, may be worse at night
Occasionally a mass and swelling can be felt at the tumor site
Some benign tumors have no symptoms.
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will perform a physical exam. Tests that may be done include:
Alkaline phosphatase
blood level
Bone biopsy
Bone scan
Chest x-ray
CT scan of the chest
MRI
of the bone and surrounding tissue
X-ray of bone
and surrounding tissue
PET scan
The following tests may also be ordered to monitor the disease:
Alkaline phosphatase isoenzyme
Blood calcium level
Blood phosphorus
level
Treatment
Some benign bone tumors go away on their own and do not need treatment. Your provider will closely monitor you. You will likely need regular imaging tests, such as x-rays, to see if the tumor shrinks or grows.
Surgery may be needed to remove the tumor in some cases.
Treatment for cancerous bone tumors that have spread from other parts of the body depends on where the cancer started.
Radiation therapy
may be given to prevent fractures or to relieve pain.
Chemotherapy
may be used to prevent fractures or the need for surgery or radiation.
Tumors that start in the bone are rare. After biopsy, a combination of chemotherapy and surgery is usually necessary. Radiation therapy may be needed before or after surgery.
Support Groups
You can ease the stress of illness by joining a
cancer support group
. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well you do depends on the type of bone tumor.
The outcome is usually good in people with noncancerous (benign) tumors. But some benign bone tumors can turn into cancer.
People with cancerous bone tumors that have not spread may be cured. The cure rate depends on the type of cancer, location, size, and other factors. Talk to your provider about your particular cancer.
Possible Complications
Problems that may result from the tumor or treatment include:
Pain
Reduced function, depending on the tumor
Side effects of chemotherapy
Spread of the cancer to other nearby tissues (metastasis)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of a bone tumor.
