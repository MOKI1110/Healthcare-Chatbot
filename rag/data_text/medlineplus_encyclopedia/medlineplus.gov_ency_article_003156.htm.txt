Vaginal bleeding between periods

This article discusses vaginal bleeding that occurs between a woman's monthly menstrual periods. Such bleeding may be called "intermenstrual bleeding."
Related topics include:
Dysfunctional uterine bleeding
Heavy, prolonged, or irregular menstrual periods
Considerations
Normal menstrual flow lasts about 5 days. It produces a total blood loss of 30 to 80 mL (about 2 to 8 tablespoons), and occurs normally every 21 to 35 days.
Vaginal bleeding that occurs between periods or after menopause can be caused by various problems. Most are benign and can be easily treated. Sometimes, vaginal bleeding may be due to cancer or pre-cancer. Therefore, any unusual bleeding should be evaluated right away. The riskÂ for cancer increases to about 10% in women with postmenopausal bleeding.
Make sure that bleeding is coming from the
vagina
and is not from the rectum or the urine. Inserting a tampon into the vagina will confirm the vagina, cervix, or uterus as the source of bleeding.
A careful exam by your health care provider is most often the best way to find the source of the bleeding. This exam can be done even while you are bleeding.
Causes
Causes may include:
Uterine fibroids or cervical or uterine polyps
Changes in hormone levels
Inflammation or infection of the cervix (cervicitis)Â or uterus (endometritis)
Injury or disease of the vaginal opening (caused by intercourse, trauma, infection, polyp,
genital warts
, ulcer, or varicose veins)
IUD use (may cause occasional spotting)
Ectopic pregnancy
Miscarriage
Other pregnancy complications
Vaginal dryness due to lack of estrogen after
menopause
Stress
Using hormonal birth control irregularly (such as stopping and starting or skipping birth control pills, patches, or estrogen rings)Â
Underactive thyroid (low thyroid function)
Use of blood thinners (anticoagulants)
Cancer or pre-cancer of the cervix, uterus, or (very rarely) fallopian tube
Pelvic exam, cervical biopsy,Â endometrial biopsy, or other procedures
Home Care
Contact a provider right away if bleeding is very heavy.
Keep track of the number of pads or tampons used over time so that the amount of bleeding can be determined. Uterine blood loss can be estimated by keeping track of how frequently a pad or tampon is soaked and how often one needs to be changed.
If possible, aspirin should be avoided, as it may prolong bleeding. However, NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), such as ibuprofen can be used to minimize bleeding and cramping.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
You are pregnant.
There is any unexplained bleeding between periods.
There is any bleeding after menopause.
There is heavy bleeding with periods.
Abnormal bleeding is accompanied by other symptoms, such as pelvic pain, fatigue, dizziness.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
The provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions about your medical history. The physical exam will include a pelvic exam.
Questions about the bleeding may include:
When does the bleeding occur and how long does it last?
How heavy is the bleeding?
Do you have cramps too?
Are there things that make the bleeding worse?
Is there anything that prevents it or relieves it?
Do you have any other symptoms such as abdominal pain, bruising, pain when urinating, or
blood in urine
or
stools
?
Tests that may be done include:
Blood tests to check thyroid and ovarian function
Cervical cultures to check for a sexually transmitted infection
Colposcopy and cervical biopsy
Endometrial (uterine) biopsy
Pap smear
Pelvic ultrasound
Saline infusion sonohysterogram
Hysterosonogram
Hysteroscopy
Pregnancy test
Most causes of intermenstrual bleeding are easily treatable. The problem can most often be diagnosed without too much discomfort. Therefore, it is important not to delay in having this problem evaluated by your provider.
