Shoulder replacement is surgery to replace the bones of the shoulder joint with artificial joint parts.
Description
You will receive anesthesia before this surgery. Two types of anesthesia can be used:
General anesthesia
, which means you will be unconscious and unable to feel pain.
Regional anesthesia
to numb your arm and shoulder area so that you do not feel any pain in this area. If you receive only regional anesthesia, you will also be given medicine to help you relax during the operation.
The shoulder is a ball and socket joint. The round end of the arm bone fits into the opening at the end of the shoulder blade, called the socket. This type of joint allows you to move your arm in most directions.
For total shoulder replacement, the round end of your arm bone will be replaced with an artificial stem that has a rounded metal head (ball). The socket part (glenoid) of your shoulder bone will be replaced with a smooth plastic lining (socket) that will be held in place with special cement. If only 1 of these 2 bones needs to be replaced, the surgery is called a partial shoulder replacement, or a hemiarthroplasty.
Another type of procedure is called reverse total shoulder replacement. In this surgery, the positions of the ball and socket are switched. The round part of the shoulder is removed from the top of the arm, and a metal ball is attached to the shoulder bone. The socket is then attached to the arm bone. The ball ends up on the other side of the shoulder. This surgery can be done when the rotator cuff tendons are severely damaged or there are shoulder fractures.
For shoulder joint replacement, your surgeon will make an incision (cut) over your shoulder joint to open up the area. Then your surgeon will:
Remove the head (top) of your upper arm bone (humerus).
Place the new metal head and stem into place. It can sometimes be cemented in if the bone quality is poor.
Smooth the surface of the old socket and cement the new one in place.
Close your incision with staples or sutures.
Place a dressing (bandage) over your wound.
Your surgeon may place a tube in this area to drain fluid that may build up in the joint. The drain will be removed when you no longer need it.
This surgery normally takes 1 to 3 hours.
Why the Procedure is Performed
Shoulder replacement surgery is often done when you have severe pain in the shoulder area, which limits your ability to move your arm. Causes of shoulder pain include:
Osteoarthritis
Poor result from a previous shoulder surgery
Rheumatoid arthritis
Badly
broken bone
in the arm near the shoulder
Badly damaged or torn tissues in the shoulder
Tumor
in or around the shoulder
Your surgeon may not recommend this surgery if you have:
History of infection, which can spread to the replaced joint
Severe mental health illness
Unhealthy skin around the shoulder area
Very weak (rotator cuff) muscles around the shoulder that cannot be fixed during surgery
Risks
Risks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:
Reactions to medicines or
breathing problems
Bleeding
,
blood clot
, or infection
Risks of shoulder replacement surgery are:
Allergic reaction to the artificial joint
Blood vessel damage during surgery
Bone break during surgery
Nerve damage during surgery
Dislocation of the artificial joint
Loosening of the artificial joint over time
Before the Procedure
Tell your surgeon or nurse if:
You are or could be pregnant
You are taking any medicines, including illicit drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription
During the week before your surgery:
You may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.
Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.
If you have
diabetes
,
heart disease
, or other medical conditions, your surgeon may ask you to see your health care provider who treats you for these conditions.
Tell your surgeon if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 or 2 drinks a day.
If you smoke, it's important to cut back or quit. Smoking can slow healing and increase the risk for
blood clots
. Ask your provider for help
quitting smoking
.
If needed,
prepare your home
to make it easier to recover after surgery.
Let your surgeon know about any illness you may have before your surgery. This includes
COVID-19
, a
cold
,
flu
, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness. If you do get sick, your surgery may need to be postponed.
On the day of your surgery:
Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.
Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.
Arrive at the hospital on time.
After the Procedure
After the procedure:
You may stay in the hospital for 1 to 3 days after your surgery.
While there, you may receive physical therapy to help keep the muscles around your shoulder from getting stiff.
Before you go home, the physical therapist will teach you how to move your arm around by using your other (good) arm to help.
Your arm will need to be in a sling for 2 to 6 weeks with no active movement. Your surgeon will tell you what is right for you. It will be 12 weeks before you start strengthening exercises. It will be around 4 to 6 months of recovery.
Follow any instructions you are given about how to
care for your shoulder at home
. This includes activities that you should not do.
You will be given instructions on shoulder exercises to do at home. Follow these instructions exactly. Doing the exercises in a wrong way can injure your new shoulder.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Shoulder replacement surgery relieves pain and stiffness for most people. You should be able to resume your normal daily activities without much problem. Many people are able to return to sports such as golf, swimming, gardening, bowling, and others.
Your new shoulder joint will last longer if less stress is placed on it. With normal use, a new shoulder joint can last for at least 10 years.
