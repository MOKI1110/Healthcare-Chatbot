Scrotal swelling

Scrotal swelling is abnormal enlargement of the scrotum. This is the name for the sac surrounding the testicles.
Considerations
Scrotal swelling can occur in males at any age. The swelling can be on one or both sides, and there may be pain. The testicles and penis may or may not be involved.
In
testicular torsion
, the testicle becomes twisted in the
scrotum
and loses its blood supply. It is a serious emergency. If this twisting is not relieved quickly, the testicle may be permanently and completely damaged. This condition is extremely painful. Call 911 or the local emergency number, or see your health care provider immediately. Losing blood supply for just a few hours can cause tissue death and the loss of a testicle.
Causes
Causes of scrotal swelling include:
Certain medical treatments
Congestive heart failure
Epididymitis
Hernia
Hydrocele
Injury
Orchitis
Surgery in the genital area
Testicular torsion
Varicocele
Testicular cancer
Fluid retention
Home Care
Things you can do to help this problem include:
Apply ice packs to the scrotum for the first 24 hours, followed by
sitz baths
to decrease swelling. Don't apply the ice directly to the scrotum, rather place it in a towel or washcloth and apply that.
Elevate scrotum by placing a rolled up towel between your legs. It will help relieve pain and swelling.
Wear a loose-fitting athletic supporter for daily activities.
Avoid excessive activity until the swelling disappears.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
You notice any unexplained scrotal swelling.
The swelling is painful.
You have a
testicle lump
.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will perform a physical exam and take a medical history, which may include the following questions:
When did the swelling develop? Did it come on suddenly? Is it getting worse?
How big is the swelling (try to describe in terms such as "twice normal size" or "the size of a golf ball")?
Does the swelling appear to be fluid? Can you feel tissue in the swollen area?
Is the swelling in just one part of the scrotum or in the entire scrotum?
Is the swelling the same on both sides (sometimes a swollen scrotum is actually an enlarged testicle, a testicular lump, or a swollen duct)?
Have you had surgery, injury, or trauma in the genital area?
Have you had a recent genital infection?
Does the swelling go down after you rest in bed?
Do you have any other symptoms?
Is there any pain in the area around the scrotum?
The physical exam will include a detailed exam of the scrotum, testicles, and penis. The combination of a physical exam and history will determine whether you need any tests.
Your provider may prescribe antibiotics and pain medicines, or recommend surgery. A
scrotal ultrasound
may be done to find where the swelling is occurring.
