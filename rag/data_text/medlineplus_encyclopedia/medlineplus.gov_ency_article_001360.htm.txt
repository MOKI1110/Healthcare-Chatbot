Congenital toxoplasmosis is a group of symptoms that occur when an unborn baby (fetus) is infected with the parasite
Toxoplasma gondii
.
Causes
Toxoplasmosis infection can be passed to a developing baby if the mother becomes infected while pregnant. The infection spreads to the developing baby across the placenta. Most of the time, the infection is mild in the mother. The woman may not be aware she has the parasite. However, infection of the developing baby can cause serious problems. Problems are worse if the infection occurs in early pregnancy.
Symptoms
Up to half babies who become infected with toxoplasmosis during the pregnancy are born early (prematurely). The infection can damage the baby's eyes, nervous system, skin, and ears.
Often, there are signs of infection at birth. However, babies with mild infections may not have symptoms for months or years after birth. If not treated, most children with this infection develop problems in their teens. Eye problems are common.
Symptoms may include:
Enlarged liver and spleen
Vomiting
Eye damage from inflammation of the retina or other parts of the eye
Feeding problems
Hearing loss
Jaundice (yellow skin)
Low birth weight (intrauterine growth restriction)
Skin rash (tiny red spots or bruising) at birth
Vision problems
Brain and nervous system damage ranges from very mild to severe, and may include:
Seizures
Intellectual disability
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will examine the baby. The baby may have:
Swollen spleen and liver
Yellow skin (jaundice)
Inflammation of the eyes
Fluid on the brain (
hydrocephalus
)
Swollen lymph nodes (
lymphadenopathy
)
Large head size (
macrocephaly
) or smaller-than-normal head size (
microcephaly
)
Tests that may be done during pregnancy include:
Amniotic fluid
testing and
fetal blood testing
Antibody titer
Ultrasound of the abdomen
After birth, the following tests may be done on the baby:
Antibody studies on
cord blood
and cerebrospinal fluid
CT scan
of the brain
MRI scan
of the brain
Neurological exams
Standard eye exam
Toxoplasmosis test
Treatment
Spiramycin can treat infection in the pregnant mother.
Pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine can treat a fetal infection (diagnosed during the pregnancy).
Treatment of infants with congenital toxoplasmosis most often includes pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and leucovorin for one year. Infants are also sometimes given steroids if their vision is threatened or if the protein level in the spinal fluid is high.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome depends on the extent of the condition.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Hydrocephalus
Blindness
or severe visual disability
Severe intellectual disability or other neurological problems
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you are pregnant and think you are at risk for the infection. (For example, toxoplasmosis infection can be passed from cats if you clean the cat's litterÂ box.) Contact your provider if you are pregnant and have not had prenatal care.
Prevention
Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant can be tested to find out if they are at risk for the infection.
Pregnant women who have cats as house pets may be at higher risk. They should avoid contact with cat feces, or things that could be contaminated by insects exposed to cat feces (such as cockroaches and flies).
Also, cook meat until it is well done, and wash your hands after handling raw meat to avoid getting the parasite.
