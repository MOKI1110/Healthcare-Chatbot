Aspiration pneumonia

Pneumonia is inflammation (swelling) and infection of the lungs or large airways.
Aspiration pneumonia occurs when food or liquid is breathed into the airways or lungs, instead of being swallowed.
Causes
Risk factors for breathing in (
aspiration
) of foreign material into the lungs are:
Being less alert due to medicines, illness, surgery, or other reasons
Coma
Drinking large amounts of alcohol
Taking illicit drugs (such as opioids) which make you less alert
Receiving medicine to put you into a deep sleep for surgery (
general anesthesia
)
Old age
Poor gag reflex in people who are not alert (unconscious or semi-conscious) after a stroke or brain injury
Problems with swallowing
Eating or being fed when not upright
Being hospitalized can increase the risk for this condition.
Materials that may be breathed into the lungs include:
Saliva
Vomit
Liquids
Foods
The type of bacteria that causes the pneumonia depends on:
Your health
Where you live (at home or in a long-term nursing facility, for example)
Whether you were recently hospitalized
Your recent antibiotic use
Whether your immune system is weakened
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Chest pain
Coughing up foul-smelling, greenish or dark phlegm (sputum), or phlegm that contains pus or blood
Fatigue
Fever
Shortness of breath
Wheezing
Breath odor
Excessive sweating
Problems swallowing
Confusion
Seeing food or tube feed material (if being fed artificially) in your sputum
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will use a stethoscope to listen for crackles or abnormal breath sounds in your chest. Tapping on your chest wall (percussion) helps the provider listen and feel for abnormal sounds in your chest.
If pneumonia is suspected, your provider will likely order a
chest x-ray
.
The following tests also may help diagnose this condition:
Arterial blood gas
Blood culture
Bronchoscopy
Â (uses a special scope to view the lung airways) in some cases
Complete blood count (
CBC
)
X-rays or
CT scan
of the chest
Sputum culture
Swallowing tests
Treatment
Some people may need to be hospitalized. Treatment depends on how severe the pneumonia is and how ill the person is before the aspiration (chronic illness). Sometimes a
ventilator (breathing machine)
is needed to support breathing.
You will likely receive antibiotics.
You may need to have your swallowing function tested. People who have trouble swallowing may need to use other feeding methods to reduce the risk of aspiration.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Outcome depends on:
The health of the person before getting pneumonia
The type of bacteria causing the pneumonia
How much of the lungs are involved
More severe infections may result in long-term damage to the lungs.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Lung
abscess
Shock
Spread of infection to the bloodstream (
bacteremia
)
Spread of infection to other areas of the body
Respiratory failure
Death
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider, go to the emergency room, or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have:
Chest pain
Chills
Fever
Shortness of breath
Bluish discoloration of the lips or tongue (cyanosis)
Wheezing
