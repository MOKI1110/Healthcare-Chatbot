Reye syndrome

Reye syndrome is characterized by sudden (acute) brain damage and liver function problems. This condition does not have a known cause.
This syndrome has occurred in children who were given aspirin when they had chickenpox or the flu. Reye syndrome has become very rare. This is because aspirin is no longer recommended for routine use in children.
Causes
There is no known cause of Reye syndrome. It is most often seen in children ages 4 to 12. Most cases that occur with chickenpox are in children ages 5 to 9. Cases that occur with the flu are most often in children ages 10 to 14.
Symptoms
Children with Reye syndrome get sick very suddenly. The syndrome often begins with vomiting. It may last for many hours. The vomiting is quickly followed by irritable and aggressive behavior. As the condition gets worse, the child may be unable to stay awake and alert.
Other symptoms of Reye syndrome:
Confusion
Lethargy
Loss of consciousness or coma
Mental changes
Nausea and vomiting
Seizures
Unusual placement of arms and legs (
decerebrate posture
). The arms are extended straight and turned toward the body, the legs are held straight, and the toes are pointed downward
Other symptoms that can occur with this disorder include:
Double vision
Hearing loss
Muscle function loss
or paralysis of the arms or legs
Speech difficulties
Weakness
in the arms or legs
Exams and Tests
The following tests may be used to diagnose Reye syndrome:
Blood chemistry tests
Head CT
or
head MRI scan
Liver biopsy
Liver function tests
Serum ammonia test
Spinal tap
Treatment
There is no specific treatment for this condition. The health care provider will monitor the pressure in the brain,
blood gases
, and blood acid-base balance (pH).
Treatments may include:
Breathing support (a breathing machine may be needed during a deep coma)
Fluids by IV to provide
electrolytes
and glucose
Steroids to reduce
swelling
in the brain
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well a person does depends on the severity of any coma, as well as other factors.
The outcome for those who survive an
acute
episode may be good.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Coma
Permanent brain damage
Seizures
When untreated, seizures and coma may be life threatening.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) immediately if your child has:
Confusion
Lethargy
Other mental changes
Prevention
Never give a child aspirin unless told to do so by your child's provider.
When a child must take aspirin for a medical condition, take care to reduce the child's risk of catching a viral illness, such as the flu and chickenpox. Avoid aspirin for several weeks after the child has received a varicella (chickenpox) vaccine.
Note
: Other over-the-counter medicines, such as Pepto-Bismol and substances with oil of wintergreen also contain aspirin-like compounds called salicylates. DO NOT give these to a child who has a cold or fever.
