Hydromorphone is a prescription medicine used to relieve severe pain. Hydromorphone overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose.
This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with has an
overdose
, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.
Poisonous Ingredient
Hydromorphone is a type of morphine. Hydromorphone is an opioid narcotic, which means it is an extremely powerful medicine that can cause very deep sleep.
People who take hydromorphone for pain should not drink alcohol. Combining alcohol with this medicine increases the chance for dangerous side effects and overdose symptoms.

This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the container to the hospital with you, if possible.
The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.
Tests that may be done include:
Blood and urine tests
Chest x-ray
CT scan
(computerized tomography or advanced imaging)
Electrocardiogram
(ECG)
Treatment may include:
Fluids through a vein (by IV)
Medicine to reverse the effect of the hydromorphone and treat symptoms
Activated charcoal
Laxative
Breathing support, including a tube through the mouth into the lungs and connected to a
breathing machine
(ventilator)
Outlook (Prognosis)
People who quickly receive medicine (called an antidote) to reverse the effect of hydromorphone can recover within 1 to 4 hours. They may need to stay in the hospital for more doses of the antidote.
Complications such as pneumonia, muscle damage from lying on a hard surface for a long period of time, or brain damage from lack of oxygen may result in permanent disability. However, unless there are complications, long-term effects and death are rare.
