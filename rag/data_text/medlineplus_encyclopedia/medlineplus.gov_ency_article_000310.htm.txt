Drug-induced
low blood sugar
is low blood glucose that results from taking medicine.
Causes
Low blood sugar
(hypoglycemia) is common in people with diabetes who are taking insulin or other medicines to control their diabetes.
Other than certain medicines, the following can also cause blood sugar (glucose) level to drop:
Drinking alcohol
Getting more activity than usual
Intentionally or unintentionally overdosing on the medicines used to treat diabetes
Missing meals
Even when diabetes is managed very carefully, the medicines used to treat diabetes can result in drug-induced low blood sugar. The condition may also occur when someone without diabetes takes a medicine used to treat diabetes. In rare cases, non-diabetes-related medicines can cause low blood sugar.
Medicines that can cause drug-induced low blood sugar include:
Beta-blockers (such as atenolol, or propranolol overdose)
Cibenzoline and quinidine (heart arrhythmia medicines)
Glinides (such as nateglinide and repaglinide)
Indomethacin (a pain reliever)
Insulin
Metformin when used with sulfonylureas
SGLT2 inhibitors (such as canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, empagliflozin and ertugliflozin) with or without sulfonylureas
Sulfonylureas (such as glipizide, glimepiride, glyburide)
Thiazolidinediones (such as pioglitazone and rosiglitazone) when used with sulfonylureas
Drugs that fight infections (such as gatifloxacin, levofloxacin, pentamidine, quinine, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole)
Alternative Names
Hypoglycemia - drug-induced; Low blood glucose - drug-induced
