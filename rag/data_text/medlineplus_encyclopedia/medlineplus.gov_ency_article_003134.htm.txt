Increased appetite means you have an excess desire for food.
Considerations
An increased appetite can be a symptom of different diseases. For example, it may be due to a mental condition or a problem with an
endocrine gland
.
An increased appetite can come and go (intermittent), or it can last for long periods of time (persistent). This will depend on the cause. It does not always result in weight gain.
The terms "hyperphagia" and "polyphagia" refer to someone who is focused only on eating, or who eats a large amount before feeling full.
Causes
Causes may include:
Anxiety
Certain medicines (such as corticosteroids, cyproheptadine, and tricyclic antidepressants)
Bulimia
(most common in women 18 to 30 years old)
Diabetes mellitus
(including
gestational diabetes
)
Graves disease
Hyperthyroidism
Hypoglycemia
Premenstrual syndrome
Home Care
Emotional support is recommended. Counseling may be needed in some cases.
If a medicine is causing increased appetite and weight gain, your health care provider may decrease your dose or have you try another medicine. Do not stop taking your medicine without talking to your provider.
