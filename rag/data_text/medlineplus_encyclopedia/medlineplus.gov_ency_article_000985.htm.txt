Volvulus - childhood

A volvulus is a twisting of the intestine that can occur in childhood. It causes a blockage that may cut off blood flow. Part of the intestine may be damaged as a result.
Causes
A birth defect called intestinal malrotation can make an infant more likely to develop a volvulus. However, a volvulus can occur without this condition present.
Volvulus due to malrotation occurs most often in the first year of life.
Symptoms
Common symptoms of volvulus are:
Bloody or
dark red stools
Constipation
or difficulty releasing stools
Distended abdomen
Pain or tenderness in the abdomen
Nausea or vomiting
Shock
Vomiting green material
Symptoms are very often severe and require emergency care. Early treatment can be critical for survival.
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider may order the following tests to diagnose the condition:
Barium enema
Blood tests to check
electrolytes
, infection, blood count, and others
CT scan
Stool test for occult blood
(shows small amounts of blood in the stool)
Upper GI
series
Treatment
In some cases,
colonoscopy
can be used to correct the problem. This involves use of a flexible tube with a light on the end that is passed into the colon (large bowel) through the rectum.
Emergency surgery is often needed to repair the volvulus. A surgical cut is made in the abdomen. The bowels are untwisted and the blood supply is restored.
If a small segment of bowel is dead from a lack of blood flow (necrotic), it is removed. The ends of the bowel are then sewn together. Or, they are used to form a connection of the intestines to the outside of the body (colostomy or ileostomy). Bowel contents can be removed through this opening.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Most of the time, prompt diagnosis and treatment of volvulus leads to a good outcome.
If part of the bowel is dead, the outlook is poor. The situation may be fatal, depending on how much of the bowel is dead.
Possible Complications
Possible complications of volvulus are:
Secondary peritonitis
(an infection in the abdomen)
Short bowel syndrome
(problems that happen after removal of a large part of the small bowel)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
This is an emergency condition. The symptoms of childhood volvulus develop quickly and the child will become very ill. Get medical attention right away if this happens.
