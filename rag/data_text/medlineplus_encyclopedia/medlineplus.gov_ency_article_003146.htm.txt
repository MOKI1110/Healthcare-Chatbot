Urination - excessive amount

Excessive amount of urination means that your body makes larger than normal amounts of urine each day.
Causes
An excessive volume of urination for an adult is more than 2.5 liters (about 67 fluid ounces or about 2.6 quarts) of urine per day. However, this can vary depending on how much water you drink and what your total body water is. This problem is different from needing to urinate often.
Polyuria is a fairly common symptom. People often notice the problem when they have to get up during the night to use the toilet (nocturia).
Some common causes of the problems are:
Diabetes insipidus
Diabetes mellitus
Drinking excessive amounts of water
Less common causes include:
Kidney failure
Medicines such as diuretics and lithium
High or low calcium level in the body
Drinking alcohol and caffeine
Sickle cell anemia
Also, your urine production may increase for 24 hours after having tests that involve injecting a special dye (contrast medium) into your vein during imaging tests such as a
CT scan
or an
MRI scan
.
Home Care
To monitor your urine output, keep a daily record of the following:
How much and what you drink
How often you urinate and how much urine you produce each time
How much you weigh (use the same scale every day)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you have excessive urination over several days, and it is not explained by medicines you take or drinking more fluids.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions such as:
When did the problem start and has it changed over time?
How often do you urinate during the daytime and overnight? Do you get up at night to urinate?
Do you have problems controlling your urine?
What makes the problem worse? Better?
Have you noticed any blood in your urine or change in urine color?
Do you have any other symptoms (such as pain, burning, fever, or abdominal pain)?
Do you have a history of diabetes, kidney disease, or
urinary infections
?
What medicines do you take?
How much salt do you eat? Do you drink alcohol and caffeine?
Tests that may be done include:
Blood sugar
(glucose) test
Blood urea nitrogen

Creatinine
(serum)
Electrolytes

Fluid deprivation test (limiting fluids to see if the urine volume decreases)
