Skull x-ray

A skull
x-ray
is a picture of the bones surrounding the brain, including the facial bones, the nose, and the sinuses.
How the Test is Performed
You lie on the x-ray table or sit in a chair. Your head may be placed in different positions.
How to Prepare for the Test
Tell your health care provider if you are pregnant or think you are pregnant. Remove all jewelry.
How the Test will Feel
There is little or no discomfort during an x-ray. If there is a
head injury
, positioning the head may be uncomfortable. You may need to wear a lead cover over your thyroid gland (neck).
Why the Test is Performed
Your provider may order this x-ray if you have injured your skull. You may also have this x-ray if you have symptoms or signs of a structural problem inside the skull, such as a
tumor
or bleeding.
A skull x-ray is also used to evaluate an unusually shaped child's head.
Other conditions for which the test may be performed include:
Teeth are not aligned properly (
malocclusion of teeth
)
Infection of the mastoid bone (
mastoiditis
)
Occupational hearing loss
Middle ear infection (
otitis media
)
Abnormal bone growth in the middle ear that causes hearing loss (
otosclerosis
)
Pituitary tumor
Sinus infection (
sinusitis
)
Sometimes skull x-rays are used to screen for foreign bodies that may interfere with other tests, such as an
MRI scan
.
A
CT scan of the head
is usually preferred to a skull x-ray to evaluate most head injuries or brain disorders. Skull x-rays are rarely used as the main test to diagnose such conditions.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Abnormal results may be due to:
Fracture
Tumor
Breakdown (erosion) or calcium loss of the bone
Movement of the soft tissues inside the skull
A skull x-ray may detect
increased intracranial pressure
and unusual skull structures that are present at birth (congenital).
Risks
There is low radiation exposure. X-rays are monitored and regulated to provide the minimum amount of radiation exposure needed to produce the image. Most experts feel that the risk is low compared with the benefits. Pregnant women and children are more sensitive to the risks associated with x-rays.
