Fibrinopeptide A blood test
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Fibrinopeptide A is a substance released as blood clots in your body. A test can be done to measure the level of this substance in your blood.
How the Test is Performed
A
blood sample
is needed.
How to Prepare for the Test
No special preparation is necessary.
How the Test will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.
Why the Test is Performed
This test is used to help diagnose severe problems with blood clotting, such as
disseminated intravascular coagulation
(DIC). Certain types of
leukemia
are associated with DIC.
Normal Results
In general, the level of fibrinopeptide A should range from 0.6 to 1.9 (mg/mL).
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
An increased fibrinopeptide A level may be a sign of:
DIC
Leukemia at the time of diagnosis, during early treatment, and during a relapse
Some infections
Systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE)
Blood clotting
Risks
There is little risk in having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Drawing blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:
Excessive bleeding
Fainting or feeling lightheaded
Multiple punctures to locate veins
Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
Alternative Names
FPA
