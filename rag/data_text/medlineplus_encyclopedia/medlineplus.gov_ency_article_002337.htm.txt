The uvea is the middle layer of the eye. It lies beneath the white part of the eye (the
sclera
). It is made of the
iris
,
ciliary body
, and
choroid
. These structures control many eye functions, including adjusting to different levels of light or distances of objects. Inflammation of one or more of these structures is called uveitis.
