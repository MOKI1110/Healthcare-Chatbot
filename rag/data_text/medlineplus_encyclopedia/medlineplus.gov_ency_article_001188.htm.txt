Parathyroid adenoma

A parathyroid adenoma is a noncancerous (
benign
) tumor of the parathyroid glands. The parathyroid glands are located in the neck, near or attached to the back side of the thyroid gland.
Causes
The parathyroid glands in the neck help regulate calcium absorption, use, and removal by the body. They do this by producing parathyroid hormone, or PTH. PTH helps regulate calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the blood and bone. It is important for healthy bones.
Parathyroid adenomas are common. Most parathyroid adenomas do not have an identified cause. Sometimes a genetic problem is the cause. This is more common if the diagnosis is made when you are young.
Parathyroid adenomas may occur in people without a family history of the disease, or as part of 3 inherited syndromes:
Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I
Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) IIA
Isolated familial hyperparathyroidism
In people with an inherited syndrome, a changed (variant) gene is passed down through the family. You only need to get the gene from one parent to develop the condition.
In MEN I, problems in the parathyroid glands occur, as well as tumors in the pituitary gland and pancreas.
In MEN IIA, overactivity of the parathyroid glands occurs, along with tumors in the adrenal or thyroid gland.
Conditions that stimulate the parathyroid glands to get bigger can also cause an adenoma. These include:
Genetic disorders
Taking the medicine lithium
Chronic kidney disease
Women over age 60 have the highest risk for developing this condition. Radiation to the head or neck also increases the risk.
Symptoms
Many people have no symptoms. The condition is often discovered when blood tests are done for another medical reason.
Parathyroid adenomas are the most common cause of
hyperparathyroidism
(overactive parathyroid glands), which leads to an increased blood calcium level. Symptoms may include any of the following:
Confusion
Constipation
Lack of energy (
lethargy
)
Muscle pain
Nausea
or decreased appetite
Urinating more often at night
Weak bones or
fractures
Exams and Tests
Blood tests may be done to check levels of:
PTH
Calcium
Creatinine, BUN (
kidney function tests
)
Magnesium
Phosphorus
Vitamin D
24-hour urine test - done to determine how much calcium is being filtered out of the body into the urine
Alkaline phosphatase
Other tests include:
Bone density exam
Kidney
ultrasound
or
CT scan
(may show kidney stones or calcification)
Kidney
x-rays
(may show kidney stones)
MRI
Neck ultrasound
Sestamibi neck scan (to identify the location of the parathyroid adenoma)
Treatment
Surgery is the most common treatment, and it often cures the condition. But, some people choose to only have regular checkups with their health care provider if the condition is mild.
To help improve the condition, your provider may ask you to stop taking calcium and vitamin D supplements. Women who have gone through menopause may want to discuss treatment with estrogen or other medicines to prevent bone loss.
Outlook (Prognosis)
When treated, outlook is generally good.
Possible Complications
Osteoporosis
and the increased risk for bone fractures is the most common concern.
Other complications are less common, but may include:
Calcium deposits in the kidneys that can reduce kidney function (
nephrocalcinosis
)
Softened, weak areas in the bones (
osteitis fibrosa
)
Complications from surgery include:
Damage to a nerve that controls your voice
Damage to the parathyroid glands, which causes
hypoparathyroidism
(lack of enough parathyroid hormone) and low calcium level
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of this condition.
