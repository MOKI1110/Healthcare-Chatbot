An antiparietal cell antibody test is a blood test that looks for
antibodies
against the parietal cells of the stomach. The parietal cells make and release a substance called intrinsic factor that the body needs to absorb vitamin B12.
How the Test is Performed
A
blood sample
is needed.
How to Prepare for the Test
No special preparation is necessary.
How the Test will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.
Why the Test is Performed
Your health care provider may use this test to help diagnose
pernicious anemia
. Pernicious anemia is a decrease in red blood cells that occurs when your intestines cannot properly absorb vitamin B12. Other tests are also used to help with the diagnosis.
Normal Results
A normal result is called a negative result.
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
An abnormal result is called a positive result. This may be due to:
Atrophic
gastritis
(inflammation of the stomach lining)
Diabetes
Gastric ulcer
Thyroid disease
Risks
There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:
Excessive bleeding
Fainting
or feeling lightheaded
Multiple punctures to locate veins
Hematoma
(blood buildup under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
Alternative Names
APCA; Anti-gastric parietal cell antibody; Atrophic gastritis - anti-gastric parietal cell antibody; Gastric ulcer - anti-gastric parietal cell antibody; Pernicious anemia - anti-gastric parietal cell antibody; Vitamin B12 - anti-gastric parietal cell antibody
