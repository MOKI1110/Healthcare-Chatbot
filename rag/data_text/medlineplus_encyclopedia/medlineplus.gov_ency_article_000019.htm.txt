Broken or dislocated jaw
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
A broken jaw is a break (fracture) in the jaw bone. A dislocated jaw means the lower part of the jaw has moved out of its normal position at one or both joints where the jaw bone connects to the skull (temporomandibular joints). A jaw bone joint is called the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).
Considerations
A broken or dislocated jaw usually heals well after treatment. But the jaw may become dislocated again in the future.
Complications may include:
Airway blockage
Bleeding
Breathing blood or food into the lungs
Difficulty eating (temporary)
Difficulty talking (temporary)
Infection of the jaw or face
Pain of the jaw joint
(TMJ) pain and other problems
Numbness of part of the jaw or face
Problems aligning the teeth
Swelling
Causes
The most common cause of a broken or dislocated jaw is injury to the face. This may be due to:
Assault
Industrial accident
Motor vehicle accident
Recreational or sports injury
Trips and falls
After a dental or medical procedure
Symptoms
Symptoms of a broken jaw include:
Pain in the face or jaw, located in front of the ear or on the affected side,Â that gets worse with movement
Bruising and swelling of the face, bleeding from the mouth
Difficulty chewing
Misaligned teeth or jaw
Jaw stiffness, difficulty opening the mouth widely, or problem closing the mouth
Jaw moving to one side when opening
Jaw tenderness or pain, worse with biting or chewing
Loose or damaged teeth
Lump or abnormal appearance of the cheek or jaw
Numbness of the face (particularly the lower lip)
Ear pain
Symptoms of a dislocated jaw include:
Pain in the face or jaw, located in front of the ear or on the affected side that gets worse with movement
Bite that feels "off" or crooked
Problems talking
Inability to close the mouth
Drooling because of inability to close the mouth
Locked jaw or jaw that protrudes forward
Teeth that do not line up properly
First Aid
A person with a broken or dislocated jaw needs medical attention right away. This is because they may have breathing problems or bleeding. Call 911 or the local emergency number or a local hospital for further advice.
Hold the jaw gently in place with your hands on the way to the emergency room. You can also wrap a bandage under the jaw and over the top of the head. The bandage should be easy to remove in case you need to vomit.
At the hospital, if you have breathing problems, heavy bleeding occurs, or severe swelling of your face, a tube may be placed into your airway to help you breathe.
FRACTURED JAW
Treatment for a fractured jaw depends on how badly the bone is broken. If you have a minor fracture, it can heal on its own. You may only need pain medicines. You will probably have to eat soft foods or stay on a
liquid diet
for a while.
Surgery is often needed for moderate to severe fractures. The jaw may be wired to the teeth of the opposite jaw to keep the jaw stable while it heals. Jaw wires are usually left in place for 6 to 8 weeks. Small rubber bands (elastics) are used to hold the teeth together. After a few weeks, some of the elastics are removed to allow motion and reduce joint stiffness.
If the jaw is wired, you can only drink liquids or eat very soft foods. You must have blunt scissors readily available to cut the elastics in the event of vomiting or choking. If the wires must be cut, call your health care provider right away so that the wires can be replaced.
DISLOCATED JAW
If your jaw is dislocated, the provider may be able to place it back into the correct position using the thumbs. Numbing medicines (anesthetics) and muscle relaxants may be needed to relax the jaw muscles.
Afterward, your jaw may need to be stabilized. This usually involves bandaging the jaw to keep the mouth from opening widely. In some cases, surgery is needed to do this, particularly if repeated jaw dislocations occur.
After dislocating your jaw, you should not open your mouth widely for at least 6 weeks. Support your jaw with one or both hands when yawning and sneezing.
DO NOT
DoÂ not try to correct the position of the jaw. A provider should do this.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
A broken or dislocated jaw requiresÂ prompt medical attention. Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing or heavy bleeding.
Prevention
During work, sports, and recreation activities, using safety equipment, such as a helmet when playing football, or using mouth guards can prevent or minimize some injuries to the face or jaw.
