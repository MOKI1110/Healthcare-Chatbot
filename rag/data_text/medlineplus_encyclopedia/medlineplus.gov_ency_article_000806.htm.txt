Irregular sleep-wake syndrome

Irregular sleep-wake syndrome is sleeping without any real schedule.
Causes
This disorder is very rare. It usually occurs in people with a brain function problem who also don't have a regular routine during the day. The total sleep time is normal, but the body clock loses its normal circadian cycle.
People with changing work shifts and travelers who often change time zones may also have these symptoms. These people have a different condition, such as shift work sleep disorder or
jet lag syndrome
.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Sleeping or napping more than usual during the day
Trouble falling asleep and staying asleep at night
Waking up often during the night
Exams and Tests
A person must have at least 3 abnormal sleep-wake episodes during a 24-hour period to be diagnosed with this problem. The time between episodes is usually 1 to 4 hours.
If the diagnosis is not clear, your health care provider may prescribe a device called an actigraph. The device looks like a wristwatch, and it can tell when a person is sleeping or awake.
Your provider may ask you to keep a sleep diary. This is a record of what times you go to bed and wake up. The diary allows your provider to assess your sleep-wake cycle patterns.
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to help the person return to a normal sleep-wake cycle. This may involve:
Setting up a regular daytime schedule of activities and mealtimes.
Not staying in bed during the day.
Using bright light therapy in the morning and taking melatonin at bedtime. (In older people, especially those with dementia, sedatives such as melatonin are not advised.)
Making sure the room is dark and quiet at night.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome is often good with treatment. But some people continue to have this disorder, even with treatment.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Most people have sleep disturbances on occasion. If this type of irregular sleep-wake pattern occurs regularly and without cause, see your provider.
