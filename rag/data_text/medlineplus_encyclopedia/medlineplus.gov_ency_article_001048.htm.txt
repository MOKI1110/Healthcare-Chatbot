Occupational hearing loss

Occupational hearing loss is damage to the inner ear from noise or vibrations due to certain types of jobs.
Causes
Over time, repeated exposure to loud noise or music can cause hearing loss.
Watch this video about:
Hearing and the cochlea
Sounds above 80 decibels (dB, a measurement of the loudness or strength of sound vibration) may cause vibrations intense enough to damage the inner ear. This is more likely to happen if the sound continues for a long time.
Examples of sound intensity are:
90 dB -- a large truck 5 yards (4.5 meters) away (motorcycles, snowmobiles, and similar engines range from 85 to 90 dB)
100 dB -- some rock concerts
120 dB -- a jackhammer about 3 feet (1 meter) away
130 dB -- a jet engine from 100 feet (30 meters) away
A general rule of thumb is that if you need to shout to be heard, the sound is in the range that can damage hearing.
Some jobs carry a high risk for
hearing loss
, such as:
Airline ground maintenance
Construction
Farming
Jobs involving loud music or machinery
Military jobs that involve combat, aircraft noise, or other posts with loud noises
In the United States, laws regulate the maximum job noise exposure that it is allowed. Both the length of exposure and decibel level are considered. If the sound is at or greater than the maximum levels recommended, you need to take steps to protect your hearing.
Symptoms
The main symptom is partial or complete hearing loss. The hearing loss will likely get worse over time with continued exposure.
Noise in the ear (
tinnitus
) may accompany hearing loss.
Exams and Tests
A physical exam will not show any specific changes in most cases. Tests that may be done include:
Audiology/audiometry
CT scan of the head
MRI of the brain
Treatment
The hearing loss is very often permanent. The goals of treatment are to:
Prevent further hearing loss
Improve communication with any remaining hearing
Develop coping skills (such as lip reading)
You may need to
learn to live with hearing loss
. There are techniques you can learn to improve communication and avoid stress. Many things in your surroundings can affect how well you hear and understand what others are saying.
Using a hearing aid may help you understand speech. You can also use
other devices
to help with hearing loss. If the hearing loss is severe enough, a
cochlear implant
may help.
Protecting your ears from any further damage and hearing loss is a key part of treatment. Protect your ears when you are exposed to loud noises. Wear ear plugs or earmuffs to protect against damage from loud equipment.
Be aware of risks connected with recreation such as shooting a gun, driving snowmobiles, or other similar activities.
Learn how to protect your ears when listening to music at home or concerts.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Hearing loss is often permanent. The loss may get worse if you don't take measures to prevent further damage.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if:
You have hearing loss
The hearing loss gets worse
You develop other new symptoms
Prevention
The following steps can help prevent hearing loss.
Protect your ears when you are exposed to loud noises. Wear proper protective ear plugs or earmuffs when you are around loud equipment.
Be aware of the risks to hearing from recreational activities such as shooting a gun or driving snowmobiles.
DO NOT listen to loud music for long periods of time, including using headphones.
