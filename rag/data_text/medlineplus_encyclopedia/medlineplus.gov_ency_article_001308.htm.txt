Burkitt lymphoma (BL) is a very fast growing form of
non-Hodgkin lymphoma
.
Causes
BL was first discovered in children in certain parts of Africa. It also occurs in the United States.
The African type of BL is closely associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the main cause of
infectious mononucleosis
. The North American form of BL is not commonly linked to EBV.
People with HIV/AIDS have an increased risk for this condition. BL is most often seen in males.
Symptoms
BL may first be noticed as a
swelling of the lymph nodes
(glands) in the head and neck. These swollen lymph nodes are often painless, but can grow very rapidly.
In the types commonly seen in the United States, the
cancer
often starts in the belly area (abdomen). The disease can also start in the ovaries, testes, brain, kidneys, liver, and spinal fluid.
Other general symptoms may include:
Fever
Night sweats
Unexplained weight loss
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. Tests that may be done include:
Bone marrow biopsy
Chest x-ray
CT scan of the chest
,
abdomen
, and
pelvis
Complete blood count (CBC)
Examination of the spinal fluid
Lymph node biopsy
MRI of the abdomen or other affected body area
PET scan
Treatment
Chemotherapy
is used to treat this type of cancer. If the cancer does not respond to chemotherapy alone, a
bone marrow transplant
may be done.
Outlook (Prognosis)
More than one half of people with BL can be cured with intensive chemotherapy. The cure rate may be lower if the cancer spreads to the bone marrow or spinal fluid. The outlook is poor if the cancer comes back after a remission or does not go into remission as a result of the first cycle of chemotherapy.
Possible Complications
Possible complications of BL include:
Complications of treatment
Spread of the cancer
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of BL.
