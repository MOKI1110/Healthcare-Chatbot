Sarcoidosis

Sarcoidosis is a disease in which inflammation occurs in the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, eyes, skin, and/or other tissues.
Causes
The exact cause of sarcoidosis is unknown. What is known is that when a person has the disease, tiny clumps of abnormal tissue (granulomas) form in certain organs of the body. Granulomas are clusters of immune cells.
The disease can affect almost any organ. It most commonly affects the lungs.
Health experts think that having certain genes makes it more likely for a person to develop sarcoidosis. Things that may trigger the disease include infections with bacteria or viruses. Contact with dust or chemicals may also be triggers.
The disease is more common in African Americans and White people of Scandinavian heritage. More women than men have the disease.
The disease often begins between ages 20 and 40. Sarcoidosis is rare in young children.
A person with a close blood relative who has sarcoidosis is nearly 5 times as likely to develop the condition.
Symptoms
There may be no symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they can involve almost any body part or organ system.
Almost all people affected by sarcoidosis have lung or chest symptoms:
Chest pain
(most often behind the breast bone)
Dry
cough
Shortness of breath
Coughing up blood
(rare, but serious)
Symptoms of general discomfort may include:
Fatigue
Fever
Joint ache or pain
(arthralgia)
Weight loss
Skin symptoms may include:
Hair loss
Raised, red, firm skin sores (
erythema nodosum
), almost always on the front part of the lower legs
Rash
Scars that become raised or inflamed
Nervous system symptoms may include:
Headache
Seizures
Weakness
on one side of the face
Eye symptoms may include:
Burning, itching, discharge from the eye
Dry eyes
Pain
Vision loss
Other symptoms of this disease may include:
Dry mouth
Fainting spells
, if the heart is involved
Nosebleed
Swelling in the upper part of the abdomen
Liver disease
Swelling of the legs if heart and lungs are involved
Abnormal heart rhythm if the heart is involved
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about the symptoms.
Different imaging tests may help diagnose sarcoidosis:
Chest x-ray
to see if the lungs are involved or lymph nodes are enlarged
CT scan
of the chest
Lung gallium scan
(rarely done now)
Imaging tests of the
brain
and
liver
PET scan of the whole body (or specific body parts)
Echocardiogram
or
MRI
of the heart
To diagnose this condition, a biopsy is needed. A
biopsy
of the lung using
bronchoscopy
is usually done. Biopsies of other body tissues may also be done.
The following lab tests may be done:
Calcium levels (
urine
,
ionized
,
blood
)
CBC
Immunoelectrophoresis
Liver function tests
Quantitative immunoglobulins
Phosphorus
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)
Treatment
Sarcoidosis symptoms will often get better without treatment, especially if there are only small lung abnormalities.
If the eyes, heart, nervous system, or lungs are affected, corticosteroids are usually prescribed. This medicine may need to be taken for 1 to 2 years.
Medicines that suppress the immune system are sometimes also needed.
In rare cases, people with very severe heart or lung damage (end-stage disease) may need an organ transplant.
With sarcoidosis that affects the heart, an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (
ICD
) may be needed to treat heart rhythm problems.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Many people with sarcoidosis are not seriously ill, and get better without treatment. Up to half of all people with the disease get better in 3 years without treatment. People whose lungs are affected may develop lung damage.
Overall the death rate from sarcoidosis is less than 5%. Causes of death include:
Bleeding from the lung tissue
Heart damage, leading to heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms
Lung scarring (pulmonary fibrosis)
Possible Complications
Sarcoidosis may lead to these health problems:
Fungal lung infections (
aspergillosis
)
Glaucoma
and blindness from
uveitis
(rare)
Kidney stones
from high calcium levels in blood or urine
Osteoporosis
and other complications of taking corticosteroids for long periods of time
High blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs (
pulmonary hypertension
)
