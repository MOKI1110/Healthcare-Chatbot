Endometritis

Endometritis is an inflammation or irritation of the lining of the uterus (the endometrium). It is not the same as
endometriosis
.
Causes
Endometritis is caused by an infection in the uterus. It can be due to chlamydia, gonorrhea, tuberculosis, or a mix of normal vaginal bacteria. It is more likely to occur after miscarriage or childbirth. It is also more common after a long labor or C-section.
The risk for endometritis is higher after having a pelvic procedure that is done through the cervix. Such procedures include:
D and C
(dilation and curettage)
Endometrial biopsy
Hysteroscopy
Placement of an intrauterine device (IUD)
Childbirth (more common after
C-section
than vaginal birth)
Endometritis can occur at the same time as other pelvic infections.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
Swelling of the abdomen
Abnormal vaginal bleeding
or
discharge
Discomfort with bowel movement (including constipation)
Fever
General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling
Pain in lower abdomen or pelvic region (uterine pain)
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam with a pelvic exam. Your uterus and
cervix
may be tender and your provider may not hear
bowel sounds
. You may have cervical discharge.
The following tests may be performed:
Cultures from the cervix for
chlamydia
,
gonorrhea
, and other organisms
Endometrial biopsy
ESR (
erythrocyte sedimentation rate
)
WBC (
white blood count
)
Wet prep
(microscopic exam of any discharge)
Treatment
You will need to take antibiotics to treat the infection and prevent complications. Finish all your medicine if you have been given antibiotics after a pelvic procedure. Also, go to all recommended follow-up visits with your provider.
You may need to be treated in the hospital if your symptoms are severe or occur after childbirth.
Other treatments may involve:
Fluids through a vein (by IV)
Rest
Sexual partners may need to be treated if the condition is caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI).
Outlook (Prognosis)
In most cases, the condition goes away with antibiotics. Untreated endometritis can lead to more serious infections and complications. Rarely, it may be associated with a diagnosis of endometrial cancer.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Infertility
Pelvic
peritonitis
(generalized pelvic infection)
Pelvic or uterine
abscess
formation
Septicemia
Septic shock
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of endometritis.
Call right away if symptoms occur after:
Childbirth
Miscarriage
Abortion
IUD placement
Surgery involving the uterus
Prevention
Endometritis may be caused by STIs. To help prevent endometritis from STIs:
Treat STIs early.
Make sure sexual partners are treated in the case of a STI.
Follow safer sex practices, such as using condoms.
Women having a C-section may have antibiotics before the procedure to prevent infections.
