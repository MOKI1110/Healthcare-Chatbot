Histoplasma skin test

The histoplasma skin test is used to check if you have been exposed to a fungus called
Histoplasma capsulatum.
The fungus causes an infection called
histoplasmosis
.
How the Test is Performed
Your health care provider cleans an area of your skin, usually the forearm. An
allergen
is injected just below the cleaned skin surface. An allergen is a substance that causes an allergic reaction. The injection site is checked at 24 hours and at 48 hours for signs of a reaction. Occasionally, the reaction may not appear until the fourth day.
How to Prepare for the Test
No special preparation is necessary for this test.
How the Test will Feel
You may feel a brief sting as the needle is inserted just below the skin.
Why the Test is Performed
This test is used to determine if you have been exposed to the fungus that causes histoplasmosis.
Normal Results
No reaction (inflammation) at the site of the test is normal. The skin test can rarely make histoplasmosis antibody tests turn positive.
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
A reaction means you have been exposed to
Histoplasma capsulatum
. It does not mean you have an active infection.
Risks
There is a slight risk of
anaphylactic shock
(a severe reaction).
Considerations
This test is rarely used today. It has been replaced by a variety of
blood
and urine tests.
Alternative Names
Histoplasmosis skin test
