Vaginal or uterine bleeding
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Vaginal bleeding normally occurs during a woman's menstrual cycle, when she gets her period. Every woman's period is different.
Most women have periods between 24 and 34 days apart. It usually lasts 4 to 7 days in most cases.
Young girls may get their periods anywhere from 21 to 45 days or more apart.
Women in their 40s will often notice their period occurring less often.
Many women have abnormal bleeding between their periods at some point in their lives. Abnormal bleeding means you have:
Heavier bleeding than usual
Bleeding for more days than normal (menorrhagia)
Spotting or bleeding between periods
Bleeding after sex
Bleeding after
menopause
Bleeding while pregnant
Bleeding before age 9
Menstrual cycles longer than 35 days or shorter than 21 days
No period for 3 to 6 months (amenorrhea)
Causes
There are many causes of abnormal vaginal bleeding.
HORMONES
Abnormal bleeding is often linked to failure of regular ovulation (anovulation). Health care providers call the problem
abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB)
Â or anovulatory uterine bleeding. AUB is more common in teenagers and in women who are approaching menopause.
Women who take oral contraceptives may experience episodes of abnormal vaginal bleeding. Often this is called "breakthrough bleeding." This problem often goes away on its own. However, talk to your provider if you have concerns about the bleeding.
PREGNANCY
Pregnancy complications such as:
Ectopic pregnancy
Miscarriage
Threatened miscarriage
PROBLEMS WITH REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS
Problems with reproductive organs may include:
Infection in the uterus (pelvic inflammatory disease)
Recent injury or surgery to the uterus
Noncancerous growths in the uterus, including
uterine fibroids
, uterine or
cervical polyps
, and
adenomyosis
Inflammation or infection of the cervix (
cervicitis
)
Injury or disease of the vaginal opening (caused by intercourse, infection, polyp,
genital warts
, ulcer, or varicose veins)
Endometrial hyperplasia (thickening or build-up of the lining of the uterus)
MEDICAL CONDITIONS
Problems with medical conditions may include:
Polycystic ovary syndrome
Cancer or precancer of the
cervix
, uterus, ovary, or fallopian tube
Thyroid or pituitary disorders
Diabetes
Cirrhosis
of the liver
Systemic lupus erythematosus
Bleeding disorders
OTHER CAUSES
Other causes may include:
Use of an
intrauterine device
(IUD) for birth control (may cause spotting)
Cervical or
endometrial biopsy
or other procedures
Changes in exercise routine
Diet changes
Recent weight loss or gain
Stress
Use of certain medicines such as blood thinners (Warfarin or Coumadin)
Sexual abuse
An object in the vagina
Effect of low estrogen levels on the vaginal tissue
Symptoms
Symptoms of abnormal vaginal bleeding include:
Bleeding or spotting between periods
Bleeding after sex
Bleeding more heavily (passing large clots, needing to change protection during the night, soaking through a sanitary pad or tampon every hour for 2 to 3 hours in a row)
Bleeding for more days than normal or for more than 7 days
Menstrual periods less than 28 days (more common) or more than 35 days apart
Bleeding after you have gone through menopause
Heavy bleeding associated with
anemia
(low blood count, low iron)
Bleeding from the rectum or blood in the urine may be mistaken for vaginal bleeding. To know for certain, insert a tampon into the vagina and check for bleeding.
Keep a record of your symptoms and bring these notes to your provider. Your record should include:
When menstruation begins and ends
How much flow you have (count numbers of pads and tampons used, noting whether they are soaked)
Bleeding between periods and after sex
Any other symptoms you have
Exams and Tests
Your provider will perform a physical exam, including a pelvic exam. Your provider will ask questions about your medical history and symptoms.
You may have certain tests, including:
Pap test
HPV test
Urinalysis
Thyroid function tests
Complete blood count
(CBC)
Iron level
Pregnancy test
Based on your symptoms, other tests may be needed. Some can be done in your provider's office. Others may be done at a hospital or surgical center:
Sonohysterography: Fluid is placed in the uterus through a thin tube, while vaginal ultrasound images are made of the uterus.
Ultrasound
: Sound waves are used to make a picture of the pelvic organs. The ultrasound may be performed abdominally or vaginally.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
: In this imaging test, powerful magnets are used to create images of internal organs.
Hysteroscopy
: A thin telescope-like device is inserted through the vagina and the opening of the cervix. It lets the provider view the inside of the uterus.
Endometrial biopsy: Using a small or thin catheter (tube), tissue is taken from the lining of the uterus (endometrium). It is looked at under a microscope.
Treatment
The treatment depends on the specific cause of the vaginal bleeding, including:
Hormonal changes
Endometriosis
Uterine fibroids
Ectopic pregnancy
Polycystic ovary syndrome
The treatment may include hormonal medicines, pain relievers, and possibly surgery.
The type of hormone you take will depend on whether you want to get pregnant as well as your age.
Birth control pills can help make your periods more regular.
Hormones also can be given as an injection, a skin patch, a vaginal cream, or through an IUD that releases hormones.
An IUD is a birth control device that is inserted in the uterus. The hormones in the IUD are released slowly and may control abnormal bleeding.
Other medicines given for AUB may include:
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen or naproxen) to help control bleeding and reduce menstrual cramps
Tranexamic acid to help treat heavy menstrual bleeding
Antibiotics to treat infections
Procedures for AUB may include:
Endometrial ablation
Surgical removal of benign growths
Procedures to block the blood supply to uterine vessels (uterine artery embolization)
Hysterectomy
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
You have soaked through a pad or tampon every hour for 2 to 3 hours.
Your bleeding lasts longer than 1 week.
You have vaginal bleeding and you are pregnant or could be pregnant.
You have severe pain, especially if you also have pain when not menstruating.
Your periods have been heavy or prolonged for three or more cycles, compared to what is normal for you.
You have bleeding or spotting after reaching menopause.
You have bleeding or spotting between periods or caused by having sex.
Abnormal bleeding returns.
Bleeding increases or becomes severe enough to cause
weakness
or lightheadedness.
You have
fever
or pain in the lower abdomen.
Your symptoms become more severe or frequent.
Prevention
Aspirin may prolong bleeding and should be avoided if you have bleeding problems. Ibuprofen most often works better than aspirin for relieving menstrual cramps. It also may reduce the amount of blood you lose during a period.
