Petroleum jelly, also known as soft paraffin, is a semisolid mixture of fatty substances that are made from petroleum. A common brand name is Vaseline. This article discusses what happens when someone swallows a lot of petroleum jelly or it gets in the eyes.
This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.
Poisonous Ingredient
Petroleum jelly (petrolatum) can be harmful if someone swallows it or it gets in the eyes.
Where Found
Petroleum jelly is used in:
Some skin care products (including Vaseline)
Some eye lubricant ointments
Other products may also contain petroleum jelly.
Symptoms
These symptoms may occur from
swallowing a large amount of petroleum jelly
:
Abdominal pain
Coughing
Diarrhea
Irritation of the throat
Shortness of breath
A large amount of petroleum jelly which gets in the eyes or nose, or is used on the skin, the eyes, nose, or skin may cause irritation of these tissues.

Home Care
Stop using the product.
