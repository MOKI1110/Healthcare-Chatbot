Orchitis
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Orchitis is swelling (inflammation) of one or both of the
testicles
.
Causes
Orchitis may be caused by an infection. Many types of bacteria and viruses can cause this condition.
The most common virus that causes orchitis is
mumps
. It most often occurs in boys after puberty. Orchitis most often develops 4 to 6 days after the mumps begins.
Orchitis may also occur along with infections of the prostate or
epididymis
.
Orchitis may be caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as
gonorrhea
or
chlamydia
. The rate of sexually transmitted orchitis or epididymitis is higher in men ages 19 to 35.
Risk factors for sexually transmitted orchitis include:
High-risk sexual behaviors
Multiple sexual partners
Personal history of gonorrhea or another STI
Sexual partner with a diagnosed STI
Risk factors for orchitis not due to an STI include:
Being older than age 45
Long-term use of a
Foley catheter
Not being vaccinated against the mumps virus
Problems of the urinary tract that were present at birth (congenital)
Repeated
urinary tract infections
Surgery of the urinary tract (genitourinary surgery)
BPH (benign prostatic hyperplasia) - enlarged prostate
Urethral stricture (scarring inside urinary tract that causes narrowing of the passageway)
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Pain in the testicle
Blood in the semen
Discharge from the penis
Fever
Groin pain
Pain with intercourse or ejaculation
Pain with urination
(dysuria)
Scrotal swelling
Tender, swollen groin area on affected side
Tender, swollen, heavy feeling in the testicle
Exams and Tests
A physical exam may show:
Enlarged or tender prostate gland
Tender and
enlarged lymph nodes
in the groin (inguinal) area on the affected side
Tender and enlarged testicle on the affected side
Redness or tenderness of the scrotum
Tests may include:
Complete blood count
(CBC)
Testicular ultrasound
Tests to screen for chlamydia and gonorrhea (urethral smear)
Urinalysis
Urine culture (clean catch)
-- may need several samples, including initial stream, midstream, and after prostate massage
Treatment
Treatment may include:
Antibiotics, if the infection is caused by bacteria. (In the case of gonorrhea or chlamydia, sexual partners must also be treated.)
Anti-inflammatory medicines.
Pain medicines.
Bed rest with the scrotum elevated and ice packs applied to the area.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Getting the right diagnosis and treatment for orchitis caused by bacteria can most often allow the testicle to recover normally.
You will need further testing to check for testicular cancer if the testicle does not completely return to normal after treatment.
Mumps orchitis has no effective treatment, and the outcome can vary. Men who have had mumps orchitis can become sterile.
Possible Complications
Some boys who get orchitis caused by mumps will have shrinking of the testicles (testicular atrophy).
Orchitis may also cause
infertility
.
Other potential complications include:
Chronic epididymitis
Death of testicle tissue (testicular infarction)
Fistula
on the skin of the scrotum (cutaneous scrotal fistula)
Scrotal
abscess
Acute
pain in the scrotum or testicles can be caused by twisting of the testicular blood vessels (torsion). This is a medical emergency that requires immediate surgery.
A swollen testicle with little or no pain may be a sign of testicular cancer. If this is the case, you should have a testicular ultrasound.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
See your health care provider for an exam if you have testicle problems.
Get emergency medical help if you have sudden pain in the testicle.
Prevention
Things you can do to prevent the problem include:
Get vaccinated against mumps.
Practice safer sex behaviors to decrease your risk for STIs.
