Personality disorders are a group of mental conditions in which a person has a long-term pattern of behaviors, emotions, and thoughts that is very different from his or her culture's expectations. These behaviors interfere with the person's ability to function in relationships, work, or other settings.
Causes
Causes of personality disorders are unknown. Genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role.
Mental health professionals categorize these disorders into the following types:
Antisocial personality disorder
Avoidant personality disorder
Borderline personality disorder
Dependent personality disorder
Histrionic personality disorder
Narcissistic personality disorder
Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder
Paranoid personality disorder
Schizoid personality disorder
Schizotypal personality disorder
Symptoms
Symptoms vary widely, depending on the type of personality disorder.
In general, personality disorders involve feelings, thoughts, and behaviors that don't adapt well to a wide range of settings.
These patterns usually begin in the teens and may lead to problems in social and work situations.
The severity of these conditions ranges from mild to severe.
Exams and Tests
Personality disorders are diagnosed based on a psychological evaluation. The health care provider will consider how long-lived and how severe the person's symptoms are.
Treatment
At first, people with these disorders usually don't seek treatment on their own. This is because they feel the disorder is part of themselves. They tend to seek help once their behavior has caused severe problems in their relationships or work. They may also seek help when they are struggling with another mental health problem, such as a mood or
substance use disorder
.
Although personality disorders take time to treat, certain forms of talk therapy are helpful. In some cases, medicines are a useful addition.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outlook varies. Some personality disorders improve greatly during middle age without any treatment. Others only improve slowly or not at all, even with treatment.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Problems with relationships
Problems with school or work
Other mental health disorders
Suicide
attempts
Illegal drug and
alcohol use
Mood and anxiety disorders
