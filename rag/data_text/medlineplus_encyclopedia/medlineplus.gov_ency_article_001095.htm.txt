Spider angioma

Spider angioma is an abnormal collection of blood vessels near the surface of the skin.
Causes
Spider angiomas are very common. They often occur in pregnant women and in people with liver disease. They can appear in both children and adults. They get their name because the mark looks similar to a red spider.
They appear most often on the face, neck, upper part of the trunk, arms, and fingers.
Symptoms
The main symptom is a blood vessel spot that:
May have a red dot in the center
Has reddish extensions that reach out from the center
Disappears when pressed on and comes back when pressure is released
In rare cases, bleeding occurs in a spider angioma.
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine the spider angioma on your skin. You may be asked if you have any other symptoms.
Most of the time, you do not need tests to diagnose the condition. But sometimes, a
skin biopsy
is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Blood tests may be done if a liver problem is suspected.
Treatment
Spider angiomas usually do not need treatment, but burning (
electrocautery
) or laser treatment is sometimes done.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Spider angiomas in children may disappear after puberty, and often disappear after a woman gives birth. Untreated, spider angiomas tend to last in adults.
Treatment is often successful.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Let your provider know if you have a new spider angioma so they can check for other related medical conditions.
