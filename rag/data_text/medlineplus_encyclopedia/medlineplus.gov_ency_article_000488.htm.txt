Renal papillary necrosis

Renal papillary necrosis is a disorder of the kidneys in which all or part of the renal papillae die. The renal papillae are the areas where the openings of the collecting ducts enter the kidney and where urine flows into the ureters.
Causes
Renal papillary necrosis often occurs with
analgesic nephropathy
. This is damage to one or both kidneys caused by overexposure to pain medicines. But, other conditions can also cause renal papillary necrosis, including:
Diabetic nephropathy
Kidney infection (pyelonephritis)
Kidney transplant rejection
Sickle cell anemia
, a common cause of renal papillary necrosis in children
Urinary tract blockage
Symptoms
Symptoms of renal papillary necrosis may include:
Back pain or
flank pain
Bloody, cloudy, or dark urine
Tissue pieces in the urine
Other symptoms that may occur with this disease:
Fever and chills
Painful urination
Needing to urinate more often than usual (frequent urination) or a sudden, strong urge to urinate (urgency)
Difficulty starting or maintaining a urine stream (
urinary hesitancy
)
Urinary incontinence
Urinating large amounts
Urinating often at night
Exams and Tests
The area over the affected kidney (in the flank) may feel tender during an exam. There may be a history of urinary tract infections. There may be signs of
blocked urine flow
or kidney failure.
Tests that may be done include:
Urine test
Blood tests
Ultrasound, CT, or other imaging tests of the kidneys
Treatment
There is no specific treatment for renal papillary necrosis. Treatment depends on the cause. For example, if analgesic nephropathy is the cause, your health care provider will recommend that you stop using the medicine that is causing it. This may allow the kidney to heal over time.
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well a person does, depends on what is causing the condition. If the cause can be controlled, the condition may go away on its own. Sometimes, people with this condition develop kidney failure and will need
dialysis
or a
kidney transplant
.
Possible Complications
Health problems that may result from renal papillary necrosis include:
Kidney infection
Kidney stones
Kidney cancer, especially in people who take a lot of pain medicines
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider for an appointment if:
You have
bloody urine
You develop other symptoms of renal papillary necrosis, especially after taking over-the-counter pain medicines
Prevention
Controlling diabetes or sickle cell anemia may reduce your risk. To prevent renal papillary necrosis from analgesic nephropathy,Â follow your provider's instructions when using medicines, including over-the-counter pain relievers. Do not take more than the recommended dose without asking your provider.
