Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a problem caused by the presence of one or more of these findings:
Not being able to focus
Being overactive
Not being able to control behavior
Causes
ADHD often begins in childhood. But it may continue into the adult years. ADHD is diagnosed more often in boys than in girls.
It is not clear what causes ADHD. It may be linked to genes and home or social factors. Experts have found that the brains of children with ADHD are different from those of children without ADHD. Brain chemicals are also different.
Symptoms
ADHD symptoms fall into three groups:
Not being able to focus (inattentiveness)
Being extremely active (
hyperactivity
)
Not being able to control behavior (impulsivity)
Some people with ADHD have mainly inattentive symptoms. Some have mainly hyperactive and impulsive symptoms. Others have a combination of these behaviors.
INATTENTIVE SYMPTOMS
Doesn't pay attention to details or makes careless mistakes in schoolwork
Has problems focusing during tasks or play
Doesn't listen when spoken to directly
Doesn't follow through on instructions and doesn't finish schoolwork or chores
Has problems organizing tasks and activities
Avoids or doesn't like tasks that require mental effort (such as schoolwork)
Often loses things, such as homework or toys
Is easily distracted
Is often forgetful
Has trouble concentrating
HYPERACTIVITY SYMPTOMS
Fidgets or squirms in seat
Leaves their seat when they should stay in their seat
Runs about or climbs when they shouldn't be doing so
Has problems playing or working quietly
Is often on the go, acts as if "driven by a motor"
Talks all the time
IMPULSIVITY SYMPTOMS
Blurts out answers before questions have been completed
Has problems awaiting their turn
Interrupts or intrudes on others (butts into conversations or games)
Many of the above findings are present in children as they grow. For these problems to be diagnosed as ADHD, they must be out of the normal range for a person's age and development.
Exams and Tests
There is no test that can diagnose ADHD. Diagnosis is based on a pattern of the symptoms listed above. When a child is suspected to have ADHD, parents and teachers are often involved during the evaluation.
Most children with ADHD have at least one other developmental or mental health issue. This may be a mood, anxiety, or substance use disorder. Or, it may be a learning issue or a tic disorder.
Treatment
Treating ADHD is a partnership between your health care provider and the person with ADHD. If it's a child, parents and often teachers are involved. For treatment to work, it is important to:
Set specific goals that are right for you or your child.
Start medicine or talk therapy, or both.
Follow-up regularly with your provider to check on goals, results, and any side effects of medicines.
If treatment does not seem to work, your provider will likely:
Confirm the person has ADHD.
Check for health problems that can cause similar symptoms.
Make sure the treatment plan is being followed.
MEDICINES
Medicine
combined with behavioral treatment often works best. Different ADHD medicines can be used alone or combined with each other. Your provider will decide which medicine is right, based on your child's symptoms and needs.
Psychostimulants (also known as stimulants) are the most commonly used medicines. Although these medicines are called stimulants, they actually have a calming effect on people with ADHD. Other medicines that are not stimulants are FDA approved for some people with ADHD. Ask your provider what is best for you.
Follow your provider's instructions about how to take ADHD medicine. Your provider needs to monitor if the medicine is working and if there are any problems with it. So, be sure to keep all appointments with your provider.
Some ADHD medicines have side effects. If you or your child has side effects, contact your provider right away. The dosage or medicine itself may need to be changed.
THERAPY
A common type of ADHD therapy is called behavioral therapy. It teaches children and parents healthy behaviors and how to manage disruptive behaviors. For mild ADHD, behavioral therapy alone (without medicine) may be effective.
Other tips to help a child with ADHD include:
Talk regularly with your child's teacher.
Keep a daily schedule, including regular times for homework, meals, and activities. Make changes to the schedule ahead of time and not at the last moment.
Limit distractions in your child's environment.
Make sure your child gets a healthy, varied diet, with plenty of fiber and basic nutrients.
Make sure your child gets enough sleep.
Praise and reward good behavior.
Provide clear and consistent rules for your child.
There is little proof that alternative treatments for ADHD such as herbs, supplements, and chiropractic treatments are helpful.

Outlook (Prognosis)
ADHD is a long-term condition. ADHD may lead to:
Illegal drug use and alcohol misuse
Not doing well in school
Problems keeping a job
Trouble with the law
One third to one half of children with ADHD have symptoms of inattention or hyperactivity-impulsivity as adults. Adults with ADHD are often able to control behavior and mask problems.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you or your child's teachers suspect ADHD. You should also tell your provider about:
Problems at home, school, and with peers
Side effects of ADHD medicine
Signs of
depression
