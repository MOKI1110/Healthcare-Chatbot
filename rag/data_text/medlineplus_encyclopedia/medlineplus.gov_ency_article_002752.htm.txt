Asphalt cement poisoning

Asphalt is a brownish-black liquid petroleum material that hardens when it cools. Asphalt cement poisoning occurs when someone swallows asphalt. If hot asphalt gets on the skin, serious injury can occur.
This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

Person's age, weight, and condition
Name of the product (ingredients, if known)
Time it was swallowed
Amount swallowed
Poison Control
Your local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated.
The person may receive:
Blood and urine tests.
Breathing support, including giving oxygen through a tube through the mouth into the lungs, and a breathing machine (ventilator).
Bronchoscopy -- camera placed down the throat to look for burns in the airways and lungs.
Chest x-ray.
ECG (heart tracing).
Endoscopy -- camera placed down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and the stomach.
Fluids through vein (by IV).
Products to dissolve the asphalt.
Medicines to treat symptoms.
Surgery to remove burned skin (debridement).
Washing of the skin (irrigation). This may need to be done every few hours for several days.
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well someone does depends on how much asphalt they swallowed and how quickly they receive treatment. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery. Hot asphalt cools very quickly and is difficult to get off the skin. Serious burns can easily occur from the extreme heat. Construction workers who work with asphalt should wear protective clothing.
Asphalt is hard to swallow, but it may cause serious damage.
Delayed injury may occur, including a hole forming in the throat, esophagus, or stomach. This can lead to severe bleeding and infection. Surgical procedures may be needed to treat these complications.
If asphalt gets in the eye, ulcers may develop in the cornea, the clear part of the eye. This can cause blindness.
