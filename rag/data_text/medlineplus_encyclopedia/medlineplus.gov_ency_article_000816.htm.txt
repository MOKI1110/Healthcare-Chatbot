Autoimmune disorders

An autoimmune disorder occurs when
the body's immune system
attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake. There are more than 80 autoimmune disorders.
Causes
The blood cells in the body's immune system help protect against harmful substances. Examples include bacteria, viruses,
toxins
,
cancer
cells, and blood and tissue from outside the body. These substances contain antigens. The immune system produces
antibodies
against these antigens that enable it to destroy these harmful substances.
When you have an autoimmune disorder, your immune system does not distinguish between healthy tissue and potentially harmful antigens. As a result, your body sets off a reaction that destroys normal tissues.
The exact cause of autoimmune disorders is unknown. One theory is that some microorganisms (such as bacteria or viruses) or drugs may trigger changes that confuse the immune system. This may happen more often in people who have genes that make them more prone to autoimmune disorders.
An autoimmune disorder may result in:
The destruction of body tissue
Abnormal growth of an organ
Changes in organ function
An autoimmune disorder may affect one or more organ or tissue types. Areas often affected by autoimmune disorders include:
Blood vessels
Connective tissues
Endocrine
glands such as the thyroid or pancreas
Joints
Muscles
Red blood cells
Skin
A person may have more than one autoimmune disorder at the same time. Common autoimmune disorders include:
Addison disease
Celiac disease - sprue
(gluten-sensitive enteropathy)
Dermatomyositis
Graves disease
Hashimoto thyroiditis
Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease, ulcerative colitis)
Multiple sclerosis
Myasthenia gravis
Pernicious anemia
Reactive arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis
SjÃ¶gren syndrome
Systemic lupus erythematosus
Â (lupus)
Type I diabetes
Symptoms
Symptoms will vary, based on the type and location of the faulty immune response. Common symptoms include:
Fatigue
Fever
General ill feeling
(malaise)
Joint pain
Rash
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will do a physical exam. Signs depend on the type of disease.
Tests that may be done to diagnose an autoimmune disorder include:
Antinuclear antibody (ANA) tests
Autoantibody tests
Complete blood count (CBC)
with white blood cell differential (CBC with WBC differential)
Comprehensive metabolic panel
C-reactive protein (CRP)
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)
Urinalysis
Treatment
The goals of treatment are to:
Control the autoimmune process
Maintain your body's ability to fight disease
Reduce symptoms
Treatments will depend on your disease and symptoms. Types of treatments include:
Supplements to replace a substance that the body lacks, such as thyroid hormone, vitamin B12, or insulin, due to the autoimmune disease
Blood transfusions if blood is affected
Physical therapy to help with movement if the bones, joints, or muscles are affected
Many people take medicines to reduce the immune system's abnormal response. These are called immunosuppressive medicines. Examples include corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and nonsteroid drugs such as azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate, sirolimus, or tacrolimus. Targeted drugs such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) blockers and Interleukin inhibitors can be used for some diseases.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome depends on the disease. Most autoimmune diseases are
chronic
, but many can be controlled with treatment.
Symptoms of autoimmune disorders can come and go. When symptoms get worse, it is called a flare-up.
Possible Complications
Complications depend on the disease. Medicines used to suppress the immune system can cause severe side effects, such as higher risk for infections.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of an autoimmune disorder.
Prevention
There is no known prevention for most autoimmune disorders.
