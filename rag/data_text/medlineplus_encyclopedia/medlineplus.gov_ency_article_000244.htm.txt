Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS) is a rare disorder in which growths called polyps form in the intestines. A person with PJS has a high risk for developing certain cancers.
Causes
It is unknown how many people are affected by PJS. However, the National Institutes of Health estimates that it affects about 1 in 50,000 to 200,000 people.
PJS is caused by a mutation in the gene called STK11 (previously known as LKB1). There are two ways that PJS can occur:
Familial PJS is inherited in families as an
autosomal dominant
trait. That means if one of your parents has this type of PJS, you have a 50% chance of inheriting the gene and having the disease.
Spontaneous PJS is not inherited from a parent. The gene mutation occurs on its own. Once someone carries the genetic change, their children have a 50% chance of inheriting it.
Symptoms
Symptoms of PJS are:
Brownish or bluish-gray spots on the lips, gums, inner lining of the mouth, and skin
Clubbed fingers or toes
Cramping pain in the belly area
Dark freckles on and around the lips of a child
Blood in the stool
that can be seen with the naked eye (sometimes)
Vomiting
Exams and Tests
The polyps develop mainly in the small intestine, but also in the large intestine (colon). An exam of the colon called a
colonoscopy
will show colon polyps. The small intestine is evaluated in two ways. One is a barium x-ray (small bowel series). The other is a capsule endoscopy, in which a small camera is swallowed and then takes many pictures as it travels through the small intestine.
Additional exams may show:
Part of the intestine folded in on itself (
intussusception
)
Benign (noncancerous) tumors in the nose, airways, ureters, or bladder
Laboratory tests may include:
Complete blood count (CBC) -- may reveal
anemia
Genetic testing
Stool occult blood
, to look for blood in stool
Total serum iron and iron-binding capacity
(TIBC) -- may indicate iron-deficiency anemia
Treatment
Surgery may be needed to remove polyps that cause long-term problems. Iron supplements help counteract blood loss.
People with this condition should be monitored by a health care provider and checked regularly for cancerous polyp changes.
Support Groups
More information and support for people with PJS and their families can be found at:
National Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) --
rarediseases.org/rare-diseases/peutz-jeghers-syndrome
Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) --
rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7378/peutz-jeghers-syndrome
Outlook (Prognosis)
There may be a high risk for these polyps becoming cancerous. Some studies link PJS with cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, lung, breast, uterus, and ovaries.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Intussusception
Polyps that lead to cancer
Ovarian cysts
A type of ovarian tumors called sex cord tumors
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider for an appointment if you or your child has symptoms of this condition. Severe abdominal pain may be a sign of an emergency condition such as intussusception.
Prevention
Genetic counseling is recommended if you are planning to have children and have a family history of this condition.
