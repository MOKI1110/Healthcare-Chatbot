Corneal injury
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Corneal injury is a wound to the part of the eye known as the cornea. The cornea is the crystal clear (transparent) tissue that covers the front of the eye. It works with the lens of the eye to focus images on the retina.
Causes
Injuries to the cornea are common.
Injuries to the outer surface may be due to:
Abrasions -- Includes scratches or scrapes on the surface of the cornea
Chemical injuries -- Caused by almost any fluid that gets into the eye
Contact lens problems -- Overuse, poor fit, or sensitivity to contact lens care solutions
Foreign bodies -- Exposure to something in the eye such as sand or dust
Ultraviolet injuries-- Caused by sunlight, sun lamps, snow or water reflections, or arc-welding
Infections
may also damage the cornea.
You are more likely to develop a corneal injury if you:
Are exposed to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light for long periods of time
Have ill-fitting contact lenses or overuse your contact lenses
Have very
dry eyes
Work in a dusty environment
Use a hammer or power tools without wearing safety glasses
High-speed particles, such as chips from hammering metal on metal, may get stuck in the surface of the cornea. Rarely, they may penetrate deeper into the eye.

Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Blurred vision
Eye pain
or stinging and burning in the eye
Feeling like something is in your eye (may be caused by a scratch or something in your eye)
Light sensitivity
Redness of the eye
Swollen eyelids

Exams and Tests
You will need to have a complete eye exam. The health care provider may use eye drops containing fluorescein dye to help look for injuries.
Tests may include:
Standard eye exam
Slit lamp examination
Treatment
First aid for
eye emergencies
:
Do not try to remove an object that is stuck in your eye without professional medical help.
If chemicals are splashed in the eye, immediately flush the eye with water for 15 minutes. The person should be quickly taken to the nearest emergency room.
Anyone with severe eye pain needs to be seen in an emergency care center or examined by an ophthalmologist right away.
Treatment for corneal injuries may involve:
Removing foreign material from the eye
Wearing an eye patch or temporary bandage contact lens
Using eye drops or ointments prescribed by the provider
Not wearing contact lenses until the eye has healed
Taking pain medicines
Outlook (Prognosis)
Most of the time, injuries that affect only the surface of the cornea heal very quickly with treatment. The eye should be back to normal within 2 to 3 days. For more serious injuries or when there may be delayed healing, placement of an amniotic membrane (from purified placental tissue) can be very helpful.
Injuries that penetrate the cornea are much more serious. The outcome depends on the specific injury.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if the injury is not better after 2 to 3 days of treatment.
Prevention
Things you can do to prevent corneal injuries include:
Wear safety goggles at all times when using hand or power tools or chemicals, during high impact sports, or during other activities where you may get an eye injury.
Wear sunglasses that screen ultraviolet light when you are exposed to sunlight or are in the vicinity of arc welding. Wear this type of sunglasses even during the winter.
Be careful when using household cleaners. Many household products contain strong chemicals. Drain and oven cleaners are very dangerous. They can lead to blindness if not used properly.
