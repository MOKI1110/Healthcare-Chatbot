Hymenolepis infection is an infestation byÂ one ofÂ two species of tapeworm:
Hymenolepis nana
or
Hymenolepis diminuta
. The disease is also called hymenolepiasis.
Causes
Hymenolepis worms live in warm climates and are common in the southern United States. Insects eat the eggs of these worms.
Humans and other animals become infected when they eat material contaminated by insects (including fleas associated with rats). In an infected person, it is possible for the worm's entire life cycle to be completed in the bowel, so infection can last for years.
Hymenolepis nana
infections are much more common than
Hymenolepis diminuta
infections in humans. These infections used to be common in the southeastern United States, in crowded environments, and in people who were confined to institutions. However, the disease occurs throughout the world.
Symptoms
Symptoms occur only with heavy infections. Symptoms include:
Diarrhea
Gastrointestinal discomfort
Itchy anus
Poor appetite
Weakness
Exams and Tests
A
stool exam
for the tapeworm and its eggs confirms the diagnosis.
Treatment
The treatment for this condition is a single dose of praziquantel, repeated in 10 days.
Household members may also need to be screened and treated because the infection can be spread easily from person to person.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Expect full recovery following treatment.
Possible Complications
Health problems that may result from this infection include:
Abdominal discomfort
Dehydration
from prolonged diarrhea
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you have chronic diarrhea or abdominal cramping.
Prevention
Good hygiene, public health and sanitation programs, and elimination of rats help prevent the spread of hymenolepiasis.
Alternative Names
Hymenolepiasis; Dwarf tapeworm infection; Rat tapeworm; Tapeworm - infection
