Minimally invasive prostate resection is surgery to remove part of the prostate gland, to treat an
enlarged prostate
. The surgery will improve the flow of urine through the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder outside of your body. It can be done in different ways. There is no incision (cut) in your skin.
Description
These procedures are often done in your surgeon's office or at a surgery center.
The surgery can be done in many ways. The type of surgery will depend on the size of your prostate and what caused it to grow. Your surgeon will consider the size of your prostate, how healthy you are, and what type of surgery you may want.
All of these procedures are done by passing an instrument through the opening in your penis (meatus). You will be given
general anesthesia
(asleep and pain-free),
spinal or epidural anesthesia
(awake but pain-free), or local anesthesia and sedation. Choices are:
Laser prostatectomy (laser TURP):
This procedure takes about 1 to 2 hours. The laser destroys prostate tissue that blocks the opening of the urethra. You will probably go home the same day. You will need a
Foley catheter
placed in your bladder to help drain urine for a few days after surgery.
Transurethral incision (TUIP):
Your surgeon makes small surgical cuts where the prostate meets your bladder. This makes the urethra wider. This procedure takes 20 to 30 minutes. Many men can go home the same day. Full recovery can take 2 to 3 weeks. You may go home with a catheter in your bladder.
Transurethral electrovaporization (TUVP):
A tool or instrument delivers a strong electric current to destroy prostate tissue. You will have a catheter placed in your bladder. It may be removed within hours after the procedure or you may go home with it.
Photoselective vaporization (PVP):
A high-powered green-light laser is used to vaporize and remove excess prostate tissue with very little loss of blood. You may need a Foley catheter placed in your bladder to help drain urine for a few days after surgery.
Prostatic urethral lift (PUL):
Small implants are placed in the prostate lobes to compress the prostate tissue.
Transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT):
TUMT delivers heat using microwave pulses to destroy prostate tissue. Your doctor will insert the microwave antenna through your urethra. You may need a Foley catheter placed in your bladder to help drain urine after surgery for 3 to 5 days.
Water vapor thermal therapy (WVTT):
This procedure releases sterile water vapor (steam) into the prostate to remove extra tissue. It can be done in the surgeon's office or an outpatient surgery center.
Transurethral needle ablation (TUNA):
The surgeon passes needles into the prostate. High-frequency sound waves (
ultrasound
) heat the needles and prostate tissue. You may need a Foley catheter placed in your bladder to help drain urine after surgery for 3 to 5 days.
Prostate water jet treatment (Aquablation)
: Miniature high pressure water jets are used to remove portions of an enlarged prostate. You will need a Foley catheter placed in your bladder to help drain urine for a few days after surgery.
Enucleation of the prostate (HoLEP)
: A laser (using holmium) is used to carve out and remove the enlarged parts of the prostate. You will need a Foley catheter placed in your bladder to help drain urine for a few days after surgery.
Urethral implant (iTind)
: A temporary nitinol implant is placed into the prostate and as it expands it creates several cuts in the prostate to help create a larger opening.
Why the Procedure is Performed
An enlarged prostate can make it hard for you to urinate. You may also get
urinary tract infections
. Removing all, or part, of the prostate gland can make these symptoms better. Before you have surgery, your health care provider may tell you changes you can make in how you eat or drink. You may also try some medicines to treat your symptoms.
Your provider may recommend prostate surgery if you:
Cannot completely empty your bladder (urinary retention)
Have repeat urinary tract infections
Have bleeding from your prostate
Have
bladder stones
with your enlarged prostate
Urinate very slowly
Took medicines and they did not help your symptoms or if you have side effects with the medicines
Risks
Risks for any surgery are:
Blood clots
in the legs that may travel to the lungs
Blood loss
Breathing problems
Heart attack
or
stroke
during surgery
Infection, including in the surgical wound, lungs (
pneumonia
), bladder, or kidney
Reactions to medicines
Other risks for this surgery are:
Erection problems (
impotence
)
No symptom improvement
Passing semen back into your bladder instead of out through the urethra (
retrograde ejaculation
)
Problems with urine control (
incontinence
)
Urethral stricture
(tightening of the urinary outlet from scar tissue)
Before the Procedure
You will have many visits with your providers and tests before surgery:
Complete physical exam
Visits with your provider to make sure medical problems such as
diabetes
,
high blood pressure
, and heart or lung problems are being treated well
If you are a smoker, you should stop several weeks before the surgery. Your provider or nurse can help.
Always tell your surgeon or nurse what medicines, vitamins, and other supplements you are taking, even ones you bought without a prescription.
During the one to two weeks before your surgery:
You may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), vitamin E, clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin), and other medicines like these.
You may be asked to stop certain weight loss medicines (GLP-1 agonists) a few weeks before. When people use these medicines the movement of food though the stomach is slowed so even if they fast after midnight there still may be food in the stomach.
Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.
Let your surgeon know about any illness you may have before your surgery. This includes
COVID-19
, a
cold
,
flu
, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness. If you do get sick, your surgery may need to be postponed.
On the day of your surgery:
Do not eat or drink anything after midnight the night before your surgery.
Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.
Your surgeon or nurse will tell you when to arrive at the hospital or clinic.
After the Procedure
Most people are able to go home the day of surgery or the day after. You may still have a catheter in your bladder when you leave the hospital or clinic.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Most of the time, these procedures can relieve your symptoms. But you have a higher chance of needing a second surgery in 5 to 10 years than if you have transurethral resection of the prostate (
TURP
).
Some of these less invasive surgeries may cause fewer problems with controlling your urine or ability to have sex than the standard TURP. Talk to your surgeon.
You may have the following problems for a while after surgery:
Blood in your urine
Burning with urination
Need to urinate more often
Sudden urge to urinate
