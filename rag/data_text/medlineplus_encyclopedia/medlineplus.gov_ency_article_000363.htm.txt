Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a rare disorder that may be passed down through families (inherited). It involves repeated fevers and inflammation that often affects the lining of the abdomen, chest, or joints.
Causes
FMF is most often caused by a variation in a gene named
MEFV
. This gene creates a protein involved in regulating inflammation. The disease usually appears only in people who received two copies of the variant gene, one from each parent. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance or an autosomal recessive condition.
FMF most often affects people of Mediterranean ancestry. These include non-Ashkenazi (Sephardic) Jews, Armenians, and Arabs. People from other ethnic groups can also be affected.
Symptoms
Symptoms usually begin between ages 5 and 15. Inflammation in the lining of the abdominal cavity, chest cavity, skin, or joints occurs along with high fevers that usually peak in 12 to 24 hours. Attacks may vary in severity of symptoms. People are usually symptom-free between attacks.
Symptoms may include repeated episodes of:
Abdominal pain
Chest pain that is sharp and gets worse when taking a breath
Fever or alternating chills and fever
Joint pain
Skin sores (lesions) that are red and swollen and range from 5 to 20 centimeters (cm) in diameter
Exams and Tests
If genetic testing shows that you have two pathogenic variants and your symptoms match the typical pattern, the diagnosis is nearly certain. Lab tests and
x-rays
or other imaging tests are used to check for other possible diseases to help confirm the diagnosis.
Levels of certain blood tests may be higher than normal when done during an attack. Tests may include:
Complete blood count
(CBC) that includes white blood cell count
C-reactive protein
(CRP) to check for inflammation
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR) to check for inflammation
Fibrinogen test
to check blood clotting
Treatment
The goal of treatment for FMF is to regulate symptoms. Colchicine, a medicine that reduces inflammation, may help during an attack and may prevent further attacks. It can also help prevent a serious complication called systemic
amyloidosis
, which is common in people with FMF.
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be used to treat fever and pain.
Outlook (Prognosis)
There is no known cure for FMF. Most people continue to have attacks, but the number and severity of attacks is different from person to person.
Possible Complications
Amyloidosis may lead to kidney damage or not being able to absorb nutrients from food (malabsorption). Fertility problems in women and men and arthritis are also complications.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you or your child develops symptoms of this condition.
