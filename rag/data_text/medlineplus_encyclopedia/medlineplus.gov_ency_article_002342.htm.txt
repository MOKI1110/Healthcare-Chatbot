The vagina is the female body part that connects the womb (uterus) and
cervix
to the outside of the body.
Information
The vagina is a muscular tube lined with mucous membranes. Its opening is between the urethra (where urine leaves the body) and the anus (where stool leaves the body).
Menstrual blood leaves the body through the vagina. The vagina also allows for sexual intercourse, and it is the passageway a baby goes through when it is born.
Inflammation of the vagina is called
vaginitis
.
