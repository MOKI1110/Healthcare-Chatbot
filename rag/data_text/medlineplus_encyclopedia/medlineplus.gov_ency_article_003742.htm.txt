Joint fluid culture is a laboratory test to detect infection-causing germs in a sample of fluid that is in a joint.
How the Test is Performed
A sample of joint fluid is needed. This may be done in a health care provider's office using a needle, or much less often, during an operating room procedure. Removing the sample is called
joint fluid aspiration
.
The fluid sample is sent to a lab. There, it is placed in a special dish and watched to see if bacteria or fungi grow. This is called a culture.
If these germs are detected, other tests may be done to further identify the infection-causing substance and its sensitivities or resistance to different antibiotics and determine the best treatment.
How to Prepare for the Test
Your provider will tell you how to prepare for the procedure. No special preparation is needed. But, tell your provider if you're taking a blood thinner, such as aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin) or clopidogrel (Plavix). These medicines can affect test results or your ability to take the test.
How the Test will Feel
After cleansing your skin thoroughly, usually, your provider will first inject numbing medicine into the skin with a small needle, which will sting. A larger needle is then used to draw out the synovial fluid.
This test may also cause some discomfort if the tip of the needle touches bone. The procedure usually lasts less than 1 to 2 minutes.
Why the Test is Performed
Your provider may order this test if you have unexplained pain and inflammation of a joint or a suspected joint infection.
Normal Results
The test result is considered normal if no organisms (bacteria or fungi) grow in the lab dish.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Abnormal results are a sign of infection in the joint. Infections may include:
Bacterial arthritis
Fungal arthritis
Gonococcal arthritis
Tuberculous arthritis
Risks
Risks of this test include:
Infection of the joint -- unusual, but more common with repeated aspirations
Bleeding into the joint space
Alternative Names
