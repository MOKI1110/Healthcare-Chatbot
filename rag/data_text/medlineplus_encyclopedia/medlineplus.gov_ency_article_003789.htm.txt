Abdominal CT scan

An abdominal CT scan is an imaging test that uses x-rays to create cross-sectional pictures of the belly area. CT stands for computed tomography.
How the Test is Performed
You will lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner. Most often, you will lie on your back with your arms raised above your head.
Once you are inside the scanner, the machine's
x-ray
beam rotates around you. Modern spiral scanners can perform the exam without stopping. There is very little noise.
A computer creates separate images of the belly area. These are called slices. These images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, printed on film or saved to a disk. Three-dimensional models of the belly area can be made by stacking the slices together.
You must be still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time.
In many cases, an abdominal CT is done with a
pelvis CT
.
The scan should take less than 30 minutes.
How to Prepare for the Test
You may need to have a special dye, called contrast, put into your body before some exams. Contrast helps certain areas show up better on the scans. Contrast can be administered in various ways. Such as:
Contrast can be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. If contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.
You may have to drink the contrast before the exam. When you drink it will depend on the type of exam being done. Contrast has a chalky taste, although some are flavored so they taste a little better. The contrast you drink will pass out of your body through your stools and is harmless.
Rarely, the contrast may be given into your rectum using an enema.
Let your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test to safely receive this substance.
Before receiving the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes medicine metformin (Glucophage). People taking this medicine may have to stop taking it for a while before the test.
Let your provider know if you have any kidney problems. The IV contrast can worsen kidney function.
Too much weight can damage the scanner. Find out if the CT machine has a weight limit if you weigh more than 300 pounds (136 kg).
You will need to take off your jewelry and wear a hospital gown during the study.
How the Test will Feel
Lying on the hard table may be a bit uncomfortable.
If you have contrast through a vein (IV), you may have:
Slight burning sensation
Metallic taste in the mouth
Warm flushing of the body
These feelings are normal and go away within a few seconds.
Why the Test is Performed
An abdominal CT scan makes detailed pictures of the structures inside your belly very quickly.
This test may be used to look for:
Cause of blood in the urine
Cause of abdominal pain or swelling
Cause of abnormal blood test results such as liver or kidney problems
Hernia
Cause of a fever
Masses and tumors, including cancer
Infections or injury
Kidney stones
Appendicitis
What Abnormal Results Mean
The abdominal CT scan may show some cancers, including:
Cancer of the renal pelvis or ureter
Colon cancer
Hepatocellular carcinoma
Lymphoma
Melanoma
Ovarian cancer
Pancreatic cancer
Pheochromocytoma
Renal cell carcinoma
(kidney cancer)
Spread of cancers that began outside the belly
The abdominal CT scan may show problems with the gallbladder, liver, or pancreas, including:
Acute cholecystitis
Alcoholic liver disease
Cholelithiasis
Pancreatic abscess
Pancreatic pseudocyst
Pancreatitis
Blockage of bile ducts
The abdominal CT scan may reveal the following kidney problems:
Blockage of the kidneys
Hydronephrosis
(kidney swelling from the backflow of urine)
Kidney infection
Kidney stones
Kidney or ureter damage
Polycystic kidney disease
Abnormal results may also be due to:
Abdominal aortic aneurysm
Abscesses
Appendicitis
Bowel wall thickening
Crohn disease
Renal artery stenosis
Renal vein thrombosis
Risks
Risks of CT scans include:
Allergy to contrast dye
Exposure to radiation
Damage to kidney function from contrast dye
CT scans expose you to more radiation than regular x-rays. Many x-rays or CT scans over time may increase your risk for cancer. However, the risk from any one scan is small. Most modern scanners are able to reduce the radiation exposure. Talk to your provider about this risk and the benefit of the test for getting a correct diagnosis of your medical problem.
Some people have allergies to contrast dye. Let your provider know if you have ever had an allergic reaction to injected contrast dye.
The most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. If you have an iodine allergy, you may have
nausea or vomiting
,
sneezing
,
itching
, or
hives
if you get this type of contrast. If you must be given such contrast, your provider may give you
antihistamines
(such as Benadryl) or steroids before the test.
Your kidneys help remove IV dye from the body. You may need extra fluids after the test to help flush the iodine out of your body if you have kidney disease or diabetes.
Rarely, the dye may cause a life-threatening allergic response. Tell the scanner operator right away if you have any trouble breathing during the test. Scanners come with an intercom and speakers, so the operator can hear you at all times.
