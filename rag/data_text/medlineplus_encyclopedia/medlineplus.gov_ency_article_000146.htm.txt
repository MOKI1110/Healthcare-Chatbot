Hospital-acquired pneumonia is an infection of the lungs that occurs during a hospital stay. This type of pneumonia can be very severe. Sometimes, it can be fatal.
Causes
Pneumonia
is a common illness. It is caused by many different germs. Pneumonia that starts in the hospital tends to be more serious than other lung infections because:
People in the hospital are often very sick and cannot fight off germs.
The types of germs present in a hospital are often more dangerous and more resistant to treatment than those outside in the community.
Pneumonia occurs more often in people who are using a ventilator, which is a machine that helps them breathe. This is called ventilator-associated pneumonia.
Hospital-acquired pneumonia can also be spread by health care workers, who can pass germs from their hands, clothes, or instruments from one person to another. This is why hand-washing, wearing gowns, and using other safety measures is so important in the hospital.
People can be more likely to get pneumonia while in the hospital if they:
Use alcohol excessively
Have had chest surgery or other major surgery
Have a weak immune system from cancer treatment, certain medicines, or severe wounds
Have long-term (chronic)
lung disease
Breathe saliva or food into their lungs as a result of not being fully alert or having swallowing problems (for example, after a stroke)
Are not mentally alert due to medicines or illness
Are older
Are on a breathing machine (ventilator)
Symptoms
In older adults, the first sign of hospital-acquired pneumonia may be mental changes or confusion.
Other symptoms may include:
A cough with greenish or pus-like phlegm (sputum)
Fever and chills
General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise)
Loss of appetite
Nausea and vomiting
Sharp chest pain that gets worse with deep breathing or coughing
Shortness of breath
Decreased blood pressure
Fast heart rate
Increased respiratory rate
Exams and Tests
If your health care provider suspects pneumonia, tests will be ordered. These may include:
Arterial blood gases
, to measure oxygen levels in the blood
Blood cultures
, to see if the infection has spread to the blood
Chest x-ray
or
CT scan of the chest
, to check the lungs
Complete blood count (
CBC
)
Pulse oximetry, to measure oxygen levels in the blood
Sputum culture
or
sputum Gram stain
, to check what germs are causing the pneumonia
Bronchoscopy, to get cultures directly from the lungs in some cases
Treatment
Treatments may include:
Antibiotics through your veins (IV) to treat the lung infection. The antibiotic you are given will fight the germs that are found in your sputum culture or are suspected to be causing the infection.
Oxygen to help you breathe better and lung treatments to loosen and remove thick mucus from your lungs.
Ventilator (breathing machine) using a tube or a mask to support your breathing for more severe cases.
Outlook (Prognosis)
People who have other serious illnesses do not recover as well from pneumonia as people who are not as sick.
Hospital-acquired pneumonia can be a life-threatening illness. Long-term lung damage may occur.
Prevention
People visiting someone in the hospital need to take steps to
prevent spreading germs
. The best way to stop the spread of germs is to wash your hands often. Stay home if you are sick. Keep your immunizations up to date.
After any surgery, you will be asked to take deep breaths and move around as soon as possible to help keep your lungs open. Follow the advice of your provider to help prevent pneumonia.
Most hospitals have programs to prevent hospital-acquired infections.
