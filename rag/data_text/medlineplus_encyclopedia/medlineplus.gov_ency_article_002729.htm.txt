Automatic dishwasher soap poisoning refers to illness that occurs when you swallow soap used in automatic dishwashers or when the soap contacts the face.
This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.
Poisonous Ingredient
Automatic dishwasher products contain various soaps. Potassium carbonate and sodium carbonate are the most common.
Standard liquid household detergents and soaps rarely cause serious injury if swallowed accidentally. However, single-use laundry or dishwasher detergent packets, or "pods" are more concentrated. Therefore, they are more likely to damage the esophagus.
Where Found
The poisonous ingredients are found in automatic dishwasher soaps.

What to Expect at the Emergency Room
If you go to the emergency room, take the container for the poison with you, if possible.
The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Blood and urine tests will be done. Symptoms will be treated as needed. The person may receive:
Activated charcoal to help prevent the remaining poison from being absorbed into the stomach and digestive tract.
Airway and breathing support, including oxygen. In extreme cases, a tube may be passed through the mouth into the lungs to prevent aspiration. A breathing tube (ventilator) would then be needed.
Blood transfusion if severe blood loss has occurred.
Chest x-ray
.
ECG
(electrocardiogram, or heart tracing).
Fluids through a vein (IV).
Endoscopy
-- a camera down the throat to see burns in the esophagus and stomach.
Medicines (laxatives) to move the poison quickly through the body.
Tube through the mouth into the stomach to wash out the stomach (
gastric lavage
). This is rare.
Medicines to treat symptoms, such as nausea and vomiting, or those of an allergic reaction, such as swelling of the face or mouth or wheezing (diphenhydramine, epinephrine, or steroids).
Outlook (Prognosis)
Most cases of swallowing dishwasher soap are not that harmful. How well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.
Swallowing poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Damage can continue to occur to the esophagus and stomach for several weeks after the product is swallowed. Death may occur up to a month after the poisoning.
