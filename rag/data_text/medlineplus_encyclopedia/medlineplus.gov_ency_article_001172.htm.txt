Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor (SLCT) is a rare
cancer
of the ovaries. The cancer cells produce and release a male sex hormone called testosterone.
Causes
The exact cause of this tumor is not known. Changes (alterations) in genes may play a role.
SLCT occur most often in young women 20 to 30 years old. But the tumor can occur at any age.
Symptoms
The Sertoli cells are normally located in the male reproductive glands (the testes). They feed sperm cells. The Leydig cells, also located in the testes, release a male sex hormone.
These cells are also found in a woman's ovaries, and in very rare cases lead to cancer. SLCT starts in the female ovaries, mostly in one ovary. The cancer cells release a male sex hormone. As a result, the woman may develop symptoms such as:
A deep voice
Enlarged clitoris
Facial hair
Loss in breast size
Stopping of menstrual periods
Pain in the lower belly (pelvic area) is another symptom. It occurs due to the tumor pressing on nearby structures.
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and a pelvic exam, and ask about your symptoms.
Tests will be ordered to check the levels of female and male hormones, including
testosterone
.
An
ultrasound
or
CT scan
will likely be done to find out where the tumor is and its size and shape.
Treatment
Surgery is done to remove one or both ovaries.
If the tumor is at an advanced stage,
chemotherapy
or
radiation therapy
may be done after surgery.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Early treatment results in a good outcome. Feminine characteristics usually return after surgery. But male characteristics resolve more slowly.
For more advanced stage tumors, outlook is less positive.
Alternative Names
Sertoli-stromal cell tumor; Arrhenoblastoma; Androblastoma; Ovarian cancer - Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor
