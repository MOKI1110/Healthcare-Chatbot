Sulfuric acid is a very strong chemical that is corrosive. Corrosive means it can cause severe burns and tissue damage when it comes into contact with the skin or mucous membranes. This article discusses poisoning from sulfuric acid.

Poison Control
Your local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including:
Oxygen saturation
Temperature
Pulse
Breathing rate
Blood pressure
Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive:
Airway and/or breathing support -- including oxygen via external delivery device or endotracheal intubation (placement of a breathing tube through the mouth or nose into the airway) with placement on a ventilator (life support breathing machine).
Blood tests
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Endoscopy -- a camera is used to examine down the throat to see burns in the esophagus and the stomach
Laryngoscopy or bronchoscopy -- a device (laryngoscope) or camera (bronchoscope) is used to examine the throat and airway to see burns
Eye irrigation
Fluids through a vein (IV)
Medicines to treat symptoms
Surgery to repair any tissue damage
Surgical removal of burned skin (skin debridement)
Washing of the skin (irrigation), perhaps every few hours for several days
X-rays of the chest and abdomen
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well a person does depends on how fast the poison is diluted and neutralized. Extensive damage to the mouth, throat, eyes, lungs, esophagus, nose, and stomach is possible. The ultimate outcome depends on how much damage there is.
Damage continues to occur to the esophagus and stomach for several weeks after the poison is swallowed, which can lead to serious infection and failure of multiple organs. Treatment may require the removal of part of the esophagus and stomach.
If the poison enters the lungs, serious damage may occur, both immediately and long-term.
Swallowing the poison may cause death. It may occur as long as a month after the poisoning.
