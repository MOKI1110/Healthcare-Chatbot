Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is scar tissue in the filtering unit of the kidney. This structure is called the glomerulus. The glomeruli serve as filters that help the body get rid of harmful substances. Each kidney has thousands of glomeruli.
"Focal" means that some of the glomeruli become scarred. Others remain normal. "Segmental" means that only part of an individual glomerulus is damaged.
Causes
The cause of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is often unknown.
The condition affects both children and adults. It occurs slightly more often in men and boys. It is also more common in African Americans. Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis causes up to a quarter of all cases of
nephrotic syndrome
.
Known causes include:
Drugs such as heroin, bisphosphonates, anabolic steroids
Infection
Inherited genetic problems
Obesity
Reflux nephropathy
(a condition in which urine flows backward from the bladder to the kidney)
Sickle cell disease
Some medicines
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
Foamy urine (from excess protein in the urine)
Poor appetite
Swelling, called generalized
edema
, from fluids held in the body
Weight gain
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will perform a physical exam. This exam may show tissue swelling (edema) and high blood pressure. Signs of kidney (renal) failure and excess fluid may develop as the condition gets worse.
Tests may include:
Kidney biopsy
Kidney function tests
(blood and urine)
Urinalysis
Urine microscopy
Urine protein
Treatment
Treatments may include:
Medicines to reduce the body's inflammatory response.
Medicines to lower blood pressure. Some of these medicines also help reduce the amount of protein that spills into the urine.
Medicines to get rid of excess fluid (diuretic or "water pill").
Low sodium diet
to reduce swelling and lower blood pressure.
The goal of treatment is to control the symptoms of nephrotic syndrome and prevent
chronic kidney disease or failure
. These treatments may include:
Antibiotics to control infections
Fluid restriction
Low-fat diet
Low- or moderate-protein diet
Vitamin D
supplements
Dialysis
Kidney transplant
Outlook (Prognosis)
A large portion of people with focal or segmental glomerulosclerosis will develop chronic kidney disease or failure.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Chronic kidney disease or failure
End-stage kidney disease
Infection
Malnutrition
Nephrotic syndrome
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of this condition, especially if there is:
Fever
Pain with urination
Decreased urine output
Prevention
No prevention is known.
