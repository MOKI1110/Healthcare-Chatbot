Drug-induced thrombocytopenia

Thrombocytopenia
Â means that there are not enough platelets. Platelets are elements in the blood that help the blood clot. A low platelet count makes bleeding more likely.
Many conditions can cause a low platelet count. When medicines or drugs do this, it is called drug-induced thrombocytopenia.
Causes
Drug-induced thrombocytopenia occurs when certain medicines destroy platelets or interfere with the body's ability to make enough of them.
There are two types of drug-induced thrombocytopenia: immune and nonimmune.
If a medicine causes your immune system to produce
antibodies
which seek and destroy your platelets, the condition is called drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia. Heparin, a blood thinner, is the most common cause of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia. This is a unique form of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia that increases the risk of blood clots.
If a medicine prevents your bone marrow from making enough platelets, the condition is called drug-induced nonimmune thrombocytopenia.
Chemotherapy
medicines and a seizure medicine called valproic acid may lead to this problem.
Other medicines that may cause drug-induced thrombocytopenia include:
Furosemide
Gold, used to treat arthritis
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
Penicillin
Quinidine
Quinine
Ranitidine
Sulfonamides
Linezolid
Statins
Symptoms
Decreased platelets may cause:
Abnormal bleeding
Bleeding when you brush your teeth
Easy
bruising
Pinpoint red spots on the skin (
petechiae
)
Treatment
The first step is to stop using the medicine that is causing the problem.
For people who have life-threatening bleeding, treatments may include:
Immunoglobulin therapy (IVIG) given through a vein
Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis)
Platelet transfusions
Corticosteroid medicine
Possible Complications
Bleeding can be life threatening if it occurs in the brain or certain other organs.
A pregnant woman who has antibodies to platelets may pass the antibodies to the baby in the womb.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you have unexplained bleeding or bruising and are taking medicines, such as the ones mentioned above under Causes.
