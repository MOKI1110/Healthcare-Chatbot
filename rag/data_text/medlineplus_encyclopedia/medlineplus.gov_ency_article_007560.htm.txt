Spinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a treatment for pain that uses a mild electric current to block nerve impulses in the spine.
Description
A trial electrode will be put in place first to see if it helps your pain.
Your skin will be numbed with a local anesthetic.
Wires (leads) will be placed under your skin and stretched into the space on top of your spinal cord.
These wires will be connected to a small current generator outside of your body that you carry like a cell phone.
The procedure takes about 1 to 2 hours. You will be able to go home after the leads are placed.
If the treatment greatly reduces your pain, you will be offered a permanent generator. The generator will be implanted a few weeks later.
You will be asleep and pain-free with
general anesthesia
.
The generator will be inserted under the skin of your abdomen or buttocks through a small surgical cut.
The procedure takes about 30 to 45 minutes.
The generator runs on batteries. Some batteries are rechargeable. Others last 2 to 5 years. You will need another surgery to replace the battery.
Why the Procedure is Performed
Your surgeon may recommend this procedure if you have:
Back pain that continues or gets worse, even after treatment (that may include surgery) to correct it
Complex regional pain syndrome
(CRPS)
Long-term (chronic) back pain, with or without arm or leg pain
Nerve pain or numbness in the arms or legs
Swelling (inflammation) of the lining of the brain and spinal cord
SCS is used after you have tried other treatments such as medicines and exercise and they have not worked.
Risks
Risks of this surgery include any of the following:
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) leakage and spinal headaches
Damage to the nerves that come out of the spine, causing
paralysis
, weakness, or pain that does not go away
Infection of the battery or electrode site (if this occurs, the hardware usually needs to be removed)
Breaking of the wire that may require more surgery
Movement of or damage to the generator or leads that requires more surgery
Pain after surgery
Problems with how the stimulator works, such as sending too strong of a signal, stopping and starting, or sending a weak signal
The stimulator may not work
Collection of blood or fluid between the covering of the brain (dura) and the surface of the brain
The SCS device may interfere with other devices, such as pacemakers and defibrillators. After the SCS is implanted, you may not be able to get an MRI anymore. Discuss this with your surgeon.
Before the Procedure
Tell your surgeon or nurse if:
You are or could be pregnant
You are taking any medicines, including drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription
During the week before your surgery:
You may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.
Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.
Prepare your home for when you come back from the hospital.
If you are a smoker, you need to stop smoking. Your recovery will be slower and possibly not as good if you keep smoking. Ask your provider for
help quitting
.
Talk with your surgeon if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol.
On the day of surgery:
Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.
Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.
Arrive at the hospital on time.
Bring your cane, walker, or wheelchair if you have one already. Also bring shoes with flat, nonskid soles.
After the Procedure
After the permanent generator is placed, the surgical cut will be closed and covered with a dressing. You will be taken to the recovery room to wake up from the anesthesia.
Most people can go home the same day, but your surgeon may want you to stay overnight in the hospital. You will be taught how to care for your surgical site.
You should avoid heavy lifting, bending, and twisting while you are healing. Light exercise such as walking can be helpful during recovery.
Outlook (Prognosis)
After the procedure, you may have less back pain and will not need to take as much pain medicines. But, the treatment does not cure back pain or treat the source of the pain. The stimulator can also be adjusted depending on your response to the treatment.
