Health screenings for men age 65 and older
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
You should visit your health care provider regularly, even if you feel healthy. The purpose of these visits is to:
Screen for medical issues
Assess your risk for future medical problems
Encourage a healthy lifestyle
Update vaccinations and other preventive care services
Help you get to know your provider in case of an illness
Information
Even if you feel fine, you should still see your provider for regular checkups. These visits can help you avoid problems in the future. For example, the only way to find out if you have
high blood pressure
is to have it checked regularly. High blood sugar and
high cholesterol
levels also may not have any symptoms in the early stages. A simple blood test can check for these conditions.
There are specific times when you should see your provider or receive specific health screenings. The US Preventive Services Task Force publishes a list of recommended screenings. Below are screening guidelines for men age 65 and older.
ABDOMINAL AORTIC ANEURYSM SCREENING
If you are age 65 to 75 and have smoked, you should have an ultrasound to screen for
abdominal aortic aneurysms
.
Other men should discuss this screening with their provider.
BLOOD PRESSURE SCREENING
Have your
blood pressure
checked at least once every year. Watch for blood pressure screenings in your area. Ask your provider if you can stop in to have your blood pressure checked. You can also check your blood pressure using the automated machines at some local grocery stores and pharmacies.
Ask your provider if you need your blood pressure checked more often if
You have diabetes,
heart disease
,
kidney problems
, or are overweight or have certain other conditions
You have a first degree relative with high blood pressure
You are Black
Your blood pressure top number is from 120 to 129 mm Hg, or the bottom number is from 70 to 79 mm Hg
If the top number is 130 mm Hg or greater, but lower than 140 mm Hg or the bottom number is 80 mm Hg or greater but lower than 90 mm Hg, this is considered stage 1 hypertension. Readings above these are considered stage 2 hypertension. Schedule an appointment with your provider to learn how you can reduce your blood pressure. Record your blood pressure numbers and bring this information to share with your provider.
CHOLESTEROL SCREENING
If your cholesterol level is normal, your cholesterol should be checked every 5 years.
Repeat cholesterol testing or other additional monitoring should take place:
Every 5 years for men with normal cholesterol levels
More often if changes occur in lifestyle (including weight gain and diet)
More often if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or blood flow problems in the legs or feet, or certain other conditions
Your provider may recommend testing more often if you are taking medicines to control high cholesterol.
COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING
Until age 75, you should have screening for
colorectal cancer
on a regular basis. Several tests are available for
colorectal cancer screening
:
A stool-based fecal occult blood (FOBT) or fecal immunochemical test (
FIT
) every year (colonoscopy is needed if results are positive)
A stool DNA-FIT test every 1 to 3 yearsÂ (colonoscopy is needed if results are positive)
Flexible
sigmoidoscopy
every 5 years or every 10 years with stool occult blood testing with FOBT or FIT every year
CT colonography (
virtual colonoscopy
) every 5 years
Colonoscopy
every 10 years
You may need a colonoscopy more often if you have risk factors for colorectal cancer, such as:
Ulcerative colitis
A personal or family history of cancer of the colon or rectum
A history of growths in your colon called
adenomatous polyps
A family history of inherited colorectal cancer syndromes such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC)
People ages 76 through 85 should talk with their health care provider about whether to continue to get screened. People ages 86 and older no longer need colorectal cancer screening.
DENTAL EXAM
Go to the dentist once or twice every year for an exam and cleaning. Your dentist will evaluate if you have a need for more frequent visits.
PREDIABETES AND TYPE 2 DIABETES SCREENING
You should be screened for
prediabetes
and
type 2 diabetes
every 3 years up to age 70 if you are overweight or have obesity.
You should be tested more often if you have other risk factors for diabetes, such as:
You have a first-degree relative with
diabetes
You have high blood pressure, prediabetes, or a history of heart disease
EYE EXAM
Have an eye exam every year.Â Your provider may recommend more frequent eye exams if you have vision problems or glaucoma risk.
Have an eye exam that includes an examination of your retina (back of your eye) at least every year if you have diabetes.
HEARING TEST
Have your hearing tested if you have symptoms of
hearing loss
.
IMMUNIZATIONS
Commonly needed vaccines include:
Flu shot
: get one every year
COVID-19
vaccine: ask you provider what is best for you
Pneumococcal vaccines
: you should receiveÂ the appropriate pneumococcal vaccines
Shingles
Â 2 doses of (herpes zoster) vaccine at or after age 50
Tetanus-diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine
: have as one of your tetanus-diphtheria vaccines if you did not receive it as an adolescent
Tetanus-diphtheria
: have a booster (Td or Tdap) every 10 years
INFECTIOUS DISEASE SCREENING
Screening for hepatitis C:
All adults ages 18 to 79 should get a one-time test for
hepatitis C
.
Screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV): all people ages 15 to 65 should get a one-time test.
Depending on your lifestyle and medical history, you may need to be screened for infections such as syphilis, chlamydia, and other infections.
LUNG CANCER SCREENING
You should have an annual screening for
lung cancer
with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) if:
You are age 50 to 80 years AND
You have a 20 pack-year smoking history AND
You currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years
OSTEOPOROSIS SCREENING
If you have risk factors for
osteoporosis
, you should discuss screening with your provider.
Risk factors can include long-term steroid use, low body weight, smoking, heavy alcohol use, having a fracture after age 50, or a family history of hip fracture or osteoporosis.
PHYSICAL EXAMS
All adults should visit their provider from time to time, even if they are healthy. The purpose of these visits is to:
Screen for diseases
Assess risk of future medical problems
Encourage a healthy lifestyle
Update vaccinations and other preventive care services
Maintain a relationship with a provider in case of an illness
In addition:
Your blood pressure should be checked at least every year.
Your height, weight, and
body mass index (BMI)
should be checked at every exam.
During your exam, your provider may ask you about:
Depression and anxiety
Diet and exercise, including exercises to improve your balance and reduce your risk of falling
Alcohol and tobacco use
Safety, such as use of seat belts and smoke detectorsÂ and intimate partner violence
Whether you have had any falls or are afraid of falling
Your medicines and risk for interactions
PROSTATE CANCER SCREENING
If you're 55 through 69 years old, before having the test, talk to your provider about the pros and cons of having a prostate specific antigen (
PSA
) blood test. Ask about:
Whether screening decreases your chance of dying from
prostate cancer
.
Whether there is any harm from prostate cancer screening, such as side effects from testing or overtreatment of cancer when discovered.
Whether you have a higher risk of prostate cancer than others.
For men 70 or older, most recommendations are against screening.
If you choose to be tested, the PSA blood test is repeated over time (yearly or less often), though the best frequency is not known.
Prostate physical examinations are no longer routinely done on men with no symptoms.
SKIN EXAM
Your provider may check your skin for signs of
skin cancer
, especially if you're at high risk. You may be at risk if you:
Have had skin cancer before
Have close relatives with skin cancer
Have a weakened immune systemÂ
Professional organizations do not recommend for or against performing a skin self-exam.
Â TESTICULAR EXAM
The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) now recommends against performing testicular self-exams. Doing testicular self-exams has been shown to have little to no benefit.
