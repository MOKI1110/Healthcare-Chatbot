Sputum direct fluorescent antibody (DFA) is a lab test that looks for micro-organisms in lung secretions.
How the Test is Performed
You will produce a sputum sample from your lungs by coughing up mucus from deep inside your lungs. (This mucus is not the same as saliva or spit from the mouth.)
The sample is sent to a lab. There, a fluorescent dye is added to the sample. If micro-organisms are present, a bright glow (fluorescence) can be seen in the sputum sample using a special microscope.
How to Prepare for the Test
If coughing does not produce sputum, a breathing treatment may be given before the test to trigger sputum production.
How the Test will Feel
There is no discomfort with this test.
Why the Test is Performed
Your health care provider may order this test if you have signs of certain lung infections.
Normal Results
Normally, there is no fluorescence.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Abnormal results may be due to an infection such as:
Legionnaire disease
Pneumonia
due to certain bacteria, viruses, fungi, or other micro-organisms
Risks
There are no risks with this test.
Alternative Names
Direct immunofluorescence test; Direct fluorescent antibody - sputum
