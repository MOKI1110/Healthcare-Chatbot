Naproxen sodium overdose
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Naproxen sodium is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve mild to moderate aches and pains and swelling. Naproxen sodium overdose occurs when someone accidentally or intentionally takes more than the recommended amount of this medicine. People with kidney or liver disease are more likely to develop serious side effects or worsening of their disease from NSAIDs.
As a group, and because of their common use, NSAIDs are responsible for more serious drug-related side effects than any other class of pain-relieving medicines.
