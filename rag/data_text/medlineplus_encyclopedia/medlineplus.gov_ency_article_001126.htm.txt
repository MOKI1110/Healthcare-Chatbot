MSG symptom complex

MSG symptom complex is a set of symptoms associated with eating food with the additive monosodium glutamate (MSG). MSG is the sodium salt of a common amino acid, glutamic acid. MSG is found naturally in our bodies and in many foods including cheese and tomatoes. MSG is added to many different types of foods as a flavor enhancer.
Causes
Reports of reactions to MSG originated in 1968 in a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Since then, reports of reactions to MSG have come from people claiming to experience symptoms after consuming food containing MSG. However, studies on MSG in foods have failed to find a conclusive link between MSG and the symptoms some people describe.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did a study of the issue and found no evidence that MSG in food caused symptoms. The report did find minor reactions in people who consumed 3 or more grams of MSG alone without food. Most foods with MSG have less than 0.5 grams of the additive.
MSG is rated as "generally considered safe" by the FDA.
Symptoms
Symptoms, if they occur, are usually mild and go away in a short time:
Flushing
Headache

Numbness
or burning in or around the mouth
Heart palpitations
Tingling
Drowsiness
Exams and Tests
There are no tests for MSG symptom complex.
Treatment
Most symptoms are mild, such as headache or flushing, and need no treatment.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Most people recover from perceived MSG symptom complex without treatment and have no lasting problems.
