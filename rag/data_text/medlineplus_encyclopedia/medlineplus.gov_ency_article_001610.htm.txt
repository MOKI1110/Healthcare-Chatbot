Erythroderma is widespread redness of the skin. It is accompanied by
scaling
, peeling, and flaking of the skin, and may include itching and hair loss.
Causes
Erythroderma may occur due to:
Complication of other skin conditions, such as
eczema
and
psoriasis
Reaction to medicines or some chemicals, such as phenytoin and allopurinol
Some types of cancer, such as lymphoma
Sometimes the cause is unknown. It is more common in males.

Redness over 80% to 90% of the body
Scaly skin patches
Thickened skin
Skin is itchy or painful with an odor
Swelling of the arms or legs
Fast heart beat

Loss of temperature regulation by the body
There may be secondary infections of the skin.
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will ask about your symptoms and take your medical history. The provider will do a skin examination with a dermatoscope. Most of the time, the cause can be identified after the exam.
If needed, the following tests may be ordered:
Biopsy of the skin
Allergy testing
Other tests to find the cause of erythroderma
Treatment
Since erythroderma can quickly lead to serious complications, the provider will start treatment right away. This usually involves strong doses of cortisone medicines to reduce inflammation.
Other treatments may include:
Medicines to treat the underlying cause of erythroderma
Antibiotics for any infection
Dressings applied to the skin
Ultraviolet light
Correction of fluid and electrolyte balance
Outlook (Prognosis)
In serious cases, the person needs to be treated in the hospital.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Secondary infections that can lead to
sepsis
(bodywide inflammatory response)
Fluid loss that can result in dehydration and an imbalance of minerals (electrolytes) in the body
Heart failure
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider right away if:
Symptoms get worse or do not get better, even with treatment.

Prevention
Risk for erythroderma may be reduced by following the provider's instructions on skin care.
