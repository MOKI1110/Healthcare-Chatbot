Secondary systemic amyloidosis is a disorder in which abnormal proteins build up in tissues and organs. Clumps of the abnormal proteins are called amyloid deposits.
Secondary means it occurs because of another disease or situation. For example, this condition usually occurs due to
long-term
(chronic) infection or inflammation. In contrast, primary amyloidosis is a primary hematological disorder that results in deposition of abnormal amyloid proteins in different organs such as the heart and kidney.
Systemic means that the disease affects the entire body.
Causes
The exact cause of secondary systemic
amyloidosis
is unknown. You are more likely to develop secondary systemic amyloidosis if you have a long-term infection or inflammation.
This condition may occur with:
Ankylosing spondylitis
-- a form of arthritis that mostly affects the bones and joints in the spine
Bronchiectasis
-- a disease in which the large airways in the lungs are damaged by chronic infection
Chronic
osteomyelitis
-- a long-standing bone infection
Cystic fibrosis
-- a genetic disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other areas of the body, leading to chronic infection of the lungs
Familial Mediterranean fever
-- an inherited disorder of repeated fevers and inflammation that often affects the lining of the abdomen, chest, or joints
Gout
Hairy cell leukemia
-- a type of blood cancer
Hodgkin disease
-- cancer of the lymph tissue
Inflammatory bowel disease
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis
-- arthritis that affects children
Multiple myeloma
-- a type of blood cancer
Psoriatic arthritis
Reactive arthritis
-- a group of conditions that causes swelling and inflammation of the joints, eyes, and urinary and genital systems
Rheumatoid arthritis
Systemic lupus erythematosus
-- an autoimmune disorder
Tuberculosis
Vasculitis
(inflammation of the blood vessels)
Symptoms
Symptoms of secondary systemic amyloidosis depend on which body tissue is affected by the protein deposits. These deposits damage normal tissues. This may lead to the symptoms or signs of this illness, including:
Bleeding in the skin
Fatigue
Irregular heartbeat
Numbness
of hands and feet
Rash
Shortness of breath
Swallowing difficulties
Swollen arms or legs
Swollen tongue
Weak hand grip
Weight loss
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about your symptoms.
Tests that may be done include:
Abdominal ultrasound
(may show a swollen liver or spleen)
Biopsy (removing a small piece) or
aspiration
using a needle to remove a small piece of fat just beneath the skin
Biopsy of rectum
Biopsy of skin
Biopsy of bone marrow
Blood tests, including
creatinine
and
BUN
(blood urea nitrogen)
Echocardiogram
Electrocardiogram
(ECG)
Nerve conduction velocity
Urinalysis
A special test known as mass spectrometry can determine the subtype of amyloid
Treatment
The condition that is causing the amyloidosis should be treated. In some cases, the drug colchicine or an immunosuppressive medicine (medicine that suppresses the immune system) is prescribed.
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well a person does depends on which organs are affected. It also depends on, whether the disease that is causing it can be controlled. If the disease involves the heart and kidneys, it may lead to organ failure and death.
Possible Complications
Health problems that may result from secondary systemic amyloidosis include:
Endocrine
failure
Heart failure
Kidney failure
Nerve damage
Respiratory
failure
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of this condition. The following are serious symptoms that need prompt medical attention:
Bleeding
Irregular heartbeat
Numbness
Shortness of breath
Swelling
Weak grip
Prevention
If you have a disease that is known to increase your risk for this condition, make sure you get it treated. This may help prevent amyloidosis.
