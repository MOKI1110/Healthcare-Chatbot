Epidermolysis bullosa

Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a group of disorders in which skin blisters form after a minor injury. It is passed down in families.
Causes
There are 3 main types of EB. They are:
Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa
Epidermolysis bullosa simplex
Junctional epidermolysis bullosa
EB can vary in severity from minor to fatal. The minor forms cause blistering of the skin. The fatal forms affect other organs. Most types of this condition start at birth or soon after. It can be hard to identify the exact type of EB a person has, although specific genetic markers are now available for most.
Family history is a risk factor. The risk is higher if a parent has this condition.
Another rare type of EB is called epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. This form develops after birth. It is an
autoimmune disorder
, which means the body attacks itself.
Symptoms
Depending on the form of EB, symptoms can include:
Alopecia (
hair loss
)
Blisters
around the eyes and nose
Blisters in or around the mouth and throat, causing feeding problems or
swallowing difficulty
Blisters on the skin as a result of minor injury or temperature change, especially of the feet
Blistering that is present at birth
Dental problems, such as tooth decay
Hoarse cry, cough, or other breathing problems
Tiny white bumps on previously injured skin
Nail loss or deformed nails
Mitten-like hands or feet
Thickening of skin on hands and feet
Muscle, heart, brain, gastrointestinal, bone, or kidney issues
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will look at your skin to diagnose EB.
Tests that are used to confirm the diagnosis include:
Genetic testing
Skin biopsy
Special tests of skin samples under a microscope
Skin tests may be used to identify the form of EB.
Other tests that may be done include:
Blood test for anemia
Culture
to check for bacterial infection if wounds are healing poorly
Imaging studies to look at other organs
The growth rate will be checked often for a baby who has or may have EB.
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to prevent blisters from forming and avoiding complications. Other treatment will depend on how bad the condition is.
HOME CARE
Follow these guidelines at home:
Take good care of your skin to prevent infections.
Follow your provider's advice if blistered areas become crusted or raw. You might need regular whirlpool therapy and to apply antibiotic ointments to wound-like areas. Your provider will let you know if you need a bandage or a dressing, and if so, what type to use.
You may need to use oral steroid medicines for short periods of time if you have
swallowing problems
. You may also need to take medicine if you get a candida (yeast) infection in the mouth or throat.
Take good care of your oral health and get regular dental check-ups. It is best to see a dentist who has experience treating people with EB.
Eat a healthy diet. When you have a lot of skin injury, you may need extra calories and protein to help your skin heal. Choose soft foods and avoid nuts, chips, and other crunchy foods if you have sores in your mouth. A nutritionist can help you with your diet.
Do exercises a physical therapist shows you to help keep your joints and muscles mobile.
SURGERY
Surgery to treat this condition may include:
Skin grafting
in places where sores are deep
Dilation (widening) of the esophagus if there is a narrowing
Repair of hand deformities
Removal of any
squamous cell carcinoma
(a type of skin cancer) that develops
OTHER TREATMENTS
Other treatments for this condition may include:
Medicines that suppress the immune system may be used for the autoimmune form of this condition.
Protein and gene therapy and the use of the medicine interferon are being studied.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outlook depends on the severity of the illness.
Infection of the blistered areas is common.
Mild forms of EB improve with age. Very serious forms of EB have a very high death rate.
In the severe forms, scarring after blisters form may cause:
Contracture deformities
(for example, at the fingers, elbows, and knees) and other deformities
Swallowing problems if the mouth and esophagus are affected
Fused fingers and toes
Limited mobility from scarring
Possible Complications
These complications may occur:
Anemia
Reduced life span due to severe forms of the condition
Esophageal narrowing
Eye problems, including blindness
Infection, including
sepsis
(infection in the blood)
Loss of function in the hands and feet
Muscular dystrophy
Periodontal disease
Cardiac problems
Kidney failure
Severe malnutrition caused by feeding difficulty, leading to
failure to thrive
Squamous cell skin cancer
When to Contact a Medical Professional
If your infant has any blistering shortly after birth, contact your provider. If you have a family history of EB and plan to have children, you may want to have genetic counseling.
Prevention
Genetic counseling is recommended for prospective parents who have a family history of any form of EB.
During pregnancy, a test called
chorionic villus sampling
may be used to test the baby. For couples at high risk of having a child with EB, the test can be done as early as week 8 to 10 of pregnancy. Talk to your provider.
To prevent skin damage and blistering, wear padding around injury-prone areas such as the elbows, knees, ankles, and buttocks. Avoid contact sports.
If you have EB acquisita and are on steroids for longer than 1 month, you may need calcium and vitamin D supplements. These supplements may help prevent
osteoporosis
(thinning bones).
