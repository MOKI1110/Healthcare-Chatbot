Hepatocellular carcinoma is cancer that starts in the liver.
Causes
Hepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of liver cancer. It occurs more often in men than women. It is most often diagnosed in people age 50 or older.
Hepatocellular carcinoma is not the same as
metastatic liver cancer
. Metastatic liver cancer starts in another organ (such as the breast or colon) and spreads to the liver.
In most cases, the cause of hepatocellular liver cancer is long-term damage and scarring of the liver (
cirrhosis
). Cirrhosis may be caused by:
Alcohol overuse
Autoimmune diseases
of the liver
Hepatitis B
or
hepatitis C
virus infection
Inflammation of the liver that is long-term (chronic hepatitis)
Iron overload in the body (
hemochromatosis
)
People with hepatitis B or C are at high risk for liver cancer, even if they do not develop cirrhosis.
Symptoms
Symptoms of liver cancer may include any of the following:
Abdominal pain
or tenderness, especially in the upper-right part
Easy bruising or bleeding
Enlarged abdomen due to fluid in the abdomen (
ascites
)
Yellow skin or eyes (
jaundice
)
Unexplained weight loss
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. The physical exam may show an enlarged, tender liver or other signs of cirrhosis.
If your provider suspects liver cancer, tests that may be ordered include:
Abdominal CT scan
Abdominal MRI scan
Abdominal ultrasound
Liver biopsy
Liver function tests
Serum alpha fetoprotein
Some people at risk for liver cancer may get regular blood tests and ultrasounds to see if tumors are developing.
Treatment
Treatment depends on how advanced the cancer is.
Surgery may be done if the tumor has not spread. Before surgery, the tumor may be treated with
chemotherapy
to reduce its size. This is most often done by delivering the medicine straight into the liver with a tube (catheter).
Radiation treatments
in the area of the cancer may also be helpful.
Ablation is another method that may be used. Ablate means to destroy. Types of ablation include using:
Radio waves or microwaves
Ethanol (an alcohol) or acetic acid (vinegar)
Extreme cold (cryoablation)
A
liver transplant
may be recommended.
If the cancer can't be surgically removed or has spread outside the liver, there is usually no chance for long-term cure. Treatment instead focuses on improving and extending the person's life. Treatment in this case may use
targeted therapy
with drugs that can be taken as pills. Newer immunotherapy drugs may also be used.
Support Groups
You can ease the stress of illness by joining a
cancer support group
. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.
Outlook (Prognosis)
If the cancer can't be completely treated, the disease is usually fatal. But survival can vary, depending on how advanced the cancer is and how successful treatment is.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you develop ongoing abdominal pain, especially if you have a history of
liver disease
.
Prevention
Preventive measures include:
Preventing and treating viral hepatitis may help reduce your risk. Childhood vaccination against hepatitis B may reduce the risk for liver cancer in the future.
Not drinking alcohol in excess.
Screening for liver cancer in people with certain types of hemochromatosis (iron overload).
Screening for liver cancer in people who have hepatitis B or C or cirrhosis.
