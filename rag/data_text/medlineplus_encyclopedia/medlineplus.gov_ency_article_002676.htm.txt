Home Care
Seek medical help right away. Do not make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to.
Naloxone is a life-saving medicine that can reverse an overdose from opioids, including meperidine, and is often available to the general public without prescription. If Naloxone is available, follow all state and federal guidelines and regulations regarding its use.
If you give someone Naloxone, always seek medical help right away, and always stay with them until emergency help arrives.
Before Calling Emergency

Person's age, weight, and condition
Name of the product (and ingredients and strength, if known)

If the medicine was prescribed for the person
Poison Control
Your local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.
The provider will measure and monitor the person's
vital signs
, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.
Tests that may be done include:
Blood and urine tests
Chest x-ray
Electrocardiogram
(ECG)
Treatment may include:
Fluids through a vein (by IV)
Medicine to reverse the effects of the meperidine (an antidote) and to treat other symptoms
Activated charcoal
Laxative
Breathing support, including a tube through the mouth into the lungs and connected to a breathing machine (
ventilator
)
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well someone does depends on how much meperidine they took and how quickly they receive treatment. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.
If an antidote can be given, recovery begins right away. People who take a large overdose may stop breathing. They may also have seizures if they do not get this medicine quickly. A hospital stay may be needed for additional doses of the antidote. Complications, such as pneumonia, muscle damage from lying on a hard surface for a prolonged period of time, or brain damage from lack of oxygen, may result in permanent disability.
A severe overdose of meperidine can cause death.
