Sensorineural deafness is a
type of hearing loss
. It occurs from damage to the inner ear, the place of origin of the nerve that runs from the ear to the brain (auditory nerve), or damage to the brain itself.
Considerations
Symptoms may include:
Some sounds seem overly loud in one ear.
You have problems following conversations when two or more people are talking.
You have problems hearing in noisy areas.
It is easier to hear men's voices than women's voices.
It is hard to tell high-pitched sounds (such as "s" or "th") from one another.
Other people's voices sound mumbled or slurred.
You have problems hearing when there is background noise.
Associated symptoms may include:
Feeling of being off-balance or dizzy (more common with
Meniere disease
and
acoustic neuromas
)
Ringing or buzzing sound in the ears (
tinnitus
)
Causes
The inner part of the ear contains tiny hair cells (nerve endings), that change sounds into electric signals. The nerves then carry these signals to the brain.
Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is caused by damage to these special cells, or to the nerve fibers in the inner ear. Sometimes, the hearing loss is caused by damage to the nerve that carries the signals to the brain.
Sensorineural deafness that is present at birth (congenital) is most often due to:
Genetic syndromes
Infections that the mother passes to her baby in the womb (
toxoplasmosis
,
rubella
,
herpes
)
SNHL may develop in children or adults later in life (acquired) as a result of:
Age-related hearing loss
Disease of the blood vessels
Immune disease
Infections, such as
meningitis
,
mumps
,
scarlet fever
, and
measles
Injury of the ear or head
Loud noises or sounds, or
loud sounds that last for a long time
Meniere disease
Tumor, such as
acoustic neuroma
Use of certain medicines
Working around loud noises every day
In some cases, the cause is unknown.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
The goal of treatment is to improve your hearing. The following may be helpful:
Hearing aids
Telephone amplifiers and other assistive devices
Safety and alert systems for your home
Sign language (for those with severe hearing loss)
Speech reading (such as lip reading and using visual cues to aid communication)
A
cochlear implant
may be recommended for certain people with severe hearing loss. Surgery is done to place the implant. The implant makes sounds seem louder, but does not restore normal hearing.
You will also learn strategies for
living with hearing loss
and advice to share with those around you for
talking to someone with hearing loss
.
