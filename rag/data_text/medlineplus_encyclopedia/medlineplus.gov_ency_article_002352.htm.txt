An enterotoxin is a substance that is harmful to your digestive system. It is produced by certain bacteria. The enterotoxin enters your stomach and intestines if you eat contaminated food or water. It can also be produced by bacteria in the intestines. This causes symptoms such as cramps, nausea, vomiting, or diarrhea.
