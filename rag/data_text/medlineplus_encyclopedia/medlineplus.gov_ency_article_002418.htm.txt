Chromium in diet
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Chromium is an essential element that is not made by the body. It must be obtained from the diet.
Function
Chromium is important in the
breakdown
of fats and
carbohydrates
. It stimulates fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. They are important for brain function and other body processes. Chromium also aids in insulin action and glucose breakdown.
Food Sources
The best source of chromium is brewer's yeast. However, many people do not use brewer's yeast because it causes bloating (
abdominal distention
) and
nausea
. Meat and whole grain products are relatively good sources. Some fruits, vegetables, and spices are also relatively good sources.
Other good sources of chromium include the following:
Beef
Liver
Eggs
Chicken
Oysters
Wheat germ
Broccoli
Side Effects
Lack of chromium may be seen in people with impaired glucose tolerance. It occurs in older people with
type 2 diabetes
and in infants with
protein-calorie malnutrition
. Taking a chromium supplement may help reduce insulin resistance but is not recommended as the sole treatment for people with diabetes.
Because of the low absorption and high excretion rates of chromium, toxicity is not common.
Recommendations
Dosages for chromium, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:
Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)
: The average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people. An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence.
Adequate Intake (AI)
: This level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA. It is set at a level that is thought to ensure enough nutrition.
The AIs for chromium are as follows:
Infants
0 to 6 months: 0.2 micrograms per day (mcg/day)
7 to 12 months: 5.5 mcg/day
Children
1 to 3 years: 11 mcg/day
4 to 8 years: 15 mcg/day
Males age 9 to 13 years: 25 mcg/day
Females age 9 to 13 years: 21 mcg/day
Adolescents and adults
Males age 14 to 50: 35 mcg/day
Males age 51 and over: 30 mcg/day
Females age 14 to 18: 24 mcg/day
Females age 19 to 50: 25 mcg/day
Females age 51 and older: 20 mcg/day
Pregnant females age 19 to 50: 30 mcg/day (age 14 to 18: 29 mcg/day)
Lactating females age 19 to 50: 45 mcg/day (age 14 to 18: 44 mcg/day)
The best way to get the daily requirement of essential vitamins is to eat a balanced diet that contains a variety of foods from the food guide plate.
Specific recommendations depend on age, sex, and other factors (such as pregnancy). Women who are pregnant or producing breast milk (lactating) need higher amounts. Ask your health care provider which amount is best for you.
