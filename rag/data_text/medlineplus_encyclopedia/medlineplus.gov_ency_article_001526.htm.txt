Autism spectrum disorder

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder. It often appears in the first 2 to 3 years of life. ASD affects the brain's ability to develop normal social and communication skills.
Causes
The exact cause of ASD isn't known. It's likely that a number of factors may lead to ASD. Research shows that genes may be involved, since ASD runs in some families. Certain medicines taken during pregnancy may also lead to ASD in the child.
Other causes have been suspected, but not proven. Some scientists believe that damage to a part of the brain, called the amygdala, may be involved. Others are looking at whether a virus may trigger symptoms.
Some parents have heard that vaccines may cause ASD. But studies have found no link between vaccines and ASD. All expert medical and government groups state that there is no link between vaccines and ASD.
The increase in children with ASD may be due to better diagnosis and newer definitions of ASD. Autism spectrum disorder now includes syndromes that used to be regarded as separate disorders:
Autistic disorder
Asperger syndrome
Childhood disintegrative disorder
Pervasive developmental disorder
Symptoms
Most parents of children with ASD suspect that something is wrong by the time the child is 18 months old. Children with ASD often have problems with:
Pretend play
Social interactions
Verbal and nonverbal communication
Some children seem normal before age 1 or 2. They then suddenly lose language or social skills they already had.
Symptoms can vary from moderate to severe.
A person with ASD may:
Be very sensitive to sight, hearing, touch, smell, or taste (for example, they refuse to wear "itchy" clothes and get upset if they're forced to wear the clothes)
Be very upset when routines are changed
Repeat body movements over and over
Be unusually attached to things
Communication problems may include:
Can't start or maintain a conversation
Uses gestures instead of words
Develops language slowly or not at all
Doesn't adjust gaze to look at objects that others are looking at
Doesn't refer to self the right way (for example, says "you want water" when the child means "I want water")
Doesn't point to show other people objects (normally occurs in the first 14 months of life)
Repeats words or memorized passages, such as commercials
Social interaction problems may include:
Doesn't make friends
Doesn't play interactive games
Is withdrawn
May not respond to eye contact or smiles, or may avoid eye contact
May treat others as objects
Prefers to be alone rather than with others
Isn't able to show empathy
Response to sensory information problems may include:
Doesn't startle at loud noises
Has very high or very low senses of sight, hearing, touch, smell, or taste
May find normal noises painful and hold their hands over their ears
May withdraw from physical contact because it's too stimulating or overwhelming
Rubs surfaces, mouths or licks objects
May have a very high or very low response to pain
Problems with play may include:
Doesn't imitate the actions of others
Prefers solitary or ritualistic play
Shows little pretend or imaginative play
Behaviors may include:
Acts out with intense tantrums
Gets stuck on a single topic or task
Has a short attention span
Has very narrow interests
Is overactive or very passive
Is aggressive toward others or self
Shows a strong need for things being the same
Repeats body movements
Exams and Tests
All children should have routine exams done by their health care provider. More tests may be needed if the provider or parents are concerned. This is true if a child doesn't meet any one of these language milestones:
Babbling by 12 months
Gesturing (pointing, waving bye-bye) by 12 months
Saying single words by 16 months
Saying two-word spontaneous phrases by 24 months (not just echoing)
Losing any language or social skills at any age
These children might need a hearing test, blood lead test, and screening test for ASD.
A provider experienced in diagnosing and treating ASD should see the child to make the actual diagnosis. Because there isn't a definitive test for ASD, diagnosis is often based on guidelines from a medical book titled
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V)
.
An evaluation for ASD often includes a complete physical and nervous system (neurologic) exam. Tests may be done to see if there is a problem with genes or the body's
metabolism
. Metabolism is the body's physical and chemical processes.
ASD includes a broad spectrum of symptoms. So, a single, brief evaluation can't tell a child's true abilities. It's best to have a team of specialists to evaluate the child. They might evaluate:
Communication
Language
Motor skills
Speech
Success at school
Thinking abilities
Some parents don't want to have their child diagnosed because they're afraid the child will be labeled. But without a diagnosis, their child may not get the needed treatment and services.
Treatment
At this time, there is no cure for ASD. A treatment program will greatly improve the outlook for most young children. Most programs build on the interests of the child in a highly structured schedule of constructive activities.
Treatment plans may combine techniques, including:
Applied behavior analysis (ABA)
Medicines, if needed
Occupational therapy
Physical therapy
Speech-language therapy
APPLIED BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS (ABA)
This program is for younger children. ItÂ helps in some cases. ABA uses one-on-one teaching that reinforces various skills. The goal is to get the child close to normal functioning for their age.
An ABA program is often done in a child's home. A behavioral psychologist oversees the program. ABA programs can be very expensive and aren't widely used by school systems. Parents often have to find funding and staffing from other sources, which aren't available in many communities.
TEACCH
Another program is called the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH). It uses picture schedules and other visual cues. These helpÂ children work on their own and organize and structure their environments.
Though TEACCH tries to improve a child's skills and ability to adapt, it also accepts the problems associated with ASD. Unlike ABA programs, TEACCH doesn't expect children to achieve typical development with treatment.
MEDICINES
There is no medicine that treats ASD itself. But medicines are often used to treat behavior or emotional problems that people with ASD may have. These include:
Aggression
Anxiety
Attention problems
Extreme compulsions that the child cannot stop
Hyperactivity
Impulsiveness
Irritability
Mood swings
Outbursts
Sleep difficulty
Tantrums
The drug risperidone is FDA approved to treat children ages 5 through 16 for the irritability and aggression that can occur with ASD. The drug aripriprazole is FDA approved to treat children ages 6 through 17 for the same symptoms. Other medicines that may also be used are mood stabilizers and stimulants.
DIET
Some children with ASD seem to do well on a gluten-free or casein-free diet. Gluten is in foods containing wheat, rye, and barley. Casein is in milk, cheese, and other dairy products. Not all experts agree that changes in diet make a difference. And not all studies have shown positive results.
IfÂ you're thinking about these or other diet changes, talk to both a provider and a registered dietitian. You want to be sure thatÂ your child is still getting enough calories and the right nutrients.
OTHER APPROACHES
Beware of widely publicized treatments for ASD that don't have scientific support, and reports of miracle cures. If your child has ASD, talk with other parents. Also discuss your concerns with ASD specialists. Follow the progress of ASD research, which is rapidly developing.
Support Groups
Many
organizations
provide additional information and help on ASD.
Outlook (Prognosis)
With the right treatment, many ASD symptoms can be improved. Most people with ASD have some symptoms throughout their lives. But, they're able to live with their families or in the community.
Possible Complications
ASD can beÂ linked with other brain disorders, such as:
Fragile X syndrome
Intellectual disability
Tuberous sclerosis
Some people with autism develop seizures.
The stress of dealing with autism can lead to social and emotionalÂ problems for families and caregivers, and for the person with autism.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Parents usually suspect that there is a developmental problem long before a diagnosis is made. Call your provider if you think that your child is not developing normally.
