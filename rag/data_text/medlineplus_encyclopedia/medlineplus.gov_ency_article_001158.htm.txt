Plummer-Vinson syndrome is a condition that can occur in people with long-term (chronic)
iron deficiency anemia
. People with this condition have problems swallowing due to small, thin growths of tissue (webs) that partially block the upper food pipe (esophagus).
Causes
The cause of Plummer-Vinson syndrome is unknown. Genetic factors and a lack of certain nutrients (in particular iron deficiency anemia) may play a role. It is a rare disorder that can be linked to cancers of the esophagus and throat. It is more common in women.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
Difficulty swallowing
Weakness or fatigue from the anemia
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will do an exam to look for abnormal areas on your skin and nails.
You may have an
upper GI series
or
upper endoscopy
to look for abnormal tissue in the food pipe. You may have tests to look for anemia or iron deficiency.
Treatment
Taking iron supplements may improve the swallowing problems. Sometimes, intravenous (IV) iron is needed.
If supplements do not help, the web of tissue can be widened during upper endoscopy. This will allow you to swallow food normally.
Outlook (Prognosis)
People with this conditionÂ generally respond to treatment.
Possible Complications
Devices used to stretch the esophagus (dilators) may cause a tear. This can lead to bleeding.
Plummer-Vinson syndrome has been linked to
esophageal cancer
.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
Food gets stuck after you swallow it
You have severe fatigue and weakness
Prevention
GettingÂ enough iron in your diet may prevent this disorder.
