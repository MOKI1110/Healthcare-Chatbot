Morning sickness is
nausea and vomiting
that can occur at any time of the day during pregnancy.
Considerations
Morning sickness is very common. Most pregnant women have at least some nausea, and about one third have vomiting.
Morning sickness most often begins during the first month of pregnancy and continues through the 14th to 16th week (3rd or 4th month). Some women have nausea and vomiting through their
entire pregnancy
.
Morning sickness does not hurt the baby in any way unless you lose weight, such as with
severe vomiting
. Mild weight loss during the first trimester is not uncommon when women have moderate symptoms, and is not harmful to the baby.
The amount of morning sickness during one pregnancy does not predict how you will feel in future pregnancies.
Causes
The exact cause of morning sickness is unknown. It may be caused by hormone changes or lower blood sugar during early pregnancy. Emotional stress, fatigue, traveling, or some foods can make the problem worse. Nausea in pregnancy is more common and can be worse with twins or triplets.
Home Care
Try to keep a positive attitude. Remember that in most cases morning sickness stops after the first 3 or 4 months of pregnancy. To reduce nausea, try:
A few soda crackers or dry toast when you first wake up, even before you get out of bed in the morning.
A small snack at bedtime and when getting up to go to the bathroom at night.
Avoid large meals; instead, snack as often as every 1 to 2 hours during the day and drink plenty of fluids.
Eat foods high in protein and complex carbohydrates, such as peanut butter on apple slices or celery; nuts; cheese; crackers; milk; cottage cheese; and yogurt; avoid foods high in fat and salt, but low in nutrition.
Ginger products (proven effective against morning sickness) such as ginger tea, ginger candy, and ginger soda.
Here are some more tips:
Acupressure wrist bands or acupuncture may help. You can find these bands in drug, health food, and travel and boating stores. If you are thinking about trying acupuncture, talk to your health care provider and look for an acupuncturist who is trained to work with pregnant women.
Avoid smoking and secondhand smoke.
Avoid taking medicines for morning sickness. If you do, ask a provider first.
Keep air flowing through rooms to reduce odors.
When you feel nauseated, bland foods like gelatin, broth, ginger ale, and saltine crackers can soothe your stomach.
Take your prenatal vitamins at night. Increase vitamin B6 in your diet by eating whole grains, nuts, seeds, and peas and beans (legumes). Talk to your provider about possibly taking vitamin B6 supplements. Doxylamine is another medicine that is sometimes prescribed and is known to be safe.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
Morning sickness does not improve, despite trying home remedies.
Nausea and vomiting continue beyond your 4th month of pregnancy. This happens to some women. In most cases this is normal, but you should have it checked out.
You
vomit blood
or material that looks like coffee grounds. (Call immediately.)
You vomit more than 3 times per day or you cannot keep food or liquid down.
Your urine appears to be concentrated and dark, or you urinate very infrequently.
You have excessive weight loss.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will do a physical examination, including a pelvic exam, and look for any signs of
dehydration
.
Your provider may ask the following questions:
Are you only nauseated or do you also vomit?
Does the nausea and vomiting occur every day?
Does it last throughout the day?
Can you keep down any food or fluid?
Have you been traveling?
Has your schedule changed?
Are you feeling stressed?
What foods have you been eating?
Do you smoke?
What have you done to try to feel better?
What other symptoms do you have -- headaches, abdominal pain, breast tenderness, dry mouth, excessive thirst, unintended weight loss?
Your provider may do the following tests:
Blood tests including
