The cortisol urine test measures the level of cortisol in the urine. Cortisol is aÂ glucocorticoidÂ (steroid) hormone produced by the
adrenal gland
.
Cortisol can also be measured using a
blood
or saliva test.
How the Test is Performed
A 24-hour urine sample is needed. You will need to
collect your urine over 24 hours
in a container provided by the laboratory. Your health care provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly.
Because cortisol production by the adrenal gland can vary, the test may need to be done three or more separate times over a few weeks to months to get a more accurate picture of average cortisol production.
How to Prepare for the Test
You may be asked not to do any vigorous exercise the day before the test.
You may also be told to temporarily stop taking medicines that can affect the test, including:
Anti-seizure medicines
Estrogen
Human-made (synthetic) glucocorticoids, such as hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone
Androgens
How the Test will Feel
The test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.
Why the Test is Performed
The test is done to check for increased or decreased cortisol production. Cortisol is a glucocorticoid (steroid) hormone released from the adrenal gland in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (
ACTH
). This is a hormone released from the pituitary gland in the brain. Cortisol affects many different body systems. It plays a role in:
Bone growth
Blood pressure control
Immune system function
Metabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and protein
Nervous system function
Stress response
Different diseases, such as
Cushing syndrome
and
Addison disease
, can lead to either too much or too little production of cortisol. Measuring urine cortisol levels can help diagnose these conditions.
Normal Results
Normal range is less than 45 mcg/24 hours (124 nmol/24 hours) for women and less than 60 mcg/24 hours (165 nmol/24 hours).
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
A higher than normal level may indicate:
Cushing disease
, in which the pituitary gland makes too much ACTH because of excess growth of the pituitary gland or a tumor in the pituitary gland
Ectopic Cushing syndrome
, in which a tumor outside the pituitary or adrenal glands makes too much ACTH
Severe depression
Tumor of the adrenal gland
that is producing too much cortisol
Severe stress
Rare genetic disorders
A lower than normal level may indicate:
Addison disease in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol
Hypopituitarism
in which the pituitary gland does not signal the adrenal gland to produce enough cortisol
Suppression of normal pituitary or adrenal function by glucocorticoid medicines including pills, skin creams, eyedrops, inhalers, joint injections, chemotherapy
Risks
There are no risks with this test.
