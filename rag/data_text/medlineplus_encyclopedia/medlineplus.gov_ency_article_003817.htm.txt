A barium enema is a special
x-ray
of the large intestine, which includes the colon and rectum.
How the Test is Performed
This test may be done in your health care provider's office or hospital radiology department. It is done after your colon is completely empty and clean. Your provider will give you instructions for cleansing your colon.
During the test:
You lie flat on your back on the x-ray table. An x-ray is taken.
You then lie on your side. The x-ray technologist or radiologist gently inserts a well-lubricated tube (enema tube) into your rectum. The tube is connected to a bag that holds a liquid containing barium sulfate. This is a contrast material that highlights specific areas in the colon, creating a clear image.
The barium flows into your colon. X-rays are taken. A small balloon at the tip of the enema tube may be inflated to help keep the barium inside your colon. TheÂ x-ray technologist or radiologist monitors the flow of the barium on an x-ray screen.
Sometimes a small amount of air is delivered into the colon to expand it. This allows for even clearer images. This test is called a double contrast barium enema.
You are asked to move into different positions. The table will move up and down to get different views. At certain times when the x-ray pictures are taken, you are told to hold your breath and be still for a few seconds so the images will not be blurry.
The enema tube is removed after the x-rays are taken.
You are then given a bedpan or helped to the toilet, so you can empty your bowels and remove as much of the barium as possible. Afterward, 1 or 2 more x-rays may be taken.
How to Prepare for the Test
Your bowels need to be completely empty for the exam. If they are not empty, the test may miss a problem in your large intestine.
You will be given instructions for cleansing your bowel using an enema or laxatives. This is also called bowel preparation. Follow the instructions exactly.
For 1 to 3 days before the test, you need to be on a clear liquid diet. Examples of clear liquids are:
Clear coffee or tea
Fat-free bouillon or broth
Gelatin
Sports drinks
Strained fruit juices
Water
How the Test will Feel
When barium enters your colon, you may feel like you need to have a bowel movement. You may also have:
A feeling of fullness
Moderate to severe cramping
General discomfort
Taking long, deep breaths may help you relax during the procedure.
It is normal for your stools to be white for a few days after this test. Drink extra fluids for 2 to 4 days. Ask your provider about a laxative if you develop hard stools.
Why the Test is Performed
The barium enema test is used to:
Detect or screen for
colon cancer
Diagnose or monitor
ulcerative colitis
or
Crohn disease
Diagnose the cause of
blood in stools
,
diarrhea
, or very hard stools (constipation)
The barium enema test is rarely used anymore.Â
Colonoscopy
Â or
CT colonography
is done more often now. Occasionally gastrografin enemas in patients that have had prior surgery are done which are similar to barium enemas.
Normal Results
Barium should fill the colon evenly, showing normal bowel shape and position and no blockages.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Abnormal test results may be a sign of:
Blockage of the large intestine
Narrowing of the colon above the rectum (
Hirschsprung disease
in infants)
Crohn disease or ulcerative colitis
Cancer in the colon or rectum
Sliding of one part of the intestine into another (
intussusception
)
Small growths that stick out of the lining of the colon, called
polyps
Small, bulging sacs or pouches of the inner lining of the intestine, called
diverticula
Twisted loop of the bowel (
volvulus
)
Fistula or abnormal connections of the colon to other organs
Risks
There is low radiation exposure. X-rays are monitored so that the smallest amount of radiation is used. Pregnant women and children are more sensitive to x-ray risks.
