Morton neuroma

Morton neuroma is an injury to the nerve between the toes that causes thickening and pain. It commonly affects the nerve that travels between the 3rd and 4th toes.
Causes
The exact cause is unknown. Health care providers believe the following may play a role in the development of this condition:
Wearing tight shoes and high heels
Abnormal positioning of toes
Flat feet
Forefoot problems, including
bunions
and
hammer toes
High foot arches
Morton neuroma is more common in women than in men.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
Numbness and tingling in the space between the 3rd and 4th toes
Toe cramping
Sharp, shooting, or burning pain in the ball of the foot and sometimes toes
Pain that increases when wearing tight shoes, high heels, or pressing on the area
Pain that gets worse over time
In rare cases, nerve pain occurs in the space between the 2nd and 3rd toes. This is not a common form of Morton neuroma, but symptoms and treatment are similar.
Exams and Tests
Your provider can usually diagnose this problem by examining your foot. Squeezing your forefoot or toes together bring on the symptoms.
A foot
x-ray
may be done to rule out bone problems.
MRI
or
ultrasound
can successfully diagnose the condition.
Nerve testing (
electromyography
) cannot diagnose Morton neuroma. But it may be used to check for conditions that cause similar symptoms.
Blood tests may be done to check for inflammation-related conditions, including certain forms of arthritis.
Treatment
Nonsurgical treatment is tried first. Your provider may recommend any of the following:
Padding and taping the toe area
Shoe inserts (orthotics)
Changes to footwear, such as wearing shoes with wider toe boxes or flat heels
Anti-inflammatory medicines taken by mouth or injected into the area between the toes
Nerve blocking medicines injected into the toe area
Other painkillers
Physical therapy
Anti-inflammatories and painkillers are not recommended for long-term treatment.
In some cases, surgery is needed to remove the thickened tissue and inflamed nerve. This helps relieve pain and improve foot function. Numbness after surgery is permanent.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Nonsurgical treatment does not always improve symptoms. Surgery to remove the thickened tissue is successful in most cases.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Difficulty walking
Trouble with activities that put pressure on the foot, such as pressing the gas pedal while driving
Difficulty wearing certain types of shoes, such as high-heels
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have constant pain or tingling in your foot or toe area.
Prevention
Avoid ill-fitting shoes. Wear shoes with a wide toe box or lower heels.
