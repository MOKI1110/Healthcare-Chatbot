A macrophage is a type of immune cell. It destroys foreign substances to protect the body from infection.
Information
Macrophages do not travel through the blood. Instead, they remain in one part of the body.
Macrophages are found in many organs and tissues, including the:
Brain
Breast tissue
Liver
Lung
Lymph nodes
Placenta
Spleen
Tonsils
Macrophages quickly recognize infectious material (pathogens), and are an important first line of defense for the immune system. Macrophages take in viruses and bacteria, present them to other cells of the immune system (T and B cells) and activate the inflammatory response.
In people with a disease called Langerhans cell histiocytosis (previously called
histiocytosis X
), there is an excess of macrophages and other white blood cells in some bodily tissues.
