A sinus
x-ray
is an imaging test to look at the sinuses. These are the air-filled spaces in the front of the skull.
How the Test is Performed
A sinus x-ray is taken in a hospital radiology department. Or the x-ray may be taken in your health care provider's office. You will be asked to sit in a chair so that any fluid in the sinuses can be seen in the x-ray images. The technologist may place your head in different positions as the images are taken.
How to Prepare for the Test
Tell your provider or x-ray technologist if you are or think you are pregnant. You will be asked to remove all jewelry. You may be asked to change into a gown.
How the Test will Feel
There is little or no discomfort with a sinus x-ray.
Why the Test is Performed
The sinuses are located behind the forehead, nasal bones, cheeks, and eyes. When the sinus openings become blocked or too much mucus builds up, bacteria and other germs can grow. This can lead to an infection and inflammation of the sinuses called
sinusitis
.
A sinus x-ray is ordered when you have any of the following:
Symptoms of sinusitis
Other sinus disorders, such as a deviated septum (crooked or bent septum, the structure that separates the nostrils)
Symptoms of another infection of that area of the head
These days, a sinus x-ray is not often ordered. This is because a
CT scan of the sinuses
shows more detail.
What Abnormal Results Mean
The x-ray may detect an infection, blockages, bleeding or tumors.
Risks
There is low radiation exposure. X-rays are monitored and regulated so that the lowest amount of radiation is used to produce the image.
Pregnant women and children are more sensitive to the risks of x-rays.
Alternative Names
Paranasal sinus radiography; X-ray - sinuses
