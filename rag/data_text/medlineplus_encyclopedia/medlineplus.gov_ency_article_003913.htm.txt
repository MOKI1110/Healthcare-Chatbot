Colposcopy - directed biopsy

A colposcopy is a special way of looking at the cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina. Abnormal changes in the cells on the surface of your cervix is called cervical dysplasia.
Colposcopy uses a light and a low-powered microscope to make the cervix appear much larger. This helps your health care provider find and then
biopsy
abnormal areas in your cervix.
How the Test is Performed
You will lie on a table and place your feet in stirrups, to position your pelvis for exam. The provider will place an instrument (called a speculum) into your
vagina
to see the cervix clearly.
The cervix and vagina are gently cleaned with a vinegar or iodine solution. This removes the mucus that covers the surface and highlights abnormal areas.
The provider will place the colposcope at the opening of your vagina and examine the area. Photographs may be taken. The colposcope does not touch you.
If any areas look abnormal, a small sample of the tissue will be removed using small biopsy tools. Several samples may be taken. Sometimes a tissue sample from inside the cervix is removed. This is called endocervical curettage (ECC).
How to Prepare for the Test
There is no special preparation. You may be more comfortable if you empty your bladder and bowel before the procedure.
Before the exam:
Do not douche (this is never recommended).
Do not place any products into the vagina.
Do not have sex for 24 hours before the exam.
Tell your provider if you are pregnant or could be pregnant.
This test should not be done during a heavy period, unless it is abnormal. Keep your appointment if you are:
At the very end or beginning of your regular period
Having abnormal bleeding
You may be able to take ibuprofen or acetaminophen (Tylenol) before the colposcopy. Ask your provider if this is OK, and when and how much you should take.
How the Test will Feel
You may have some discomfort when the speculum is placed inside your vagina. It may be more uncomfortable than a regular
Pap test
.
Some women feel a slight sting from the cleansing solution.
You may feel a pinch or cramp each time a tissue sample is taken.
You may have some cramping or slight bleeding after the biopsy.
Do not use tampons or put anything in your vagina for several days after a biopsy.
Some women may hold their breath during pelvic procedures because they expect pain. Slow, regular breathing will help you relax and relieve pain. Ask your provider about bringing a support person with you if that will help.
You may have some bleeding after the biopsy, for about 2 days.
You should not douche, place tampons or creams into your vagina, or have sex for up to a week afterward. Ask your provider how long you should wait.
You can use sanitary pads.
Why the Test is Performed
Colposcopy is done to detect cervical cancer and changes that may lead to cervical cancer.
It is most often done when you have had an abnormal Pap smear or HPV test. It may also be recommended if you have bleeding after sexual intercourse.
Colposcopy may also be done when your provider sees abnormal areas on your cervix during a pelvic exam. These may include:
Any abnormal growth on the cervix, or elsewhere in the vagina
Genital warts
or HPV
Irritation or inflammation of the cervix (
cervicitis
)
The colposcopy may be used to keep track of HPV, and to look for abnormal changes that can come back after treatment.
Normal Results
A smooth, pink surface of the cervix is normal.
A specialist called a pathologist will examine the tissue sample from the cervical biopsy and send a report to your provider. Biopsy results most often take 1 to 2 weeks. A normal result means there is no cancer and no abnormal changes were seen.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Your provider should be able to tell you if anything abnormal was seen during the test, including:
Abnormal patterns in the blood vessels
Areas that are swollen, worn away, or wasted away (atrophic)
Cervical polyps
Genital warts
Whitish patches on the cervix
Abnormal biopsy results may be due to changes that can lead to cervical cancer. These changes are called dysplasia, or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN).
CIN I is mild dysplasia
CIN II is moderate dysplasia
CIN III is severe dysplasia or very early cervical cancer called carcinoma in situ
Abnormal biopsy results may be due to:
Cervical cancer
Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
(CIN) -- precancerous tissue changes that are also called cervical dysplasia
Cervical warts (infection with
human papilloma virus
, or HPV)
If the biopsy does not determine the cause of abnormal results, you may need a procedure called a cold knife cone biopsy.
Risks
After the biopsy, you may have some bleeding for up to a week. You may have mild cramping, your vagina may feel sore, and you may have a dark discharge for 1 to 3 days.
A colposcopy and biopsy will not make it more difficult for you to become pregnant, or cause problems during pregnancy.
Contact your provider right away if:
Bleeding is very heavy or lasts for longer than 2 weeks.
You have pain in your belly or in the pelvic area.
You notice any signs of infection (fever, foul odor, or discharge).
