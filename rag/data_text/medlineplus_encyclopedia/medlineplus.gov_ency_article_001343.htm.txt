Congenital cytomegalovirus is a condition that can occur when an infant is infected with a virus called cytomegalovirus (CMV) before birth. Congenital means the condition is present at birth.
Causes
Congenital CMV occurs when an infected mother passes CMV to the fetus through the placenta. The mother may not have symptoms, so she may be unaware that she has CMV.
Symptoms
Most children with congenital CMV do not have symptoms. Those who do have symptoms may have:
Inflammation of the
retina
Yellow skin and whites of the eyes
(jaundice)
Large spleen and liver
Low birth weight
Mineral deposits in the brain
Rash at birth
Seizures
Small head size
Exams and Tests
During the exam, the health care provider may find:
Abnormal breath sounds indicating
pneumonia
Enlarged liver
Enlarged spleen
Delayed physical movements (psychomotor retardation)
Tests include:
Antibody titer
against CMV for both the mother and infant
Bilirubin
level and blood tests for liver function
CBC
CT scan
or
ultrasound
of the head
Fundoscopy
TORCH screen
Urine
culture for CMV virus in the first 2 to 3 weeks of life
X-ray of the chest
Treatment
There is no specific treatment for congenital CMV. Treatments focus on specific problems, such as physical therapy and appropriate education for children with delayed physical movements.
Treatment with antiviral medicines is often used for infants with neurologic (nervous system) symptoms. This treatment may reduce hearing loss later in the child's life.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Most infants who have symptoms of their infection at birth will have neurologic abnormalities later in life. Most infants without symptoms at birth will NOT have these problems.
Some children may die while they are still an infant.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Difficulty with physical activities and movement
Vision problems or blindness
Deafness
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Have your baby checked right away if a provider did not examine your baby shortly after birth, and you suspect your baby has:
A small head
Other symptoms of congenital CMV
If your baby has congenital CMV, it is important to follow your provider's recommendations for well-baby examinations. That way, any growth and development problems can be identified early and treated promptly.
Prevention
CMV is almost everywhere in the environment. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend the following steps to reduce the spread of CMV:
Wash hands with soap and water after touching diapers or saliva.
Avoid kissing children under the age of 6 on the mouth or cheek.
Do not share food, drinks, or eating utensils with young children.
Pregnant women working in a day care center should work with children older than age 2Â½.
