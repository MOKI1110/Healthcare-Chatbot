Hypovolemic shock

Hypovolemic
shock
is an emergency condition in which severe blood or other fluid loss makes the heart unable to pump enough blood to the body. This type of shock can cause many organs to stop working.
Causes
Losing more than 15 to 20 percent of the normal amount of blood in your body causes hypovolemic shock.
Blood loss can be due to:
Bleeding from serious cuts
Bleeding from other injuries
Internal bleeding, such as in the gastrointestinal tract
The amount of circulating blood in your body also may drop when you lose too much body fluid from other causes. This can be due to:
Burns
Diarrhea
Excessive perspiration
Vomiting
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
Anxiety
or agitation
Cool, clammy skin
Confusion
Decreased or no urine output
Generalized
weakness
Pale skin color
(pallor)
Rapid breathing
Sweating
, moist skin
Unconsciousness
(lack of responsiveness)
The greater and more rapid the blood loss, the more severe the symptoms of shock.
Exams and Tests
A physical exam will show signs of shock, including:
Low blood pressure
Low body temperature
Rapid pulse, often weak and thready
Tests that may be done include:
Blood chemistry, including kidney function tests and those tests looking for evidence of heart muscle damage
Complete blood count
(CBC)
CT
scan, ultrasound, or
x-ray
of areas known or suspected to be injured
Echocardiogram
- sound wave test of heart structure and function
Electrocardiogram
Endoscopy
- tube placed in the mouth to the stomach (upper endoscopy) or colonoscopy (tube placed through the anus to the large bowel)
Right heart (Swan-Ganz) catheterization
Urinary catheterization (tube placed into the bladder to measure urine output)
In some cases, other tests may be done as well.
Treatment
Get medical help right away. In the meantime, follow these steps:
Keep the person comfortable and warm (to avoid
hypothermia
).
Have the person lie flat with the feet lifted about 12 inches (30 centimeters) to increase circulation. However, if the person has a head, neck, back, or leg injury, do not change the person's position unless they are in immediate danger.
Do not give fluids by mouth.
If person is having an
allergic reaction
, treat the allergic reaction, if you know how.
If the person must be carried, try to keep them flat, with the head down and feet lifted. Stabilize the head and neck before moving a person with a suspected spinal injury.
The goal of hospital treatment is to replace blood and fluids. One or more
intravenous
(IV) lines will be placed to allow blood, blood products, or fluids to be given.
Medicines such as epinephrine or norepinephrine may be needed to increase blood pressure and the amount of blood pumped out of the heart (cardiac output).
Outlook (Prognosis)
Symptoms and outcomes can vary, depending on:
Amount of blood/fluid volume lost
Rate of blood/fluid loss
Illness or injury causing the loss
Underlying chronic medical conditions, such as diabetes and heart, lung, and kidney disease, or related to injury
In general, people with milder degrees of shock do better than those with more severe shock. Severe hypovolemic shock may lead to death, even with immediate medical attention. Older adults are more likely to have poor outcomes from shock.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Kidney damage
(may require temporary or permanent use of a kidney dialysis machine)
Brain damage
Gangrene of arms or legs, sometimes leading to amputation
Heart attack
Other organ damage
Death
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Hypovolemic shock is a medical emergency. Call the local emergency number (such as 911) or take the person to the emergency room.
Prevention
Preventing shock is easier than trying to treat it once it happens. Quickly treating the cause will reduce the risk of developing severe shock. Early first aid can help control shock.
