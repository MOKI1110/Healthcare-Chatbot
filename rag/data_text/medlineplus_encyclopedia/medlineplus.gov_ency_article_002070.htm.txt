Antibiotics fight infections that are caused by bacteria. They do not treat infections that are caused by a virus.
Colds

The overuse of antibiotics can:
Kill normal ("healthy") bacteria that live in your body. This may cause nausea and diarrhea. Women can get vaginal yeast infections.
Increase the risk of drug-resistant bacterial infections.
Put you at risk of an
allergic reaction
.
Do not take antibiotics when they will not treat an illness.
