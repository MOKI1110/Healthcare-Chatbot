Perianal streptococcal cellulitis is an infection of the area around the anus and rectum. The infection is caused by streptococcus bacteria.
Causes
Perianal streptococcal cellulitis usually occurs in children. It often appears during or after
strep throat
, nasopharyngitis, or streptococcal skin infection (
impetigo
).
The skin around the anus may get infected while a child wipes the area after using the toilet. The infection can also result from scratching the area with fingers that have bacteria from the mouth or nose.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
Fever
Itching, pain, or bleeding with bowel movements
Redness around the anus
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine the child and ask about the symptoms.
Tests that may be done include:
Rectal swab culture
Skin culture from rectal area
Throat culture
Treatment
The infection is treated with antibiotics for about 10 days, depending on how well and quickly they are working. Penicillin is the most often used antibiotic in children.
Topical medicine can be applied to the skin and is commonly used with other antibiotics, but it should not be the only treatment. Mupirocin is a common topical medicine used for this condition.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Children usually recover quickly with antibiotic treatment. It is important to contact your provider if your child does not get better soon on antibiotics.
Possible Complications
Complications are rare, but may include:
Anal scarring,
fistula
, or
abscess
Bleeding, discharge
Bloodstream or other streptococcal infections (including heart, joint, and bone)
Kidney disease (acute
glomerulonephritis
)
Severe skin and soft tissue infection (
necrotizing fasciitis
)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your child's provider if your child complains of pain in the rectal area, painful bowel movements, or other symptoms of perianal streptococcal cellulitis.
If your child is taking antibiotics for this condition and the area of redness gets worse, or the discomfort or fever is increasing, contact your provider immediately.
Prevention
Careful handwashing may help prevent this and other infections caused by bacteria carried in the nose and throat.
To prevent the condition from coming back (relapse), be sure your child finishes all the medicine the provider prescribes.
