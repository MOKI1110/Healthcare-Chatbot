Osteomyelitis

Osteomyelitis is a bone infection. It is caused by bacteria or other germs.
Causes
A bone infection is most often caused by bacteria. But it can also be caused by fungi or other germs. When a person has osteomyelitis:
Bacteria or other germs may spread to a bone from infected skin, muscles, or tendons next to the bone. This may occur under a skin sore.
The infection can start in another part of the body and spread to the bone through the blood.
The infection can also start after bone surgery. This is more likely if the surgery is done after an injury or if metal rods or plates are placed in the bone.
In children, the
long bones
of the arms or legs are most often involved. In adults, the feet, spine bones (vertebrae), and hips (pelvis) are most commonly affected.
Risk factors are:
Diabetes
Hemodialysis
Poor blood supply
Recent injury
Use of injected illicit drugs
Surgery involving bones
Weakened immune system
Symptoms
Symptoms of osteomyelitis are often not specific and vary with age. Main symptoms include:
Bone pain
Excessive sweating
Fever and chills
General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (
malaise
)
Local
swelling
, redness, and warmth
Open wound that may show pus
Pain at the site of infection
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms. The exam may show bone tenderness and possible swelling and redness in the area around the bone.
Tests may include:
Blood culture
Bone biopsy
(the sample is cultured and examined under a microscope)
Bone scan
Bone x-ray
Complete blood count
(CBC) with
differential
C-reactive protein
(CRP)
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR)
MRI
of the bone
Needle
aspiration
of the area of the affected bones
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to get rid of the infection and reduce damage to the bone and surrounding tissues.
Antibiotics are given to destroy the bacteria causing the infection:
You may receive more than one antibiotic at a time.
Antibiotics are taken for at least 4 to 6 weeks, often
at home through an IV
(intravenously, meaning through a vein).
Surgery may be needed to remove dead bone tissue if the above methods fail:
If there are metal plates near the infection, they may need to be removed.
The open space left by the removed bone tissue may be filled with
bone graft
or packing material. This promotes resolution of the infection.
Infection that occurs after joint replacement may require surgery. This is done to remove the replaced joint and infected tissue in the area. A new
prosthesis
may be implanted in the same operation. More often, providers wait until the antibiotic course is finished and the infection has gone away.
If you have
diabetes
, it will need to be well controlled. If there are
problems with blood supply
to the infected area, such as the foot, surgery may be needed to improve blood flow in order to get rid of the infection.
Outlook (Prognosis)
With treatment, the outcome for acute osteomyelitis is often good.
The outlook is worse for those with long-term (
chronic
) osteomyelitis. Symptoms may come and go for years, even with surgery. Amputation may be needed, especially in people with diabetes or poor blood circulation.
The outlook for people with an infection of a prosthesis depends partly on:
The person's health
The type of infection
Whether the infected prosthesis can be safely removed
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you:
Develop symptoms of osteomyelitis
Have osteomyelitis that continues even with treatment
