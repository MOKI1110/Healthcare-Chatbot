A metastatic brain tumor is cancer that started in another part of the body and has spread to the brain.
Causes
Many tumor or cancer types can spread to the brain. The most common are:
Lung cancer
Breast cancer
Melanoma
Kidney cancer
Some types of cancer rarely spread to the brain, such as prostate and colon cancer. In some cases, a tumor can spread to the brain from an unknown location. This is called cancer of unknown primary (CUP).
Growing brain tumors can place pressure on nearby parts of the brain. Brain swelling due to these tumors also causes increased
pressure within the skull
.
Brain tumors that spread are classified based on the location of the tumor in the brain, the type of tissue involved, and the original location of the tumor.
Metastatic brain tumors occur in about one fourth (25%) of all cancers that spread through the body. They are much more common than primary brain tumors (tumors that start in the brain).
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Decreased coordination
, clumsiness, falls
General ill feeling
or
fatigue
Headache
, new or more severe than usual
Memory loss, poor judgment, difficulty solving problems
Numbness, tingling, pain, and other changes in sensation
Personality changes
Rapid emotional changes or strange behaviors
Seizures
that are new
Problems with speech
Vision changes
, double vision, decreased vision
Vomiting, with or without nausea
Weakness of a body area
Specific symptoms vary. Common symptoms of most types of metastatic brain tumors are caused by increased pressure in the brain.
Exams and Tests
An exam can show brain and nervous system changes based on where the tumor is in the brain. Signs of increased pressure in the skull are also common. Some tumors may not show signs until they are very large. Then, they can cause a very quick decline in nervous system function.
The original (primary) tumor may be found by examining tumor tissues from the brain.
Tests may include:
Mammogram
,
CT scans
of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to find the original tumor site
CT scan or
MRI of the brain
to confirm the diagnosis and identify the tumor location (MRI is usually more sensitive for finding tumors in the brain)
Examination of tissue removed from the tumor during surgery orÂ CT scan- or MRI-guided
biopsy
to confirm the type of tumor
Lumbar puncture
(spinal tap)
Treatment
Treatment depends on:
The size and type of the tumor
Location in the body from where it spread
The person's general health
The goals of treatment may be to relieve symptoms, improve functioning, or provide comfort.
Whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is often used to treat tumors that have spread to the brain, especially if there are many tumors, and surgery is not a good option.
Surgery may be used when there is a single tumor. Some tumors may be completely removed. Tumors that are deep or that extend into brain tissue may be reduced in size (debulked).
Surgery may reduce pressure and relieve symptoms in cases when the tumor cannot be removed.
Chemotherapy
for metastatic brain tumors is usually not as helpful as surgery or radiation. Some types of tumors, though, do respond to chemotherapy.
Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)
may also be used. This form of radiation therapy focuses high-power x-rays on a small area of the brain. It is used when there are only a few, small, metastatic tumors.
Medicines for brain tumor symptoms include:
Anticonvulsants such as phenytoin or levetiracetam to reduce or prevent seizures
Corticosteroids such as dexamethasone to reduce brain swelling
Pain medicines
When the cancer has spread, treatment may focus on relieving pain and other symptoms. This is called
palliative
or supportive care.
Comfort measures, safety measures, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and other treatments may improve the patient's quality of life. Some people may want to seek legal advice to help them create an
advance directive
and power of attorney for health care.
Support Groups
You can ease the stress of illness by joining a
cancer support group
. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.
Outlook (Prognosis)
For many people with metastatic brain tumors, the cancer is not curable. Prognosis depends on the type of tumor and how it responds to treatment.
Possible Complications
Health problems that may result include:
Brain herniation (fatal)
Loss of ability to function or care for self
Loss of ability to interact
Permanent, severe loss of nervous system function that gets worse over time
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you develop a persistent headache that is new or different for you.
Call your provider or go to the emergency room if you or someone you know suddenly becomes sluggish or has vision changes, or speech impairment, or has seizures that are new or different.
