Keratosis obturans (KO) is the buildup of keratin in the ear canal. Keratin is a protein released by skin cells that form the hair, nails, and protective barrier on the skin.
Causes
The exact cause of KO is unknown. It may be due to a problem with how skin cells in the ear canal are produced. Or, it may be caused by overstimulation of the wax glands by the nervous system.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
Mild to severe pain
Reduced hearing ability
Inflammation of ear canal
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine your ear canal. You will also be asked about your symptoms.
A
CT scan
or
x-ray
of the head may be done to help diagnose the problem.
Treatment
KO is usually treated by removing the buildup of material. Medicine is then applied to the ear canal.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Regular follow-ups and cleaning by your provider are important to avoid infections. In some people, lifetime cleaning may be needed.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you feel pain in the ear or difficulty in hearing.
