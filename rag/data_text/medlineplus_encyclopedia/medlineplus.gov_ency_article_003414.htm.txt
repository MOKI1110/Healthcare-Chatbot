A buccal (pronounced "buckle") smear is the painless removal of a sample of cells from the inside of your mouth (cheek) for study.
How the Test is Performed
Your health care provider will gently scrape the inside of the cheek with a small spatula to collect cells for testing. Sometimes, you can do this yourself.
How to Prepare for the Test
Follow the collection instructions as directed by your provider.
How the Test will Feel
You will feel a scraping sensation as cells are removed from the cheek.
Why the Test is Performed
This test is done to get cells for
chromosome
or DNA analysis, most often for genetic testing.
This test may also help establish sexual identity. When the test is used in this way, it's called the sex chromatin test.
Risks
There are no risks with this test.
Alternative Names
Sex chromatin test; Buccal swab
