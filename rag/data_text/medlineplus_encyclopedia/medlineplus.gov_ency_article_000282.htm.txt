Primary biliary cholangitis

The bile ducts are tubes that move
bile
from the liver to the small intestine. Bile is a substance that helps with digestion. All of the bile ducts together are called the biliary tract.
When the bile ducts become swollen or inflamed, this blocks the flow of bile. These changes can lead to scarring of the liver called cirrhosis. This is called biliary cirrhosis. Advanced cirrhosis can lead to liver failure.
Causes
The cause of inflamed bile ducts in the liver is not known. However, primary biliary cholangitis is an autoimmune disorder. That means your body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. The disease may be linked to
autoimmune disorders
such as:
Celiac disease
Raynaud phenomenon
Sicca syndrome (dry eyes or mouth)
Thyroid disease
The disease most often affects middle-aged women.
Symptoms
More than one half of people have no symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Symptoms most oftenÂ begin slowly. Early symptoms may include:
Nausea and belly pain
Fatigue and loss of energy
Fatty deposits under the skin
Fatty stools
Itching (pruritus)
Poor appetite and weight loss
As liver function worsens, symptoms may include:
Fluid buildup in the legs (edema) and in the abdomen (ascites)
Yellow color in the skin, mucous membranes, or eyes (jaundice)
Redness on the palms of the hands
In men, impotence, shrinking of the testicles, and breast swelling
Easy bruising and abnormal bleeding, most often from swollen veins in the digestive tract
Confusion or problems thinking
Pale or clay-colored stools
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will do a physical exam.
The following tests can check to see if your liver is working properly:
Albumin blood test
Liver function tests
(serum alkaline phosphatase is most important)
Prothrombin time
(PT)
Cholesterol and lipoprotein blood tests
Other tests that can help measure how severe liver disease may be include:
Elevated immunoglobulin M level in the blood
Liver biopsy
Anti-mitochondrial antibodies
(results are positive in about 95% of cases)
Other antibody levels (especially if the anti-mitochondrial antibodies are negative)
Special types of ultrasound or MRI that measure the amount of scar tissue (may be called elastography)
Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to ease symptoms and prevent complications.
Cholestyramine (or colestipol) may reduce the itching. Ursodeoxycholic acid may improve removal of bile from the bloodstream. This may improve survival in some people. A newer drug called obeticholic acid (Ocaliva) is also available.
Vitamin replacement therapy restores vitamins A, K, E and D, which are lost in the fatty stools that may occur in people with primary biliary cholangitis. A calcium supplement or other bone medicines may be added to prevent or treat
weak or soft bones
.
Long-term
monitoring and treatment of liver failure
is needed.
Liver transplant
may be successful if it is done before liver failure occurs.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome can vary. If the condition is not treated, most people will die without a liver transplant. About one quarter of people who have had the disease for 10 years will have liver failure. Doctors can now use a statistical model to predict the best time to do the transplant. Other diseases, such as hypothyroidism and anemia, can also develop. DEXA scans for bone health are checked regularly.
Possible Complications
Progressive cirrhosis can lead to liver failure. Complications can include:
Bleeding
Damage to the brain (
encephalopathy
)
Fluid and
electrolyte
imbalance
Kidney failure
Malabsorption
Malnutrition
Soft or weak bones (osteomalacia or osteoporosis)
Ascites (fluid buildup in the abdominal cavity)
Increased risk of liver cancer
