Ribcage pain
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Ribcage pain includes any pain or discomfort in the area of the ribs.
Considerations
With a
broken rib
, the pain is worse when bending and twisting the body. This movement does not cause the pain in someone who has
pleurisy
(swelling of the lining of the lungs) or muscle spasms.
Causes
Ribcage pain may be caused by any of the following:
Bruised, cracked, or fractured rib
Inflammation of cartilage near the breastbone (
costochondritis
)
Muscle strain
Osteoporosis
Pleurisy (the pain is worse when breathing deeply)
Home Care
Rest and not moving the area (immobilization) are the best cures for a muscle strain or broken rib.
Follow your health care provider's instructions for treating the cause of ribcage pain.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider for an appointment if you do not know the cause of the pain, or if it does not go away.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will perform a physical examination. You'll likely be asked about your symptoms, such as when the pain started, its location, the kind of pain you're having, and what makes it worse.
Tests that may be ordered include:
Bone scan
(if there is a known history of
cancer
or it is highly suspected)
Chest x-ray
Your provider may prescribe treatment for your ribcage pain. Treatment depends on the cause.
