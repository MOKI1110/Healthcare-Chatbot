Vomiting blood
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Vomiting blood is regurgitating (throwing up) contents of the stomach that contains blood.
Vomited blood may appear bright red, dark red, or look like coffee grounds. The vomited material may be mixed with food or it may be blood only.
Considerations
It may be hard to tell the difference between vomiting blood and
coughing up blood
(from the lung) or a
nosebleed
.
Conditions that cause vomiting blood can also cause
blood to appear in the stool
.
Causes
The upper GI (gastrointestinal) tract includes the mouth, throat, esophagus (swallowing tube), stomach and the duodenum (first part of the small intestine). Blood that is vomited may come from any of these places.
Vomiting that is very forceful or continues for a very long time may cause a tear in the small blood vessels of the throat. This may produce streaks of blood in the vomit.
Swollen veins in the walls of the lower part of the esophagus, and sometimes the stomach, may begin to bleed. These veins (called varices) may be present in people with severe liver damage.
Repeated vomiting and retching may cause bleeding and damage to the lower esophagus called
Mallory Weiss tears
.
Other causes may include:
Bleeding ulcer in the stomach, first part of the small intestine, or esophagus
Blood clotting disorders
Defects in the blood vessels of the GI tract
Swelling, irritation, or inflammation of the esophagus lining (
esophagitis
) or the stomach lining (
gastritis
)
Swallowing blood (for example, after a nosebleed)
Tumors of the mouth, throat, stomach or esophagus
Home Care
Get medical attention right away. Vomiting blood can indicate a serious medical problem.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider or go to the emergency room if vomiting of blood occurs. You will need to be examined right away.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
The provider will examine you and ask questions such as:
When did the vomiting begin?
Have you ever vomited blood before?
How much blood was in the vomit?
What color was the blood? (Bright or dark red or like coffee grounds?)
Have you had any recent nosebleeds, surgeries, dental work, vomiting, stomach problems, or severe coughing?
What other symptoms do you have?
What medical conditions do you have?
What medicines do you take?
Do you drink alcohol, smoke, or use tobacco?
Tests that may be done include:
Blood tests, such as a
complete blood count
Â (CBC), blood chemistries, blood clotting tests, and
liver function tests
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
(EGD) (placing a lit tube with a camera through the mouth into the esophagus, stomach and duodenum)
Rectal examination
Tube through the nose into the stomach and then applying suction to check for blood in the stomach
X-rays
If you have vomited a lot of blood, you may need emergency treatment. This may include:
Administration of oxygen
Blood transfusions
EGD with application of laser or other treatments to stop the bleeding
Fluids through a vein
Medicines to decrease stomach acid
Possible surgery if bleeding does not stop
Alternative Names
Hematemesis; Blood in the vomit
