Mouth
ulcers
are sores or open lesions in the mouth.
Causes
Mouth ulcers are caused by many disorders. These include:
Canker sores
Gingivostomatitis
Herpes simplex (
fever blister
)
Leukoplakia
Oral cancer
Oral lichen planus
Oral
thrush
A sore caused by histoplasmosis may also appear as a mouth ulcer.
Symptoms
Symptoms will vary, based on the cause of the mouth ulcer. Symptoms may include:
Open sores in the mouth
Pain or discomfort in the mouth
Exams and Tests
Most of the time, your health care provider or dentist will look at the ulcer and where it is in the mouth to make the diagnosis. You may need blood tests or a biopsy of the ulcer may be needed to confirm the cause.
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms. This can be done by:
Treating the underlying cause of the ulcer if it is known.
Gently cleaning your mouth and teeth.
Rubbing medicines directly on the ulcer, such as antihistamines, antacids, and corticosteroids that may soothe discomfort.
Avoiding hot or spicy foods until the ulcer is healed.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome varies depending on the cause of the ulcer. Many mouth ulcers are harmless and heal without treatment.
Some types of
cancer
may first appear as a mouth ulcer that does not heal.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Cellulitis
of the mouth, from secondary bacterial infection of ulcers
Dental infections (
tooth abscesses
)
Oral cancer
Spread of contagious disorders to other people
