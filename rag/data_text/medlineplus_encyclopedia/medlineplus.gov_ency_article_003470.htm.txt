To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is a protein found in all body tissues. Tissues with higher amounts of ALP include the liver,
bile
ducts, and bone.
A blood test can be done to measure the level of ALP.
A related test is the
ALP isoenzyme test
.
How the Test is Performed
A blood sample is needed. Most of the time, blood is
drawn from a vein
located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.
How to Prepare for the Test
Many medicines can interfere with blood test results.
Your health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test.
DO NOT stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.
How the Test will Feel
You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.
Why the Test is Performed
This test may be done:
To diagnose liver or bone disease
To check if treatments for those diseases are working
To check for side effects from medicines
Normal Results
The normal range is 44 to 147 international units per liter (IU/L) or 0.73 to 2.45 microkatal per liter (Âµkat/L).
Normal values may vary slightly from laboratory to laboratory. They also can vary with age and sex. High levels of ALP are normally seen in children undergoing growth spurts and in pregnant women.
The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.
