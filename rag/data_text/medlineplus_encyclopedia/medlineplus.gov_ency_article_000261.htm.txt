Pyogenic liver
abscess
is a pus-filled pocket of fluid within the liver. Pyogenic means with pus.
Causes
There are many possible causes of pyogenic liver abscesses, including:
Abdominal infection, such as
appendicitis
,
diverticulitis
, or a
perforated bowel
Infection in the blood
Infection of the tubes draining bile (bile ducts)
Recent
endoscopy
of the bile draining tubes
Trauma that damages the liver
A number of common bacteria may cause liver abscesses. In most cases, more than one type of bacteria are found.
Symptoms
Symptoms of liver abscess may include:
Pain in the right upper abdomen (more common) or throughout the abdomen (less common)
Clay-colored stools
Dark urine
Fever, chills, night sweats
Loss of appetite
Nausea, vomiting
Unintentional weight loss
Weakness
Yellow skin (
jaundice
)
Right shoulder pain (referred pain)
Chest pain (lower right)
Exams and Tests
Tests may include:
Abdominal CT scan
Abdominal ultrasound
Blood culture
for bacteria
Complete blood count (CBC)
Liver biopsy
Aspiration of abscess
Liver function tests
Treatment
Treatment usually consists of placing a tube through the skin into the liver to drain the abscess. Less often, surgery is needed. You will also receive antibiotics for about 4 to 6 weeks. Sometimes, antibiotics alone can cure the infection.
Outlook (Prognosis)
This condition can be life threatening. The risk for death is higher in people who have many liver abscesses.
Possible Complications
Life-threatening
sepsis
can develop. Sepsis is an illness in which the body has a severe inflammatory response to bacteria or other germs.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
