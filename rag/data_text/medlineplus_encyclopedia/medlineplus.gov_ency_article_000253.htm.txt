Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is a condition in which there are symptoms of blockage of the intestine (bowels) without any physical blockage.
Causes
In intestinal pseudo-obstruction, the intestine does not contract and push food, stool, and air through the digestive tract. The chronic disorder most often affects the small intestine, but can also occur in the large intestine (colon). The acute disorder usually affects the large intestine.
The condition may start suddenly or be a chronic or long-term problem. Sudden onset is called acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction and usually affects the small intestine and often other parts of the digestive tract. Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction usually affects the large intestine (colon.) It is most common in children and older people. The cause of the problem is often unknown. However, problems with the bowel's muscles or nerves may be a cause.
Risk factors include:
Cerebral palsy
or other brain or nervous system disorders.
Chronic kidney, lung, or heart disease.
Staying in bed for long periods of time (bedridden).
Taking medicines that slow intestinal movements. These include narcotic (pain) medicines and medicines used when you are not able to keep urine from leaking out.
After surgery
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Abdominal pain
Bloating
Constipation
Nausea
and vomiting
Swollen abdomen (
abdominal distention
)
Weight loss
Exams and Tests
During a physical exam, the health care provider will most often see abdominal bloating.
Tests include:
Abdominal x-ray
Anorectal manometry
Barium swallow
, barium small bowel follow-through, or
barium enema
Blood tests for nutritional or vitamin deficiencies
Colonoscopy
CT scan
Â of the abdomen
MRI of the abdomen
Antroduodenal manometry
Gastric emptying radionuclide scan
Intestinal radionuclide scan
Treatment
The following treatments may be tried:
Moving around (walking, changing position in bed)
Colonoscopy
may be used to remove air from the large intestine.
Fluids can be given through a vein to replace fluids lost from vomiting or diarrhea.
Nasogastric suction involving a nasogastric (NG) tube placed through the nose into the stomach or small intestine, or a tube through the rectum into the large intestine can be used to remove air from the bowel.
Neostigmine may be used to treat intestinal pseudo-obstruction that is only in the large bowel (Ogilvie syndrome).
Other medicines may be tried
Special diets often do not work. However, vitamin B12 and other vitamin supplements should be used for people with vitamin deficiency.
Correcting blood disturbances such as low potassium and others
Rarely a tube to vent the intestine is placed in the first part of the large intestine (cecum)
Stopping the medicines that may have caused the problem (such as narcotic drugs) may help.
In severe cases, surgery may be needed.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Most cases of acute pseudo-obstruction get better in a few days with treatment. In chronic forms of the disease, symptoms can come back and get worse over many years.
If the intestine dilates severely, a hole in the bowel (perforation) may occur and surgical removal of the involved bowel may be needed. This may result in an ostomy (attaching the bowel to the abdomen and stool passes into a bag. If malnutrition happens, you may need to be fed through a tube or the vein. Other parts of the GI tract may also have problems from poor contraction.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Diarrhea
Rupture (perforation) of the intestine
Vitamin deficiencies
Weight loss
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have abdominal pain that does not go away or other symptoms of this disorder.
