Tendinitis

Tendons are the fibrous structures that join muscles to bones. When these tendons become swollen or inflamed, it is called tendinitis. In many cases, tendinosis (tendon degeneration) is also present.
Causes
Tendinitis can occur as a result of injury orÂ overuse. Playing sports is a common cause. Tendinitis also can occur with aging as the tendon loses elasticity. Body-wide (systemic) diseases, such as
rheumatoid arthritis
or
diabetes
, can also lead to tendinitis.
Tendinitis can occur in any tendon. Commonly affected sites include the:
Elbow
Heel (
Achilles tendinitis
)
Knee
Shoulder
Thumb
Wrist
Symptoms
Symptoms of tendinitis may vary with activity or cause. Main symptoms may include:
Pain and tenderness along a tendon, usually near a joint
Pain at night
Pain that is worse with movement or activity
Stiffness in the morning
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. During the exam, your provider will look for signs of pain and tenderness when the muscle attached to the tendon is moved in certain ways. There are specific tests for specific tendons.
The tendon can be inflamed, and the skin over it may be warm and red.
Other tests that may be done include:
Ultrasound
X-ray
MRI
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to relieve pain and reduce inflammation.
Your provider will recommend resting the affected tendon to help it recover. This may be done using a splint or a removable brace. Applying heat or cold to the affected area can help.
Over-the-counter pain relievers
such as NSAIDs like aspirin or ibuprofen, can also reduce both pain and inflammation. Steroid injections into the tendon sheath can also be very useful for controlling pain.
Your provider may also suggest physical therapy to stretch and strengthen the muscle and tendon. This can restore the tendon's ability to function properly, improve healing, and prevent future injury.
In rare cases, surgery is needed to remove the inflamed tissue from around the tendon.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Symptoms improve with treatment and rest. If the injury is caused by overuse, a change in work habits may be needed to prevent the problem from coming back.
Possible Complications
Complications of tendinitis may include:
Long-term inflammation raises the risk for further injury, such as rupture
Return of tendinitis symptoms
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if symptoms of tendinitis occur.
Prevention
Tendinitis can be prevented by:
Avoiding repetitive motions and overuse of the arms and legs.
Keeping all your muscles strong and flexible.
Doing warm up exercises at a relaxed pace before vigorous activity.
