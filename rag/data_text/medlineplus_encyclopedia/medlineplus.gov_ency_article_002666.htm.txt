Person's age, weight, and condition

Time it was swallowed
Amount swallowed
Poison Control
Your local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.Â This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the container to the hospital with you, if possible.
The provider will measure and monitor the person's
vital signs
, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.
Tests that may be done include:
Chest x-ray
Electrocardiogram
(ECG)
Endoscopy
-- camera down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and stomach
Treatment may include:
Fluids through a vein (by IV)
Medicines to treat symptoms
Activated charcoal
Laxative
Breathing support, including a tube through the mouth into the lungs and connected to a breathing machine (
ventilator
)
Kidney dialysis (kidney machine), in serious cases
The person may be admitted to the hospital.
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well someone does depends on the amount of mouthwash that was swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.
Drinking large amounts of mouthwash may cause symptoms similar to drinking large amounts of alcohol (drunkenness). Swallowing large amounts of methyl salicylate and hydrogen peroxide may also cause serious stomach and intestine symptoms. It can also lead to changes in the body's acid-base balance.
