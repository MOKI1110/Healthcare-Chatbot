Fibrin degradation products (FDPs) are the substances left behind when clots dissolve in the blood. A blood test can be done to measure these products.
How the Test is Performed
A
blood sample
is needed.
How to Prepare for the Test
Certain medicines can change blood test results.
Tell your health care provider about all the medicines you take.
Your provider will tell you if you need to temporarily stop taking any medicines before you have this test. This includes blood thinners such as aspirin, heparin, and urokinase, which make it hard for the blood to clot.
Do not stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.
How the Test will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.
Why the Test is Performed
This test is done to see if your clot-dissolving (fibrinolytic) system is working properly. Your provider may order this test if you have signs of
disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
or another clot-dissolving disorder.
Normal Results
The result is normally less than 10 mcg/mL (10 mg/L).
Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Increased FDPs may be a sign of primary or secondary fibrinolysis (clot-dissolving activity) due to a variety of causes, including:
Blood clotting problems
Burns
Problem with the heart's structure and function that is present at birth (
congenital heart disease
)
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
Low level of oxygen in the blood
Infections
Leukemia
Liver disease
Problem during pregnancy such as
preeclampsia
,
placenta abruption
, miscarriage
Recent blood transfusion
Recent surgery that involved a heart and lung bypass pump, or surgery to lower high blood pressure in the liver
Kidney disease
Transplanted organ rejection
Large blood clots inside the body
Risks
There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:
Excessive bleeding
Fainting or feeling lightheaded
Multiple punctures to locate veins
Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
Alternative Names
FDPs; FSPs; Fibrin split products; Fibrin breakdown products
