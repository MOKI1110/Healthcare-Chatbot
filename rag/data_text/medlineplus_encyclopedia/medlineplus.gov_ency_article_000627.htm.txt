Cysticercosis is an infection by a parasite called
Taenia solium
(
T solium
). It is a pork tapeworm that creates
cysts
in different areas of the body.
Causes
Cysticercosis is caused by swallowing eggs from
T solium
. The eggs are found in contaminated food. Autoinfection is when a person who is already infected with adult
T solium
swallows its eggs. This occurs due to
improper hand washing
after a bowel movement (fecal-oral transmission).
Risk factors include eating pork, fruits, and vegetables contaminated with
T solium
as a result of undercooking or
improper food preparation
. The disease can also be spread by contact with infected feces.
The disease is rare in the United States. It is common in many developing countries.
Symptoms
Most often, the worms stay in muscles and do not cause symptoms.
Symptoms occur depending on where the infection is found in the body:
Brain --
seizures
or symptoms similar to those of a
brain tumor
Eyes -- decreased vision or blindness
Heart --
abnormal heart rhythms
or
heart failure
(rare)
Spine -- weakness or changes in walking due to damage to nerves in the spine
Exams and Tests
Tests that may be done include:
Blood tests to detect
antibodies
to the parasite
Biopsy
of the affected area
CT
scan,
MRI
scan, or
x-rays
to detect the lesion
Spinal tap (lumbar puncture)
Test in which an ophthalmologist looks inside the eye
Treatment
Treatment may involve:
Medicines to kill the parasites, such as albendazole or praziquantel
Powerful anti-inflammatories (steroids) to reduce swelling
If the cyst is in the eye or brain, steroids should be started a few days before other medicines to avoid problems caused by swelling during antiparasitic treatment. Not all people benefit from antiparasitic treatment.
Sometimes, surgery may be needed to remove the infected area.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outlook is good, unless the lesion has caused blindness, heart failure, or brain damage. These are rare complications.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Blindness, decreased vision
Heart failure or abnormal heart rhythm
Hydrocephalus
(fluid buildup in part of the brain, often with increased pressure)
Seizures
When to Contact a Medical Professional
If you have any symptoms of cysticercosis, contact your health care provider.
Prevention
Avoid unwashed foods, do not eat uncooked foods while traveling, and always wash fruits and vegetables well.
