Tarsal tunnel syndrome

Tarsal tunnel syndrome is a condition in which the tibial nerve is being compressed. This is the nerve in the ankle that allows feeling and movement to parts of the foot. Tarsal tunnel syndrome can lead to pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, or muscle damage mainly in the bottom of the foot.
Causes
Tarsal tunnel syndrome is an unusual form of
peripheral neuropathy
. It occurs when there is damage to the tibial nerve.
The area in the foot where the nerve enters the back of the inner side of the ankle is called the tarsal tunnel. This tunnel is normally narrow. When the tibial nerve is compressed, it results in the symptoms of tarsal tunnel syndrome.
Pressure on the tibial nerve may be due to any of the following:
Swelling from an injury, such as a dislocated, sprained, or broken ankle
An abnormal growth, such as a bone spur, lump in the joint (ganglion cyst), swollen (varicose) vein
Flat feet
or a high arch
Damage to the tibial nerve may result from body-wide (systemic) diseases, such as diabetes, low thyroid function (hypothyroidism), arthritis, or hereditary nerve problems. In some cases, no cause can be found.
Other risk factors for tarsal tunnel syndrome include participation in hockey, hiking, running, ballet dancing, and other sports that involve sprinting and jumping.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Sensation changes in the bottom of the foot and toes, including burning sensation,
numbness
, tingling, or other abnormal sensation
Pain at the ankle and in the bottom of the foot and toes
Weakness and atrophy of foot muscles that move toes
In severe cases, the foot muscles are very weak, and the foot can be deformed.
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine your ankle and foot and ask about your symptoms.
During the exam, your provider may find you have the following signs:
Inability to curl the toes
Loss of sensation on the bottom of the foot
Tests that may be done include:
Electromyography
(EMG), a recording of electrical activity in muscles
Nerve conduction tests
(recording of electrical activity along the nerve)
Other tests may include imaging tests, such as x-ray,
ultrasound
, or
MRI
.
Blood tests may be done to look for medical conditions that lead to nerve damage.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the cause of the symptoms.
Your provider will likely suggest first resting, putting ice on the ankle, and avoiding activities that cause symptoms.
Over-the-counter pain medicine, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), may help relieve pain and swelling.
If symptoms are caused by a foot problem such as flat feet, custom orthotics or a brace may be prescribed.
Physical therapy may help strengthen the foot muscles and improve flexibility.
Steroid injection into the tarsal tunnel area at the ankle may be tried.
Surgery to enlarge the tarsal tunnel or transfer the nerve may help reduce pressure on the tibial nerve.
Outlook (Prognosis)
A full recovery is possible if the cause of tarsal tunnel syndrome is found and successfully treated. Some people may have a partial or complete
loss of movement
or sensation.
Nerve pain
may be uncomfortable and last for a long time.
Possible Complications
Untreated, tarsal tunnel syndrome may lead to the following:
Deformity of the foot (mild to severe)
Movement loss in the toes (partial or complete)
Repeated or unnoticed injury to the leg
Sensation loss in the toes or foot (partial or complete)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of tarsal tunnel syndrome. Early diagnosis and treatment increases the chance that symptoms can be controlled.
