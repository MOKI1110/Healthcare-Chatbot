Acrodysostosis

Acrodysostosis is an extremely rare disorder that is present at birth (congenital). It leads to problemsÂ with the bones of the hands, feet, and nose, and intellectual disability.
Causes
Most people with acrodysostosis have no family history of the disease. However, sometimes the condition is passed down from parent to child. Parents with the condition have a 1 in 2 chance of passing it to their children.
There is a slightly greater risk for children with fathers who are 45 and older at the time of conception.
Symptoms
Symptoms of this disorder include:
Frequent middle
ear infections
Growth problems, short arms and legs
Hearing problems
Intellectual disability
The body doesn't respond to certain hormones, even though hormone levels are normal
Distinct facial features
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider can usually diagnose this condition with a physical exam. This may show any of the following:
Advanced bone age
Bone deformities in hands and feet
Delays in growth
Problems with the skin, genitals, teeth, and skeleton
Short arms and legs with small hands and feet
Short head, measured front to back
Short height
Small, upturned broad nose with flat bridge
Distinct features of the face (short nose, open mouth, jaw that sticks out)
Unusual head
Wide-spaced eyes, sometimes with extra skin fold at corner of eye
In the first months of life, x-rays may show spotty calcium deposits, called stippling, in bones (especially the nose). Infants may also have:
Abnormally short fingers and toes
Early growth of bones in the hands and feet
Short bones
Shortening of the forearm bones near the wrist
Two genes have been linked with this condition, and genetic testing may be done.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the symptoms.
Hormones, such as growth hormone, may be given. Surgery to treat bone problems may be done.

Outlook (Prognosis)
Problems depend on the degree of skeletal involvement and intellectual disability. In general, people do well.
Possible Complications
Acrodysostosis may lead to:
Learning disability
Arthritis
Carpal tunnel syndrome
Worsening range of movement in the spine, elbows, and hands
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your child's provider if signs of acrodystosis develop. Make sure your child's height and weight are measured during each
well-child visit
. Your child's provider may refer you to:
A genetic professional for a full evaluation and chromosome studies
A pediatric endocrinologist for management of your child's growth problems
