Thyroid storm

Thyroid storm is a rare life-threatening condition of the thyroid gland. It develops in cases of untreated
hyperthyroidism
, or overactive thyroid (thyrotoxicosis).
The thyroid gland is located in the neck, just above where your collarbones meet in the middle.
Causes
Thyroid storm occurs in people with uncontrolled hyperthyroidism due to a major stress such as:
Trauma
Heart attack
Infection
Rarely, thyroid storm can be caused by radioactive iodine therapy for
Graves disease
. This can occur even a week or more after treatment.
Symptoms
Symptoms are severe and may include any of the following:
Agitation
Change in alertness (consciousness)
Confusion
Diarrhea
Increased temperature
Pounding heart (
tachycardia
)
Restlessness
Shaking
Sweating
Bulging eyeballs
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider may suspect thyrotoxic storm based on:
A high systolic (top number) blood pressure reading with a lower diastolic (bottom number) blood pressure reading (wide pulse pressure)
A very high heart rate
A history of hyperthyroidism
An exam of your neck may find that your thyroid gland is enlarged (
goiter
)
Blood tests are done to check the levels of the thyroid hormones
TSH
,
free T4
and
T3
.
Other blood tests are done to check heart and kidney functions and to check for infection. Liver function tests provide added diagnosis and treatment information.
Treatment
Thyroid storm is a medical emergency. It is life threatening. Often, the person needs to be admitted to the intensive care unit. Treatment may include:
Oxygen therapy for breathing problems
Fluids for dehydration
Cooling blankets to return the body temperature to normal
Monitoring any excess fluid in older people with heart or kidney disease
Medicines to manage agitation
Medicine to slow the heart rate
Vitamins and glucose
The goal of treatment is to decrease thyroid hormone levels in the blood. Sometimes, high doses of iodine is given to try and stun the thyroid. Other medicines known as thionamides may be given to lower the hormone level in the blood. Beta blocker medicines are often given by vein (IV) to slow the heart rate, lower blood pressure, and block the effects of the thyroid hormone excess. In some severe cases, glucocorticoids (steroids) are given.
Antibiotics are given in case of infection.
Possible Complications
Irregular heart rhythms (
arrhythmias
) may occur.
Heart failure
and fluid in the lungs (
pulmonary edema
) can develop rapidly and cause death.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
This is an emergency condition. Call 911 or the local emergency number if you have hyperthyroidism and experience symptoms of thyroid storm.
Prevention
To prevent thyroid storm, hyperthyroidism should be treated.
