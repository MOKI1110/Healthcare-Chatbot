Type V glycogen storage disease

Type V (five) glycogen storage disease (GSD V) is a rare inherited condition in which the body is not able to break down glycogen. Glycogen is an important source of energy that is stored in all tissues, especially in the muscles and liver.
GSD V is also called McArdle disease.
Causes
GSD V is caused by a flaw in the gene that makes an
enzyme
called muscle glycogen phosphorylase. As a result, the body cannot break down glycogen in the muscles.
GSD V is an
autosomal recessive
genetic disorder. This means to have the disorder, you must receive a copy of the nonworking gene from both parents. A person who receives a nonworking gene from only one parent usually does not develop this syndrome. A family history of GSD V increases the risk.
Symptoms
Symptoms commonly start during early childhood. But, it may be difficult to separate these symptoms from those of normal childhood. Diagnosis may not occur until a person is over 20 or 30 years old.
Burgundy-colored urine (myoglobinuria)
Fatigue
Exercise intolerance, poor stamina
Muscle cramps
Muscle pain
Muscle stiffness
Muscle weakness
Exams and Tests
The following tests may be performed:
Electromyography (EMG)
Genetic testing
Lactic acid in blood
MRI
Muscle biopsy
Myoglobin in urine
Plasma ammonia
Serum creatine kinase
Treatment
There is no specific treatment.
The health care provider may suggest the following to stay active and healthy and prevent symptoms:
Be aware of your physical limitations.
Before exercising, warm up gently.
Avoid exercising too hard or too long.
Eat enough protein.
Ask your provider if it's a good idea to eat some sugar before exercising. This may help prevent muscle symptoms.
If you need to have surgery, ask your provider if it's OK for you to have general anesthesia.
Support Groups

Outlook (Prognosis)
People with GSD V can live a normal life by managing their diet and physical activity.
Possible Complications
Exercise may produce muscle pain, or even a breakdown of skeletal muscle (
rhabdomyolysis
). This condition is associated with burgundy-colored urine and a risk for
kidney failure
if it is severe.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have repeated episodes of sore or cramped muscles after exercise, especially if you also have burgundy or pink urine.
Consider genetic counseling if you have a family history of GSD V.
