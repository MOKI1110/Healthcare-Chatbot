The phosphorus blood test measures the amount of phosphate in the blood.
How the Test is Performed
A
blood sample
is needed.
How to Prepare for the Test
Your health care provider may tell you to temporarily stop taking medicines that may affect the test. These medicines include water pills (diuretics), antacids, and laxatives.
Do not stop taking any medicine without talking to your provider.
How the Test will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.
Why the Test is Performed
Phosphorus is a mineral the body needs to build strong bones and teeth. It is also important for nerve signaling and muscle contraction.
This test is ordered to see how much phosphorus is in your blood. Kidney, liver, and certain bone diseases can cause abnormal phosphorus levels.
Normal Results
Normal values range from:
Adults: 2.8 to 4.5 mg/dL
Children: 4.0 to 7.0 mg/dL
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
A higher than normal level (hyperphosphatemia) may be due to many different health conditions. Common causes include:
Diabetic ketoacidosis
(life-threatening condition that occurs mainly in people with type 1 diabetes)
Hypoparathyroidism
(parathyroid glands do not make enough of their hormone)
Kidney damage or failure
Liver disease
Too much vitamin D
Too much phosphate in your diet
Use of certain medicines such as laxatives that have phosphate in them
A lower than normal level (hypophosphatemia) may be due to:
Alcoholism
Hypercalcemia (too much calcium in the blood)
Primary hyperparathyroidism
(parathyroid glands make too much of their hormone)
Too little dietary intake of phosphate
Very poor nutrition
Too little vitamin D, resulting in bone problems such as
rickets
(childhood) or
osteomalacia
(adult)
Risks
There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:
Fainting or feeling lightheaded
Multiple punctures to locate veins
Hematoma (blood buildup under the skin)
Excessive bleeding
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
Alternative Names
