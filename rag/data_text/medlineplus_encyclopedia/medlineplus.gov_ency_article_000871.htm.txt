Pityriasis rosea is a common type of skin rash most often seen in young adults.
Causes
Pityriasis rosea is believed to be caused by a virus. It occurs most often in the fall and spring.
Although pityriasis rosea may occur in more than one person in a household at a time, it is not thought to spread from one person to another. Females seem to be more affected than males.
Symptoms
An episode most often lasts 4 to 8 weeks. Symptoms may disappear by 3 weeks or last as long as 12 weeks.
The rash starts with a single large
patch
called a herald patch. After several days, more skin rashes will appear on the chest, back, arms, and legs.
The skin rashes:
Are often pink or pale red
Are oval in shape
May be scaly
May follow lines in the skin or appear in a Christmas tree pattern
May itch
Other symptoms may include:
Headache
Fatigue
Sore throat
Mild fever
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider can often diagnose pityriasis rosea by the way the rash looks.
In rare cases, the following tests are needed:
A blood test to be sure it is not a form of
syphilis
, which can cause a similar rash
A
skin biopsy
to confirm the diagnosis
Treatment
If symptoms are mild, you may not need treatment.
Your provider may suggest gentle bathing, mild lubricants or cream, or mild hydrocortisone creams to soothe your skin.
Antihistamines taken by mouth may be used to reduce itching. You can buy antihistamines at the store without a prescription.
Moderate sun exposure or ultraviolet (UV) light treatment may help make the rash go away more quickly. However, you must be careful to avoid sunburn.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Pityriasis rosea often goes away within 4 to 8 weeks. It usually doesn't come back.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider for an appointment if you have symptoms of pityriasis rosea.
