A platelet count is a lab test to measure how many platelets you have in your blood. Platelets are particles in the blood that help the blood clot. They are smaller than red or white blood cells.
How the Test is Performed
A
blood sample is needed
.
How to Prepare for the Test
Most of the time you do not need to take special steps before this test.
How the Test will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.
Why the Test is Performed
The number of platelets in your blood can be affected by many diseases. Platelets may be counted to monitor or diagnose diseases, or to look for the cause of too much bleeding or clotting.
Normal Results
The normal number of platelets in the blood is 150,000 to 400,000 platelets per microliter (mcL) or 150 to 400 Ã 10
9
/L.
Normal value ranges may vary slightly. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your health care provider about your test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
LOW PLATELET COUNT
A low platelet count is below 150,000 (150 Ã 10
9
/L). If your platelet count is below 50,000 (50 Ã 10
9
/L), your risk for bleeding is higher. Even every day activities can cause bleeding.
A lower-than-normal platelet count is called
thrombocytopenia
. Low platelet count can be divided into 3 main causes:
Not enough platelets are being made in the bone marrow
Platelets are being destroyed in the bloodstream
Platelets are being destroyed in the spleen or liver
Three of the more common causes of this problem are:
Cancer treatments, such as
chemotherapy
or
radiation
Medicines
Autoimmune disorders
, in which the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue, such as platelets
If your platelet count is low, talk to your provider about how to prevent bleeding and what to do if you are bleeding.
HIGH PLATELET COUNT
A high platelet count is 400,000 (400 Ã 10
9
/L) or above.
A higher-than-normal number of platelets is called thrombocytosis. It means your body is making too many platelets. Causes may include:
Iron deficiency
After certain infections, major surgery or trauma
Cancer
Certain medicines
Bone marrow disease called myeloproliferative neoplasm (which includes
polycythemia vera
)
Spleen removal (splenectomy)
Some people with high platelet counts may be at risk for forming
blood clots
or even bleeding too much if the platelet count is extremely high. Blood clots can lead to serious medical problems.
Risks
There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:
Excessive bleeding
Fainting or feeling lightheaded
Multiple punctures to locate veins
Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
Alternative Names
Thrombocyte count
Patient Instructions
Deep vein thrombosis - discharge
