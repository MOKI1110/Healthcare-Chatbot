Angioedema

Angioedema is swelling that is similar to
hives
, but the swelling is under the skin instead of on the surface.
Hives are often called welts. They are a surface swelling. It is possible to have angioedema without hives, and many times angioedema can come with hives.
Causes
Angioedema may be caused by an
allergic reaction
. Angioedema typically is not itchy while hives are very itchy. During the reaction, histamine and other chemicals are released into the bloodstream. The body releases histamine when the immune system detects a foreign substance called an
allergen
.
However, in most cases, the cause of angioedema is never found.
The following may cause angioedema:
Allergies due to animal dander (
scales
of shed skin), foods, insect bites or pollen
Exposure to water, sunlight, cold or heat
Medicines (
drug allergy
) such as antibiotics (penicillin and sulfa drugs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and certain blood pressure medicines (ACE inhibitors)
Autoimmune diseases such as lupus
Hives and angioedema may also occur after infections. Angioedema may occur alone or with other illnesses (including
autoimmune disorders
such as lupus,Â
leukemia
, and lymphoma).
A rare form of angioedema runs in families and has different triggers, complications, and treatments. This is called
hereditary angioedema
.
Symptoms
The main symptom is sudden swelling below the skin surface. Welts or swelling on the surface of the skin can also develop.
The swelling usually occurs around the eyes and lips. It may also be found on the hands, feet, and throat. The swelling may form a line or be more spread out.
The welts are painful and may be itchy. This is known as hives (urticaria). They turn pale and swell if irritated. The deeper swelling of angioedema may also be painful.
Other symptoms may include:
Abdominal cramping
Breathing difficulty
Swollen eyes and mouth
Swollen lining of the eyes (
chemosis
)
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will look at your skin and ask if you have been exposed to any irritating substances. If your throat is affected, a physical exam might reveal abnormal sounds (
stridor
) when you breathe in.
Blood tests or
allergy testing
may be ordered, but often no cause of the swelling or hives is found.
Treatment
Mild symptoms may not need treatment. Moderate to severe symptoms may need to be treated. Breathing difficulty is an emergency condition.
People with angioedema should:
Avoid any known allergen or trigger that causes their symptoms.
Avoid any medicines, herbs, or supplements that are not prescribed by a provider.
Cool compresses or soaks can relieve pain.
Medicines used to treat angioedema include:
Antihistamines
Anti-inflammatory medicines (corticosteroids)
Epinephrine injectors (people with a history of severe symptoms may need to carry these with them in case of a severe reaction)
Inhaler medicines that help open up the airways
If the person has trouble breathing, seek medical help right away. A severe, life-threatening airway blockage may occur if the throat swells.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Angioedema that does not affect the breathing may be uncomfortable. It is usually harmless and goes away in a few days.
When to Contact a Medical Professional

Angioedema does not respond to treatment
It is severe
You have never had angioedema before
Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if there are any of the following symptoms:
Abnormal breathing sounds
Difficulty breathing or wheezing
Fainting
