Premenstrual breast changes
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Premenstrual swelling and tenderness of both breasts often occurs during the second half of the menstrual cycle.
Considerations
Symptoms of premenstrual breast tenderness may range from mild to severe. Symptoms usually:
Are most severe just before each menstrual period
Improve during or right after the menstrual period
Breast tissue may have a dense, bumpy, "cobblestone" feel to the fingers. This feel is usually more in the outer areas, particularly near the armpit. There may also be an off and on or ongoing sense of breast fullness with dull, heavy pain, and tenderness.
Causes
Hormone changes during the menstrual cycle may lead to breast swelling. More estrogen is made early in the cycle and it peaks just before mid-cycle. This causes the breast ducts to grow in size. The progesterone level peaks near the 21st day (in a 28-day cycle). This causes growth of the breast lobules (milk glands).
Premenstrual breast swelling is often linked with:
Premenstrual syndrome
(PMS)
Fibrocystic breast disease
(benign breast changes)
Premenstrual breast tenderness and swelling probably occur to some degree in nearly all women. More severe symptoms may occur in many women during their childbearing years. Symptoms may be less in women taking birth control pills.
Risk factors may include:
Family history
High-fat diet
Too much caffeine
Home Care
Self-care tips:
Eat a lower fat diet.
Avoid caffeine (coffee, tea, and chocolate).
Avoid salt 1 to 2 weeks before your period starts.
Get moderate to vigorous exercise every day.
Wear a well-fitting bra day and night to provide good breast support.
You should practice breast awareness. Do check your breasts for changes at regular intervals.
The effectiveness of vitamin E, vitamin B6, and herbal preparations such as evening primrose oil are somewhat controversial. This should be discussed with your health care provider.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you:
Have new, unusual, or changing lumps in your breast tissue
Have one-sided (unilateral) lumps in your breast tissue
Do not know how to properly perform breast self-examination
Are a woman, age 40 years or older, and have never had a screening mammogram
Have discharge from your nipple, particularly if it is a bloody or brown discharge
Have symptoms that interfere with your ability to sleep, and diet changes and exercise have not helped
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will take your medical history and do a physical examination. The provider will check for
breast lumps
, and will note the qualities of the lump (firm, soft, smooth, bumpy, and so on).
A
mammogram
or
breast ultrasound
may be done. These tests will evaluate any abnormal finding on a breast exam. If a lump is found that is not clearly
benign
, you may need a
breast biopsy
.
These medicines from your provider may reduce or eliminate symptoms:
Injections or shots that contain the hormone progestin (Depoprovera). A single shot works for up to 90 days. These injections are given into the muscles of the upper arm or buttocks. They relieve symptoms by stopping menstrual periods.
Birth control pills.
Diuretics (water pills) taken before your menstrual period. These pills may reduce breast swelling and tenderness.
Danazol may be used in severe cases. Danazol is a synthetic (manmade) androgen (male hormone). If this does not work for you, other medicines may be prescribed.
