Stasis dermatitis and ulcers
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Stasis dermatitis is a change in the skin that results from the pooling of blood in the veins of the lower leg. Ulcers are open sores that can result from untreated stasis dermatitis.
Causes
Venous insufficiency
is a long-term (chronic) condition in which the veins have problems sending blood from the legs back to the heart. This may be due to damaged valves that are in the veins.Â
Some people with venous insufficiency develop stasis dermatitis. Blood pools in the veins of the lower leg. Fluid and blood cells leak out of the veins into the skin and other tissues. This may lead to itching and inflammation that cause more skin changes. The skin may then break down to form open sores.
Symptoms
You may have symptoms of venous insufficiency including:
Dull aching or heaviness in the leg
Pain that gets worse when you stand or walk
Swelling in the leg
At first, the skin of the ankles and lower legs may look thin or tissue-like. You may slowly get brown coloring of the skin.
The skin may become irritated or crack if you scratch it. It may also become red or swollen, crusted, or weepy.
Over time, some skin changes become permanent:
Thickening and hardening of the skin on the legs and ankles (lipodermatosclerosis)
A bumpy or cobblestone appearance of the skin
Skin turns dark brown
Skin sores (
ulcers
) may develop (called a venous ulcer or stasis ulcer). These most often form on the inside of the ankle.
Exams and Tests
The diagnosis is primarily based on the way the skin looks. Your health care provider may order tests to examine the blood flow in your legs.
Stasis dermatitis can also be related to heart problems or other conditions that cause leg swelling. Your provider may need to check your general health and order more tests.
Treatment
Your provider may suggest the following to manage the venous insufficiency that causes stasis dermatitis:
Use elastic or compression stockings to reduce swelling
Avoid standing or sitting for long periods of time
Keep your leg raised when you sit
Try
varicose vein stripping
or other surgical procedures
Some skin care treatments can make the problem worse. Talk with your provider before using any lotions, creams, or antibiotic ointments.
Things to avoid:
Topical antibiotics, such as neomycin
Drying lotions, such as calamine
Lanolin
Benzocaine and other products meant to numb the skin
Treatments your provider may suggest include:
Skin moisturizers
Unna boot (compressive wet dressing, used only when instructed)
Topical steroid creams or ointments
Oral antibiotics
Good nutrition
Outlook (Prognosis)
Stasis dermatitis is often a long-term (
chronic
) condition. Healing is related to the successful treatment of the cause, factors causing the ulcer, and prevention of complications.
Possible Complications
Complications of stasis ulcers include:
Bacterial skin infections
Infection of bone
Permanent scar
Skin cancer (squamous cell carcinoma)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you develop leg swelling or symptoms of stasis dermatitis.
Watch for signs of infection, such as:
Drainage that looks like pus
Open skin sores (ulcers)
Pain
Redness
Prevention
To prevent this condition, control the causes of swelling of the leg, ankle, and foot (
peripheral edema
).
