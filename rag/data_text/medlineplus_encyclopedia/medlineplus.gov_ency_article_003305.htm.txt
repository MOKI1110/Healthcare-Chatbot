Increased
head circumference
is when the measured distance around the widest part of the skull is larger than expected for the child's age and background.
Considerations
A newborn's head is usually about 2 cm (0.78 inch) larger than the chest size. Between 6 months and 2 years, both measurements are about equal. After 2 years, the chest size becomes larger than the head.
Measurements over time that show an increased rate of head growth often provide more valuable information than a single measurement that is larger than expected.
Increased pressure inside the head (
increased intracranial pressure
) often occurs with increased head circumference. Symptoms of this condition include:
Eyes moving downward
Irritability
Vomiting
Causes
Increased head size may be from any of the following:
Benign familial macrocephaly (family tendency toward large head size)
Canavan disease
(condition that affects how the body breaks down and uses a protein called aspartic acid)
Hydrocephalus
(buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling)
Bleeding inside the skull
Disease in which the body is unable to break down long chains of sugar molecules (
Hurler
or
Morquio
syndrome)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Your health care provider usually finds an increased head size in a baby during a routine well-baby exam.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
A careful physical exam will be done. Other
milestones for growth and development
will be checked.
In some cases, a single measurement is enough to confirm that there is a size increase that needs to be tested further. More often, repeated measurements of the head circumference over time are needed to confirm that the head circumference is increased and the problem is getting worse.
Diagnostic tests that may be ordered include:
Head CT scan
MRI of the head
Cranial ultrasound
Treatment depends on the cause of the increased head size. For example, for hydrocephalus, surgery may be needed to relieve the buildup of fluid inside the skull.
