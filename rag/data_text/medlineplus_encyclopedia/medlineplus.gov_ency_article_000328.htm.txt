Apoplexy is bleeding into an organ or loss of blood flow to an organ. For example,
Adrenal apoplexy -- bleeding into the
adrenal glands
Pituitary apoplexy -- bleeding into the pituitary gland
Apoplexy most often refers to stroke symptoms that occur suddenly. Such symptoms occur due to bleeding into the brain. It can also occur by a blood clot in a brain blood vessel. Conditions such as
subarachnoid hemorrhage
or
stroke
are sometimes called apoplexy.
Functional apoplexy is when a person appears to be having stroke-like symptoms. However, there is no brain defect.
