Wheezing

Wheezing is a high-pitched whistling sound during breathing. It occurs when air moves through narrowed breathing tubes in the lungs.
Considerations
Wheezing is a sign that a person may be having breathing problems. The sound of wheezing is most apparent when breathing out (exhaling). It may also be heard when breathing in (inhaling).
Wheezing most often comes from the small breathing tubes (bronchial tubes) deep in the lungs. But it may be due to a blockage in larger airways or in people with certain vocal cord problems.
Causes
Causes of wheezing may include any of the following:
Asthma
Breathing a foreign object into the airways to the lungs
Damage and widening of the large airways in the lungs (
bronchiectasis
)
Swelling and mucus buildup in the smallest air passages in the lungs (
bronchiolitis
)
Swelling and mucus buildup in the main passages that carry air to the lungs (
bronchitis
)
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), especially when a respiratory infection is present
Acid reflux disease
Heart failure (cardiac asthma)
Insect sting that causes an
allergic reaction
Certain medicines (such as aspirin)
Infection of the lungs (
pneumonia
)
Smoking
Viral infection, especially in infants younger than age 2
Home Care
Take all of your medicines as directed.
Sitting in an area where there is moist, heated air may help relieve some symptoms. This can be done by running a hot shower or using a vaporizer.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if wheezing:
Occurs for the first time
Occurs with significant
shortness of breath
,
bluish skin
,
confusion
, or mental status changes
Keeps occurring without explanation
Is caused by an allergic reaction to a bite or medicine
If wheezing is severe or occurs with severe shortness of breath, you should go directly to the nearest emergency department.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history and symptoms. Questions about your wheezing may include when it started, how long it has lasted, when it is worse, and what might have caused it.
The physical exam may include listening to the lung sounds (
auscultation
). If your child has the symptoms, their provider will make sure your child didn't swallow a foreign object.
Tests that may be done include:
Blood tests, possibly including
arterial blood gases
Chest x-ray
Lung function tests
Pulse oximetry to measure blood oxygen level
A hospital stay may be needed if:
Breathing is particularly difficult
Medicines need to be given through a vein (IV)
Supplemental oxygen is required
The person needs to be closely watched by medical personnel
