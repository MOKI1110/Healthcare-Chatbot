Vascular dementia

Dementia is a loss of brain function that occurs with certain diseases. It affects one or more brain functions such as memory, thinking, language, judgment, or behavior.
Vascular dementia is caused by a series of small strokes over time.
Dementia may also be referred to as major
neurocognitive disorder
.
Causes
Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of
dementia
after
Alzheimer disease
in people over age 65.
Vascular dementia is caused by a series of small strokes.
A
stroke
is brain damage due to a blockage of the blood supply to any part of the brain. A stroke is also called an infarct. Multi-infarct means that more than one area in the brain has been injured due to a lack of blood.
If blood flow is stopped for longer than a few seconds, the brain cannot get oxygen. Brain cells can die, causing permanent damage.
When strokes affect a small area, there may be no symptoms. These are called silent strokes. Over time, as more areas of the brain are damaged, the symptoms of dementia appear.
Not all strokes are silent. Larger strokes that affect strength, sensation, or other brain and nervous system (neurologic) function can also lead to dementia.
Risk factors for vascular dementia include:
Diabetes
Hardening of the arteries (
atherosclerosis
)
Heart disease
High blood pressure (
hypertension
)
Smoking
Stroke or other vascular disease
Symptoms of dementia may also be caused by other types of disorders of the brain. One such disorder is Alzheimer disease. Symptoms of Alzheimer disease can be similar to those of vascular dementia. Vascular dementia and Alzheimer disease are the most common causes of dementia, and may occur together.
Symptoms
Symptoms of vascular dementia may develop gradually or may progress after each small stroke.
Symptoms may begin suddenly after each stroke. Some people with vascular dementia may improve for short periods, but decline after having more silent strokes. Symptoms of vascular dementia will depend on the areas of the brain that are injured due to the stroke.
Early symptoms of vascular dementia can include:
Difficulty performing cognitive tasks that used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing games (such as bridge), and learning new information or routines
Getting lost on familiar routes
Language problems, such as trouble finding the name of familiar objects
Losing interest in things you previously enjoyed, flat mood
Misplacing items
Mood changes leading to aggressive behavior
Personality changes and loss of social skills as well as behavioral changes
Poor performance of job duties
As dementia worsens, symptoms are more obvious and the ability to take care of oneself declines. Symptoms may include:
Change in sleep patterns, often waking up at night
Difficulty doing basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, or driving
Forgetting details about current events
Forgetting events in your own life history, losing awareness of who you are
Having delusions, depression, or agitation
Having
hallucinations
, arguments, striking out, or violent behavior
Having more difficulty reading or writing
Having poor judgment and loss of ability to recognize danger
Using the wrong word, not pronouncing words correctly, or speaking in confusing sentences
Withdrawing from social contact
Nervous system (neurologic) problems that occur with a stroke may also be present.
Exams and Tests
A skilled health care provider can often diagnose vascular dementia using the following:
Complete physical exam, including nervous system exam
Asking about the person's medical history and symptoms
Mental function tests (mental status exam)
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Neuropsychological testing
Tests may be ordered to help determine whether other medical problems could be causing dementia or making it worse, such as:
Anemia
Brain tumor
Chronic infection
Drug and medicine intoxication (
overdose
)
Severe depression
Thyroid disease
Vitamin deficiency
Other tests may be done to find out what parts of thinking have been affected and to guide other tests such as neuropsychological testing.
Tests that can show evidence of previous strokes in the brain may include:
Head CT scan
MRI of the brain
Treatment
There is no treatment to repair damage to the brain caused by small strokes.
An important goal is to regulate symptoms and correct the risk factors. To prevent future strokes:
Avoid fatty foods. Follow a healthy, low-fat diet.
Do not drink more than 1 to 2 alcoholic drinks a day.
Keep blood pressure lower than 130/80 mm Hg. Ask your provider what your blood pressure should be.
Keep LDL (bad) cholesterol lower than 70 mg/dL.
Do not smoke.
Your provider may suggest blood thinners, such as aspirin, to help prevent blood clots from forming in your arteries. Do not start taking aspirin or stop taking it without talking to your provider first.
The goals of
helping someone with dementia in the home
are to:
Manage behavior problems, confusion, sleep problems, and agitation
Remove safety hazards in the home
Support family members and other caregivers
Medicines may be needed to control aggressive, agitated, or dangerous behaviors.
Medicines used to treat Alzheimer disease have not been shown to work for vascular dementia.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Some improvement may occur for short periods, but the disorder will generally get worse over time.
Possible Complications
Complications include the following:
Future strokes
Heart disease
Loss of ability to function or care for self
Loss of ability to interact
Pneumonia
Pressure sores
Skin infections
Urinary tract infections
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if symptoms of vascular dementia occur. Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if there is a sudden
change in mental status
, sensation, or movement. These are emergency symptoms of a stroke.
Prevention
Control conditions that increase the risk of hardening of the arteries (atherosclerosis) by:
Regulating high blood pressure
Regulating weight
Stopping the use of tobacco products
Reducing saturated fats and salt in the diet
Treating related disorders
