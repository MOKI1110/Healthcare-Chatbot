A bounding
pulse
is a strong throbbing felt over one of the arteries in the body. It is due to a forceful heartbeat.
Causes
A bounding pulse and rapid heart rate may both occur in the following conditions or events:
Abnormal or rapid heart rhythms
Anemia
Anxiety
Long-term (chronic) kidney disease
Fever
Heart failure
Heart valve problem called
aortic regurgitation
Heavy exercise
Overactive thyroid (
hyperthyroidism
)
Pregnancy, because of increased fluid and blood in the body
Use of caffeine or other stimulants
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if the intensity or rate of your pulse increases suddenly and does not go away. This is very important when:
You have other symptoms along with increased pulse, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, feeling faint, or loss of consciousness.
The change in your pulse does not go away when you rest for a few minutes.
You already have been diagnosed with a heart problem.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will do a physical exam that includes checking your temperature, pulse, rate of breathing, and blood pressure. Your heart and circulation will also be checked.
Your provider will ask questions such as:
Is this the first time you have felt a bounding pulse?
Did it develop suddenly or gradually? Is it always present, or does it come and go?
Does it only happen along with other symptoms, such as palpitations? What other symptoms do you have?
Does it get better if you rest?
Are you pregnant?
Have you had a fever?
Have you been very anxious or stressed?
Do you have other heart problems, such as heart valve disease, high blood pressure, or congestive heart failure?
Do you have kidney disease?
Do you consume stimulants such as caffeine or cold medicine or drugs such as amphetamines or cocaine?
The following diagnostic tests may be performed:
Blood studies (
CBC
or
blood count
),
basic metabolic panel
Chest x-ray
Electrocardiogram
(ECG)
Echocardiogram
