Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a rare cancerous (malignant) growth inÂ one of the ducts that carries
bile
from the liver to the small intestine.
Causes
The exact cause of CCA isn't known. However, many of these tumors are already quite advanced by the time they are found.
CCA may start anywhere along the bile ducts. These tumors block off the bile ducts.
Both men and women are affected. Most people are older than 65.
People with the following health problems may have a higher chance of developing CCA:
Bile duct (choledochal)
cysts
Chronic
biliary
and liver inflammation
History of infection withÂ parasitic worms, liver flukes
Primary
sclerosing cholangitis
Ulcerative colitis
Symptoms
Symptoms of CCA may include any of the following:
Fever
Â and chills
Clay-colored stools and dark urine
Itching
Loss of appetite
Pain in the upper right abdomen that may radiate to the back
Weight loss
Yellowing of the skin (
jaundice
)
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. Tests will be done to check for a tumor or blockage in the bile duct. These may include:
Abdominal CT scan
Abdominal ultrasound
Procedure that uses a viewing scope to look at the bile ducts (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or
ERCP
), during which
tissue may be taken
and looked at under a microscope
Blood tests that may be done include:
Liver function tests
(especially alkaline phosphatase or
bilirubin
levels)
Complete blood count
(CBC)
Treatment
The goal is to treat the cancer and the blockage it causes. When possible, surgery to remove the tumor is the treatment of choice and may result in a cure. Often the cancer has already spread locally or to another area of the body by the time it is diagnosed. As a result, surgery to cure the cancer is not possible.
Chemotherapy
or
radiation
may be given after surgery to decrease the risk of the cancer returning.
In select cases, a liver transplant can be tried.
Endoscopic therapy with stent placement can temporarily relieve blockages in the biliary ducts. This may also relieve jaundice when the tumor cannot be removed.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Completely removing the tumor allows some people to survive with the possibility of complete cure.
The survival time varies greatly from several months to several years. Outlook depends on:
The location of CCA
The cell type of CCA
The stage of the tumor
The person's age and general health
Whether surgery is an option
The person's response to treatment
If the tumor cannot be completely removed, a cure is generally not possible. With treatment, about one half of affected people live a year, and about one half live longer, but rarely beyond 5 years. You and your family may want to start thinking about end-of-life planning, such as:
Palliative care
Hospice care
Advance care directives
Health care agents
Possible Complications
Complications of CCA include:
Infection
Liver failure
Spread (
metastasis
) of tumor to other organs
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have jaundice or other symptoms of cholangiocarcinoma.
