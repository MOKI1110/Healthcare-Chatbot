Protein-losing enteropathy is an abnormal loss of protein from the digestive tract. It can also refer to the inability of the digestive tract to absorb proteins.

Bacterial or parasitic infection of the intestines
Celiac disease
Crohn disease
HIV infection
Lymphoma
Lymphatic obstruction in the gastrointestinal tract
Intestinal lymphangiectasia
Symptoms
Symptoms can include:
Diarrhea
Fever
Abdominal pain
Swelling (edema)
Symptoms will depend on the disease that is causing the problem.
Exams and Tests
You may need tests that look at the intestinal tract. These may include a CT scan of the abdomen or an upper GI bowel series.
Other tests you may need include:
Colonoscopy
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)
Small intestine biopsy
Alpha-1-antitrypsin
