Chancroid is a bacterial infection that is spread through sexual contact.
Causes
Chancroid is caused by a bacterium called
Haemophilus ducreyi
.
The infection is found in many parts of the world, such as Africa and southwest Asia. The infection is uncommon in the United States. Most people in the United States who are diagnosed with chancroid get it outside the country in areas where the infection is more common.
Symptoms
Within 1 day to 2 weeks after becoming infected, a person will get a small bump on the genitals. The bump becomes an
ulcer
within a day after it first appears. The ulcer:
Ranges in size from 1/8 inch to 2 inches (3 millimeters to 5 centimeters) in diameter
Is painful
Is soft
Has sharply defined borders
Has a base that is covered with a gray or yellowish-gray material
Has a base that bleeds easily if it is bumped or scraped
About one half of infected men have only a single ulcer. Women often have 4 or more ulcers. The ulcers appear in specific locations.
Common locations in men are:
Foreskin
Groove behind the head of the penis
Shaft of the penis
Head of the penis
Opening of the penis
Scrotum
In women, the most common location for ulcers is the outer lips of the vagina (labia majora). "Kissing ulcers" may develop. Kissing ulcers are those that occur on opposite surfaces of the labia.
Ulcers also may form on the:
Inner vagina lips (labia minora)
Area between the genitals and the anus (perineal area)
Inner thighs
The most common symptoms in women are pain with urination and intercourse.
The ulcer may look like the sore of
primary syphilis
(chancre).
About one half of the people who are infected with a chancroid develop enlarged lymph nodes in the groin.
In one half of people who have swelling of the groin lymph nodes, the nodes break through the skin and cause draining
abscesses
. The
swollen lymph nodes
and abscesses are also called buboes.
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider diagnoses chancroid by:
Looking at the ulcer(s)
Checking for swollen lymph nodes
Testing (ruling out) for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
There is no blood test for chancroid.
Treatment
The infection is treated with antibiotics including ceftriaxone and azithromycin. Large lymph node swellings may need to be drained, either with a needle or local surgery.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Chancroid can get better on its own. Some people have months of painful ulcers and draining. Antibiotic treatment often clears up the lesions quickly with very little scarring.
Possible Complications
Complications include urethral
fistulas
and scars on the foreskin of the
penis
in uncircumcised males. People with chancroid should also be checked for other sexually transmitted infections, including but not limited toÂ
syphilis
, HIV, and
genital herpes
.
In people with HIV, chancroid may take much longer to heal.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider for an appointment if:
You have symptoms of chancroid.
You have had sexual contact with a person who you know has an STI.
You have engaged in high-risk sexual practices.
Prevention
Chancroid is spread by sexual contact with an infected person. Avoiding all forms of sexual activity is the only absolute way to prevent an STI.
However,
safer sex behaviors
may reduce your risk. The proper use of condoms, either the
male
or
female
type, greatly decreases the risk of catching an STI. You need to wear the condom from the beginning to the end of each sexual activity.
