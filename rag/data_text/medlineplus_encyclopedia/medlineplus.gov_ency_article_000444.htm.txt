Fungal arthritis is
swelling
and irritation (inflammation) of a joint by a fungal infection. It is also called mycotic arthritis.
Causes
Fungal arthritis is a rare condition. It can be caused by any of the invasive types of fungi. The infection can result from an infection in another organ, such as the lungs and travel to a joint through the bloodstream. A joint can also become infected during a surgery. People with weakened immune systems who travel or live in areas where the fungi are common, are more susceptible to most causes of fungal arthritis.
Conditions that can cause fungal arthritis include:
Blastomycosis
Candidiasis
Coccidioidomycosis
Cryptococcosis
Histoplasmosis
Sporotrichosis
Symptoms
The fungus can affect bone or joint tissue. One or more joints can be affected, most often the large, weight-bearing joints, such as the knees.
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Fever
Joint pain
Joint stiffness
Joint swelling
Swelling of the ankles, feet, and legs
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine you.
Tests that may be ordered include:
Removal of joint fluid to look for fungus under a microscope
Culture of joint fluid
to look for fungus
Joint x-ray
Â that may show joint changes
Positive antibody test (serology) for fungal disease
Synovial biopsy
showing fungus
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to cure the infection using antifungal medicines. Commonly used antifungal medicines are amphotericin B or medicines in the azole family (fluconazole, ketoconazole, or itraconazole).
Chronic or advanced bone or joint infection may require surgery (debridement) to remove the infected tissue.
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well you do depends on the underlying cause of the infection and your overall health. A weakened immune system, cancer, and certain medicines can affect the outcome.
Possible Complications
Joint damage may occur and the risk of damage is higher if the infection is not treated right away.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider for an appointment if you have any symptoms of fungal arthritis.
Prevention
Thorough treatment of fungal infections elsewhere in the body may help prevent fungal arthritis.
