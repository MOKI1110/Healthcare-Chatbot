Oppositional defiant disorder is a pattern of disobedient, hostile, and defiant behavior toward authority figures.
Causes
This disorder is more common in boys than in girls. This behavior typically starts by age 8. However, it may start as early as the preschool years. This disorder is thought to be caused by a combination of biological, psychological, and social factors.
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Actively does not follow adults' requests
Angry and resentful of others
Argues with adults
Blames others for own mistakes
Has few or no friends or has lost friends
Is often in trouble in school
Loses temper
Is spiteful or seeks revenge
Is touchy or easily annoyed
To fit this diagnosis, the pattern must last for at least 6 months and must be more than normal childhood misbehavior.
The pattern of behaviors must be different from those of other children around the same age and developmental level. The behavior must lead to significant problems in school or social activities.
Exams and Tests
Children with symptoms of this disorder should be evaluated by a psychiatrist or psychologist. In children and adolescents, the following conditions can cause similar behavior problems and should be considered as possibilities:
Anxiety disorders
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD)
Bipolar disorder
Depression
Learning disorders
Substance use disorders
Treatment
The best treatment for the child is to talk with a mental health professional in individual and possibly family therapy. The parents should also learn how to manage the child's behavior.
Medicines may also be helpful, especially if the behaviors occur as part of another condition (such as depression, childhood
psychosis
, or ADHD).
Outlook (Prognosis)
Some children respond well to treatment, while others do not.
Possible Complications
In many cases, children with oppositional defiant disorder grow up to have
conduct disorder
as teenagers or adults. In some cases, children may grow up to have
antisocial personality disorder
.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you have concerns about your child's development or behavior.
Prevention
Be consistent about rules and consequences at home. Don't make punishments too harsh or inconsistent.
Model the right behaviors for your child. Abuse and neglect increase the chances that this condition will occur.
