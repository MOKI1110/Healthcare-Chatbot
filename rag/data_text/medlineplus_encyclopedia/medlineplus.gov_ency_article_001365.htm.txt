Yellow fever is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes.
Causes
Yellow fever is caused by a virus carried by mosquitoes. You can develop this disease if you are bitten by a mosquito infected with this virus.
This disease is common in South America and in sub-Saharan Africa.
Anyone can get yellow fever, but older people have a higher risk of severe infection.
If a person is bitten by an infected mosquito, symptoms usually develop 3 to 6 days later.
Symptoms
Yellow fever has 3 stages:
Stage 1 (infection): Headache, muscle and joint aches, fever, flushing, loss of appetite, vomiting, and
jaundice
are common. Symptoms often go away within a week.
Stage 2 (remission): Fever and other symptoms go away. Most people will recover at this stage, but others may get worse within 24 hours.
Stage 3 (intoxication): Problems with many organs may occur, including the heart, liver, and kidney. Bleeding disorders,
seizures
,
coma
, and
delirium
may also occur.
Symptoms may include:
Fever, headache, muscle aches
Nausea and vomiting, possibly
vomiting blood
Red eyes
, face, tongue
Yellow skin and eyes (jaundice)
Decreased urination
Delirium
Irregular heartbeats
(arrhythmias)
Bleeding (may progress to hemorrhage)
Seizures
Coma
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical examination and order blood tests. These blood tests may show liver and kidney damage and evidence of shock.
It is important to tell your provider if you have traveled to areas where the disease is known to thrive. Blood tests can confirm the diagnosis.
Treatment
There is no specific treatment for yellow fever. Treatment is supportive and focuses on:
Blood products for severe bleeding
Dialysis for
kidney failure
Fluids through a vein (
intravenous
fluids)
Outlook (Prognosis)
Yellow fever can cause severe problems, including internal bleeding. Death is possible.
Possible Complications
Complications that may result include:
Coma
Death
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
Kidney failure
Liver failure
Salivary gland infection
(parotitis)
Secondary bacterial infections
Shock
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Tell your provider right away if you or your child develops fever, headache, muscle aches, vomiting, or jaundice, especially if you have traveled to an area where yellow fever is common.
Prevention
There is an effective vaccine against yellow fever. Ask your provider at least 10 to 14 days before traveling if you should be vaccinated against yellow fever. Some countries require proof of vaccination to gain entry.
