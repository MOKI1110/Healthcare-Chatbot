Childhood
stress
can be present in any setting that requires the child to adapt or change. Stress may be caused by positive changes, such as starting a new activity, but it is most commonly linked with negative changes such as illness or death in the family.
You can help your child by learning to recognize the signs of stress and teaching your child healthy ways to deal with it.
Information
Stress may be a response to a negative change in a child's life. In small amounts, stress can be good. But, excessive stress can affect the way a child thinks, acts, and feels.
Children learn how to respond to stress as they grow and develop. Many stressful events that an adult can manage will cause stress in a child. As a result, even small changes can impact a child's feelings of safety and security.
Pain, injury, illness, and other changes are stressors for children. Stressors may include:
Worrying about schoolwork or grades
Juggling responsibilities, such as school and work or sports
Problems with friends, bullying, or peer group pressures
Changing schools, moving, or dealing with housing problems or homelessness
Having negative thoughts about themselves
Going through body changes, in both boys and girls
Seeing parents go through a divorce or separation
Money problems in the family
Living in an unsafe home or neighborhood

Decreased appetite, other changes in eating habits
Headache
New or recurrent bedwetting
Nightmares
Sleep disturbances
Upset stomach or vague stomach pain
Other physical symptoms with no physical illness

Anxiety, worry
Not able to relax
New or recurring fears (fear of the dark, fear of being alone, fear of strangers)
Clinging, unwilling to let you out of sight
Anger, crying, whining
Not able to control emotions
Aggressive or stubborn behavior

HOW PARENTS CAN HELP
Parents can help children respond to stress in healthy ways. Following are some tips:
Provide a safe, secure, and dependable home.
Family routines can be comforting. Having a family dinner or movie night can help relieve or prevent stress.
Be a role model. The child looks to you as a model for healthy behavior. Do your best to keep your own stress under control and manage it in healthy ways.
Be careful about which television programs, books, and games that young children watch, read, and play. News broadcasts and violent shows or games can produce fears and anxiety.
Keep your child informed of anticipated changes such as in jobs or moving.
Spend calm, relaxed time with your children.
Learn to listen. Listen to your child without being critical or trying to solve the problem right away. Instead work with your child to help them understand and solve what is upsetting to them.
Build your child's feelings of self-worth. Use encouragement and affection. Use rewards, not
punishment
. Try to involve your child in activities where they can succeed.
Allow the child opportunities to make choices and have some control in their life. The more your child feels they have control over a situation, the better their response to stress will be.
Encourage physical activity.
Recognize signs of unresolved stress in your child.
Seek help or advice from a health care provider, counselor, or therapist when signs of stress do not decrease or disappear.
WHEN TO CALL THE DOCTOR
Talk to your child's provider if your child:
Is becoming withdrawn, more unhappy, or depressed
Is having problems in school or interacting with friends or family
Is unable to control their behavior or anger
