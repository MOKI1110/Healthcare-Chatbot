SjÃ¶gren syndrome is an
autoimmune disorder
in which the glands that produce tears and saliva are destroyed. This causes dry mouth and dry eyes. The condition may affect other parts of the body, including the kidneys and lungs.
Causes
The cause of SjÃ¶gren syndrome is unknown. It is an autoimmune disorder. This means the body attacks healthy tissue by mistake. The syndrome occurs most often in women ages 40 to 50. It is rare in children.
Primary SjÃ¶gren syndrome is defined as dry eyes and dry mouth without another autoimmune disorder.
Secondary SjÃ¶gren syndrome occurs along with another autoimmune disorder, such as:
Rheumatoid arthritis
(RA)
Systemic lupus erythematosus
Scleroderma
Polymyositis
Hepatitis C can affect the salivary glands and looks like SjÃ¶gren syndrome
IgG4 disease can look likeÂ SjÃ¶gren syndrome and should be considered
Symptoms
Dry eyes and dry mouth are the most common symptoms of this syndrome.
Eye symptoms:
Itching eyes
Burning sensation in eyes
Feeling that something is in the eye
Mouth and throat symptoms:
Difficulty swallowing or eating dry foods
Loss of sense of taste
Problems speaking
Thick or stringy saliva
Mouth sores or pain
Teeth decay and gum inflammation
Hoarseness
Other symptoms may include:
Fatigue
Fever
Change in the color of hands or feetÂ with cold exposure (Raynaud phenomenon)
Joint pain
or
joint swelling
Swollen glands
Skin rash
Numbness and pain due to neuropathy
Cough and shortness of breath due to lung disease
Irregular heartbeatÂ
Nausea and heartburn
Vaginal dryness or painful urination
Exams and Tests
A complete physical exam will be done. The exam reveals dry eyes and dry mouth. There may be
mouth sores
, decayed teeth or gum inflammation. This occurs because of the mouth dryness. Your health care provider will look in your mouth for fungus infection (candida). Skin may show a rash, the lung exam may be abnormal, the abdomen will be palpated for liver enlargement. The joints will be examined for arthritis. The neurologic exam will look for deficits due to nerve damage.
You may have the following tests done:
Complete blood chemistry with liver enzymes
Complete blood count with differential
Urinalysis
Antinuclear
antibodies
(
ANA
) test
Anti-Ro/SSA and anti-La/SSB antibodies
Rheumatoid factor
Anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody
Test for cryoglobulins
Complement levels
Protein electrophoresis
Test for hepatitis C and HIV (if at risk)
Thyroid tests
Schirmer test
of tear production
Imaging of the salivary gland: by ultrasound or by MRI
Salivary gland biopsy
Skin biopsy if a rash is present
Examination of the eyes by an ophthalmologist
Chest x-ray
Treatment
The goal is to relieve symptoms.
Dry eyes may be treated with artificial tears, eye-lubricating ointments, or cyclosporine liquid.
If Candida is present, it may be treated with sugar-free miconazole or nystatin preparations.
Tiny plugs can be placed in the tear drainage ducts to help the tears stay on the surface of the eye.
Oral medicines such as pilocarpine or cevimeline that cause increased saliva production can be useful in dryness when local therapy is not helping.
Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) similar to those used for RA may improve the symptoms of SjÃ¶gren syndrome. These include Rituximab and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibiting drugs such as etanercept (Enbrel), adalimumab (Humira) or infliximab (Remicade).
Some things you can do to ease symptoms include:
Sip water throughout the day
Chew sugarless gum
Avoid medicines that can cause mouth dryness, such as antihistamines and decongestants
Avoid alcohol
Talk with your dentist about:
Mouth rinses to replace minerals in your teeth
Saliva substitutes
Drugs that help your salivary glands make more saliva
To prevent dental decay caused by mouth dryness:
Brush and floss your teeth often
Visit the dentist for regular checkups and cleanings
Outlook (Prognosis)
The disease is most often not life threatening. The outcome depends on what other diseases you have.
There is a higher risk for
lymphoma
and early death when SjÃ¶gren syndrome has been very active for a long time, as well as in people with vasculitis, low complements, and cryoglobulins.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Damage to the eye
Dental cavities
Kidney failure
(rare)
Lymphoma
Pulmonary disease
Vasculitis (rare)
Neuropathy
Bladder inflammation
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of SjÃ¶gren syndrome.
