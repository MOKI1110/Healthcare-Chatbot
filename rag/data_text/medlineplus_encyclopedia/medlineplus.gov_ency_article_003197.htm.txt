Movement - uncontrolled or slow
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Uncontrolled or slow movement is a problem with muscle tone, usually in the large muscle groups. The problem leads to slow, uncontrollable jerky movements of the head, limbs, trunk, or neck.
Considerations
The abnormal movement may be reduced or disappear during sleep. Emotional stress makes it worse.
Abnormal and sometimes strange postures may occur because of these movements.
Causes
The slow twisting movements of muscles (athetosis) or jerky muscle contractions (dystonia) may be caused by one of many conditions, including:
Cerebral palsy
(a group of disorders that can involve brain and nervous system functions, such as movement, learning, hearing, seeing, and thinking)
Side effects of medicines, especially for mental disorders
Encephalitis
(irritation and swelling of the brain, most often due to infections)
Genetic diseases
Hepatic encephalopathy
(loss of brain function when the liver is unable to remove toxins from the blood)
Huntington disease
(disorder that involves breakdown of nerve cells in the brain)
Stroke
Head and neck trauma
Pregnancy
Sometimes two conditions (such as a brain injury and medicine) interact to cause the abnormal movements when neither one alone would cause a problem.
Home Care
Get enough sleep and avoid too much stress. Take safety measures to avoid injury. Follow the treatment plan your health care provider prescribes.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
You have unexplained movements that you cannot control
The problem is getting worse
Uncontrolled movements
occur with other symptoms
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will perform a physical exam. This may include a detailed exam of the nervous and muscle systems.
You'll be asked about your medical history and symptoms, including:
When did you develop this problem?
Is it always the same?
Is it always present or only sometimes?
Is it getting worse?
Is it worse after exercise?
Is it worse during times of emotional stress?
Have you been injured or in an accident recently?
Have you been sick recently?
Is it better after you sleep?
Does anyone else in your family have a similar problem?
What other symptoms do you have?
What medicines are you taking?
Tests that may be ordered include:
Blood studies, such as
metabolic panel
, complete blood count (
CBC
),
blood differential
CT scan of the head
or affected area
Electroencephalogram
Â (EEG)
Electromyography
Â (EMG) and
nerve conduction velocity
Â (sometimes done)
Genetic studies
Lumbar puncture
MRI of the head
or affected area
Urinalysis
Pregnancy test
Treatment is based on the movement problem the person has and on the condition that may be causing the problem. If medicines are used, your provider will decide which medicine to prescribe based on the person's symptoms and any test results.
