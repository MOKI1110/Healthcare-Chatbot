Eclampsia

Eclampsia is the new onset of
seizures
or coma in a pregnant woman with preeclampsia. These seizures are not related to an existing brain condition.
Causes
The exact cause of eclampsia is not known. Factors that may play a role include:
Blood vessel problems
Brain and nervous system (neurological) factors
Diet
Genes
Eclampsia follows a condition called
preeclampsia
. This is a complication of pregnancy in which a woman has high blood pressure and other findings.
Most women with preeclampsia do not go on to have eclampsia (seizures). It is hard to predict which women will. Women at high risk of seizures often have severe preeclampsia with findings such as:
Abnormal blood tests
Headaches
Very high blood pressure
Vision changes
Abdominal pain
Your chances of getting preeclampsia increase when:
You are 35 or older.
You are African American.
This is your first pregnancy.
You have
diabetes
, high blood pressure, or kidney disease.
You are having more than 1 baby (such as twins or triplets).
You are a teen.
You are obese.
You have a family history of preeclampsia.
You have autoimmune disorders.
You have undergone in vitro fertilization.
You have history of a clotting disorder.
Symptoms
Symptoms of eclampsia include:
Seizures
Severe agitation
Unconsciousness
Altered mental status and confusion
Most women will have these symptoms of preeclampsia before the seizure:
Headaches
Nausea and vomiting
Stomach pain
Swelling of the hands and face
Vision problems, such as loss of vision, blurred vision, double vision, or missing areas in the visual field
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will do a physical exam to look for causes of seizures. Your blood pressure and breathing rate will be checked regularly.
Blood and urine tests may be done to check:
Blood clotting factors
Blood creatinine
Hematocrit
Uric acid
Liver function
Platelet count
Protein in the urine
Hemoglobin level
Treatment
The main treatment to prevent severe preeclampsia from progressing to eclampsia is giving birth to the baby. Letting the pregnancy go on can be dangerous for you and the baby.
You may be given medicine to prevent seizures. These medicines are called anticonvulsants.
Your provider may give you medicine to lower high blood pressure. If your blood pressure stays high, delivery may be needed, even if it is before the baby is due.
Possible Complications
Women with eclampsia or preeclampsia have a higher risk for:
Separation of the placenta (
placenta abruptio
)
Premature delivery that leads to complications in the baby
Blood clotting problems
Stroke
Infant death
Maternal death
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider or go to the emergency room if you have any symptoms of eclampsia or preeclampsia. Emergency symptoms include seizures or decreased alertness.
Seek medical care right away if you have any of the following:
Bright red vaginal bleeding
Little or no movement in the baby
Severe headache
Severe pain in the upper right abdominal area
Vision loss
Nausea or vomiting
Prevention
Getting medical care during your entire pregnancy is important in preventing complications. This allows problems such as preeclampsia to be detected and treated early.
Getting treatment for preeclampsia may prevent eclampsia.
