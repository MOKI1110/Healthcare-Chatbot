Phlegmasia cerulea dolens is an uncommon, severe form of
deep venous thrombosis
(blood clots in the vein). It most often occurs in the upper leg.
Causes
Phlegmasia cerulea dolens is preceded by blood clots in a vein, usually a deep vein of the leg.
Symptoms
Severe pain, rapid
swelling
, and
bluish-skin coloring
affect the area below the blocked vein.
Possible Complications
Continued clotting can lead to increased swelling. The swelling can interfere with arterial blood flow. This complication is called phlegmasia alba dolens. It causes the skin to turn white. Phlegmasia alba dolens may lead to tissue death (
gangrene
) and the need for
amputation
.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Seek medical help right awayÂ if an arm or leg is severely swollen, blue, or painful.
