Hemoglobin C disease is a blood disorder passed down through families. It leads to a type of
anemia
, which occurs when red blood cells break down earlier than normal.
Causes
Hemoglobin C is an abnormal type of hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. It is a type of hemoglobinopathy. The disease is caused by a problem with a gene called beta globin.
The disease most often occurs in African Americans. You are more likely to have hemoglobin C disease if someone in your family has had it.
Symptoms
Most people do not have symptoms. In some cases,
jaundice
may occur. Some people may develop
gallstones
that need to be treated.
Exams and Tests
A physical exam may show an
enlarged spleen
.
Tests that may be done include:
Complete blood count
Hemoglobin electrophoresis
Peripheral blood smear
Blood hemoglobin
Treatment
In most cases, no treatment is needed. Folic acid supplements may help your body produce normal red blood cells and improve the symptoms of the anemia.
Outlook (Prognosis)
People with hemoglobin C disease can expect to lead a normal life.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Anemia
Gallbladder disease
Enlargement of the spleen
When to Contact a Medical Professional
