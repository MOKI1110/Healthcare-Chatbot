This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.
The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated.
The person may receive:
Blood and urine tests
Breathing support, including a tube through the mouth into the lungs, and a breathing machine (ventilator)
Bronchoscopy -- camera placed down the throat to see burns in the airways and lungs
Chest x-ray
ECG (electrocardiogram or heart tracing)
Endoscopy -- camera placed down the throat to see burns in the food pipe (esophagus) and the stomach
Fluids through a vein (by IV)
Medicines to treat symptoms
Surgery to remove burned skin (debridement)
Washing of the skin (irrigation), perhaps every few hours for several days
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well someone does depends on how much steam iron cleaner they swallowed and how quickly they receive treatment. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery. Steam iron cleaner can cause extensive damage to the:
Esophagus
Eyes
Lungs
Mouth
Nose
Stomach
Throat
Delayed injury may occur, including a hole forming in the throat, esophagus, or stomach. This can lead to severe bleeding and infection. Surgical procedures may be needed to correct these complications.
If the cleaner gets in the eye, ulcers may develop in the cornea, the clear part of the eye. This can cause blindness.
