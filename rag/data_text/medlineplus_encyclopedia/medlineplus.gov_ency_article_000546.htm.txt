Acquired platelet function defects are conditions that prevent clotting elements in the blood called platelets from working as they should. The term acquired means these conditions are not present at birth.
Causes
Platelet disorders can affect the number of platelets, how well they function, or both. A platelet disorder impairs normal blood clotting.
Disorders that can cause a reduced number of platelets or affect platelet function include:
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura
(bleeding disorder in which the immune system destroys platelets)
Chronic myelogenous leukemia
(blood cancer that starts inside bone marrow)
Multiple myeloma
(blood cancer that starts in the plasma cells in the bone marrow)
Primary
myelofibrosis
(bone marrow disorder in which the marrow is replaced by fibrous scar tissue)
Polycythemia vera
(bone marrow disease that leads to an abnormal increase in the number of blood cells)
Primary thrombocythemia
Â (bone marrow disorder in which the marrow produces too many platelets affecting their blood clotting function)
Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura
(blood disorder that causes blood clots to form in small blood vessels)
Other causes include:
Kidney (renal) failure
Medicines such as aspirin, ibuprofen, other anti-inflammatory medicines, penicillin, phenothiazines, and prednisone (after long-term use)
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Heavy menstrual periods or prolonged bleeding (more than 5 days each period)
Abnormal vaginal bleeding
Blood in the urine
Bleeding under the skin
Bruising
easily or pinpoint red spots on the skin
Gastrointestinal bleeding
resulting in
bloody, dark black, or tarry bowel movements
; or
vomiting blood
or material that looks like coffee grounds
Nosebleeds
Exams and Tests
Tests that may be done include:
Partial thromboplastin time
(PTT)
Platelet function analysis
Platelet count
Prothrombin time
(PT)
Treatment
Treatment is aimed at fixing the cause of the problem:
Bone marrow disorders are often treated with platelet transfusions or removing platelets from the blood (platelet pheresis).
Chemotherapy may be used to treat an underlying condition that is causing the problem.
Platelet function defects caused by kidney failure are treated with dialysis or medicines.
Platelet problems caused by a certain medicine are treated by stopping the medicine.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Most of the time, treating the cause of the problem corrects the defect.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Bleeding that does not stop easily
Anemia
(due to excessive bleeding)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if:
You have bleeding and do not know the cause
Your symptoms get worse
Your symptoms do not improve after you are treated for an acquired platelet function defect
Prevention
Using medicines as directed can reduce the risk for drug-related acquired platelet function defects. Treating other disorders may also reduce the risk. Some cases cannot be prevented.
