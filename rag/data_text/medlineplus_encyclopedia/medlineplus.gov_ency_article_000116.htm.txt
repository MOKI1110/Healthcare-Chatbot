Solitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a noncancerousÂ
tumor
of the lining of the lung and chest cavity, an area called the pleura. SFT used to be called localized fibrous mesothelioma.
Causes
The exact cause of SFT remains unknown. This type of tumor affects men and women equally.
Symptoms
About one half of the people with this type of tumor do not show any symptoms.
If the tumor grows to a large size and pushes on the lung, it can lead to symptoms, such as:
Chest pain
Chronic cough
Shortness of breath
Clubbed appearance of the fingers
Exams and Tests
SFT is usually found by accident when a
chest x-ray
is done for other reasons. If your health care provider suspects SFT, additional tests will be ordered. These may include:
CT scan of the chest
Open lung biopsy
Pulmonary function tests
The diagnosis of SFT is difficult compared with the cancerous type of this disease, called
malignant mesothelioma
, which is caused by exposure to asbestos (as cancer needs to be checked for). SFT is not caused by asbestos exposure.
Treatment
SFT is usually treated by removing the tumor.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome is expected to be good with prompt treatment. In rare cases, the tumor may return.
Possible Complications
Fluid escaping into the membranes around the lungs (
pleural effusion
) is a complication.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider for an appointment if you notice symptoms of SFT.
Alternative Names
Mesothelioma - benign; Mesothelioma - fibrous; Pleural fibroma
