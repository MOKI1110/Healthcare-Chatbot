The lymph system is a network of organs, lymph nodes, lymph ducts, and lymph vessels that make and move lymph from tissues to the bloodstream. The lymph system is a major part of the body's immune system.

Information
Lymph is a clear-to-white fluid made of:
White blood cells, especially lymphocytes, the cells that attack bacteria in the blood and body tissues
Fluid from the intestines called chyle, which contains proteins and fats
Lymph nodes are most often soft, small, round- or bean-shaped structures. They usually cannot be seen or easily felt. They are located in clusters in various parts of the body, such as the:
Neck
Armpit
Groin
Inside the center of the chest and abdomen

Lymph nodes
Lymph nodes mainly store immune cells that help the body fight infection but are also places where these cells can be made. They also filter the lymph fluid and remove foreign material such as bacteria and
cancer
cells. When bacteria are recognized in the lymph fluid, the lymph nodes make more infection-fighting white blood cells. This causes the nodes to swell. The
swollen nodes
are sometimes felt in the neck, under the arms, and groin.
The lymph system includes the:
Tonsils
Adenoids
Spleen
Thymus
