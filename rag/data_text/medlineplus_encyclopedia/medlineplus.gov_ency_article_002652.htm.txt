To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Hydrogen peroxide is a liquid commonly used to fight germs. Hydrogen peroxide poisoning occurs when large amounts of the liquid are swallowed or get in the lungs or eyes.
This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.
Poisonous Ingredient
Hydrogen peroxide can be poisonous if it is not used correctly.
Where Found
Hydrogen peroxide is used in these products:
Household hydrogen peroxide
Hair bleach
Some contact lens cleaners
Note: Household hydrogen peroxide has a 3% concentration. That means it contains 97% water and 3% hydrogen peroxide.
Hair bleaches
are stronger. They usually have a concentration of more than 6%. Some industrial-strength solutions contain more than 10% hydrogen peroxide.
Symptoms
Symptoms of a hydrogen peroxide poisoning may differ depending on whether it is swallowed or inhaled. Symptoms may include:
Abdominal pain
and cramping
Airway irritation which may be severe if exposed to industrial (higher than 10%) solutions
Breathing difficulty (if a large amount is swallowed or any is inhaled)
Body aches
Burns in the mouth and throat (if swallowed)
Chest pain
Eye burns (if it gets in the eyes)
Seizures
(rare)
Stomach swelling
Temporary white color to the skin
Vomiting (sometimes with blood)
Home Care
Seek medical help right away. Do not make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to do so. If the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.
Before Calling Emergency
Have this information ready:
Person's age, weight, and condition
Name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known)
Time it was swallowed or got into eyes or on skin
Amount swallowed, in eyes, or on skin
Poison Control
Your localÂ
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.
The provider will measure and monitor the person's
vital signs
, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.
Tests that may done include:
Blood and urine tests
Chest x-ray
Electrocardiogram
(ECG)
Endoscopy -- camera placed down the throat to check for burns in the esophagus and stomach
Treatment may include:
Fluids through a vein (by IV)
Medicines to treat symptoms
Tube down the throat into the stomach (
endoscopy
) to relieve gas pressureÂ
Breathing support, including a tube through the mouth into the lungs and connected to a breathing machine (
ventilator
)
Outlook (Prognosis)
Most contact with household-strength hydrogen peroxide is fairly harmless. Exposure to industrial-strength hydrogen peroxide can be dangerous. EndoscopyÂ may be required to stop internal bleeding.
