Whipple disease

Whipple disease is a rare condition that mainly affects the small intestine. This prevents the small intestine from allowing nutrients to pass into the rest of the body. This is called
malabsorption
.
Causes
Whipple disease is caused by infection with a bacterium called
Tropheryma whipplei
. The disorder mainly affects white men of middle-age.
Whipple disease is rare. Risk factors are not known.
Symptoms
Symptoms most often start slowly. Joint pain is the most common early symptom. Symptoms of gastrointestinal (GI) infection often occur several years later. Other symptoms may include:
Abdominal pain
Diarrhea
Fever
Darkening of skin in light-exposed areas of the body
Joint pain
in the ankles, knees, elbows, fingers, or other areas
Memory loss
Mental changes
Weight loss
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may show:
Enlarged lymph glands
Heart murmur
Swelling in body tissues (
edema
)
Tests to diagnose Whipple disease may include:
Complete blood count (
CBC
)
Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to check for the bacteria that cause the disease
Small bowel
biopsy
Upper GI
endoscopy
Small bowel
enteroscopy
This disease may also change the results of the following tests:
Albumin
levels in the blood
Unabsorbed fat in the stools (
fecal fat
)
Intestinal absorption of a type of sugar (
d-xylose absorption
)
Treatment
People with Whipple disease need to take long-term antibiotics to cure the infection that may include sites in the brain and central nervous system. An antibiotic called ceftriaxone is given through a vein (IV). It is followed by another antibiotic (such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) taken by mouth for up to 1 year.
If symptoms come back during antibiotic use, the medicines may be changed.
Your provider should closely follow your progress. Symptoms of the disease can return after you finish the treatments. People who remain malnourished will also need to take dietary supplements.
Outlook (Prognosis)
If not treated, the condition is most often fatal. Treatment relieves symptoms and can cure the disease.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Brain damage
Heart valve damage (from
endocarditis
)
Nutritional deficiencies
Symptoms return (which may be because of drug resistance)
Weight loss
