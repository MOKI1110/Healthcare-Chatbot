Mononucleosis

Mononucleosis, or mono, is a viral infection that causes fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph glands, most often in the neck.
Causes
Mono is often spread by saliva and close contact. It is known as "the kissing disease." Mono occurs most often or seen in adolescents and young adults, but the infection may develop at any age.
Mono is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Rarely, it is caused by other viruses, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV).
Symptoms
Mono may begin slowly with fatigue, a general ill feeling, headache, and sore throat. The sore throat slowly gets worse. Your tonsils become swollen and develop a whitish-yellow covering. Often, the lymph nodes in the neck are swollen and painful.
A pink, measles-like rash can occur, and is more likely if you take the medicine ampicillin or amoxicillin for a throat infection. (Antibiotics should typically not given without a test that shows you have a strep infection.)
Common symptoms of mono include:
Drowsiness
Fever
General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling
Loss of appetite
Muscle aches
or stiffness
Rash
Sore throat
Swollen lymph nodes
, most often in the neck and armpit
Less common symptoms are:
Chest pain
Cough
Fatigue
Headache
Hives
Jaundice (yellow color to the skin and whites of the eyes)
Neck stiffness
Nosebleed
Rapid heart rate
Sensitivity to light
Shortness of breath
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine you. They may find:
Swollen lymph nodes in the front and back of your neck
Swollen tonsils with a whitish-yellow covering
Swollen liver or spleen
Skin rash
Blood tests will be done, including:
White blood cell (WBC) count -- will be higher than normal if you have mono
Monospot test
Â --Â will be positive for infectious mononucleosis
Antibody titer
Â --Â tells the difference between a current and past infection
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms. Steroid medicine (prednisone) may be given if your symptoms are severe.
Antiviral drugs, such as acyclovir, have little or no benefit.
To relieve typical symptoms:
Drink plenty of fluids.
Gargle with warm salt water to ease a sore throat.
Get plenty of rest.
Take acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain and fever.
Also avoid contact sports if your spleen is swollen (to prevent it from rupturing).
Outlook (Prognosis)
The fever usually drops in 10 days, and swollen lymph glands and spleen heal in 4 weeks. Tiredness usually goes away within a few weeks, but it may linger for 2 to 3 months. Nearly everyone recovers completely.
Possible Complications
Complications of mononucleosis may include:
Anemia, which occurs when red blood cells in the blood die sooner than normal (hemolytic anemia)
Hepatitis
with jaundice (more common in people older than 35)
Swollen or inflamed testicles
Nervous system problems (rare), such as
Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome
, meningitis,
seizures
, damage to the nerve that controls movement of the muscles in the face (
Bell palsy
), and uncoordinated movements
Spleen rupture (rare, avoid pressure on the spleen)
Skin rash
(uncommon)
Death is possible in people who have a weakened immune system.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
The early symptoms of mono feel very much like any other illness caused by a virus. You do not need to contact a provider unless your symptoms last longer than 10 days or you develop:
Abdominal pain
Breathing difficulty
Persistent high fevers (more than 101.5Â°F or 38.6Â°C)
Severe headache
Severe sore throat or swollen tonsils
Weakness in your arms or legs
Yellow color in your eyes or skin
Call 911 or the local emergency number or go to an emergency room if you develop:
Sharp, sudden, severe abdominal pain
Stiff neck or severe weakness
Trouble swallowing or breathing
Prevention
People with mono may be contagious while they have symptoms and for up to a few months afterwards. How long someone with the disease is contagious varies. The virus can live for several hours outside the body. Avoid kissing or sharing utensils if you or someone close to you has mono.
