Sports cream overdose
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Sports creams are creams or ointments used to treat aches and pains. Sports cream overdose can occur if someone uses this product on open skin (such as an open sore or wound), or swallows or gets the product in their eyes. This can be by accident or on purpose.
When used on healthy skin, overdose is not likely. But a person can have an allergic reaction to the cream or ointment.
This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

Poison Control
Your localÂ
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.
The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated. The person may receive:
Activated charcoal
Blood and urine tests
Breathing support, including oxygen and a tube through the mouth into the lungs and breathing machine (ventilator)
Chest x-ray
ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)
Intravenous fluids (through a vein)
Laxative
Medicine to reverse the effects of the poison (antidote) and treat symptoms
Kidney dialysis (machine to remove the poison and reverse its effects, severe cases only)
If the poisoning occurred through skin exposure, the person may receive:
Washing (irrigation) of the skin, perhaps every few hours for several days
Antibiotic ointment (after skin irrigation)
Surgery to remove burned skin (debridement)
If the poisoning occurred through eye exposure, the person may receive:
Irrigation of the eyes
Ointment to treat the eyes
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well a person does depends on the amount of poison in the body and how quickly the treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery. Recovery is likely if the effects can be reversed.
