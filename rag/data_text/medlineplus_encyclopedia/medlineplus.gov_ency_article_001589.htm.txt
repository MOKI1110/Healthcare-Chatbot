Cleidocranial dysostosis

Cleidocranial dysostosis is a disorder involving the abnormal development of bones in the skull and collar (clavicle) area.
Causes
Cleidocranial dysostosis is caused by an abnormal gene. It is passed down through families as an
autosomal dominant
trait. That means you only need to get the abnormal gene from one parent in order for you to inherit the disease.
Cleidocranial dysostosis is a congenital condition, which means it is present from before birth. The condition affects girls and boys equally.
Symptoms
People with cleidocranial dysostosis have a jaw and brow area that sticks out. The middle of their nose (nasal bridge) is wide.
The collar bones may be missing or abnormally developed. This pushes the shoulders together in front of the body.
Primary teeth do not fall out at the expected time. Adult teeth may develop later than normal and an extra set of adult teeth grow in. This causes the teeth to become crooked.
Intelligence level is most often normal.
Other symptoms include:
Ability to touch shoulders together in front of body
Delayed closure of fontanelles ("soft spots")
Loose joints
Prominent forehead (
frontal bossing
)
Short forearms
Short fingers
Short stature
Increased risk of getting flat foot, abnormal curvature of spine (scoliosis) and knee deformities
High risk of hearing loss due to infections
Increased risk of fracture due to decreased bone density
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will take your family history. The provider will do a physical examination and may do series of x-rays to check for:
Undergrowth of the collarbone
Undergrowth of the shoulder blade
Failure of the area in the front of the pelvis bone to close
Treatment
There is no specific treatment for it and management depends on each person's symptoms. Most people with the disease need:
Regular dental care
Head gear to protect skull bones until they close
Ear tubes for frequent ear infections
Surgery to correct any bone abnormalities

Outlook (Prognosis)
In most cases, the bone symptoms cause few problems. Appropriate dental care is important.
Possible Complications
Complications include dental problems and shoulder dislocations.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have a:
Family history of cleidocranial dysostosis and are planning to have a child.
Child with similar symptoms.
Prevention
Genetic counseling is appropriate if a person with a family or personal history of cleidocranial dysostosis is planning to have children. The disease may be diagnosed during pregnancy.
