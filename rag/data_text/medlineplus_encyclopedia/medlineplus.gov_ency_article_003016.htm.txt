A mastoidectomy is surgery to remove cells in the hollow, air-filled spaces in the skull behind the ear within the mastoid bone. These spaces are called mastoid air cells.
Description
This surgery used to be a common way to treat an infection in mastoid air cells. In most cases, the condition was caused by an ear infection that spread to the bone in the skull. This surgery is not often performed now.
You will receive general anesthesia, so you will be asleep and pain free. The surgeon will make a cut behind the ear. A bone drill will be used to gain access to the middle ear cavity that is behind the mastoid bone in the skull. The infected parts of the mastoid bone or ear tissue will be removed and the cut is stitched and covered with a bandage. The surgeon may put a drain behind the ear to prevent fluid from collecting around the incision. The operation will take 2 to 3 hours.
Why the Procedure is Performed
Mastoidectomy may be used to treat:
Cholesteatoma
Complications of an ear infection (
otitis media
)
Infections of the mastoid bone that do not get better with antibiotics
To place a
cochlear implant
Risks
Risks may include:
Changes in taste
Dizziness
Hearing loss
Infection that persists or keeps returning
Noises in the ear (

)

Before the Procedure
Tell your surgeon or nurse if:
You are or could be pregnant
You are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription
You have been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 or 2 drinks a day
Planning for your surgery:
If you have
diabetes
,
heart disease
, or other medical conditions, your surgeon may ask you to see your health care provider who treats you for these conditions.
If you smoke, itâs important to cut back or quit.
Smoking can slow healing and increase the risk for blood clots
. Ask your provider for help
quitting smoking
.
If needed,
prepare your home
to make it easier to recover after surgery.
Ask your surgeon if you need to arrange to have someone drive you home after your surgery.
During the week before your surgery:
You may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.
Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.
Let your surgeon know about any illness you may have before your surgery. This includes
COVID-19
, a
cold
,
flu
, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness. If you do get sick, your surgery may need to be postponed.
On the day of surgery:
Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.
Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.
Follow instructions on when to arrive at the hospital. Be sure to arrive on time.
After the Procedure
You will have stitches behind your ear and there may be a small rubber drain. You may also have a large dressing over the operated ear. The dressing is removed the day after surgery. You may need to stay in the hospital overnight. Your provider will give you pain medicines and antibiotics to prevent infection.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Mastoidectomy successfully gets rid of the infection in the mastoid bone in most people.
