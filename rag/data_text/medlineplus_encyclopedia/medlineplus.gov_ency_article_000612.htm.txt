Meningitis
is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. This covering is called the meninges.
Bacteria are one type of germ that can cause meningitis.
Haemophilus influenzae
type b is one kind of bacteria that causes meningitis.
Causes
H influenzae
meningitis is caused by
Haemophilus influenzae
type b bacteria. This illness is not the same as the flu (
influenza
), which is caused by a virus.
Before the Hib vaccine,
H influenzae
was the leading cause of bacterial meningitis in children under age 5. Since the vaccine became available in the United States, this type of meningitis occurs much less often in children in the United States.
H influenzae
meningitis may occur after an upper respiratory infection. The infection usually spreads from the lungs and airways to the blood, then to the brain area.
Risk factors include:
Attending day care
Cancer
Ear infection (
otitis media
) with
H influenzae
infection
Family member with an
H influenzae
infection
Native American race
Pregnancy
Older age
Sinus infection (
sinusitis
)
Sore throat (
pharyngitis
)
Upper respiratory infection
Weakened immune system
Symptoms
Symptoms usually come on quickly, and may include:
Fever
and
chills
Mental status changes
Nausea and vomiting
Sensitivity to light (
photophobia
)
Severe
headache
Stiff neck (meningismus)
Other symptoms that can occur include:
Agitation
Bulging fontanelles
in infants
Decreased consciousness
Poor feeding and irritability in children
Rapid breathing
Unusual posture, with the head and neck arched backwards (
opisthotonos
)
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. Questions will focus on symptoms and possible exposure to someone who might have the same symptoms, such as a stiff neck and fever.
If your provider thinks meningitis is possible, a lumbar puncture (
spinal tap
) is done to take a sample of spinal fluid for testing.
Other tests that may be done include:
Blood culture
Chest x-ray
CT scan of the head
Complete blood count
(CBC)
Gram stain
or other special stains, and
culture of the spinal fluid
Treatment
Antibiotics will be given as soon as possible. Ceftriaxone is one of the most commonly used antibiotics. Ampicillin may sometimes be used.
Corticosteroids may be used to fight inflammation.
Unvaccinated people who are in close contact with someone who has
H influenzae
meningitis should be given antibiotics to prevent infection. Such people include:
Household members
Roommates in dormitories
Those who come into close contact with an infected person
Outlook (Prognosis)
Meningitis is a dangerous infection and it can be deadly. The sooner it is treated, the better the chance for recovery. Young children and adults over age 50 have the highest risk for death.
Possible Complications
Long-term complications may include:
Brain damage
Buildup of fluid between the skull and brain (
subdural effusion
)
Buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling (
hydrocephalus
)
Hearing loss
Seizures
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Call 911 or the local emergency number or go to an emergency room if you suspect meningitis in a young child who has the following symptoms:
Feeding problems
High-pitched cry
Irritability
Persistent, unexplained fever
Meningitis can quickly become a life-threatening illness.
Prevention
Infants and young children can be protected with the
Hib vaccine
.
Close contacts in the same household, school, or day care center should be watched for early signs of the disease as soon as the first person is diagnosed. All unvaccinated family members and close contacts of this person should begin antibiotic treatment as soon as possible to prevent the spread of the infection. Ask your provider about antibiotics during the first visit.
Always use good hygiene habits, such as washing hands before and after changing a diaper, and after using the bathroom.
