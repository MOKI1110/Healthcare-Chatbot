Lomotil is a prescription medicine used to treat diarrhea. Lomotil overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine.Â This can be by accident or on purpose.
This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual
overdose
. If you or someone you are with has an overdose, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.
Poisonous Ingredient
Lomotil contains two medicines that can be harmful in large amounts. They are:
Atropine
Diphenoxylate (an opioid)
Where Found
Medicines with these names contain atropine and diphenoxylate:
Lofene
Logen
Lomanate
Lomotil
Lonox
Other medicines may also contain atropine and diphenoxylate.

Note: Symptoms may take up to 12 hours to appear.
Home Care

Before Calling Emergency
Have this information ready:
Person's age, weight, and condition
Name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known)
Time it was swallowed
Amount swallowed
If the medicine was prescribed for the person
Poison Control
Your local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotlineÂ (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the container to the hospital with you, if possible.
The provider will measure and monitor the person's
vital signs
, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated.
Tests that may be done include:
Blood and urine tests
Chest x-ray
Electrocardiogram
(ECG)
Treatment may include:Â
Fluids through a vein (by IV)
Laxative
Activated charcoal
Medicine to reverse the effect of atropine
Medicine to reverse the effect of the diphenoxylate
Breathing support, including tube through the mouth and connected to a breathing machine (
ventilator
)
Some people may need to stay in the hospital to be monitored.
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well someone does depends on how much medicine was swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.
A hospital stay may be needed for more doses of the medicines that reverse the effects of the drug. Complications, such as pneumonia, muscle damage from lying on a hard surface for a prolonged period of time, or brain damage from lack of oxygen may result in permanent disability. However, unless there are complications, long-term effects and death are rare.
People who quickly receive medicine to reverse the effect of the opioid usually get better within 24 to 48 hours. However, children do not do as well.
