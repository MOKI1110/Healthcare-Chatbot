Poison Control
Your local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive:
Breathing support, including oxygen, a tube through the mouth into the lungs, and a breathing machine (ventilator).
Endoscopy -- camera down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus (swallowing tube) and the stomach.
Fluids through a vein (by IV).
Kidney dialysis (machine to remove poison and correct acid-base balance).
Medicine (antidote) to reverse the effect of the poison and treat symptoms.
Tube through the mouth into the stomach to aspirate (suck out) the stomach. This is done only when the person gets medical care within 30 to 45 minutes of the poisoning, and a very large amount of the substance has been swallowed.
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well the person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster the person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.
Methanol is the most dangerous and poisonous substance thatÂ can beÂ an ingredientÂ in ink remover. It often causes permanent blindness.
