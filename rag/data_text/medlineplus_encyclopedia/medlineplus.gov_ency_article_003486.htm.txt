Calcium - ionized

Ionized calcium is calcium in your blood that is not attached to proteins. It is also called free calcium.
All cells need calcium in order to work. Calcium helps build strong bones and teeth. It is important for heart function. It also helps with muscle contraction, nerve signaling, and blood clotting.
This article discusses the test used to measure the amount of ionized calcium in blood.
How the Test is Performed
A blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is
drawn from a vein
located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.
How to Prepare for the Test
Many medicines can interfere with blood test results.
Your health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test.
DO NOT stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.
Why the Test is Performed
Your provider may order this test if you have signs of bone, kidney, liver or parathyroid disease. The test may also be done to monitor progress and treatment of these diseases.
Most of the time, blood tests measure your total calcium level. This looks at both ionized calcium and calcium attached to proteins. You may need to have a separate ionized calcium test if you have factors that increase or decrease total calcium levels. These may include abnormal blood levels of albumin or immunoglobulins.
Normal Results
Results generally fall in these ranges:
Children: 4.8 to 5.3 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 1.20 to 1.32 millimoles per liter (millimol/L)
Adults: 4.8 to 5.6 mg/dL or 1.20 to 1.40 millimol/L
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Higher-than-normal levels of ionized calcium may be due to:
Decreased levels of calcium in the urine from an unknown cause (also called hypocalciuria)
Hyperparathyroidism
Hyperthyroidism
Milk-alkali syndrome
Multiple myeloma
Paget disease
Sarcoidosis
Thiazide diuretics
Thrombocytosis (high platelet count)
Tumors
Vitamin A excess
Vitamin D
excess
Lower-than-normal levels may be due to (or caused by):
Hypoparathyroidism
Malabsorption
Osteomalacia
Pancreatitis
Renal failure
Rickets
Vitamin D deficiency
Alternative Names
Free calcium; Ionized calcium
