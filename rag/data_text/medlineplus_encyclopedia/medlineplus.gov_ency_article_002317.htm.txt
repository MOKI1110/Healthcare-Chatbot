The cervix is the lower end of the womb (uterus). It is at the top of the
vagina
. It is about 2.5 to 3.5 centimeters (1 to 1.3 inches) long. The cervical canal passes through the cervix. It allows blood from a menstrual period and a baby (fetus) to pass from the womb into the vagina. Sperm travel from the vagina up the cervical canal into the uterine cavity, then into the fallopian tubes to fertilize the egg.
Conditions that affect the cervix include:
Cervical cancer
Cervical infection
Cervical inflammation
Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia
(CIN) or dysplasia
Cervical polyps
Cervical pregnancy
Cervical incompetence in pregnancy
Cervical cancer screening involves a
Pap smear
and an
HPV test
. For both these tests, the cells are taken from the cervix. A Pap test checks for premalignant (precancerous) changes in the cervix, and the HPV test checks for infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) that may lead to cervical cancer.
