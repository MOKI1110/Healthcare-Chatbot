A gum
biopsy
is a surgery in which a small piece of gingival (gum) tissue is removed and examined.
How the Test is Performed
A painkiller is sprayed into the mouth in the area of the abnormal gum tissue. You may also have an injection of numbing medicine. A small piece of gum tissue is removed and checked for problems in the lab. Sometimes stitches are used to close the opening created for the biopsy.
How to Prepare for the Test
You may be told not to eat for a few hours before the biopsy.
How the Test will Feel
The painkiller put in your mouth should numb the area during the procedure. You may feel some tugging or pressure. If there is bleeding, the blood vessels may be sealed off with an electric current or laser. This is called
electrocauterization
. After the numbness wears off, the area may be sore for a few days.
Why the Test is Performed
This test is done to look for the cause of abnormal gum tissue.
Normal Results
This test is only done when gum tissue looks abnormal.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Abnormal results may indicate:
Amyloidosis
Noncancerous
mouth sores
(the specific cause can be determined in many cases)
Oral cancer
(for example,
squamous cell carcinoma
)
Risks
Risks for this procedure include:
Bleeding from the biopsy site
Infection of the gums
Soreness
Considerations
Avoid brushing the area where the biopsy was performed for 1 week. You may be given a mouthwash to keep the area clean for a week after the procedure.
Alternative Names
