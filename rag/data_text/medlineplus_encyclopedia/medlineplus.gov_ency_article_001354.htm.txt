Scrofula is a
tuberculosis
infection of the lymph nodes in the neck.
Causes
Scrofula is most often caused by the bacteria
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
. There are other types of mycobacterium bacteria that may cause scrofula.
Scrofula is usually caused by breathing in air that is contaminated with mycobacterium bacteria. The bacteria then travel from the lungs to lymph nodes in the neck.
Symptoms
Symptoms of scrofula are:
Fever (rare)
Painless
swelling of lymph nodes
in the neck and other areas of the body
Sores (rare)
Sweating
Exams and Tests
Tests to diagnose scrofula include:
Biopsy
of affected tissue
Chest x-rays
CT scan
of the neck
Cultures
to check for the bacteria in tissue samples taken from the lymph nodes
HIV blood test (if positive, treatment would be modified)
Interferon-gamma release blood test, such as the QFT-Gold test to check for TB infection (active or infection in the past)
PPD test
(also called TB test)
Treatment
When infection is caused by
Mycobacterium tuberculosis
, treatment usually involves 9 to 12 months of antibiotics. Several antibiotics need to be used at once. Common antibiotics for scrofula include:
Ethambutol
Isoniazid (INH)
Pyrazinamide
Rifampin
When infection is caused by another type of mycobacteria (which often occurs in children), treatment usually involves antibiotics such as:
Rifampin
Ethambutol
Clarithromycin
Surgery is sometimes used first. It may also be done if the medicines are not working.
Outlook (Prognosis)
With treatment, people often make a complete recovery.
Possible Complications
These complications may occur from this infection:
Draining sore in the neck
Scarring
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you or your child has a swelling or group of swellings in the neck. Scrofula can occur in children who have not been exposed to someone with tuberculosis.
Prevention
People who have been exposed to someone with tuberculosis of the lungs should have a PPD test.
Alternative Names
