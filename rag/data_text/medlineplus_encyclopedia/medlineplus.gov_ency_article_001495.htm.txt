Cervicitis

Cervicitis is swelling or inflamed tissue of the end of the uterus (
cervix
).
Causes
Cervicitis is most often caused by an infection that is caught during sexual activity. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) that can cause cervicitis include:
Chlamydia
Gonorrhea
Herpes simplex virus (
genital herpes
)
Human papilloma virus (
genital warts
)
Trichomoniasis
Other things that can cause cervicitis include:
A device inserted into the pelvic area such as a cervical cap, diaphragm, IUD, or pessary
Allergy to spermicides used for birth control
Allergy to latex in condoms
Exposure to a chemical
Reaction to douches or vaginal deodorants
Cervicitis is very common. It affects more than one half of all women at some point during their adult life. Causes include:
High-risk sexual behavior
History of STIs
Many sexual partners
Sexual intercourse at an early age
Sexual partners who have engaged in high-risk sexual behavior or have had an STI
Too much growth of some bacteria that normally are present in the vagina (
bacterial vaginosis
) can also lead to cervical infection.
Symptoms
There may be no symptoms. If symptoms are present, these may include:
Abnormal vaginal bleeding
that occurs after intercourse, or between periods
Unusual
vaginal discharge
that does not go away: discharge may be gray, white or yellow in color
Painful sexual intercourse
Pain in the vagina
Pressure or heaviness in the pelvis
Painful urination
Vaginal itching
Women who may be at risk for chlamydia should be tested for this infection, even if they do not have symptoms.
Exams and Tests
A pelvic exam is done to look for:
Discharge from the cervix
Redness of the cervix
Swelling (inflammation) of the walls of the vagina
Tests that may be done include:
Inspection
of the discharge under a microscope (may show
candidiasis
,
trichomoniasis
, or bacterial vaginosis)
Pap test
Tests for gonorrhea and chlamydia
Rarely,
colposcopy and biopsy of the cervix
is necessary.
Treatment
Antibiotics are used to treat chlamydia or gonorrhea. Medicines called antivirals may be used to treat herpes simplex virus infections.
Hormonal therapy (with estrogen or progesterone) may be used in women who have reached menopause.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Most of the time, simple cervicitis usually heals with treatment if the cause is found and there is a treatment for that cause.
Often, cervicitis does not cause any symptoms. It doesn't need treatment as long as tests for bacterial and viral causes are negative.
Possible Complications
Cervicitis may last for months to years. Cervicitis may lead to pain with intercourse.
Untreated cervicitis may lead to inflammation involving the female pelvic organs, causing a condition called
pelvic inflammatory disease (PID)
.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you have symptoms of cervicitis.
Prevention
Things you can do to reduce your risk of developing cervicitis include:
Avoid
irritants
such as douches and deodorant tampons.
Make sure that any foreign objects you insert into your vagina (such as tampons) are properly placed. Be sure to follow instructions on how long to leave it inside, how often to change it, or how often to clean it.
Make sure your partner is free of any STI. You and your partner should not have sex with any other people.
Use a
condom
every time you have sex to lower your risk of getting an STI. Condoms are available for both men and women, but are most commonly worn by the man. A condom must be used properly every time.
