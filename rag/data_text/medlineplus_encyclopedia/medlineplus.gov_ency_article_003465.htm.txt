Lipase is a protein (
enzyme
) released by the pancreas into the small intestine. It helps the body absorb fat. This test is used to measure the amount of lipase in the blood.
How the Test is Performed
A sample of
blood will be taken from a vein
.
How to Prepare for the Test
Do not eat for 8 hours before the test.
Your health care provider may ask you to stop taking medicines that may affect the test, such as:
Birth control pills
Cholinergic medicines
Indomethacin
Opiates (codeine, meperidine, and morphine)
Thiazide diuretics
How the Test will Feel
You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted to draw blood. There may be some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn. Veins and arteries vary in size, so it may be harder to take a blood sample from one person than another.
Why the Test is Performed
This test is done to check for disease of the pancreas, most often
acute pancreatitis
.
Lipase appears in excessive amounts in the blood when the pancreas is damaged.
Normal Results
In general, normal results are 0 to 160 units per liter (U/L) or 0 to 2.67 microkat/L (Âµkat/L).
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurement methods. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Higher-than-normal levels may be due to:
Blockage of the bowel
(bowel obstruction)
Celiac disease
Cancer of the pancreas
Pancreatitis
Pancreatic or bile duct blockage
Pancreatic pseudocyst
Perforated ulcer
Renal failure
Salivary gland inflammation
This test may also be done for
familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency
.
Risks
There is very little risk from your blood taken.
Other uncommon risks may include:
Excessive bleeding
Fainting or feeling lightheaded
Hematoma
(blood accumulating under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
Alternative Names
Pancreatitis - blood lipase
