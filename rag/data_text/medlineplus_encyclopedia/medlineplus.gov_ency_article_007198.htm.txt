Rapid shallow breathing
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
A normal breathing rate for an adult at rest is 12 to 20 breaths per minute. For an infant, a normal rate is 30 to 60 breaths per minute.
Tachypnea is the term that your health care provider uses to describe your breathing if it is too fast, especially if you have fast, shallow breathing from a lung disease or other medical cause.
The term
hyperventilation
is usually used if you are taking rapid, deep breaths. This can be due to lung disease or because of anxiety or panic. The terms are sometimes used interchangeably.
Causes
Shallow, rapid breathing has many possible medical causes, including:
Asthma
Blood clot
in an artery in the lung
Choking
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) and other chronic lung diseases
Heart failure
Infection in the smallest air passages of the lungs in children (
bronchiolitis
)
Pneumonia
or other lung infection
Transient tachypnea
of the newborn
Anxiety
and panic
Other serious lung disease, such as interstitial lung disease or
bronchiectasis
Diabetic ketoacidosis or other causes of acid buildup in the body are often associated with rapid, very deep breaths
Home Care
Rapid, shallow breathing should not be treated at home. It is generally considered a medical emergency (unless anxiety is the only cause).
If you have asthma or COPD, use your inhaler or nebulizer medicines as prescribed by your provider. You may still need to be checked by a provider right away if you have rapid shallow breathing. Your provider will explain when it is important to go to the emergency room.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Call 911 or the local emergency number, or go to the emergency room if you are breathing rapidly and you have:
Bluish or grayish color to the skin, nails, gums, lips, or the area around the eyes (
cyanosis
)
Chest pain
Chest wall is pulling in with each breath (
intercostal retractions
)
Fever
Labored or difficult breathing
Never had rapid breathing before
Symptoms that are getting more severe
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will do a thorough exam of your heart, lungs, abdomen, and head and neck.
Tests that may be ordered include:
Arterial blood gas
and pulse oximetry to check your oxygen level
Chest x-ray
Chest CT scan
Complete blood count
(CBC) and blood chemistries
Electrocardiogram
(ECG)
Ventilation/perfusion scan of your lungs
Comprehensive metabolic panel
to check the body's chemical balance and metabolism
Treatment will depend on the underlying cause of the rapid breathing. Treatment may include oxygen if your oxygen level is too low. If you are having an asthma or a COPD attack, you'll receive treatment to stop the attack.
Many times, this evaluation will need to be done in an emergency room setting.
