SVC obstruction
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
SVC obstruction is a narrowing or blockage of the superior vena cava (SVC), which is the second largest vein in the human body. The superior vena cava moves blood from the upper parts of the body to the heart.
Causes
SVC obstruction is a rare condition.
It is most often caused by
cancer
or a
tumor
in the mediastinum (the area of the chest under the breastbone and between the lungs).
Types of cancer that can lead to this condition include:
Breast cancer
Lung cancer
Lymphoma
Metastatic cancer to the lung
(cancer that has spread to the lungs)
Testicular cancer
Thyroid cancer
Thymus tumor
SVC obstruction can also be caused by noncancerous conditions that cause scarring near the SVC. These conditions include:
Histoplasmosis
(a type of fungal infection)
Inflammation of a vein (
thrombophlebitis
)
Lung infections (such as
tuberculosis
)
Other causes of SVC obstruction include:
Widening of the artery that leaves the heart (
aortic aneurysm
)
Blood clots in the SVC
Tightening of the thin lining of the heart (
constrictive pericarditis
)
Effects of radiation therapy for certain medical conditions
Enlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter)
Catheters placed in the large veins of the upper arm and neck may cause blood clots in the SVC.
Symptoms
Symptoms occur when something blocks the blood flowing back to the heart. Symptoms may begin suddenly or gradually, and may worsen when you bend over or lie down.
Early signs include:
Swelling around the eyes
Swelling of the face
Swelling of the whites of the eyes
Distended veins in the neck
The swelling may be worse or more prominent when lying down than when upright. It may be worse in the early morning hours and may go away by mid-morning.
The most common symptoms are
shortness of breath
(dyspnea) and swelling of the face, neck, trunk, and arms.
Other possible symptoms include:
Decreased alertness
Dizziness
, fainting
Headache
Reddish face or cheeks
Reddish palms
Reddish mucous membranes (inside the nose, mouth, and other places)
Redness changing to blueness later
Sensation of head or ear fullness
Vision changes
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam, which may show enlarged veins of the face, neck, and upper chest. Blood pressure is often high in the arms and low in the legs.
If lung cancer is suspected, a
bronchoscopy
may be done. During this procedure, a camera is used to view inside the airways and lungs.
Blockage of the SVC may be visible on:
Chest x-ray
CT scan of the chest
or
MRI of chest
Coronary angiography
(a heart blood vessel study)
Doppler ultrasound
(sound wave test of the blood vessels)
Radionuclide ventriculography
(nuclear study of heart motion)
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to relieve the blockage.
Diuretics (water pills) or steroids (anti-inflammatory medicines) may be used to temporarily relieve
swelling
.
Other treatment options may include
radiation therapy
or
chemotherapy
to shrink the tumor, or surgery to remove the tumors. Surgery to bypass the obstruction is rarely performed. Placement of a
stent
(tube placed inside a blood vessel) to open up the SVC may be performed.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome varies, depending on the cause and the amount of blockage.
SVC obstruction caused by a tumor is a sign that the tumor has spread, and it indicates a poorer long-term outlook.
Possible Complications
The throat could become blocked, which can block the airways.
Increased pressure may develop in the brain, leading to changed levels of consciousness, nausea, vomiting, or vision changes.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of SVC obstruction. Complications are serious and can sometimes be fatal.
Prevention
Prompt treatment of other medical disorders may reduce the risk of developing SVC obstruction.
