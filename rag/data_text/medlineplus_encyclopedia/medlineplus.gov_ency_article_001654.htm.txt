Aarskog syndrome is a very rare disease that affects a person's height, muscles, skeleton, genitals, and appearance. It can be passed down through families (inherited).
Causes
Aarskog syndrome is a genetic disorder that is linked to the X chromosome. It affects mainly males, but females may have a milder form. The condition is caused by changes (mutations) in a gene called "faciogenital dysplasia" (
FGD1
).
Symptoms
Symptoms of this condition include:
Belly button that sticks out
Bulge in the groin or scrotum
Delayed sexual maturity
Delayed teeth
Downward
palpebral slant
to eyes (palpebral slant is the direction of the slant from the inner to outer corner of the eye)
Hairline with a "widow's peak"
Mildly sunken chest (pectus excavatum)
Mild to moderate cognitive problems
Mild to moderate
short height
, which may not be obvious until the child is 1 to 3 years old
Poorly developed middle section of the face
Rounded face
Scrotum surrounds the penis (shawl scrotum)
Short fingers and toes with mild
webbing
Single crease in the palm of the hand
Small, broad hands and feet with short fingers and curved-in fifth finger
Small nose with nostrils tipped forward
Testicles that have not come down (
undescended
)
Top portion of the ear folded over slightly
Wide groove above the upper lip, crease below the lower lip
Wide-set eyes with droopy eyelids
Exams and Tests
These tests may be done:
Genetic testing for mutations in the
FGD1
gene
X-rays
Treatment
Moving the teeth may be done to treat some of the abnormal dental features a person with Aarskog syndrome may have.
Support Groups

Outlook (Prognosis)
Some people may have some mental slowness, but children with this condition often have good social skills. Some males may have problems with fertility.
Possible Complications
These complications can occur:
Changes in the brain
Difficulty growing in the first year of life
Poorly aligned teeth
Seizures
Undescended testicles
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if your child has delayed growth or if you notice any symptoms of Aarskog syndrome. Seek genetic counseling if you have a family history of Aarskog syndrome. Contact a genetic specialist if your provider thinks you or your child may have Aarskog syndrome.
Prevention
Genetic testing may be available for people with a family history of the condition or a known mutation of the gene that causes it.
