To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Indigestion (dyspepsia) is a mild discomfort in the upper belly or abdomen. It often occurs during or right after eating. It may feel like:
Heat, burning, or pain in the area between the navel and the lower part of the breastbone
Unpleasant fullness that starts soon after a meal begins or when the meal is over
Bloating
and
nausea
are less common symptoms.
Indigestion is NOT the same as
heartburn
.
Causes
Most of the time, indigestion is not a sign of a serious health problem unless it occurs with other symptoms. These may include:
Bleeding
Trouble swallowing
Weight loss
Recurrent nausea and vomiting
Rarely, the discomfort of a heart attack is mistaken for indigestion.
Indigestion may be triggered by:
Drinking too many caffeinated beverages
Drinking too much alcohol
Eating spicy, fatty, or greasy foods
Eating too much (overeating)
Eating too fast
Eating high-fiber foods
Smoking or chewing tobacco
Stress or being nervous
Other causes of indigestion are:
Gallstones
Gastritis
(when the lining of the stomach becomes inflamed or swollen)
Esophagitis (inflamed esophagus)
Swelling of the pancreas (pancreatitis)
Ulcers
(stomach or intestinal ulcer)
Use of certain medicines such as antibiotics, aspirin, andÂ nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugsÂ (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen or naproxen)
Home Care
Changing the way you eat may help your symptoms. Steps you can take include:
Allow enough time for meals.
Avoid arguments during meals.
Avoid excitement or exercise right after a meal.
Chew food carefully and completely.
Relax and get rest if indigestion is caused by stress.
Avoid aspirin and other NSAIDs. If you must take them, do so on a full stomach.
Avoid alcohol and smoking.
Antacids may relieve indigestion.
Medicines you can buy without a prescription, such as famotidine (Zantac 360 or Pepcid AC) and omeprazole (Prilosec OTC) can relieve symptoms. There are other choices as well. In addition, your health care provider may also prescribe these or similar medicines in higher doses or for longer periods of time.
