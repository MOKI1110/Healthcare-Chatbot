Pulmonary arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal connection between an artery and vein in the lungs. As a result, blood passes through the lungs without receiving enough oxygen.
Causes
Pulmonary arteriovenous fistulas are usually the result of abnormal development of the blood vessels of the lung. Most occur in people with
hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)
. These people often have abnormal blood vessels in many other parts of the body.
Fistulas also can be a complication of liver disease or lung injury, although these causes are much less common.
Symptoms
Many people have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include:
Bloody sputum
Difficulty breathing
Difficulty exercising
Nosebleeds
Shortness of breath with exertion
Chest pain
Â
Blue skin (
cyanosis
)
Clubbing
of the fingers
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine you. The exam may show:
Abnormal blood vessels (
telangiectasias
) on the skin or mucous membranes
Abnormal sound, called a bruit when a stethoscope is placed over the abnormal blood vessel
Low blood oxygen when measured with a pulse oximeter
Tests that may be done include:
Arterial blood gas
, with and without oxygen (usually oxygen treatment does not improve the arterial blood gas as much as expected)
Complete blood count
(CBC)
Chest x-ray
Chest CT scan
Echocardiogram
with bubble study to check the function of the heart and assess for presence of a shunt
Lung function tests
Perfusion radionuclide lung scan
to measure breathing and circulation (perfusion) in all areas of the lungs
Pulmonary arteriogram
to view the lung arteries
Treatment
A small number of people who have no symptoms may not need treatment. For most people with fistulas, the treatment of choice is to block the fistula during an
arteriogram
(embolization).
Some people may need surgery to remove the abnormal vessels and nearby lung tissue.
When arteriovenous fistulas are caused by liver disease, the treatment is a
liver transplant
.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outlook for people with HHT is not as good as for those without HHT. For people without HHT, surgery to remove the abnormal vessels usually has a good outcome, and the condition is not likely to return.
For people with liver disease as a cause, the prognosis depends on the liver disease.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Bleeding in the lung
Stroke
due to blood clot that travels from the lungs to the arms, legs, or brain (paradoxical venous embolism)
Infection in the brain or heart valve, especially in people with HHT
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you often have nosebleeds or difficulty breathing, especially if you also have a personal or familyÂ history of HHT.
Prevention
Because HHT is often genetic, prevention is not usually possible.
Genetic counseling
Â may help in some cases.
