CSF cell count

A CSF cell count is a test to measure the number of red and white blood cells that are in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a clear fluid that is in the space around the spinal cord and brain.
How the Test is Performed
A sample of CSF is needed [1 to 5 milliliters (ml)]. A
lumbar puncture
(spinal tap) is the most common way to collect this sample. Rarely, other methods are used for collecting CSF such as:
Cisternal puncture
Ventricular puncture
Removal of CSF from a tube that is already in the CSF, such as a shunt or ventricular drain
After the sample is taken, it is sent to a lab for evaluation.
Why the Test is Performed
The CSF cell count may help detect:
Meningitis
and infection of the brain or spinal cord
Tumor
,
abscess
, or area of tissue death (infarct)
Inflammation
Bleeding into the spinal fluid (secondary to
subarachnoid hemorrhage
)
Normal Results
The normal white blood cell count is from 0 to 5. The normal red blood cell count is 0.
Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens.
What Abnormal Results Mean
An increase of white blood cells indicates infection, inflammation, or bleeding into the cerebrospinal fluid. Some causes include:
Abscess
Encephalitis
Hemorrhage
Meningitis
Multiple sclerosis
Other infections
Tumor
Neurosarcoidosis
Finding red blood cells in the CSF may be a sign of bleeding. However, red blood cells in the CSF may also be due to the spinal tap needle hitting a blood vessel.
Additional conditions which this test may help diagnose include:
Arteriovenous malformation (cerebral)
Cerebral aneurysm
Delirium
Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome
Stroke
Neurosyphilis
Primary lymphoma of the brain
Seizure disorders, including
epilepsy
Spinal tumor
Lyme disease
