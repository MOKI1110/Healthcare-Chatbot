Tuberous sclerosis

Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic disorder that affects the skin, brain/nervous system, kidneys, heart, and lungs. The condition can also cause tumors to grow in the brain. These tumors have a tuber or root-shaped appearance.
Causes
Tuberous sclerosis is a genetic condition. Changes (non-working gene variants or mutations) in one of two genes,
TSC1
and
TSC2
, are responsible for most cases.
Only one parent needs to pass on the non-working gene for the child to get the disease. However, two-thirds of cases are due to new gene changes. In most cases, there is no family history of tuberous sclerosis.
This condition is one of a group of diseases called neurocutaneous syndromes. Both the skin and
central nervous system
(brain and spinal cord) are involved.
There are no known risk factors, other than having a parent with tuberous sclerosis. In that case, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease.
Symptoms
Skin symptoms include:
Areas of the skin that are white (due to decreased pigment) and have either an ash leaf or confetti appearance
Red patches on the face containing many blood vessels (facial angiofibromas)
Raised patches of skin with an orange-peel texture (shagreen spots), often on the back
Brain symptoms include:
Autism
spectrum disorders
Developmental delays
Intellectual disability
Seizures
Other symptoms include:
Pitted tooth enamel.
Rough growths under or around the fingernails and toenails.
Rubbery noncancerous tumors on or around the tongue.
Lung disease known as LAM (lymphangioleiomyomatosis). This is more common in women. In many cases, there are no symptoms. In other people, this can lead to shortness of breath, coughing blood, and lung collapse.
A benign cardiac tumor known as a cardiac rhabdomyoma. This is common in children with tuberous sclerosis and can be seen on ultrasound before a baby is born.
The symptoms vary from person to person. Some people have normal intelligence and no seizures. Others have intellectual disabilities or difficult-to-control seizures.
Exams and Tests
Signs may include:
Abnormal heart rhythm (
arrhythmia
)
Calcium deposits in the brain
Noncancerous tumors in the brain
Rubbery growths on the tongue or gums
Tumor-like growth (hamartoma) on the retina, pale patches in the eye
Tumors
in the kidneys
Tests may include:
CT scan of the head
Chest CT
Echocardiogram
(ultrasound of the heart)
MRI of the head
Ultrasound of the kidney
Ultraviolet light examination of the skin
DNA testing for the two genes that can cause this disease (
TSC1
or
TSC2
) is available.
Regular ultrasound checks of the kidneys are important to make sure there is no tumor growth.
Treatment
There is no known cure for tuberous sclerosis. Because the disease can differ from person to person, treatment is based on the symptoms.
Depending on the severity of the intellectual disability, the child may need special education.
Some seizures are controlled with medicine (vigabatrin is first line for infantile spasms). Other children may need surgery.
Small growths on the face (facial angiofibromas) may be removed by laser treatment. These growths tend to come back, and repeat treatments will be needed.
Cardiac rhabdomyomas commonly disappear after puberty. Surgery to remove them is usually not needed.
Brain tumors can be treated with medicines called mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus, everolimus).
Kidney tumors are treated with surgery, or by reducing the blood supply using special x-ray techniques. mTOR inhibitors are being studied as another treatment for kidney tumors.
Support Groups
More information and support for people with tuberous sclerosis and their families can be found at:

Outlook (Prognosis)
Children with mild tuberous sclerosis most often do well. However, children with severe intellectual disability or uncontrollable seizures often need lifelong assistance.
Sometimes when a child is born with severe tuberous sclerosis, one of the parents is found to have had a mild case of tuberous sclerosis that was not diagnosed.
The tumors in this disease tend to be noncancerous (benign). However, some tumors (such as kidney or brain tumors) can become cancerous.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Brain tumors (
astrocytoma
)
Heart tumors (rhabdomyoma)
Severe intellectual disability
Uncontrollable seizures
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if:
Either side of your family has a history of tuberous sclerosis
You notice symptoms of tuberous sclerosis in your child
Contact a genetic specialist if your child is diagnosed with a cardiac rhabdomyoma. Tuberous sclerosis is the leading cause of this tumor.
Prevention
Genetic counseling is recommended for couples who have a personal or family history of tuberous sclerosis and who want to have children.
Prenatal diagnosis is available for families with a known gene variant or history of this condition. However, tuberous sclerosis often appears as a new DNA mutation. These cases are not preventable.
