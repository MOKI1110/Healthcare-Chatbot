Poisoning first aid
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Poisoning is caused by exposure to a harmful substance. This can be due to swallowing, injecting, breathing in, or other means. Most poisonings occur by accident.
Immediate first aid is very important in a poisoning emergency. The first aid you give before getting medical help can save a person's life.
This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.
Considerations
Millions of poisonings are reported to United States poison control centers every year. Many result in death.
It is important to note that just because a package does not have a warning label does not mean a substance in the package is safe. You should consider poisoning if someone suddenly becomes sick for no apparent reason. Poisoning should also be considered if the person is found near a furnace, car, fire, or in an area that is not well ventilated.
Symptoms of poisoning may take time to develop. However, if you think someone has been poisoned, DO NOT wait for symptoms to develop. Get medical help right away.

First Aid
Seek immediate medical help.
For poisoning by swallowing and some inhalations:
Check and monitor the person's airway, breathing, and pulse. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and
CPR
.
Try to make sure that the person has indeed been poisoned. It may be hard to tell. Some signs include chemical-smelling breath, burns around the mouth, difficulty breathing, vomiting, or unusual odors on the person. If possible, identify the poison.
DO NOT make a person throw up unless told to do so by poison control or a health care professional.
If the person vomits, clear the person's airway. Wrap a cloth around your fingers before cleaning out the mouth and throat. If the person has been sick from a plant part, save the vomit. It may help experts identify what medicine can be used to help reverse the poisoning.
If the person starts having convulsions, give
convulsion first aid
.
Keep the person comfortable. The person should be rolled onto the left side, and remain there while getting or waiting for medical help.
If the poison has spilled on the person's clothes, remove the clothing and flush the skin with water.
For inhalation poisoning:
Call for emergency help. Never attempt to rescue a person without notifying others first.
If it is safe to do so, rescue the person from the danger of the gas, fumes, or smoke. Open windows and doors to remove the fumes.
Take several deep breaths of fresh air, and then hold your breath as you go in. Hold a wet cloth over your nose and mouth.
DO NOT light a match or use a lighter because some gases can catch fire.
After rescuing the person from danger, check and monitor the person's airway, breathing, and pulse. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and CPR.
If necessary, perform
first aid for eye injuries
or convulsion first aid.
If the person vomits, clear the person's airway. Wrap a cloth around your fingers before cleaning out the mouth and throat.
Even if the person seems perfectly fine, get medical help.
DO NOT
DO NOT:
Give an unconscious person anything by mouth.
Induce vomiting unless you are told to do so by the Poison Control Center or a health care provider. A strong poison that burns on the way down the throat will also do damage on the way back up.
Try to neutralize the poison with lemon juice or vinegar, or any other substance, unless you are told to do so by the Poison Control Center or a provider.
Use any "cure-all" type antidote.
Wait for symptoms to develop if you suspect that someone has been poisoned.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
The local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
After doing first aid steps at home, you may need to go to the emergency room. Take the container of the poison substance with you to the hospital, if possible. At the hospital you will have an exam. You also may need the following tests and treatments.
Activated charcoal
Airway support, including oxygen, breathing tube through the mouth (intubation), and ventilator (breathing machine)
Blood and urine tests
Chest x-ray
CT scan
Electrocardiogram
(ECG), or heart tracing
Fluids through the vein
(IV)
Laxative
Medicines to treat symptoms, including antidotes to reverse the effects of the poisoning if one exists
Prevention
Be aware of poisons in and around your home. Take steps to
protect young children
from toxic substances. Store all
medicines
, cleaners, cosmetics, and household chemicals out of reach of children, or in cabinets with childproof latches.
Be familiar with plants in your home, yard, and vicinity. Keep your children informed, too. Remove any poisonous plants. Never eat wild plants, mushrooms, roots, or berries unless you very familiar with them.
Teach children about the dangers of substances that contain poison. Label all poisons.
DO NOT store household chemicals in food containers, even if they are labeled. Most nonfood substances are poisonous if taken in large doses.
If you are concerned that industrial poisons might be polluting nearby land or water, report your concerns to the local health department or the state or federal Environmental Protection Agency.
Some poisons or environmental exposures do not require large doses or contact to cause symptoms and injury. Therefore, it is very important to get treatment right away to avoid serious harm. The outcome will depend on the type of poison the person came in contact with and the care received to treat the exposure.
