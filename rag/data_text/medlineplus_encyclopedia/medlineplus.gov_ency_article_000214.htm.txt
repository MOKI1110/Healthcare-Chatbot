Hepatic ischemia is a condition in which the liver does not get enough blood or oxygen. This causes injury to liver cells.
Causes
Low blood pressure
from any condition can lead to hepatic ischemia. Such conditions may include:
Abnormal heart rhythms
Dehydration
Heart failure
Infection, especially sepsis
Severe bleeding
Other causes may include:
Blood clots in the main artery to the liver (hepatic artery) after a liver transplant
Inflammation of blood vessels, leading to reduced blood flow (vasculitis)
Burns
Heat stroke
Having a sickle cell crisis
Symptoms
The person may have an altered mental status due to reduced blood flow to the brain. Other symptoms may include:
Loss of appetite
Feeling of general discomfort
Discomfort in the right upper quadrant of your abdomen
Jaundice
Damage to the liver cells most often does not cause symptoms until it affects liver function.
Blood clots in the liver's main artery may cause abdominal pain.
Exams and Tests
The following tests will be done:
Blood tests to check liver function (AST and ALT). These readings can be very high (in the thousands) with ischemia.
Doppler ultrasound of the blood vessels of the liver.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the cause. Low blood pressure and blood clots must be treated right away.
Outlook (Prognosis)
People generally recover if the illness causing hepatic ischemia can be treated. Death from liver failure due to hepatic ischemia is very rare.
Possible Complications
Liver failure is a rare, but fatal complication.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider right away if you have persistent weakness or symptoms of
shock
or
dehydration
.
Prevention
Quickly treating the causes of low blood pressure may prevent hepatic ischemia.
Alternative Names
Ischemic hepatitis; Shock liver
