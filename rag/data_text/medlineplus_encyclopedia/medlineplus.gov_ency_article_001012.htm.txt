Orbital cellulitis is an infection of the fat and muscles around the eye. It affects the eyelids, eyebrows, and cheeks. It may begin suddenly or be a result of an infection that gradually becomes worse.
Causes
Orbital cellulitis is a dangerous infection, which can cause lasting problems. Orbital cellulitis is different than
periorbital cellulitis
, which is an infection of the eyelid or skin around the eye.
In children, it often starts out as a sinus infection from bacteria such as
Haemophilus influenza.
The infection used to be more common in young children, under the age of 7. It is now rare due to a vaccine that helps prevent this infection.
The bacteria
Staphylococcus aureus
,
Streptococcus pneumoniae
, and beta-hemolytic streptococci may also cause orbital cellulitis.
Orbital cellulitis infections in children may get worse very quickly and can lead to visual difficulties or blindness. Medical care is needed right away.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
Painful swelling of upper and lower eyelid, and possibly the eyebrow and cheek
Bulging eyes
Decreased vision
Pain when moving the eye
Fever
, often 102Â°F (38.8Â°C) or higher
General ill feeling
Difficulty with eye movements
Double vision
Shiny, red or purple eyelid
Exams and Tests
Tests commonly done include:
CBC (
complete blood count
)
Blood culture
Spinal tap
in affected children who are very sick
Other tests may include:
X-ray of the sinuses
and surrounding area
CT scan or MRI of the sinuses and orbit
Culture of eye and nose drainage
Throat culture
Treatment
In most cases, a hospital stay is needed. Treatment most often includes antibiotics given through a vein (IV). Surgery may be needed if there is an
abscess
or to relieve pressure in the space around the eye.

An orbital cellulitis infection can get worse very quickly. A person with this condition must be checked every few hours.
Outlook (Prognosis)
With prompt treatment, the person can recover fully.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Cavernous sinus thrombosis
(formation of a blood clot in a cavity at the base of the brain)
Hearing loss
Septicemia
or blood infection
Meningitis
Optic nerve damage and
loss of vision
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Orbital cellulitis is a medical emergency that needs to be treated right away. Contact your health care provider if there are signs of eyelid swelling, especially with a fever.
Prevention
Getting scheduled HiB vaccine shots will prevent the infection in most children. Young children who share a household with a person who has this infection may need to take antibiotics to avoid getting sick.
Prompt treatment of a sinus or dental infection may prevent it from spreading and becoming orbital cellulitis.
