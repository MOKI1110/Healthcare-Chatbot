General anesthesia is treatment with certain medicines that puts you into a deep sleep-like state so you do not feel pain during surgery. After you receive these medicines, you will not be aware of what is happening around you.
Description
Most times, a doctor called an anesthesiologist will give you the anesthesia. Sometimes, a certified registered nurse anesthetist will give you the anesthesia.
Anesthesia often involves more than one medicine. Some medicines are given into your vein. You may be asked to breathe in (inhale) a special gas through a mask. Once you are asleep, the doctor may insert a tube into your windpipe (trachea) to help you breathe and protect your lungs.
You will be watched very closely while you are asleep. Your blood pressure, pulse, and breathing will be monitored continuously.
You will not move, feel any pain, or have any memory of the procedure because of these medicines.
Why the Procedure is Performed
General anesthesia is a safe way to stay asleep and pain-free during procedures that would:
Be too painful
Take a long time
Affect your ability to breathe
Make you uncomfortable
Cause too much anxiety
As an alternative to general anesthesia, you may also be able to have
moderate or deep sedation
Â or a regional anesthetic where part of your body is numb for your procedure. Sometimes, though, it is not enough to make you comfortable. Children may need general anesthesia for a medical or dental procedure to manage any pain or anxiety they may feel.
Risks
General anesthesia is usually safe for healthy people. You may have a higher risk of problems with general anesthesia if you:
Use large amounts of alcohol or other medicines such as sedatives, opioids, or illicit drugs
Have allergies or a family history of being allergic to medicines
Have heart, lung, or kidney problems
Smoke
Ask your doctor about these complications:
Death (rare)
Harm to your vocal cords
Heart attack
Lung infection
Mental confusion (temporary)
Stroke
Trauma to the teeth or tongue
Waking during anesthesia (rare)
Allergy to the medicines
Malignant hyperthermia
(fast rise in body temperature and severe muscle contractions)
Before the Procedure
Tell your surgeon or nurse if:
You are or could be pregnant
You are taking any medicines, including medicines, drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription
During the week before your surgery:
You may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.
Ask your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.
On the day of surgery:
Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.
Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.
Arrive at the hospital on time.
After the Procedure
You may wake up tired and groggy in the recovery or operating room. You may also feel sick to your stomach, and have a dry mouth, sore throat, or feel cold or restless until the effect of the anesthesia wears off. Your nurse will monitor these side effects, which will wear off, but it may take a few hours. Sometimes, nausea and vomiting can be treated with other medicines.
Follow your surgeon's instructions while you recover and care for your surgical wound.
Outlook (Prognosis)
General anesthesia is generally safe because of modern equipment, medicines, and safety standards. Most people recover completely and do not have any complications.
