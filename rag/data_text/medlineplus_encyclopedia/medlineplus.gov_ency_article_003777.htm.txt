Abdominal
ultrasound
is a type of imaging test. It is used to look at organs in the abdomen, including the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and kidneys. The blood vessels that lead to some of these organs, such as the inferior vena cava and aorta, can also be examined with ultrasound.
How the Test is Performed
An ultrasound machine makes images of organs and structures inside the body. The machine sends out high-frequency sound waves that reflect off body structures. A computer receives these waves and uses them to create a picture. Unlike with
x-rays
or
CT scans
, this test does not expose you to ionizing radiation.
You will be lying down for the procedure. A clear, water-based conducting gel is applied to the skin over the abdomen. This helps with the transmission of the sound waves. A handheld probe called a transducer is then moved over the abdomen.
You may need to change position so that the health care provider can look at different areas. You may also need to hold your breath for short periods during the exam.
Most of the time, the test takes less than 30 minutes.
How to Prepare for the Test
How you will prepare for the test depends on the problem. You will likely be asked not to eat or drink for several hours before the exam. Your health care provider will go over what you need to do.
How the Test will Feel
There is little discomfort. The conducting gel may feel a little cold and wet. The sonographer may press the probe against your abdomen.
Why the Test is Performed
You may have this test to:
Find the cause of abdominal pain
Find the cause of kidney infections
Diagnose or monitor tumors and cancers
Diagnose or treat
ascites
Learn why there is swelling of an abdominal organ
Look for damage after an injury
Look for stones in the gallbladder or kidney
Look for the cause of abnormal blood tests such as
liver function tests
or kidney tests
Look for the cause of a fever
The reason for the test will depend on your symptoms.
Normal Results
The organs examined appear normal.
What Abnormal Results Mean
The meaning of abnormal results depends on the organ being examined and the type of problem. Talk to your provider if you have any questions or concerns.
