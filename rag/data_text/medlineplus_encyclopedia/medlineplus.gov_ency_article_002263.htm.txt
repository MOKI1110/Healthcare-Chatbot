Mucopolysaccharides are long chains of sugar molecules that are found throughout the body, often in mucus and in fluid around the joints. They are more commonly called glycosaminoglycans.
Information
When the body cannot break down mucopolysaccharides, a condition called
mucopolysaccharidoses
(MPS) occurs. MPS refers to a group of inherited disorders of metabolism. People with MPS do not have any, or enough, of a substance (
enzyme
) needed to break down sugar molecule chains.
Forms of MPS include:
MPS I
(Hurler syndrome; Hurler-Scheie syndrome; Scheie syndrome)
MPS II
(Hunter syndrome)
MPS III
(Sanfilippo syndrome)
MPS IV
(Morquio syndrome)
Alternative Names
Glycosaminoglycans; GAG
