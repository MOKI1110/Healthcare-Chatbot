Ataxia - telangiectasia

Ataxia-telangiectasia is a rare childhood disease. It affects the brain and other parts of the body.
Ataxia refers to uncoordinated movements, such as walking. Telangiectasias are enlarged blood vessels (capillaries) just below the surface of the skin. Telangiectasias appear as tiny, red, spider-like blood vessels.
Causes
Ataxia-telangiectasia is inherited. This means it is passed down through families. It is an
autosomal recessive
trait. Both parents must provide a copy of a nonworking gene for the child to have symptoms of the disorder.
The disease results from a variant in the
ATM
gene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control the rate at which cells grow and divide. Defects in this gene can lead to abnormal cell death in many sites of the body, including the part of the brain that helps coordinate movement.
Boys and girls are equally affected.
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Decreased coordination of movements (ataxia) in late childhood that can include ataxic gait (cerebellar
ataxia
), jerky gait, unsteadiness
Decreasing mental development, slows or stops after age 10 to 12
Delayed walking
Discoloration of skin areas exposed to sunlight
Discoloration of skin (coffee-with-milk-colored spots)
Enlarged blood vessels in skin of nose, ears, and inside of the elbow and knee
Enlarged blood vessels in the whites of the eyes
Jerky or abnormal eye movements (
nystagmus
) late in the disease
Premature graying of the hair
Seizures
Sensitivity to radiation, including x-rays
Severe respiratory infections that keep coming back (recurring)
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. The exam may show signs of the following:
Tonsils, lymph nodes, and spleen below normal size
Decreased to absent deep tendon reflexes
Delayed or absent physical and sexual development
Growth failure
Mask-like face
Multiple skin coloring and texture changes
Possible tests include:
Alpha fetoprotein
B and T cell screen
Carcinoembryonic antigen
Genetic testing to look for changes in the ATM gene
Glucose tolerance test
Serum immunoglobulin levels (IgE, IgA)
X-ray or CT scan to look at the size of the thymus gland
Treatment
There is no specific treatment for ataxia-telangiectasia. Treatment is directed at specific symptoms.
Support Groups
More information and support for people with ataxia-telangiectasia condition and their families can be found at:
Ataxia Telangiectasia Children's Project:
www.atcp.org
National Ataxia Foundation (NAF):
www.ataxia.org
Outlook (Prognosis)
Early death is common, but life expectancy varies.
Because people with this condition are very sensitive to radiation, they should never be given radiation therapy, and no unnecessary x-rays should be done.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Cancer, such as
lymphoma
Diabetes
Kyphosis
Progressive movement disorder that leads to wheelchair use
Scoliosis
Severe, recurrent
lung infections
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if your child develops symptoms of this disorder.
Prevention
Couples with a family history of this condition who are considering pregnancy may consider genetic counseling.
Parents of a child with this disorder may have a slight increased risk for cancer. They should have genetic counseling and increased cancer screenings.
