Neurosarcoidosis is a form of
sarcoidosis
, in which inflammation occurs in the brain, spinal cord, and other areas of the nervous system.
Causes
Sarcoidosis is a chronic disease that affects many parts of the body, mostly the lungs. In a small number of people, the disease involves some part of the nervous system. This is called neurosarcoidosis.
Neurosarcoidosis may affect any part of the nervous system. Sudden facial weakness (
facial palsy
or facial droop) is a common neurological symptom that involves the nerves to the muscles of the face. Any other nerve in the skull can be affected, including those in the eye and those that control taste, smell, or hearing.
The spinal cord is another part of the nervous system that sarcoidosis can affect. People may have weakness in their arms and legs, and difficulty walking or controlling their urine or bowels. In some cases, the spinal cord is so severely affected that both legs are paralyzed.
The condition can also affect the parts of the brain involved in regulating many bodily functions, such as temperature, sleep, and stress responses. Other areas of the brain, including the pituitary gland at the base of the brain, can be affected.
Involvement of
muscles
or
peripheral
nerves can cause weakness and sensory loss.
Symptoms
The symptoms vary. Any part of the nervous system can be affected. Involvement of the brain or cranial nerves can cause:
Confusion
, disorientation
Decreased hearing
Dementia
Dizziness
,
vertigo
, or abnormal sensations of movement
Double vision or other vision problems, including blindness
Facial palsy (weakness, drooping)
Headache
Loss of sense of smell
Loss of sense of taste
, abnormal tastes
Mental disturbances
Seizures
Speech impairment
Involvement of the pituitary gland can cause:
Changes in menstrual periods
Excessive tiredness
or fatigue
Excessive thirst
High urine output
Weight changes
Hair changes
Involvement of one or more peripheral nerves can lead to:
Abnormal sensations
in any body part
Loss of movement
of any body part
Loss of sensation in any body part
Weakness of any body part
Exams and Tests
A neurological exam may show problems with one or more nerves.
A history of sarcoidosis followed by nerve-related symptoms highly suggests neurosarcoidosis. However, symptoms of the condition can mimic other medical disorders, including
diabetes insipidus
,
hypopituitarism
,
multiple sclerosis
,
optic neuritis
,
meningitis
, and certain tumors. Sometimes, the nervous system can be affected before a person is known to have sarcoidosis, or without affecting the lungs or other organs at all.
Blood tests are not very helpful in diagnosing the condition. A
lumbar puncture
may show signs of inflammation. Increased levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme may be found in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, this is not a reliable diagnostic test.
MRI
of the brain and spinal cord may be helpful. A
chest x-ray
often reveals signs of sarcoidosis of the lungs. A
biopsy
of the affected tissue confirms the disorder. A biopsy of lymph nodes or other organs can show findings to support the diagnosis and to exclude other conditions. Sometimes a nerve or brain biopsy is needed.
Treatment
There is no known cure for sarcoidosis. Treatment is given if symptoms are severe or are getting worse. The goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms.
Corticosteroids such as prednisone are prescribed to reduce inflammation. They are often prescribed until symptoms get better or go away. You may need to take the medicines for months, or even years.
Other medicines may include hormone replacement and medicines that suppress the immune system.
If you have numbness, weakness, vision or hearing problems, or other problems due to damage of the nerves in the brain and spinal cord, you may need physical therapy, braces, a cane, walker, or wheelchair.
Mental disorders or dementia may require medicines for depression, safety interventions, and assistance with care.
Outlook (Prognosis)
For some people, the symptoms of neurosarcoidosis go away on their own in 4 to 6 months. Others continue off and on for the rest of the person's life. Neurosarcoidosis can cause permanent disability and, in some cases, death.
Possible Complications
Complications vary, depending on which part of the nervous system is involved and how you respond to treatment. Slowly worsening or permanent loss of neurological function is possible. In rare cases, the brainstem may be involved. This is life threatening.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you have sarcoidosis and any neurological symptoms occur.
Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have a sudden loss of sensation, movement, or body function.
Prevention
Aggressive treatment of sarcoidosis turns off the body's faulty immune response before your nerves become damaged. This may reduce the chance that neurological symptoms will occur.
