Pulmonary ventilation/perfusion scan

A pulmonary ventilation/perfusion scan involves two nuclear scan tests to measure breathing (ventilation) and circulation (perfusion) in all areas of the lungs.
How the Test is Performed
A pulmonary ventilation/perfusion scan is actually 2 tests. They may be done separately or together.
During the perfusion scan, a technician injects radioactive albumin into your vein. You are placed on a movable table that is under the arm of a scanner. The machine scans your lungs as blood flows through them to find the location of the radioactive particles.
During the ventilation scan, you breathe in radioactive gas through a mask while you are sitting or lying on a table under the scanner arm.
How to Prepare for the Test
You do not need to stop eating (fast), be on a special diet, or take any medicines before the test.
A
chest x-ray
is usually done before, and sometimes after a ventilation and perfusion scan.
You wear a hospital gown or comfortable clothing that does not have metal fasteners.
How the Test will Feel
The table may feel hard or cold. You may feel a sharp prick when the IV is placed in the vein in your arm for the perfusion part of the scan.
The mask used during the ventilation scan may make you feel nervous about being in a small space (claustrophobia). You must lie still during the scan.
The
radioisotope
injection usually does not cause discomfort.
Why the Test is Performed
The ventilation scan is used to see how well air moves and blood flows through the lungs. The perfusion scan measures the blood supply through the lungs.
A ventilation and perfusion scan is most often done to detect an acuteÂ
pulmonary embolus
(blood clot in the lungs). It is also used to:
Detect abnormal circulation (shunts) in the blood vessels of the lungs (pulmonary vessels)
Detect abnormal circulation from multiple old blood clots (chronic thromboembolic disease)
Test regional (different lung areas) lung function in people with advanced
pulmonary disease
, such as
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD)
Normal Results
A radiologist will evaluate your ventilation and perfusion scan in conjunction with a chest x-ray. All parts of both lungs should take up the radioisotope evenly.
What Abnormal Results Mean
If the lungs take up lower than normal amounts of radioisotope during a ventilation or perfusion scan, it may be due to any of the following:
Airway obstruction
COPD
Pneumonia
Narrowing of the pulmonary artery
Inflammation of the lungs due to breathing in a foreign substance (pneumonitis)
Pulmonary embolus
Chronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease
Reduced breathing and ventilation ability
Risks
Risks are about the same as for x-rays (radiation) and needle pricks.
No radiation is released from the scanner. Instead, it detects radiation and converts it into an image.
There is a small exposure to radiation from the radioisotope. The radioisotopes used during scans are short-lived. All of the radiation leaves the body in a few days. However, as with any radiation exposure, caution is advised for pregnant or breastfeeding women.
There is a slight risk for infection or bleeding at the site where the needle is inserted. The risk with perfusion scan is the same as with inserting an
intravenous
needle for any other purpose.
In rare cases, a person may develop an
allergy
to the radioisotope. This may include a serious
anaphylactic reaction
.
Considerations
A pulmonary ventilation and perfusion scan may be a lower-risk alternative to
pulmonary angiography
for evaluating disorders of the lung blood supply.
This test may not provide a definite diagnosis, particularly in people with lung disease. Other tests may be needed to confirm or check for the findings of a pulmonary ventilation and perfusion scan.
This test has largely been replaced by CT pulmonary angiography for diagnosing pulmonary embolism. However, people with kidney problems or an allergy to contrast dye can more safely have this test.
