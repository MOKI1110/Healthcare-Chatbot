Urine melanin test is a test to determine the abnormal presence of
melanin
in the urine.
How the Test is Performed
A
clean-catch urine sample
is needed.
How to Prepare for the Test
No special preparation is needed.
How the Test will Feel
The test involves only normal urination.
Why the Test is Performed
This test is used to diagnose
melanoma
, a type of skin cancer that produces melanin. If the cancer spreads (especially within the liver), the cancer may produce enough of this substance that it shows up in the urine.
Normal Results
Normally, melanin is not present in urine.
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
If melanin is present in the urine, malignant melanoma is suspected.
Risks
There are no risks associated with this test.
Considerations
This test is rarely done anymore to diagnose melanoma because there are better tests available.
Alternative Names
Thormahlen's test; Melanin - urine
