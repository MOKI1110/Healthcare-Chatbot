Radial nerve dysfunction

Radial nerve dysfunction is a problem with the radial nerve. This is the nerve that travels from the armpit down the back of the arm to the hand. It helps you move your arm, wrist, and hand.
Causes
Damage to one nerve, such as the radial nerve, is called
mononeuropathy
. Mononeuropathy means there is damage to a single nerve. Diseases affecting the entire body (systemic disorders) can also cause isolated nerve damage.
Causes of mononeuropathy include:
An illness in the whole body that damages a single nerve
Direct injury to the nerve
Long-term pressure on the nerve
Pressure on the nerve caused by swelling or injury of nearby body structures
Radial neuropathy occurs when there is damage to the radial nerve, which travels down the arm and controls:
Movement of the triceps muscle at the back of the upper arm
Ability to bend the wrist and fingers backward
Movement of the wrist and hand
Sensation of part of the back of the hand
When damage destroys the nerve covering (
myelin sheath
) or part of the nerve itself, nerve signaling is slowed or prevented.
Damage to the radial nerve can be caused by:
Broken arm bone and other injury
Diabetes
Improper use of crutches leading to excess pressure in the armpit
Lead poisoning
Long-term or repeated constriction of the wrist (for example, from wearing a tight watch strap)
Long-term pressure on the nerve, usually caused by swelling or injury of nearby body structures
Pressure to the upper arm from arm positions during sleep or coma
In some cases, no cause can be found.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Abnormal sensations in the back and thumb side of the hand, or in the thumb, 2nd, and 3rd fingers
Weakness, loss of coordination of the fingers
Problem straightening the arm at the elbow
Problem bending the hand back at the wrist, or holding the hand
Pain,
numbness
, decreased sensation, tingling, or burning sensation in the areas controlled by the nerve
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms and medical history. You may be asked what you were doing before the symptoms started.
Tests that may be needed include:
Blood tests
Imaging tests to view the nerve and nearby structures
Electromyography
to check the health of the radial nerve and the muscles it controls
Nerve biopsy
to examine a piece of nerve tissue (rarely needed)
Nerve conduction tests
to check how fast nerve signals travel
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to allow you to use the hand and arm as much as possible. Your provider will find and treat the cause, if possible. Sometimes, no treatment is needed and you will get better on your own.
If medicines are needed, they may include:
Over-the-counter or prescription pain medicines
Corticosteroid injections around the nerve to reduce swelling and pressure
Your provider will likely suggest self-care measures. These may include:
A supportive splint at either the wrist or elbow to help prevent further injury and relieve the symptoms. You may need to wear it all day and night, or only at night.
An elbow pad if the radial nerve is injured at the elbow. Also, avoid bumping or leaning on the elbow.
Physical therapy exercises to help maintain muscle strength in the arm.
Occupational therapy or counseling to suggest changes in the workplace may be needed.
Surgery to relieve pressure on the nerve may help if the symptoms get worse, or if there is proof that part of the nerve is wasting away.
Outlook (Prognosis)
If the cause of the nerve dysfunction can be found and successfully treated, there is a good chance that you will fully recover. In some cases, there may be partial or complete loss of movement or sensation.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Mild to severe deformity of the hand
Partial or complete loss of feeling in the hand
Partial or complete loss of wrist or hand movement
Recurrent or unnoticed injury to the hand
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have an arm injury and develop numbness, tingling, pain, or weakness down the back of the arm and the thumb and your first 2 fingers.
Prevention
Avoid prolonged pressure on the upper arm.
