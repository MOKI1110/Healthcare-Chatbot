To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Nitroglycerin is a medicine that helps relax the blood vessels leading to the heart. It is used to prevent and treat chest pain (
angina
), as well as extremely high blood pressure and other conditions. Nitroglycerin overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose.

This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.
The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated. The person may receive:
Activated charcoal
Blood and urine tests
Breathing support, including oxygen and a tube through the mouth into the lungs and breathing machine (ventilator)
Chest x-ray
ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing
Intravenous fluids (IV, or through a vein)

Outlook (Prognosis)
Deaths from nitroglycerin overdose have occurred, but they are rare.
Very low blood pressure may result from taking nitroglycerin with other medicines whose action also lowers blood pressure, such as drugs used to treat erectile dysfunction.
An overnight hospital stay may be needed if a long-acting nitroglycerine drug preparation caused the overdose.
