Alcoholic neuropathy is damage to the nerves that results from excessive drinking of alcohol.
Causes
The exact cause of alcoholic neuropathy is unknown. It likely includes both a direct poisoning of the nerve by the alcohol and the effect of poor nutrition associated with alcoholism. Up to half of long-term heavy alcohol users develop this condition.
In severe cases, nerves that regulate internal body functions (autonomic nerves) may be involved.
Symptoms
Symptoms of this condition include any of the following:
Numbness
in the arms and legs
Abnormal sensations
, such as "pins and needles"
Painful sensations in the arms and legs
Muscle problems, including
weakness
,
cramps
,
aches
, or spasms
Heat intolerance
, especially after exercise
Erection problems (
impotence
)
Problems urinating
,
incontinence
(leaking urine), the feeling of incomplete bladder emptying,
difficulty beginning to urinate
Constipation or diarrhea
Nausea, vomiting
Problems swallowing or talking
Unsteady gait (walking)
Changes in muscle strength or sensation usually occur on both sides of the body and are more common in the legs than in the arms. Symptoms usually develop gradually and become worse over time.
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about symptoms. An eye exam may show eye problems.
Excessive alcohol use often makes the body unable to use or store certain vitamins and minerals. Blood tests may be ordered to check for a lack of:
Thiamine
(vitamin B1)
Pyridoxine
(vitamin B6)
Vitamin B12
Folic acid
Other tests may be ordered to check for other possible causes of neuropathy or damage to body systems due to neuropathy.
Tests may include:
Electrolyte levels
, including glucose to check for diabetes
Electromyography
(EMG) to check the health of the muscles and the nerves that control the muscles
Hemoglobin A1c
test to check for diabetes
Liver and kidney function tests
Thyroid function tests
Levels of vitamins and minerals in the body
Nerve conduction tests
to check how fast electrical signals move through a nerve
Nerve biopsy
to remove a small piece of a nerve for examination
Upper GI and small bowel series
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy
(EGD) to examine the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine
Voiding cystourethrogram
, an x-ray test of the bladder and urethra
Treatment
Stopping the use of alcohol is the most important first step. People will often need counseling from alcohol use disorder specialists. If there are other medical problems that can also cause nerve damage, such as diabetes, they should be treated as well. Once the alcohol problem has been addressed, treatment goals include:
Controlling symptoms
Maximizing ability to function independently
Preventing injury
It is important to supplement the diet with vitamins, including thiamine and folic acid.
Physical therapy and orthopedic appliances (such as splints) may be needed to maintain muscle function and limb position.
Medicines may be needed to treat pain or uncomfortable sensations due to nerve damage. They will be prescribed the smallest dose of medicine needed to reduce symptoms. This may help prevent medicine dependence and other side effects of
chronic
use.
Positioning or the use of a bed frame that keeps the covers off the legs may help reduce pain.
People with lightheadedness or dizziness when standing up (orthostatic hypotension) may need to try several different treatments before finding one that successfully reduces their symptoms. Treatments that may help include:
Wearing
compression stockings
Eating extra salt
Sleeping with the head elevated
Using medicines
Bladder problems may be treated with:
Manual expression of urine
Intermittent catheterization (
male
or
female
)
Medicines
Impotence, diarrhea, constipation, or other symptoms are treated when necessary. These symptoms often respond poorly to treatment in people with alcoholic neuropathy.
It is important to protect body parts with reduced sensation from injury. This may include:
Checking the temperature of bath water to prevent burns
Changing footwear
Frequently inspecting the feet and shoes to reduce injury caused by pressure or objects in the shoes
Guarding the extremities to prevent injury from pressure
Alcohol use must be stopped
to prevent the damage from getting worse. Treatment for alcohol use disorder may include counseling, social support such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), or medicines.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Damage to nerves from alcoholic neuropathy is usually permanent. It is likely to get worse if the person continues to use alcohol or if nutritional problems are not corrected. Alcoholic neuropathy is usually not life threatening, but it can severely affect quality of life.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of alcoholic neuropathy.
Prevention
The only way to prevent alcoholic neuropathy is not to drink excessive amounts of alcohol.
