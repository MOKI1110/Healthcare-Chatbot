Angina is a type of
chest discomfort or pain
due to poor blood flow through the blood vessels (coronary arteries) of the heart muscle (myocardium). Typically, the chest pain feels like tightness, heavy pressure, squeezing, or a crushing feeling. It may spread to the:
Arm (most often the left)
Back
Jaw
Neck
Shoulder
Some people say the pain feels like gas or indigestion.
Some patients have symptoms other than classic angina when there is poor blood flow to the heart which may be called their "anginal equivalent." Examples include shortness of breath, back, jaw or arm pain that occur without chest pain.
There are different types of angina:
Stable angina
Unstable angina
Variant angina
Get medical help right away if you have new, unexplained chest pain or pressure. If you have had angina before, call your health care provider.
