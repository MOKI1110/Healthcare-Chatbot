Eustachian tube patency

Eustachian tube patency refers to how much the eustachian tube is open. The eustachian tube runs between the middle ear and the throat. It controls the pressure behind the eardrum in the middle ear space. This helps keep the middle ear free of fluid.
The eustachian tube is normally open, or patent. However, some conditions can increase pressure in the ear such as:
Ear infections
Upper respiratory infections
Altitude changes
These can cause the eustachian tube to become blocked. Alternatively, if the eustachian tube becomes blocked first, the pressure in the middle ear will go up and fluid may accumulate in it.
