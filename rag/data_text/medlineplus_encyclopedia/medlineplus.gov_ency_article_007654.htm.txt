Soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is
cancer
that forms in the soft tissue of the body. Soft tissue connects, supports, or surrounds other body parts. In adults, STS is rare.
There are many different types of soft tissue cancers. The type of sarcoma depends on the tissue it forms in:
Muscles
Tendons
Fat
Blood vessels
Lymph vessels
Nerves
Tissues in and around joints
The cancer can form almost anywhere, but is most common in the:
Head
Neck
Arms
Legs
Trunk
Abdomen
Causes
It is not known what causes most sarcomas. But there are certain risk factors:
Some inherited diseases, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome
Radiation therapy
for other cancers
Exposure to certain chemicals, such as vinyl chloride or certain herbicides
Having swelling in the arms or legs for a long time (
lymphedema
)
Symptoms
In early stages, there are often no symptoms. As the cancer grows, it may cause a lump or swelling that keeps growing over time. Most lumps are not due to cancer.
Other symptoms include:
Pain, if it presses on a nerve, organ, blood vessel, bone, or muscle
Blockage or bleeding in the stomach or intestines
Breathing problems
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will ask you about your medical history and do a physical exam. Other tests may include:
X-rays
CT scan
MRI
PET scan
If your provider suspects cancer, you might have a
biopsy
to check for cancer. In a biopsy, your provider collects a tissue sample to examine in the lab.
The biopsy will show if cancer is present and help show how quickly it is growing. Your provider may ask for more tests to
stage the cancer
. Staging can tell how much cancer is present and whether it has spread.
Treatment
Surgery is the most common treatment for STS.
In early stages, the tumor and some healthy tissue around it is removed.
Sometimes, just a small amount of tissue needs to be removed. Other times, a wider area of tissue must be removed.
With advanced cancers that form in an arm or leg, surgery may be followed by radiation therapy or
chemotherapy
. Rarely, the limb may need to be amputated.
You also may have radiation therapy or chemotherapy:
Used before surgery to help shrink the tumor to make it easier to remove the cancer
Used after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells
Chemotherapy may be used to help kill cancer that has
metastasized
. This means it has spread to different areas of the body.
Support Groups
Cancer affects how you feel about yourself and your life. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a
cancer support group
. Sharing with others who have had the same experiences and problems can help you feel less alone.
Ask your provider to help you find a support group for people who have been diagnosed with STS.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outlook for people whose cancer is treated early is very good. Most people who survive 5 years can expect to be cancer-free at 10 years.
Possible Complications
Complications include side effects from surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
See your provider about any lump that grows in size or is painful.
Prevention
The cause of most STSs isn't known and there is no way to prevent it. Knowing your risk factors and telling your provider when you first notice symptoms can increase your chance of surviving this type of cancer.
