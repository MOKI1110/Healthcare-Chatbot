Outlook (Prognosis)
This substance is very poisonous. How well the person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed, what symptoms occur within the first 10 to 15 minutes after swallowing it and how quickly treatment is received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery. Kidney dialysis (filtration) through a machine may be needed if the kidneys do not recover after acute mercury poisoning.
Kidney failure
and death can occur, even with small doses.
If the poisoning has occurred slowly over time, any brain damage may be permanent.
Mercuric chloride poisoning can lead to multiple organ failure and death.
