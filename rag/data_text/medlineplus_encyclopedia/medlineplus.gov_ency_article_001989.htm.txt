Question:
Is there any reason to worry about a child's potbelly?
Answer:
It is generally normal for toddlers to have potbellies. By the time children reach school age, the potbelly will most often disappear and their bodies will be more proportionate.
The belly should feel soft and NOT tender. There is nothing to worry about unless the child also has other symptoms such as:
Belly pain
Fever
Hard or firm-feeling belly
Short stature
Swollen belly
Vomiting
Alternative Names
Children and potbellies
