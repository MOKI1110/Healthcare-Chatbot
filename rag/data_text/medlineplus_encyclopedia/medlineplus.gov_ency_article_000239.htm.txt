Hepatic vein obstruction (Budd-Chiari)

Hepatic vein obstruction is a blockage of the
hepatic
vein, which carries blood away from the liver.
Causes
Hepatic vein obstruction prevents blood from flowing out of the liver and back to the heart. This blockage can cause liver damage. Obstruction of this vein can be caused by a
tumor
or growth pressing on the vessel, or by a clot in the vessel (hepatic vein thrombosis).
Most often, it is caused by conditions that make blood clots more likely to form, including:
Abnormal growth of cells in the bone marrow (myeloproliferative disorders)
Cancers
Chronic inflammatory or
autoimmune
diseases
Infections
Inherited (hereditary) or acquired problems with excessive blood clotting
Oral contraceptives
Pregnancy
Hepatic vein blockage is the most common cause of Budd-Chiari syndrome.
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Abdominal swelling or stretching due to fluid in the abdomen
Pain in the right upper abdomen
Vomiting blood
Yellowing of the skin (jaundice)
Exams and Tests
One of the signs is swelling of the abdomen from fluid buildup (
ascites
). The liver is often swollen and tender.
Tests include:
CT scan
or
MRI of the abdomen
Doppler ultrasound of the liver veins
Liver biopsy
Liver function tests
Ultrasound
of the liver
Treatment
Treatment varies, depending on the cause of the blockage.
Your health care provider may recommend the following medicines:
Blood thinners (anticoagulants)
Clot-busting medicines (thrombolytic treatment)
Medicines to treat the liver disease, including ascites
Surgery may be recommended. This may involve:
Angioplasty
and
stent
placement
Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt
(TIPS)
Venous shunt surgery
Liver transplant
Possible Complications
Hepatic vein obstruction can get worse and lead to
cirrhosis
and liver failure. This can be life threatening.
