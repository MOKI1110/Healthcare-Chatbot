Progeria is a rare genetic condition that produces rapid aging in children.
Causes
Progeria is a rare condition. It is remarkable because its symptoms strongly resemble normal human aging, but it occurs in young children. In most cases, it is not passed down through families. It is rarely seen in more than one child in a family.
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Growth failure during the first year of life
Narrow, shrunken or wrinkled face
Baldness
Loss of eyebrows and eyelashes
Short stature
Large head for size of face (
macrocephaly
)
Open soft spot of the skull (fontanelle)
Small jaw (
micrognathia
)
Dry, scaly, thin skin
Limited range of motion
Teeth - delayed or absent formation
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and order laboratory tests. This may show:
Insulin resistance
Skin changes similar to that seen in scleroderma (the connective tissue becomes tough and hardened)
Generally normal cholesterol and triglyceride levels
Cardiac stress testing may reveal signs of early atherosclerosis of blood vessels.
Genetic testing can detect changes in the gene (
LMNA
) that causes progeria.
Treatment
There is no specific treatment for progeria. Aspirin and statin medicines may be used to protect against a heart attack or stroke.

Outlook (Prognosis)
Progeria causes early death. People with the condition most often only live to their teenage years (average lifespan of 14 years). However, some can live into their early 20s. The cause of death is very often related to the heart or a
stroke
.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Heart attack (
myocardial infarction)
Stroke
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if your child does not appear to be growing or developing normally.
