Protein C blood test
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Protein C is a normal substance in the body that prevents blood clotting. A blood test can be done to see how much of this protein you have in your blood.
How the Test is Performed
A
blood sample
is needed.
How to Prepare for the Test
Certain medicines can change blood test results.
Tell your health care provider about all the medicines you take.
Your provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test. This may include blood thinners.
Do not stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.
How the Test will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.
Why the Test is Performed
You may need this test if you have an unexplained blood clot or a family history of blood clots. Protein C helps control blood clotting. A lack of this protein or a problem with the function of this protein may cause blood clots to form in veins abnormally.
The test is also used to screen relatives of people who are known to have
protein C deficiency
. It may also be done to find the reason for repeated miscarriages.
Normal Results
Normal values are 60% to 150% inhibition.
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
A lack (deficiency) of protein C can lead to excess clotting. These clots tend to form in veins, not arteries. Clotting can occur in unusual areas such as abdominal veins or veins in the brain.
Protein C deficiency can be passed down through families (inherited). It can also develop with other conditions, such as:
Chemotherapy use
Disorder in which the proteins that control blood clotting become over active (
disseminated intravascular coagulation
)
Liver disease
Long-term antibiotic use
Warfarin (Coumadin) use
A problem such as a
sudden blood clot in the lung
may reduce the protein C level.
Protein C level rises with age or while pregnant, but this does not cause any health problems.
Risks
There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:
Excessive bleeding
Fainting or feeling lightheaded
Multiple punctures to locate veins
Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
Alternative Names
Autoprothrombin IIA
