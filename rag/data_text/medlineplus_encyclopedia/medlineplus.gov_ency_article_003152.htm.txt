Breast pain is any discomfort or pain in the breast.
Considerations
There are many possible causes for breast pain. For example, changes in the level of hormones during menstruation or pregnancy often cause breast pain. Some swelling and tenderness just before your period is normal.
Some women who have pain in one or both breasts may fear
breast cancer
. However, breast pain is not a common symptom of cancer.
Causes
Some breast tenderness is normal. The discomfort may be caused by hormone changes from:
Menopause
(unless a woman is taking hormone replacement therapy)
Menstruation and
premenstrual syndrome
(PMS)
Pregnancy -- breast tenderness tends to be more common during the first trimester
Puberty in both girls and boys
Soon after having a baby, a woman's breasts may become swollen with milk. This can be very painful. If you also have an area of redness, contact your health care provider, as this may be a sign of an infection or other more serious breast problem.
Breastfeeding itself may also cause breast pain.
Fibrocystic breast changes
are a common cause of breast pain. Fibrocystic breast tissue contains lumps or cysts that tend to be more tender just before your menstrual period.
Certain medicines may also cause breast pain, including:
Oxymetholone
Chlorpromazine and other antipsychotic medicines
Water pills (diuretics)
Digitalis preparations
Methyldopa
Spironolactone
Oral contraceptives
Estrogen replacement therapy
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, such as fluoxetine
Shingles
can lead to pain in the breast as there is a painful blistering rash that appears on the skin of your breasts.
Home Care
If you have painful breasts, the following may help:
Take medicine such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen
Use heat or ice on the breast
Wear a well-fitting bra that supports your breasts,Â such as a sports bra
There is no good evidence to show that reducing the amount of fat, caffeine, or chocolate in your diet helps reduce breast pain. Vitamin E, thiamine, magnesium, and evening primrose oil are not harmful, but most studies have not shown any benefit. Talk to your provider before starting any medicine or supplement.
Certain birth control pills may help ease breast pain, although in other cases, it may cause breast pain. Ask your provider if this therapy is right for you.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have:
Bloody or clear discharge from your nipple
Given birth within the last week and your breasts are swollen or hard
Noticed a new lump that does not go away after your menstrual period
Persistent, unexplained breast pain
Signs of a breast infection, including redness, pus drainage, or fever
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will perform a breast examination and ask questions about your breast pain. You may have a
mammogram
or
ultrasound
.
Your provider may arrange a follow-up visit if your symptoms have not gone away in a given period of time. You may be referred to a specialist.
