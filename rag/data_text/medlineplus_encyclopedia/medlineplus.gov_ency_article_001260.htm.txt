Spondylolisthesis

Spondylolisthesis is a condition in which a bone (vertebra) in the spine moves forward, out of its proper position, in relation to the bone below it.
Causes
In children, spondylolisthesis usually occurs between the fifth bone in the lower back (lumbar vertebra) and the first bone in the sacrum (pelvis) area. It is often due to a birth defect in that area of the spine or sudden injury (acute trauma).
In adults, the most common cause is abnormal wear on the cartilage and bones, such as
arthritis
. The condition mostly affects people over 50 years old. It is more common in women than in men.
Bone disease and
fractures
can also cause spondylolisthesis. Certain sports activities, such as gymnastics, weightlifting, and football, greatly stress the bones in the lower back. They also require that the athlete constantly overstretch (hyperextend) the spine. This can lead to a stress fracture on one or both sides of the vertebra. A stress fracture can cause a spinal bone to become weak and shift out of place.
Symptoms
Symptoms of spondylolisthesis may vary from mild to severe. Many people with spondylolisthesis have no symptoms. Children may not show symptoms until they're 18 years old.
The condition can lead to increased and abnormal
lordosis
(also called swayback). In later stages, it may result in
kyphosis
(roundback) as the upper spine falls off the lower spine.
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Lower back pain
Muscle tightness (tight hamstring muscle)
Pain,
numbness, or tingling
in the thighs and buttocks
Lower back stiffness
Tenderness in the area of the vertebra that is out of place
Weakness
in the legs
Difficulty with bladder or bowel control
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine you and feel your spine. You will be asked to raise your leg straight out in front of you. This may be uncomfortable or painful.
X-ray of the spine
can show if a bone in the spine is out of place or broken.
CT scan
or
MRI scan
of the spine can show if there is any narrowing of the spinal canal and pinching of your nerves.
Treatment
Treatment depends on how severely the vertebra has shifted out of place. Most people get better with exercises that stretch and strengthen lower back muscles.
If the shift is not severe, you can play most sports if there is no pain. Most of the time, you can slowly resume activities.
You may be asked to avoid contact sports or to change activities to protect your back from being overextended.
You will have follow-up x-rays to make sure the problem is not getting worse.
Your provider may also recommend:
A back brace to limit spine movement
Pain medicine (taken by mouth or injected into the back)
Physical therapy
Surgery may be needed to
fuse the shifted vertebrae
if you have:
Severe pain that does not get better with treatment
A severe shift of a spine bone
Weakness of muscles in one or both of your legs
Difficulty with controlling your bowels or bladder
There is a chance of nerve injury with such surgery. However, the results can be very successful.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Exercises and changes in activity are helpful for most people with mild spondylolisthesis.
Possible Complications
If too much movement occurs, the bones may begin to press on nerves. Surgery may be necessary to correct the condition.
Other complications may include:
Long-term (chronic) back pain
Infection
Temporary or permanent damage of spinal nerve roots, which may cause sensation changes, weakness, or paralysis of the legs
Difficulty controlling your bowel or bladder
Arthritis that develops above the level of the slippage
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
Your back appears to have a severe curve
You have back pain or stiffness that does not go away
You have pain in the thighs and buttocks that does not go away
You have numbness and weakness in legs
You have trouble controlling bowel movements or urination
