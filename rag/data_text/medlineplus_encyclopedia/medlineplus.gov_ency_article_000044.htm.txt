Genital injury
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
A genital injury is an injury to male or female sex organs, mainly those outside the body. It also refers to injury in the area between the legs, called the perineum.
Considerations
Injury to the genitals can be very painful. It may cause a lot of bleeding. Such injury can affect the reproductive organs and the bladder and urethra.
Damage may be temporary or permanent.
Causes
Genital injury can occur in both women and young girls. It may be caused by placing items into the vagina. Young girls (most often less than 4 years of age) may do this during normal exploration of the body. Objects used may include toilet tissue, crayons, beads, pins, or buttons.
It is important to rule out sexual abuse, rape, and assault. The health care provider should ask the girl how the object was placed there.
In men and young boys, common causes of genital injury include:
Having the toilet seat fall down onto the area
Getting the area caught in a pant zipper
Straddle injury: falling and landing with the legs on each side of a bar, such as a monkey bar or the middle of a bicycle
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
Abdominal pain
Bleeding
Bruising
Change in shape of the affected area
Faintness
Foul-smelling
vaginal or urethral discharge
Object embedded in a body opening
Groin pain
or genital pain (can be extreme)
Swelling
Urine drainage
Vomiting
Urination that is painful
or the inability to urinate
Open wound
First Aid
Keep the person calm. Be sensitive to privacy. Cover the injured area while giving first aid.
Control bleeding by using direct pressure. Place a clean cloth or sterile dressing on any open wounds. If the vagina is bleeding severely, put sterile gauze or clean cloths on the area, unless a foreign body is suspected.
Apply cold compresses to help reduce swelling.
If the
testicles
have been injured, support them with a sling made from towels. Place them on a padded cloth, such as a diaper.
If there is an object stuck in a body opening or wound, leave it alone and seek medical attention. Taking it out may cause more damage.
DO NOT
DO NOT try to remove an object by yourself. Seek medical help right away.
Never volunteer your thoughts on how you think the injury happened. If you think the injury was the result of assault or abuse, DO NOT let the person change clothes or take a bath or shower. Seek medical help right away.
