Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis

Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis is a kidney disorder that involves inflammation and changes to kidney cells. It may lead to
kidney failure
.
Causes
Glomerulonephritis
is an inflammation of the glomeruli. The glomeruli of the kidney help filter wastes and fluids from the blood to form urine.
Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is a form of glomerulonephritis caused by an abnormal
immune response
. Deposits of
antibodies
build up in a part of the kidneys called the glomerular basement membrane. This membrane helps filter wastes and extra fluids from the blood.
Damage to this membrane affects the kidney's ability to create urine normally. It may allow blood and protein to leak into the urine. If enough protein leaks into the urine, fluid may leak out of the blood vessels into body tissues, leading to swelling (
edema
). Nitrogen waste products may also build up in the blood (
azotemia
).
The 2 forms of this disease are MPGN I and MPGN II.
Most people with the disease have type I. MPGN II is much less common. It also tends to get worse faster than MPGN I.
Causes of MPGN may include:
Autoimmune diseases (
systemic lupus erythematosus
,
scleroderma
,
SjÃ¶gren syndrome
,
sarcoidosis
)
Cancer (leukemia, lymphoma)
Infections (
hepatitis B
,
hepatitis C
,
endocarditis
,
malaria
)
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Blood in the urine
Changes in mental status
such as
decreased alertness
or decreased concentration
Cloudy urine
Dark urine
(smoke, cola, or tea colored)
Decrease in urine volume
Swelling
of any part of the body
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms. The provider may find that you have signs of too much fluid in the body, such as:
Swelling, often in the legs
Abnormal sounds when listening to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope
You may have high blood pressure
The following tests help confirm the diagnosis:
BUN
and
creatinine
blood test
Blood complement levels
Urinalysis
Urine protein
Kidney biopsy
(to confirm membranoproliferative GN I or II)
Treatment
Treatment depends on the symptoms. The goals of treatment are to reduce symptoms, prevent complications, and slow the progression of the disorder.
You may need a change in diet. This may include limiting sodium, fluids, or protein to help control high blood pressure, swelling, and the buildup of waste products in the blood.
Medicines that may be prescribed include:
Blood pressure medicines
Dipyridamole, with or without aspirin
Diuretics
Medicines to suppress the immune system, such as cyclophosphamide
Steroids
Treatment is more effective in children than in adults. Dialysis or
kidney transplant
may eventually be needed to manage kidney failure.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The disorder often slowly gets worse and eventually results in
chronic kidney failure
.
Half of people with this condition develop long-term (chronic) kidney failure within 10 years. This is more likely in those who have higher levels of protein in their urine.
Possible Complications
Complications that may result from this disease include:
Acute nephritic syndrome
Acute renal failure
Chronic kidney disease
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
You have symptoms of this condition
Your symptoms get worse or do not go away
You develop new symptoms, including decreased urine output
Prevention
Preventing infections such as hepatitis or managing diseases such as lupus may help prevent MPGN.
