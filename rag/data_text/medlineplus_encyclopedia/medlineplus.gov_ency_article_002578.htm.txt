Beta-blockers are a type of medicine used to treat high blood pressure and heart rhythm disturbances. They are one of several classes of medicines used to treat the heart and related conditions. Beta-blockers are also used in the treatment of thyroid disease, migraine, and glaucoma. These drugs are a common cause of poisoning.
Beta-blocker
overdose
occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose.

This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison control. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.
The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.
Tests that may be done include:
Blood and urine tests
Chest x-ray
ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)
Treatment may include:
Activated charcoal
Breathing support, which may include oxygen or a ventilator (tube through the mouth into the lungs and breathing machine

Outlook (Prognosis)
A beta-blocker overdose can be very dangerous. It can cause death. If the person's heart rate and blood pressure can be corrected, survival is likely. Survival depends on how much and what type of this medicine the person took and how quickly they receive treatment.
An overnight hospital stay may be needed even in less serious cases, as some long-acting drugs remain in the body for many hours.
Risk factors for a more severe outcome, including multiple organ failure and death, include:
Co-ingestion with other drugs which affect the heart; for example, digoxin, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants
People with other health conditions, such as congestive heart failure and heart rhythm disturbances
