Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a movement disorder that occurs from damage to certain nerve cells in the brain.
Causes
PSP is a condition that causes symptoms similar to those of
Parkinson disease
.
It involves damage to many cells of the brain. Many areas are affected, including the part of the brainstem where cells that control eye movement are located. The area of the brain that controls steadiness when you walk is also affected. The frontal lobes of the brain are also affected, leading to personality changes.
The cause of the damage to the brain cells is unknown. PSP gets worse over time.
People with PSP have deposits in brain tissues that look like those found in people with
Alzheimer disease
. There is a loss of tissue in most areas of the brain and in some parts of the spinal cord.
The disorder is most often seen in people over 60 years old, and is somewhat more common in men.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Loss of balance, repeated falls
Lunging forward when moving, or fast walking
Bumping into objects or people
Changes in expressions of the face
Deeply lined face
Eye and vision problems such as
different sized pupils
, difficulty moving the eyes (
supranuclear ophthalmoplegia
), lack of control over the eyes, problems keeping the eyes open
Difficulty swallowing
Tremors, jaw or face jerks or spasms
Mild-to-moderate
dementia
Personality changes
Slow or stiff movements
Speech difficulties, such as low voice volume, not able to say words clearly, slow speech
Stiffness and rigid movement in the neck, middle of the body, arms, and legs
Exams and Tests
An exam of the nervous system (neurologic exam) may show:
Dementia that is getting worse
Difficulty walking
Limited eye movements, especially up and down movements
Inability to keep eyes open
Normal vision, hearing, feeling, and control of movement
Stiff and uncoordinated movements like those of Parkinson disease
Your health care provider may do the following tests to rule out other diseases:
MRI
might show shrinking of the brainstem (hummingbird sign)
PET scan of the brain
will show changes in the front of the brain
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to control symptoms. There is no known cure for PSP.
Medicines such as levodopaÂ (combined with carbidopa) may be tried. These medicines raise the level of a brain chemical called dopamine. Dopamine is involved in the control of movement. The medicines may reduce some symptoms, such as rigid limbs or slow movements for a time. But they are usually not as effective as they are for Parkinson disease.
Many people with PSP will eventually need around-the-clock care and monitoring as they lose brain functions.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Treatment sometimes can reduce symptoms for a while, but the condition will get worse. Brain function will decline over time. Death commonly occurs in 5 to 7 years.
Newer medicines are being studied to treat this condition.
Possible Complications
Complications of PSP include:
Blood clot in veins (
deep vein thrombosis
) due to limited movement
Injury from falling
Lack of control over vision
Loss of brain functions over time
Pneumonia
due toÂ trouble swallowing
Poor nutrition (malnutrition)
Side effects from medicines
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you often fall, and if you have a stiff neck/body, and vision problems.
Also, call if a loved one has been diagnosed with PSP and the condition has declined so much that you can no longer care for the person at home.
