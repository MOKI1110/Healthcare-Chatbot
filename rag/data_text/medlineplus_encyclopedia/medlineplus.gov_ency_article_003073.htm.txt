Coughing up blood
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Coughing up blood is the spitting up of blood or bloody mucus from the lungs and throat (respiratory tract).
Hemoptysis is the medical term for coughing up blood from the respiratory tract.
Considerations
Coughing up blood is not the same as bleeding from the mouth, throat, or gastrointestinal tract.
Blood that comes up with a cough often looks bubbly because it is mixed with air and mucus. It is most often bright red, although it may be rust-colored. Sometimes the mucus contains only streaks of blood.
The outlook depends on what is causing the problem. Most people do well with treatment to treat the symptoms and the underlying disease. People with severe hemoptysis may die.
Causes
A number of conditions, diseases, and medical tests may make you cough up blood. These include:
Blood clot in the lung
Breathing food or other material into the lungs (pulmonary aspiration)
Bronchoscopy
with biopsy
Bronchiectasis
Bronchitis
Lung cancer
Cystic fibrosis
Inflammation of the blood vessels in the lung (vasculitis)
Injury to the arteries of the lungs
Irritation of the throat from violent coughing (small amounts of blood)
Pneumonia
or other lung infections
Pulmonary edema
Systemic lupus erythematosus
Tuberculosis
Very thin blood (from blood thinning medicines, most often at higher than recommended levels)
Home Care
Medicines that stop coughing (cough suppressants) may help if the problem comes from heavy coughing. These medicines may lead to airway blockages, so check with your health care provider before using them.
Keep track of how long you cough up blood, and how much blood is mixed with the mucus. Contact your provider any time you cough up blood, even if you do not have any other symptoms.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Get medical help right away if you cough up blood and have:
A cough that produces more than a few teaspoons of blood
Blood in your urine or stools
Chest pain
Dizziness
Fever
Lightheadedness
Severe
shortness of breath
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
In an emergency, your provider will give you treatments to control your condition. The provider will then ask you questions about your cough, such as:
How much blood are you coughing up? Are you coughing up large amounts of blood at a time?
Do you have blood-streaked mucus (phlegm)?
How many times have you coughed up blood and how often does it happen?
How long has the problem been going on? Is it worse at some time such as at night?
What other symptoms do you have?
Are you taking any blood-thinning medicines?
The provider will do a complete physical exam and check your chest and lungs. Tests that may be done include:
Bronchoscopy
, a test to view the airways
Chest
CT scan
Chest x-ray
Complete blood count
Lung biopsy
Lung scan
Pulmonary arteriography
Sputum culture
and smear
Test to see if the blood clots normally, such as
PT
/INR or
PTT
