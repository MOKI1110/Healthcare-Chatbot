Biofeedback is a technique that measures bodily functions and gives you information about them in order to help train you to control them.
Information
Biofeedback is most often based on measurements of:
Blood pressure
Brain waves (
EEG
)
Breathing
Heart rate
Muscle tension
Skin conductivity of electricity
Skin temperature
By watching these measurements, you can learn how to change these functions by relaxing or by holding pleasant images in your mind.
Patches, called electrodes, are placed on different parts of your body. They measure your heart rate, blood pressure, or other bodily function. A monitor displays the results. A tone or other sound may be used to let you know when you have reached a goal or certain state.
Your health care provider will describe a situation and guide you through relaxation techniques. The monitor lets you see how your heart rate and blood pressure change in response to being stressed or remaining relaxed.
Biofeedback teaches you how to control and change these bodily functions. By doing so, you feel more relaxed or more able to cause specific muscle relaxation processes. This may help treat conditions such as:
Anxiety and
insomnia
Constipation
Tension
and
migraine headaches
Urinary incontinence
Pain disorders such as headache or
fibromyalgia
Alcoholism and other substance use disorders
