Pneumonia is a lung infection caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi.
This article covers community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children. This type of pneumonia occurs in healthy children who have not recently been in the hospital or another health care facility.
Pneumonia that affects people in health care facilities, such as hospitals, is often caused by germs that are harder to treat. This is called
hospital-acquired pneumonia
.
Causes
Viruses are the most common cause of CAP in infants and children.
Ways your child can get CAP include:
Bacteria and viruses living in the nose, sinuses, or mouth may spread to the lungs.
Your child may breathe some of these germs directly into the lungs.
Your child
breathes in
food, liquids, or vomit from the mouth into the lungs.
Risk factors that increase a child's chance of getting CAP include:
Being younger than 6 months of age
Being born prematurely
Birth defects, such as
cleft palate
Nervous system problems, such as
seizures
or
cerebral palsy
Heart or lung disease present at birth
Weakened immune system (this can occur due to cancer treatment or disease such as HIV/AIDS)
Recent surgery or trauma
Symptoms
Common symptoms of pneumonia in children include:
Stuffed up or runny nose, headaches
Loud cough
Fever, which may be mild or high, with chills and sweating
Rapid breathing, with flared nostrils and straining of the muscles between the ribs
Wheezing
Sharp or stabbing chest pain that gets worse when breathing deeply or coughing
Low energy and
malaise
(not feeling well)
Vomiting or loss of appetite
Symptoms common in children with more severe infections include:
Blue lips and fingernails
due to too little oxygen in the blood (cyanosis)
Confusion or very hard to arouse
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will listen to your child's chest with a stethoscope. Your provider will listen for crackles or abnormal breath sounds. Tapping on the chest wall (percussion) helps your provider listen and feel for abnormal sounds.
If pneumonia is suspected, your provider will likely order a
chest x-ray
.
Other tests may include:
Oximetry - noninvasive method to determine the level of oxygen in the blood
Arterial blood gases
to see if enough oxygen is getting into your child's blood from the lungs
Blood culture
and
sputum culture
to look for the germ that may be causing the pneumonia
CBC
to check white blood cell count
Chest X-ray
or
CT scan of the chest
Bronchoscopy
-- a flexible tube with a lighted camera on the end passed down into the lungs (in rare cases)
Removing fluid
from the space between the outside lining of the lungs and the chest wall (in rare cases)
Treatment
Your provider must first decide whether your child needs to be in the hospital.
If treated in the hospital, your child will receive:
Fluids, electrolytes, and antibiotics through the veins or mouth
Oxygen therapy
Breathing treatments to help open up the airways
Your child is more likely to be admitted to the hospital if they:
Have another serious medical problem, including long-term (chronic) health issues such as
cystic fibrosis
or
diabetes mellitus
Have severe symptoms
Are unable to eat or drink
Are less than 3 to 6 months old
Have pneumonia due to a harmful germ
Have taken antibiotics at home, but isn't getting better
If your child has CAP caused by bacteria, antibiotics will be given. Antibiotics are not given for pneumonia caused by a virus. This is because antibiotics do not kill viruses. Other medicines, such as antivirals, may be given if your child has the flu.
Many children can be treated at home. If so, your child may need to take medicines such as antibiotics or antivirals.
When giving antibiotics to your child:
Make sure your child does not miss any doses.
Make sure your child takes all the medicine as directed. Do not stop giving the medicine, even when your child starts feeling better.
Do not give your child cough medicine or cold medicine unless your provider says it is OK. Coughing helps the body get rid of mucus from the lungs.
Other home care measures include:
To bring mucus up from the lungs, tap your child's chest gently a few times a day. This can be done as your child is lying down.
Have your child take a couple of deep breaths 2 or 3 times every hour. Deep breaths help open up your child's lungs.
Make sure your child drinks plenty of liquids. Ask your provider how much your child should drink each day.
Have your child get plenty of rest, including napping throughout the day if needed.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Most children improve in 7 to 10 days with treatment. Children who have severe pneumonia with complications may need treatment for 2 to 3 weeks. Children at risk for severe pneumonia include:
Children whose immune system does not work well
Children with lung or heart disease
Possible Complications
In some cases, more serious problems may develop, including:
Life-threatening changes in the lungs that require a breathing machine (
ventilator
)
Fluid around the lung
, which
can become infected
Lung
abscesses
Bacteria in blood (bacteremia)
Your provider may order another x-ray at some time after treatment is done. This is to make sure that your child's lungs are clear. It may take many weeks for the x-ray to clear up. Your child may feel better for a while before the x-rays are clear.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if your child has the following symptoms:
Bad cough
Difficulty breathing (
wheezing
, grunting, rapid breathing)
Vomiting
Loss of appetite
Fever and chills
Breathing (respiratory) symptoms that get worse
Chest pain that gets worse when coughing or breathing in
Signs of pneumonia and a weak immune system (such as with HIV or
chemotherapy
)
Worsening symptoms after starting to get better
Prevention
Teach older children to wash their hands often:
Before eating food
After blowing their nose
After going to the bathroom
After playing with friends
After coming in contact with people who are sick
Vaccines may help prevent some types of pneumonia. Be sure to get your child vaccinated with:
Pneumococcal vaccine
Flu vaccine
Pertussis vaccine
Hib vaccine
COVID-19 vaccine
When infants are too young to be immunized, parents or caregivers can get themselves immunized against vaccine-preventable pneumonia.
