Abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB) is bleeding from the uterus that is longer than usual or that occurs at an irregular time. Bleeding may be heavier or lighter than usual and occur often or randomly.
AUB can occur:
As spotting or bleeding between your periods
After sex
If you period goes on for more days than your normal period
If your period is heavier than normal
After
menopause
It does not occur during pregnancy. Bleeding during pregnancy has different causes. If you have any bleeding when you are pregnant, be sure to contact your health care provider.
Causes
Every woman's menstrual cycle is different.
On average, a woman's period (menstrual flow) occurs every 28 days, although cycles may vary from 24 to 34 days.
Menstruation flow normally last about 4 to 7 days.
Young girls may get their periods anywhere from 21 to 45 days or more apart.
Women in their 40s may start to have their period less often or have the interval between their periods decrease.
For most women, female hormone levels change every month. The hormones estrogen and progesterone are released as part of the process of ovulation. When a woman ovulates, an egg is released.
AUB can occur when the ovaries do not release an egg. Changes in hormone levels cause your period to be later or earlier. Your period may sometimes be heavier than normal.
AUB is more common in teenagers or in premenopausal women. Women who are overweight also may be more likely to have AUB.
In many women, AUB is caused by a hormone imbalance. It can also occur due to following causes:
Thickening of the uterine wall or lining
Uterine fibroids
Uterine polyps
Cancers of
ovary
, uterus,
cervix
, or vagina
Bleeding disorders or problems with blood clotting
Polycystic ovary syndrome
Severe weight loss
Hormonal birth control, such as birth control pills or intrauterine devices (IUD)
Excessive weight gain or loss (more than 10 pounds or 4.5 kilograms)
Infection of the uterus or cervix
Symptoms
AUB is unpredictable. The bleeding may be very heavy or light, and can occur often or randomly.
Symptoms of AUB may include:
Bleeding or spotting from the vagina between periods
Periods that occur less than 28 days apart (more common) or more than 35 days apart
Time between periods changes each month
Heavier bleeding (such as passing large clots, needing to change protection during the night, soaking through a sanitary pad or tampon every hour for 2 to 3 hours in a row)
Bleeding that lasts for more days than normal or for more than 7 days
Other symptoms caused by changes in hormone levels may include:
Excessive growth of body hair in a male pattern (
hirsutism
)
Hot flashes
Mood swings
Tenderness and dryness of the vagina
A woman may feel tired or fatigued if she loses too much blood over time. This is a symptom of
anemia
.
Exams and Tests
Your provider will rule out other possible causes of irregular bleeding. You will likely have a pelvic exam and Pap/HPV test. Other tests that may be done include:
Complete blood count
(CBC)
Blood clotting profile
Liver function tests
(LFT)
Fasting blood glucose or hemoglobin A1C
Hormone tests, for
FSH
,
LH
, male hormone (androgen) levels, prolactin, and progesterone
Pregnancy test
Thyroid function tests
Your provider may recommend the following:
Culture to look for infection
Biopsy
to check for precancer, cancer, or to help decide on hormone treatment
Hysteroscopy
, performed in your provider's office to look into the uterus through the vagina
Ultrasound
to look for problems in the uterus or pelvis
Saline infusion sonohysterogram to further evaluate the uterine cavity for a source of the bleeding
Treatment
Treatment may include one or more of the following:
Low-dose
birth control pills
Hormone therapy
High-dose estrogen therapy for women with very heavy bleeding
Intrauterine device (IUD)
that releases the hormone progestin
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) taken just before the period starts
Tranexamic acid, which is a prescription medicine that treats heavy menstrual bleeding. It comes in a tablet and is taken each month at the start of the menstrual period.
Surgery, if the cause of the bleeding is a polyp or fibroid
Your provider may prescribe iron supplements if you have anemia.
If you want to get pregnant, you may be given medicine to stimulate ovulation.
Women with severe symptoms that don't improve or who have a cancerous or precancerous diagnosis may require other procedures such as:
Surgical
procedure
to destroy or remove the lining of the uterus
Hysterectomy to remove the uterus
Outlook (Prognosis)
Hormone therapy often relieves symptoms. Treatment may not be needed if you do not develop anemia due to blood loss. A treatment focused on the cause of the bleeding is often immediately effective. That is why it's important to understand the cause.
Possible Complications
Complications that may occur:
Infertility
(inability to get pregnant)
Severe anemia due to a lot of blood loss over time
Increased risk for
endometrial cancer
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have unusual vaginal bleeding.
