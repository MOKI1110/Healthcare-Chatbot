Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)

Immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a
bleeding disorder
in which the immune system destroys platelets, which are necessary for normal blood clotting. People with the disease have too few platelets in the blood.
Causes
ITP occurs when certain immune system cells produce
antibodies
against platelets. Platelets help your blood clot by clumping together to plug small holes in damaged blood vessels.
The antibodies attach to the platelets. The body destroys the platelets that carry the antibodies.
In children, the disease sometimes follows a viral infection. In adults, it is more often a long-term (chronic) disease and can occur after a viral infection, with use of certain medicines, during pregnancy, or as part of an immune disorder.
ITP affects women more often than men. It is more common in children than adults. In children, the disease affects boys and girls equally.
Symptoms
ITP symptoms can include any of the following:
Abnormally heavy periods in women
Bleeding into the skin
, often around the shins, causing a skin rash that looks like pinpoint red spots (petechial rash)
Easy bruising
Nosebleed or bleeding in the mouth
Exams and Tests
Blood tests will be done to check your
platelet count
.
A
bone marrow aspiration
or
biopsy
may also be done.
Treatment
In children, the disease usually goes away without treatment. Some children may need treatment.
Adults are usually started on a steroid medicine called prednisone or dexamethasone. In some cases, surgery to remove the spleen (
splenectomy
) is recommended. This increases the platelet count in about half of people. However, other medicine treatments are usually recommended instead.
If the disease does not get better with prednisone, other treatments may include:
Infusions of high-dose gamma globulin (an immune factor)
Medicines that suppress the immune system
Anti-RhD therapy for people with certain blood types
Medicines that stimulate the bone marrow to make more platelets
People with ITP should not take aspirin, ibuprofen, or warfarin, because these medicines interfere with platelet function or blood clotting, and bleeding may occur.
Support Groups
More information and support for people with ITP and their families can be found at:

Outlook (Prognosis)
With treatment, the chance of remission (a symptom-free period) is good. In rare cases, ITP may become a long-term condition in adults and reappear, even after a symptom-free period.
Possible Complications
Sudden and severe loss of blood from the digestive tract may occur. Bleeding into the brain may also occur.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if severe bleeding occurs, or if other new symptoms develop.
