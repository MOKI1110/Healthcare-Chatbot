Fecal smear is a laboratory test of a stool sample. This test is done to check for bacteria and parasites. Presence of organisms in stool shows diseases in the digestive tract.
How the Test is Performed
A stool sample is needed.
There are many ways to collect the sample. You can collect the sample:
On plastic wrap: Place the wrap loosely over the toilet bowl so that it is held in place by the toilet seat. Put the sample in a clean container given to you by your health care provider.
Into a plastic container the lab may give you.
In a test kit that supplies a special toilet tissue: Put the sample in a clean container given to you by your provider.
Do not mix urine, water, or toilet tissue with the sample.
For children wearing diapers:
Line the diaper with plastic wrap.
Position the plastic wrap so that it will prevent urine and stool from mixing. This will provide a better sample.
Put the sample in a container given to you by your provider.
Make sure you follow your provider's instructions for returning the sample. Return the sample to the lab as soon as possible.
The stool sample is sent to a lab where a small amount is placed on a slide. The slide is placed under a microscope and checked for the presence of bacteria, fungi, parasites, or viruses. A stain may be placed on the sample that highlights certain germs or cells under the microscope.
