Rickettsialpox is a disease spread by a mite. It causes a chickenpox-like
rash
on the body.
Causes
Rickettsialpox is caused by the bacteria,
Rickettsia akari
. It is commonly found in the United States in New York City and other cities. It also has been seen in Europe, South Africa, Korea, and Russia.
The bacteria are spread by the bite of a mite that lives on mice.
Symptoms
The disease begins at the site of the
mite bite
as a painless, firm, red lump (
nodule
). The nodule develops into a fluid-filled
blister
that bursts and crusts over. This lump may be up to 1 inch (in) or 2.5 centimeters (cm) wide. These lumps usually appear on the face, trunk, arms, and legs. They do not appear on the palms of hands and soles of feet. Symptoms usually develop 6 to 15 days after coming in contact with the bacteria.
Other symptoms may include:
Eye discomfort in bright light (
photophobia
)
Fever and chills
Headache
Muscle pain
Rash that looks like
chickenpox
Sweating
Runny nose
Sore throat
Cough
Enlarged lymph nodes
Loss of appetite
Nausea or vomiting
The rash is not painful and usually clears within a week.
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will do an exam to look for a rash similar to the one in chickenpox.
If rickettsialpox is suspected, these tests will likely be done:Â
Complete blood count
(CBC)
Tests of blood serum for antibodies to the bacteria (serologic studies)
Swabbing and
culture of the rash
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to cure the infection by taking antibiotics. Doxycycline is the medicine of choice. Treatment with antibiotics shortens the duration of symptoms usually to 24 to 48 hours.
Without treatment, the disease usually resolves within 7 to 10 days.
Outlook (Prognosis)
A full recovery is expected when antibiotics are taken as instructed.
Possible Complications
There are usually no complications if theÂ infection is treated.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you or your child has symptoms of rickettsialpox.
Prevention
Controlling mice helps prevent the spread of rickettsialpox.
