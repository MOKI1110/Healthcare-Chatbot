Starch is a substance used for cooking. Another kind of starch is used to add firmness and shape to clothing. Starch poisoning occurs when someone swallows starch. This can be by accident or on purpose.
This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.
Poisonous Ingredient
Cooking and laundry starch are both made from vegetable products, most commonly:
Corn
Potatoes
Rice
Wheat
Both are usually considered nonpoisonous (nontoxic), but some older laundry starches may contain:
Borax
Magnesium salts
Polishing agents
Where Found
Starch is found in:
Cooking starch
Cosmetic products
Laundry products (laundry starch)
Cooking starch and laundry starch are different substances. There are many brand names for both. Other products may also contain starch.

Swallowing cooking starch can cause a blockage in the intestines and stomach pain.
Swallowing laundry starch over a very long period of time can cause the symptoms below in different parts of the body:
BLADDER AND KIDNEYS
Decreased urine output
No urine output
EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT
Yellow eyes (jaundice)
HEART AND BLOOD
Collapse
Fever
Low blood pressure
SKIN

(decreased level of consciousness and lack of responsiveness)
Convulsions (seizures)
Drowsiness
Twitching of the arms, hands, legs, or feet
Twitching of the facial muscles
If the starch is inhaled, it may cause wheezing, rapid breathing, shallow breathing, and chest pain.
If the starch contacts the eyes, it may cause redness, tearing, and burning.
Home Care
Seek medical help right away. Do not make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to.
If the person swallowed the starch, give them water or milk right away, unless a provider tells you not to. Do not give anything to drink if the person has symptoms that make it hard to swallow. These include vomiting, convulsions, or a decreased level of alertness. If the starch is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.
Before Calling Emergency
Have this information ready:
Person's age, weight, and condition
Name of the product (ingredients, if known)
Time it was swallowed or inhaled
Amount swallowed or inhaled
Poison Control
Your local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Bring the starch with you to the hospital, if possible.
For cooking starch:
The person will probably not need to go to the emergency room unless they cannot drink fluids or are in severe pain.
For laundry starch:
The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated.
The person may receive:
Activated charcoal
Blood and urine tests
Breathing support, including a tube through the mouth into the lungs and a breathing machine (ventilator)
Chest x-ray
ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)
Fluids through a vein (by IV)
Laxatives
Medicine to treat symptoms
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well someone does depends on how much starch they swallowed and how quickly they receive treatment. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery. Cooking starch is generally not harmful, and recovery is likely. Poisoning from laundry starch is more serious.
