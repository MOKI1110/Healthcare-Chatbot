Graves disease

Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder that leads to an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism). An
autoimmune disorder
is a condition that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.
Causes
The thyroid gland is an important organ of the
endocrine system
. The gland is located at the front of the neck above where the collarbones meet. This gland releases the hormones
thyroxine
(T4) and
triiodothyronine
(T3), which control body
metabolism
. Controlling metabolism is important for regulating mood, weight, and mental and physical energy levels.
When the body makes too much thyroid hormone, the condition is called
hyperthyroidism
. (An underactive thyroid leads to
hypothyroidism
.)
Graves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It is due to an abnormal immune system response that causes the thyroid gland to produce too much thyroid hormone. Graves disease is most common in women over age 20. But the disorder can occur at any age and can affect men as well.
Symptoms
Younger people may have these symptoms:
Anxiety or nervousness, as well as problems sleeping
Breast enlargement in men (possible)
Problems concentrating
Fatigue
Frequent bowel movements
Hair loss
Heat intolerance
and increased sweating
Increased appetite
, despite having weight loss
Irregular menstrual periods in women
Muscle weakness of the hips and shoulders
Moodiness, including irritability and anger
Palpitations
(sensation of a strong or unusual heartbeat)
Rapid or irregular heartbeat
Shortness of breath
with activity
Shaking hands (
tremors
)
Weight loss
Many people with Graves disease have problems with their eyes:
The eyeballs may seem to be bulging out and may be painful.
Eyes can feel irritated, itchy, or tear more frequently.
Double vision may be present.
Decreased vision and damage to the cornea can also occur in severe cases.
Older people may have these symptoms:
Rapid or
irregular heartbeat
Chest pain
Memory loss or decreased concentration
Weakness and fatigue
Exams and Tests
During the physical exam, your health care provider may find:
You have an increased heart rate
Your thyroid gland may be enlarged (goiter)
Other tests include:
Blood tests to measure levels of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), T3, and free T4
Radioactive iodine uptake
and
scan
This disease may also affect the following test results:
Orbit CT scan
or ultrasound
Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin (
TSI
)
Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody
Anti-TSH receptor antibody (TRAb)
Treatment
Treatment is aimed at controlling your overactive thyroid. You may receive one or more types of treatment.
Beta-blocker medicines may help treat:
Rapid heart rate
Sweating
Anxiety
They may be given until the hyperthyroidism is controlled.
Antithyroid medicines:
Block or change how the thyroid gland uses iodine
May be used to control the overactive thyroid gland before surgery or radioiodine therapy
May be used as a long-term treatment
Radioactive iodine is given by mouth. It then concentrates in the overactive thyroid tissue and causes damage.
Surgery may be done to remove the thyroid.
If you have had radioactive iodine treatment or surgery, you will need to take replacement thyroid hormones for the rest of your life. This is because these treatments destroy or remove the gland.
TREATMENT OF THE EYES
Some of the eye problems related to Graves disease often improve after treatment with medicines (including selenium),Â radiation, or surgery. Radioiodine therapy can sometimes make eye problems worse. Eye problems are worse in people who smoke, even after the hyperthyroidism is treated.
Sometimes, prednisone is needed to reduce eye irritation and swelling. Prednisone is a steroid medicine that suppresses the immune system. Other treatments to suppress the immune system may be needed. Ask your provider if these would help you.
Sunglasses, cool compresses, and eye drops may reduce eye irritation. In rare cases, surgery or radiation therapy (different from radioactive iodine) may be needed to prevent further damage to the eye and loss of vision.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Graves disease often responds well to treatment. Thyroid surgery or radioactive iodine often will cause an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism). Without getting the correct dosage of thyroid hormone replacement, hypothyroidism can lead to:
Depression
Mental and physical sluggishness
Weight gain
Dry skin
Constipation
Cold intolerance
Abnormal menstrual periods in women
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of Graves disease or your eye problems or other symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment.
Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have symptoms of hyperthyroidism with:
Decrease in consciousness
Fever
Rapid, irregular heartbeat
Sudden shortness of breath
