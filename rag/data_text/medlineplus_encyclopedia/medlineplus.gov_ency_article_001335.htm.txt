Peritonitis is an inflammation (irritation) of the peritoneum. This is the thin tissue that lines the inner wall of the abdomen and covers most of the abdominal organs.
Causes
Peritonitis is caused by a collection of blood, body fluids, or pus in the belly (
abdomen
).
One type is called
spontaneous bacterial peritonitis
(SBP). It occurs in people with
ascites
. Ascites is the buildup of fluid in the space between the lining of the abdomen and the organs. This problem is found in people with long-term liver damage, certain cancers, and heart failure.
Peritonitis may be a result of other problems. This is known as
secondary peritonitis
. Problems that may lead to this type of peritonitis include:
Trauma or wounds to the belly
Ruptured appendix
Ruptured diverticula
Infection after any surgery in the belly
Symptoms
Your belly is very painful or tender. The pain may become worse when your belly is touched or when you move.
Your belly may look or feel bloated. This is called
abdominal distention
.
Other symptoms may include:
Fever and chills
Passing little or no stools or gas
Excessive fatigue
Passing less urine
Nausea and vomiting
Racing heartbeat
Shortness of breath
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. The abdomen is usually tender. It may feel firm or board-like. People with peritonitis usually curl up or refuse to let anyone touch the area.
Blood tests, x-rays, and
CT scans
may be done. If there is a lot of fluid in the belly area, your provider may use a needle to remove some and send it for testing.
Treatment
The cause must be identified and treated right away. Treatment typically involves surgery, antibiotics, or both.
Possible Complications
Peritonitis can be life threatening and may cause complications. These depend on the type of peritonitis.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have symptoms of peritonitis.
