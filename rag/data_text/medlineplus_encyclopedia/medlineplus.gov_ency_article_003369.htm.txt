CSF analysis

Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is a group of lab tests that measure chemicals in the cerebrospinal fluid. CSF is a clear fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord. The tests may look for cells, proteins, sugar (glucose), and other substances.
How the Test is Performed
A sample of CSF is needed. A
lumbar puncture
, also called a spinal tap, is the most common way to collect this sample. Less common ways to take a fluid sample include:
Cisternal puncture
Removal of CSF from a tube that is already in the CSF, such as a shunt, ventricular drain, or pain pump
Ventricular puncture
After the sample is taken, it is sent to the lab for evaluation.
Your health care provider may ask you to lie flat for at least one hour after the lumbar puncture. You may develop a headache after the lumbar puncture. If it happens, fluids and drinking caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea or soda may help.
How to Prepare for the Test
Your provider will tell you how to prepare for the
lumbar puncture
. Make sure to let them know all of the medicines you are taking in case any adjustment to the procedure is needed. It is important to report any blood thinners, aspirin, or herbal medicines too.
Why the Test is Performed
Analysis of CSF can help detect certain conditions and diseases. All of the following can be, but are not always, measured in a sample of CSF:
Antibodies to and DNA of common viruses
Bacteria (including that which causes syphilis, using a
VDRL test
)
Cell count
Chloride
Cryptococcal
antigen
Glucose
Glutamine
Lactate dehydrogenase
Oligoclonal banding
to look for specific proteins
Myelin basic protein
Total protein
Whether there are cancerous cells present (CSF cytology)
Opening pressure
Normal Results
Normal results include:
Antibodies and DNA of common viruses: None
Bacteria: No bacteria grows in a lab culture
Cancerous cells: No cancerous cells present
Cell count: 0 to 5 white blood cells (all mononuclear) and 0 red blood cells
Chloride: 115 to 130 mEq/L (115 to 130 mmol/L)
Fungus: None
Gamma globulin: 3% to 12% of the total protein
Glucose: 50 to 80 mg/dL or 2.77 to 4.44 mmol/L (or greater than two-thirds of blood sugar level)
Glutamine: 6 to 15 mg/dL (410.5 to 1,026 micromol/L)
Lactate dehydrogenase: less than 40 U/L
Oligoclonal bands: 0 or 1 bands that are not present in a matched serum sample
Protein: 15 to 60 mg/dL (0.15 to 0.6 g/L)
Opening pressure: 90 to 180 mm of water
Myelin basic protein: Less than 4ng/mL
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different lab. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens.
What Abnormal Results Mean
An abnormal CSF analysis result may be due to many different causes, including:
Cancer
Encephalitis
(due to Herpes simplex,
West Nile
, and Eastern Equine Encephalitis virus)
Hepatic encephalopathy
High blood sugar (hyperglycemia)
Infection
Inflammation
Reye syndrome
Meningitis
due to bacteria, fungus, tuberculosis, or a virus
Multiple sclerosis
Â (MS)
Alzheimer disease
Pseudotumor cerebrii
Normal pressure hydrocephalus
