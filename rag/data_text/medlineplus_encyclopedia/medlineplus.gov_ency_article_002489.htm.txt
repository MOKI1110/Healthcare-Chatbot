Poison Control
Your local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the container that contains trisodium phosphate with you to the hospital, if possible.
Treatment depends on how the poisoning occurred. The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated. Pain medicines will be given.
For swallowed poison, the person may receive:
Endoscopy (involves placing a tiny flexible camera into the throat to see burns in the esophagus and the stomach)
Chest x-ray
ECG
(electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)
Fluids by IV (through a vein)
Medicines to treat symptoms
For inhaled poisons, the person may receive:
Breathing support, including oxygen and a tube through the nose or mouth into the lungs
Bronchoscopy (involves placing a tiny flexible camera into the throat to see burns in the airways and lungs)
Chest x-ray
ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)
Fluids by IV (through a vein)
Medicine to treat symptoms
For skin exposure, the person may receive:
Skin debridement (surgical removal of burned skin)
Washing of the skin (irrigation) every few hours for several days
Ointments applied to the skin
For eye exposure, the person may receive:
Extensive irrigation to flush out the poison
Medicines
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well a person does depends on the amount of poison exposure (swallowed, inhaled, on the skin, or in the eyes) and how quickly treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.
Severe damage to the mouth, throat, eyes, lungs, esophagus, nose, and stomach are possible. The long-term outcome depends on the extent of this damage. Damage to the esophagus and stomach continues to occur for several weeks after the poison was swallowed. Death may occur as long as a month later.
Keep all poisons in their original or childproof container, with labels visible, and out of the reach of children.
