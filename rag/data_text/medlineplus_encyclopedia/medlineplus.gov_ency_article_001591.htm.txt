Craniotabes is a softening of the skull bones.
Causes
Craniotabes can be a normal finding in infants, particularly premature infants. It may occur in up to one third of all newborn infants.
Craniotabes is harmless in a newborn, unless it is associated with other problems. These can include
rickets
and brittle bones (
osteogenesis imperfecta
).
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Soft areas of the skull, especially along the suture line
Soft areas pop in and out
Bones may feel soft, flexible, and thin along the suture lines
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will press the bone along the area where the bones of the skull come together. The bone often pops in and out, similar to pressing on a Ping-Pong ball if the problem is present.
No testing is done unless osteogenesis imperfecta or rickets is suspected.
Treatment
Craniotabes that are not associated with other conditions are not treated.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Complete healing is expected.
Possible Complications
There are no complications in most cases.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
This problem is most often found when the baby is examined during a
well-baby check
. Contact your provider if you notice that your child has signs of craniotabes (to check for other problems).
Prevention
Most of the time, craniotabes is not preventable. Exceptions are when the condition is associated with rickets and osteogenesis imperfecta.
Alternative Names
Congenital cranial osteoporosis
