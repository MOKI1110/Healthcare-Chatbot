Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency

Alpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a condition in which the body does not make enough of AAT, a protein that protects the lungs and liver from damage. The condition can lead to
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD) and liver disease (
cirrhosis
).
Causes
AAT is a type of protein called a protease inhibitor. AAT is made in the liver and it works to protect the lungs and liver.
AAT deficiency means there is not enough of this protein in the body. It is caused by a genetic variant. The condition is most common among Europeans and North Americans of European descent.
Adults with severe AAT deficiency will develop emphysema, sometimes before 40 years of age. Smoking can increase the risk for emphysema and make it occur earlier.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Shortness of breath
with and without exertion, and other symptoms of COPD
Symptoms of liver failure
Loss of weight
without trying
Wheezing
Coughing
Exams and Tests
A physical exam may reveal a barrel-shaped chest, wheezing, or decreased breath sounds. The following tests may also help with diagnosis:
AAT
blood test
Arterial blood gases
Chest x-ray
CT scan of the chest
Genetic testing
Lung function tests
Your health care provider may suspect you of having this condition if you develop:
COPD before age 45
COPD but you have never smoked or been exposed to toxins
COPD and you have a family history of the condition
Cirrhosis and no other cause can be found
Cirrhosis and you have a family history of liver disease
Treatment
Treatment for AAT deficiency involves replacing the missing AAT protein. The protein is given through a vein each week or every 4 weeks. This is only slightly effective at preventing more lung damage in people without end-stage disease. This procedure is called augmentation therapy.
If you smoke, you need
to quit
.
Other treatments are also used for COPD and cirrhosis.
Lung transplant can be used for severe lung disease, and liver transplant can be used for severe cirrhosis.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Some people with this deficiency will not develop liver or lung disease. If you quit smoking, you can slow the progression of the lung disease.
COPD and cirrhosis can be life threatening.
Possible Complications
Complications of AAT deficiency include:
Bronchiectasis
(damage of the large airways)
COPD
Liver failure or cancer
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of AAT deficiency.
