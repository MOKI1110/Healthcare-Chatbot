Aspergillosis is an infection or
allergic response
due to the aspergillus fungus.
Causes
Aspergillosis is caused by a fungus called aspergillus. The fungus is often found growing on dead leaves, stored grain, compost piles, or in other decaying vegetation. It can also be found on marijuana leaves.
Although most people are often exposed to aspergillus, infections caused by the fungus rarely occur in people who have a healthy immune system.
There are several forms of aspergillosis:
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is an allergic reaction to the fungus. This infection usually develops in people who already have lung problems such as asthma or cystic fibrosis.
Aspergilloma
is a growth (fungus ball) that develops in an area of past lung disease or lung scarring such as
tuberculosis
or lung abscess.
Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a serious infection with pneumonia. It can spread to other parts of the body. This infection occurs most often in people with a weakened immune system. This can be from cancer, AIDS, leukemia, an organ transplant, chemotherapy, or other conditions or medicines that lower the number or function of white blood cells or weaken the immune system.
Symptoms
Symptoms depend on the type of infection.
Symptoms of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis may include:
Cough
Coughing up blood or brownish mucus plugs
Fever
General ill feeling (malaise)
Wheezing
Weight loss
Other symptoms depend on the part of the body affected, and may include:
Bone pain
Chest pain
Chills
Decreased urine output
Headaches
Increased phlegm production, which may be bloody
Shortness of breath
Skin sores (lesions)
Vision problems
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about the symptoms.
Tests to diagnose aspergillus infection include:
Aspergillus antibody test
Chest x-ray
Complete blood count
CT scan
Galactomannan (a sugar molecule shed from the fungus that is sometimes found in the blood)
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) blood level
Lung function tests
Sputum stain and culture for fungus (looking for aspergillus)
Tissue
biopsy
Treatment
A fungus ball is usually not treated with antifungal medicines unless there is bleeding into the lung tissue. In such a case, surgery and medicines are needed.
Invasive aspergillosis is treated with several weeks of an antifungal medicine. It can be given by mouth or IV (into a vein).
Endocarditis
caused by aspergillus is treated by surgically replacing the infected heart valves. Long-term antifungal medicines are also needed.
Allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is treated with medicines that suppress the immune system (immunosuppressive medicines), such as prednisone, typically in conjunction with antifungals.
Outlook (Prognosis)
With treatment, people with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis usually get better over time. It is common for the disease to come back (relapse) and need repeat treatment.
If invasive aspergillosis does not get better with treatment using medicine, it eventually leads to death. The outlook for invasive aspergillosis also depends on the person's underlying disease and immune system health.
Possible Complications
Health problems from the disease or treatment include:
Amphotericin B can cause kidney damage and unpleasant side effects such as fever and chills
Bronchiectasis
(permanent scarring and enlargement of the small sacs in the lungs)
Invasive lung disease can cause massive bleeding from the lung
Mucus plugs in the airways
Permanent airway blockage
Respiratory failure
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of aspergillosis or if you have a weakened immune system and develop a fever.
Prevention
Precautions should be taken when using medicines that suppress the immune system.
