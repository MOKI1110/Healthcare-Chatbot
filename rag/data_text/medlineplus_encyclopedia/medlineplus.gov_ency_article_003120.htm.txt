Abdominal pain

Abdominal pain is pain that you feel anywhere between your chest and groin. This is often referred to as the stomach region or belly.
Considerations
Almost everyone has pain in the abdomen at some point. Most of the time, it is not serious.
How bad your pain is does not always reflect the seriousness of the condition causing the pain.
For example, you might have very bad abdominal pain if you have gas or stomach cramps due to
viral gastroenteritis
.
However, potentially fatal conditions, such as colon cancer or early
appendicitis
, may only cause mild pain or no pain.
Other ways to describe pain in your abdomen include:
Generalized pain -- This means that you feel it in more than half of your belly. This type of pain is more typical for a stomach virus, indigestion, or gas. If the pain becomes more severe, it may be caused by a blockage of the intestines.
Localized pain -- This is pain found in only one area of your belly. It is more likely to be a sign of a problem in an organ, such as the appendix, gallbladder, or stomach.
Cramp-like pain -- This type of pain is not serious most of the time. It is likely to be due to gas and bloating, and is often followed by diarrhea. More worrisome signs include pain that occurs more often, lasts more than 24 hours, or occurs with a fever or rectal bleeding.
Colicky pain -- This type of pain comes in waves. It very often starts and ends suddenly, and is often severe. Kidney stones and gallstones are common causes of this type of belly pain.
Causes
Many different conditions can cause abdominal pain. The key is to know when you need to get medical care right away. Sometimes, you may only need to contact a health care provider if your symptoms continue.

Home Care
You can try the following home care steps to ease mild abdominal pain:
Sip water or other clear fluids. You may have sports drinks in small amounts. People with diabetes must check their blood sugar often and adjust their medicines as needed.
Avoid solid food for the first few hours.
If you have been vomiting, wait 6 hours, and then eat small amounts of mild foods such as rice, applesauce, or crackers. Avoid dairy products.
If the pain is high up in your abdomen and occurs after meals, antacids may help, especially if you feel heartburn or indigestion. Avoid citrus, high-fat foods, fried or greasy foods, tomato products, caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated beverages.
DO NOT take any medicine without talking to your provider.
These additional steps may help prevent some types of abdominal pain:
Drink plenty of water each day.
Eat small meals more frequently.
Exercise regularly.
Limit foods that produce gas.
Make sure that your meals are well-balanced and high in fiber. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables.
