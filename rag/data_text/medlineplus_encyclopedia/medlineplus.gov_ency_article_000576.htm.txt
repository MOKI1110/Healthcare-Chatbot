Immune hemolytic anemia

Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to the body's tissues.
Red blood cells last for about 120 days before the body gets rid of them. In hemolytic anemia, red blood cells in the blood are destroyed earlier than normal.
Immune hemolytic
anemia
occurs when antibodies form against the body's own red blood cells and destroy them. This happens because the immune system mistakenly recognizes these blood cells as foreign.
Causes
Possible causes include:
Certain chemicals, medicines, and toxins
Infections
Transfusion of blood from a donor with a blood type that does not match
Certain cancers
When
antibodies
form against red blood cells for no reason, the condition is called idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia.
The antibodies may also be caused by:
A complication of another disease
Past blood transfusions
Pregnancy (if the baby's blood type is different from the mother's)
Risk factors are related to the causes.
Symptoms
You may not have symptoms if the anemia is mild. If the problem develops slowly, symptoms that may occur first include:
Feeling weak or tired more often than usual, or with exercise
Headaches
Problems concentrating or thinking
If the anemia gets worse, symptoms may include:
Lightheadedness when you stand up
Pale skin color (
pallor
)
Shortness of breath
Sore tongue
Exams and Tests
You may need the following tests:
Absolute
reticulocyte count
Direct or indirect
Coombs test
Hemoglobin
in the urine
LDH
(level of this enzyme rises as a result of tissue damage)
Red blood cell count
(RBC), hemoglobin, and
hematocrit
Serum
bilirubin
level
Serum haptoglobin
Donath-Landsteiner test
Cold agglutinins
Platelet count
Protein electrophoresis - serum
Pyruvate kinase
Treatment
The first treatment tried is most often a steroid medicine, such as prednisone. If a steroid medicine does not improve the condition, treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or removal of the spleen (splenectomy) may be considered.
You may receive treatment to suppress your immune system if you do not respond to steroids. Medicines such as azathioprine (Imuran), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), and rituximab (Rituxan) have been used.
Blood transfusions are given with caution, because the blood may not be compatible and it may cause more red blood cell destruction.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The disease may start quickly and be very serious, or it may stay mild and not need special treatment.
In most people, steroids or splenectomy can totally or partially control anemia.
Possible Complications
Severe anemia rarely leads to death. Severe infection may occur as a complication of treatment with steroids, other medicines that suppress the immune system, or splenectomy. These treatments impair the body's ability to fight infection.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you have unexplained fatigue or chest pain, or signs of infection.
Prevention
Screening for antibodies in donated blood and in the recipient may prevent hemolytic anemia related to blood transfusions.
