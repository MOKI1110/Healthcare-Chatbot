You should visit your health care provider regularly, even if you feel healthy. The purpose of these visits is to:
Screen for medical issues
Assess your risk for future medical problems
Encourage a healthy lifestyle
Update vaccinations and other preventive care services
Help you get to know your provider in case of an illness
Information
Even if you feel fine, you should still see your provider for regular checkups. These visits can help you avoid problems in the future. For example, the only way to find out if you have
high blood pressure
is to have it checked regularly. High blood sugar and
high cholesterol
level also may not have any symptoms in the early stages. Simple blood tests can check for these conditions.
There are specific times when you should see your provider or receive specific health screenings. The US Preventive Services Task Force publishes a list of recommended screenings. Below are screening guidelines for men ages 40 to 64.
BLOOD PRESSURE SCREENING
Have your
blood pressure
checked at least once every year. Watch for blood pressure screenings in your area. Ask your provider if you can stop in to have your blood pressure checked.Â You can also check your blood pressure using the automated machines at some local grocery stores and pharmacies.
Ask your provider if you need your blood pressure checked more often if:
You have diabetes,
heart disease
,
kidney problems
, or are overweight or have certain other health conditions
You have a first-degree relative with high blood pressure
You are Black
Your blood pressure top number is from 120 to 129 mm Hg, or the bottom number is from 70 to 79 mm Hg
If the top number is 130 mm Hg or greater, but lower than 140 mm Hg or the bottom number is 80 mm Hg or greater but lower than 90 mm Hg, this is considered stage 1 hypertension. Readings above these are considered stage 2 hypertension. Schedule an appointment with your provider to learn how you can reduce your blood pressure. Record your blood pressure numbers and bring this information to share with your provider.
CHOLESTEROL SCREENING
Begin
cholesterol screening
between ages 20 and 35, depending on your risk factors for heart disease.
Repeat cholesterol testing or other additional monitoring should take place:
Every 5 years for men with normal cholesterol levels
More often if changes occur in lifestyle (including weight gain and diet)
More often if you have diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or blood flow problems in the legs or feet, or certain other conditions
Your provider may recommend testing more often if you are taking medicines to control high cholesterol.
COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING
If you are under age 45, talk to your provider about getting
screened
. You may need to be screened if you have a strong family history of colon cancer or polyps. Screening may also be considered if you have risk factors such as a history of inflammatory bowel disease or polyps.
If you are age 45 to 75, you should be screened for
colorectal cancer
. There are several screening tests available:
A stool-based fecal occult blood (FOBT) or fecal immunochemical test (
FIT
) every year
A stool DNA test every 1 to 3 years
Flexible
sigmoidoscopy
every 5 years or every 10 years with stool occult blood testing (FOBT or FIT) done every year
CT colonography (
virtual colonoscopy
) every 5 years
Colonoscopy
every 10 years
You may need a colonoscopy more often if you have risk factors for colorectal cancer, such as:
Ulcerative colitis
A personal or family history of colorectal cancer or polyps
A history of growths in your colon called
adenomatous polyps
A family history of inherited colorectal cancer syndromes such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC).
DENTAL EXAM
Go to the dentist once or twice every year for an exam and cleaning. Your dentist will evaluate if you have a need for more frequent visits.
PREDIABETES AND TYPE 2 DIABETES SCREENING
You should be screened for prediabetes and type 2 diabetes starting at age 35. Screening should be repeated every 3 years if you are overweight or have obesity.
You should be tested more often if you have other risk factors for diabetes, such as:
You have a first degree relative with diabetes
You have high blood pressure, prediabetes, or a history of heart disease
EYE EXAM
Have an eye exam every 2 to 4 years ages 40 to 54 and every 1 to 3 years ages 55 to 64. Your provider may recommend more frequent eye exams if you have vision problems or
glaucoma
risk.
Have an eye exam that includes an examination of your retina (back of your eye) at least every year if you have diabetes.
IMMUNIZATIONS
Commonly needed vaccines include:
Flu
shot
: get one every year
COVID-19 vaccine:
ask your provider what is best for you
Tetanus-diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine
: have Tdap as one of your tetanus-diphtheria vaccines if you did not receive it as an adolescent
Tetanus-diphtheria
: have a booster (Td or Tdap) every 10 years
Varicella vaccine
: receive 2 doses if you never had chickenpox or the varicella vaccine and were born in 1980 or after
Hepatitis B vaccine
: receive 2, 3, or 4 doses, depending on your exact circumstances, if you did not receive these as a child or adolescent, until age 59
Shingles (herpes zoster) vaccine
: two doses at or after age 50
Ask your provider if you should receive other immunizations, especially if you have certain medical conditions, such as diabetes or are at increased risk for some diseases such as pneumonia.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE SCREENING
Screening for hepatitis C: all adults ages 18 to 79 should get a one-time test for
hepatitis C
.
Screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV): all people ages 15 to 65 should get a one-time test for HIV.
Depending on your lifestyle and medical history, you may need to be screened for infections such as syphilis, chlamydia, and other infections.
LUNG CANCER SCREENING
You should have an annual screening for
lung cancer
with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) if:
You are age 50 to 80 years AND
You have a 20 pack-year smoking history AND
You currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years
OSTEOPOROSIS SCREENING
If you are age 50 to 64 and have risk factors for
osteoporosis
, you should discuss screening with your provider.
Risk factors can include long-term steroid use, low body weight, smoking, heavy alcohol use, having a fracture after age 50, or a family history of hip fracture or osteoporosis.
PHYSICAL EXAM
All adults should visit their provider from time to time, even if they are healthy. The purpose of these visits is to:
Screen for diseases
Assess risk of future medical problems
Encourage a healthy lifestyle
Update vaccinations and other preventive care services
Maintain a relationship with a provider in case of an illness
Your blood pressure, height, weight, and
body mass index (BMI)
should be checked at every exam.
During your exam, your provider may ask you about:
Depression
and anxiety
Diet and exercise
Alcohol and tobacco use
Safety, such as use of seat belts and smoke detectors
Your medicines and risk for interactions
PROSTATE CANCER SCREENING
If you're 55 through 69 years old, before having the test, talk to your provider about the pros and cons of having a
prostate specific antigen
(PSA) blood test. Ask about:
Whether screening decreases your chance of dying from
prostate cancer
.
Whether there is any harm from prostate cancer screening, such as side effects from testing or overtreatment of cancer when discovered.
Whether you have a higher risk of prostate cancer than others.
If you are age 55 or younger, screening is not generally recommended. You should talk with your provider about if you have a higher risk for prostate cancer. Risk factors include:
Having a family history of prostate cancer (especially a brother or father who were diagnosed before age 65)
Being African American
If you choose to be tested, the PSA blood test is repeated over time (yearly or less often), though the best frequency is not known.
Prostate physical examinations are no longer routinely done on men with no symptoms.
SKIN EXAM
Your provider may check your skin for signs of
skin cancer
, especially if you're at high risk. You may be at high risk if you:
Have had skin cancer before
Have close relatives with skin cancer
Have a weakened immune system
Professional organizations do not recommend for or against performing a skin self-exam.
Â
TESTICULAR EXAM
The US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) now recommends against performing testicular self-exams. Doing testicular self-exams has been shown to have little to no benefit.
