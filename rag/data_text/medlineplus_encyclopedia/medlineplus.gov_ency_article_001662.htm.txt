Aase syndrome is a rare disorder that involves
anemia
and certain joint and skeletal deformities.
Causes
Many cases of Aase syndrome occur without a known reason and are not passed down through families (inherited). However, some cases (45%) have been shown to be inherited. These are due to a change in 1 of 20 genes important for making protein correctly (the genes make ribosomal proteins).
This condition is similar to Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and the two conditions should considered the same. A missing piece on chromosome 19 is found in some people with Diamond-Blackfan anemia.
The anemia in Aase syndrome is caused by poor development of the bone marrow, which is where blood cells are formed.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
Absent or small knuckles
Cleft palate
Deformed ears
Droopy eyelids
Inability to fully extend the joints from birth
Narrow shoulders
Pale skin
Triple-jointed thumbs
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. Tests that may be done include:
Bone marrow biopsy
Complete blood count
(CBC)
Echocardiogram
X-rays
Treatment
Treatment may involve blood transfusions in the first year of life to treat anemia.
A steroid medicine called prednisone has also been used to treat anemia associated with Aase syndrome. However, it should only be used after reviewing the benefits and risks with a provider who has experience treating anemias.
A
bone marrow transplant
may be necessary if other treatment fails.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The anemia tends to improve with age.
Possible Complications
Complications related to anemia include:
Fatigue
Decreased oxygen in the blood
Weakness
Heart problems can lead to a variety of complications, depending on the specific defect.
Severe cases of Aase syndrome have been associated with
stillbirth
or early death.
Prevention
Genetic counseling is recommended if you have a family history of this syndrome and wish to become pregnant.
Alternative Names
Aase-Smith syndrome; Hypoplastic anemia - triphalangeal thumbs, Aase-Smith type; Diamond-Blackfan with AS-II; Aase-Smith I syndrome; Hydrocephalus-cleft palate-joint contractures syndrome
