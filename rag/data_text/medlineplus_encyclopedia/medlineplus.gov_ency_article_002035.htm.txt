To prevent chapped hands:
Avoid excessive sun exposure or exposure to extreme cold or wind.
Avoid washing hands with hot water.
Limit hand washing as much as possible while maintaining good hygiene.
Try to keep the air in your home humid.
Use mild soaps or non-soap cleansers.
Use moisturizing lotions on your hands regularly, especially if you live in a dry climate.
To soothe chapped and sore hands:
Apply skin moisturizing lotion frequently (if this does not work, try creams or ointments).
Avoid putting your hands in water unless necessary.
If your hands do not improve, contact your health care provider.
Very strong hydrocortisone creams (available by prescription) are recommended for badly chapped hands.
Wear gloves for doing everyday chores (cotton is best).
