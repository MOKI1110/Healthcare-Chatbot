Choroidal dystrophies

Choroidal dystrophies are eye disorders that involve a layer of blood vessels called the
choroid
. These vessels are between the
sclera
(the white of the eye) and
retina
(the black of the eye).
In most cases, a choroidal dystrophy is due to an abnormal gene, which is passed down through families. It most often affects males, starting in childhood.
The first symptoms are peripheral vision loss and vision loss at night. An eye doctor who specializes in the retina (back of the eye) can diagnose this disorder.
Exams and Tests
The following tests may be needed to diagnose the condition:
Electroretinography
Fluorescein angiography
Genetic testing
Treatment
Clinical trials have been underway to try to slow the disease progression by injecting a form of the missing genetic material under the retina.
Alternative Names
Choroideremia; Gyrate atrophy; Central areolar choroidal dystrophy
