Fatigue is a feeling of weariness, tiredness, or lack of energy.
Considerations
Fatigue is different from
drowsiness
. Drowsiness is feeling the need to sleep. Fatigue is a lack of energy and motivation. Drowsiness and apathy (a feeling of not caring about what happens) can be symptoms that go along with fatigue.
Fatigue can be a normal and important response to physical activity, emotional stress, boredom, or lack of sleep. Fatigue is a common symptom, and it is usually not due to a serious disease. But it can be a sign of a more serious mental or physical condition. When fatigue is not relieved by enough sleep, good nutrition, or a low-stress environment, it should be evaluated by your health care provider.
Causes
There are many possible causes of fatigue, including:
Anemia
(including
iron deficiency anemia
)
Depression
or
grief
Iron deficiency (without anemia)
Medicines, such as sedatives or antidepressants
Persistent pain
Sleep disorders
such as
insomnia
,
obstructive sleep apnea
, or
narcolepsy
Thyroid gland that is
underactive
or
overactive
Use of alcohol or drugs, such as cocaine or narcotics, especially with regular use
Fatigue can also occur with the following illnesses:
Addison disease
Â (a disorder that occurs when the adrenal glands don't produce enough hormones)
Anorexia
or other eating disorders
Arthritis, mainly adult orÂ
juvenile rheumatoid arthritis
Autoimmune diseases such as systemic
lupus
erythematosus
Cancer
COVID-19
Diabetes
Fibromyalgia
Heart failure
Infection, especially one that takes a long time to recover from or treat, such as bacterial endocarditis (infection of the heart muscle or valves), parasitic infections, hepatitis, HIV/AIDS,
tuberculosis
, and
mononucleosis
Kidney disease
Liver disease
Malnutrition
Certain medicines may also cause drowsiness or fatigue, including antihistamines for allergies, blood pressure medicines, sleeping pills, steroids, and diuretics (water pills).
Chronic fatigue syndrome
(CFS) is a condition in which symptoms of fatigue persist for at least 6 months and do not resolve with rest. The fatigue may be worsened with physical activity or mental stress. It is diagnosed based on the presence of a specific group of symptoms and after all other possible causes of fatigue are ruled out.
Home Care
Here are some tips for reducing fatigue:
Get enough sleep each night.
Make sure your diet is healthy and well-balanced, and drink plenty of water throughout the day.
Exercise regularly.
Learn better ways to relax. Try yoga or meditation.
Maintain a reasonable work and personal schedule.
Change or reduce your stressors, if possible. For example, if you are able, take a vacation or resolve relationship problems.
Discuss with your provider whether any supplemental vitamins might help you.
Avoid alcohol, nicotine, and drug use.
If you have long-term (chronic) pain or depression, treating it often helps the fatigue. Be aware that some antidepressant medicines may cause or worsen fatigue. If your medicnie is one of these, your provider may have to adjust the dosage or switch you to another medicine. DO NOT stop or change any medicines without first talking to your provider.
Stimulants (including caffeine) are not effective treatments for fatigue. They can make the problem worse when they are stopped. Sedatives also tend to worsen fatigue.
