An oropharynx lesion biopsy is surgery in which tissue from an abnormal growth or mouth sore is removed and checked for disease.
How the Test is Performed
Painkilling or numbing medicine is first applied to the area. For large sores or sores of the throat,
general anesthesia
may be needed. This means you will be asleep during the procedure.
All or part of the problem area (lesion) is removed. It is sent to the laboratory to check for diseases. If a growth in the mouth or throat needs to be removed, the biopsy will be done first. This is followed by the actual removal of the growth.
How to Prepare for the Test
If a simple painkilling or local numbing medicine is to be used, there is no special preparation. If the test is part of a growth removal or if general anesthesia is used, you will likely be asked not to eat for 6 to 8 hours before the test.
How the Test will Feel
You may feel pressure or tugging while the tissue is being removed. After the numbness wears off, the area may be sore for a few days.
Why the Test is Performed
This test is done to determine the cause of a sore (lesion) in the throat.
Normal Results
This test is only done when there is an abnormal tissue area.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Abnormal results may mean:
Cancer
(such as
squamous cell carcinoma
)
Benign lesions (such as papilloma)
Fungal infections (such as candida)
Histoplasmosis
Oral lichen planus
Precancerous sore (leukoplakia)
Viral infections (such as Herpes simplex)
Risks
Risks of the procedure may include:
Infection of the site
Bleeding at the site
If there is bleeding, the blood vessels may be sealed (cauterized) with an electric current or laser.
Considerations
Avoid hot or spicy food after the biopsy.
