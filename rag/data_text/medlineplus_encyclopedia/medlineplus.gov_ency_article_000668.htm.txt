Septic shock

Septic shock is a serious condition that occurs when a body-wide infection leads to dangerously low blood pressure.
Causes
Septic shock occurs most often in the very old and the very young. It may also occur in people with weakened immune systems.
Any type of bacteria can cause septic shock. Fungi and (rarely) viruses may also cause the condition. Toxins released by the bacteria or fungi may cause tissue damage. This may lead to low blood pressure and poor organ function. Some researchers think that blood clots in small arteries cause the lack of blood flow and poor organ function.
The body may respond to the toxins with a strong inflammatory response that may contribute to organ damage.
Risk factors for septic shock include:
Diabetes
Diseases of the genitourinary system,
biliary system
, or intestinal system
Diseases that weaken the immune system, such as AIDS
Indwelling catheters (those that remain in place for extended periods, especially intravenous lines and urinary catheters, and plastic and metal stents used for drainage)
Leukemia
Long-term use of antibiotics
Lymphoma
Recent infection
Recent surgery or medical procedure
Recent or current use of steroid medicines
Recent chemotherapy for any type of cancer
Solid organ or bone marrow transplantation
Symptoms
Septic shock can affect any part of the body, including the heart, brain, kidneys, liver, and intestines. Symptoms may include:
Cool, pale arms and legs
High or very low temperature, chills
Lightheadedness
Little or no urine
Low blood pressure, especially when standing
Palpitations
Rapid heart rate
Restlessness,
agitation
, lethargy, or confusion
Shortness of breath
Skin rash or discoloration
Decreased mental status
Â and confusion
Exams and Tests
Blood tests may be done to check for:
Infection in or throughout the body
Complete blood count (CBC)
and blood chemistry
Presence of bacteria or other organisms
Low blood oxygen level
Disturbances in the body's acid-base balance
Poor organ function or organ failure
Other tests may include:
A chest x-ray to look for pneumonia or fluid in the lungs (pulmonary edema)
A urine sample to look for infection
A CT scan or ultrasound of different parts of the body, where a source of infection might be suspected
Additional tests, such as
blood cultures
, may not become positive for several days after the blood has been taken, or for several days after the shock has developed.
Treatment
Septic shock is a medical emergency. In most cases, people are admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital.
Treatment may include:
Breathing machine (mechanical ventilation)
Dialysis
Medicines to treat low blood pressure, infection, or blood clotting
High volume of fluids given directly into a vein (intravenously)
Oxygen
Sedatives
Surgery or tube insertions to drain infected areas, if needed
Antibiotics or other agents to treat viral or fungal infections
The pressure in the heart and lungs may be checked. This is called hemodynamic monitoring. This can only be done with special equipment and intensive care nursing.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Septic shock has a high death rate. The death rate depends on the person's age and overall health, the cause of the infection, how many organs have failed, and how quickly and aggressively medical therapy is started.
Possible Complications
Respiratory failure,
cardiac failure
, or any other organ failure can occur. Gangrene may occur, possibly leading to amputation.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Go directly to an emergency department if you develop symptoms of septic shock.
Prevention
Prompt treatment of bacterial infections is helpful. Vaccination could help prevent some infections. However, many cases of septic shock cannot be prevented. Take steps to prevent the possibility of infection, especially if you have a weakened immune system.Â
