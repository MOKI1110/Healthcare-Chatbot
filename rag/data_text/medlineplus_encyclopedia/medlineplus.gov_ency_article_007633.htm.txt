Hip joint injection

A hip joint injection is a shot of medicine into the hip joint. The medicine can help relieve pain and inflammation. It can also help diagnose the source of hip pain.
Description
For this procedure, a health care provider inserts a needle in the hip area and injects medicine into the hip joint. In most cases, the provider uses a real-time x-ray (fluoroscopy) or ultrasound to see where to place the needle in the joint.
You may be given medicine to help you relax.
For the procedure:
You will lie on the x-ray table, and your hip area will be cleaned.
A numbing medicine will be applied to the injection site.
A small needle will be guided into the joint area while the provider watches the placement on the x-ray or ultrasound screen.
Once the needle is in the right spot, a small amount of contrast dye is injected so the provider can see where the medicine will be placed.
The medicine (usually a combination of a local anesthetic and a steroid) is slowly injected into the joint.
After the injection, you will remain on the table for another 5 to 10 minutes. Your provider will then ask you to move the hip to see if it is still painful. You may have pain relief almost immediately. The hip joint will become more painful afterwards when the numbing medicine has worn off. It may be a few days before you notice any pain relief from the steroids that were given.
Why the Procedure is Performed
Hip joint injection is done to reduce hip pain caused by problems in the bones or cartilage of your hip joint. The hip pain is often caused by:
Bursitis
Arthritis
Labral tear (a tear in the cartilage that is attached to the rim of the hip socket bone)
Injury to the hip joint or surrounding area
Overuse or strain from running or other activities
A hip joint injection can also help diagnose hip pain. If the shot does not relieve pain right after the injection of the numbing medicine or within a few days, then the hip joint may not be the source of hip pain.
Risks
Risks are rare, but may include:
Bruising
Swelling
Skin irritation
Allergic reaction to medicine
Infection
Bleeding in the joint
Weakness in the leg
Before the Procedure
Tell your provider about:
Any health problems
Any allergiesÂ
Medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines
Any blood thinner medicines, such as aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin), dabigatran (Pradaxa), apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), or clopidogrel (Plavix)
Plan ahead to have someone drive you home after the procedure.
After the Procedure
After the injection, follow any specific instructions your provider gives you. These may include:
Applying ice on your hip if you have swelling or pain (wrap the ice in a towel to protect your skin)
Avoiding strenuous activity the day of the procedure
Taking pain medicines as directed
You may resume most normal activities the next day.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Most people feel less pain after a hip injection.
You may notice reduced pain 15 to 20 minutes after the injection.
Pain may return in 4 to 6 hours as the numbing medicine wears off.
As the steroid medicine begins to take effect 2 to 7 days later, your hip joint should feel less painful.
You may need more than one injection. How long the shot lasts varies from person to person, and depends on the cause of the pain. For some, it can last weeks or months.
