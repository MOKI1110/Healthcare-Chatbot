Proctitis is an inflammation of the rectum. It can cause discomfort, bleeding, and the discharge of mucus or pus.
Causes
There are many causes of proctitis. They can be grouped as follows:
Inflammatory bowel disease
Autoimmune disease
Harmful substances
Non-sexually transmitted infection
Sexually transmitted disease (STD)
Proctitis caused by an STD is common in people who have anal intercourse. STDs that can cause proctitis include
gonorrhea
, herpes,
chlamydia
, and
lymphogranuloma venereum
.
Infections that are not sexually transmitted are less common than STD proctitis. One type of proctitis not from an STD is an infection in children that is caused by the same bacteria as strep throat.
Autoimmune proctitis is linked to diseases such as
ulcerative colitis
or
Crohn disease
. If the inflammation is in the rectum only, it may come and go or move upward into the large intestine.
Proctitis may also be caused by some medicines,
radiotherapy
to prostate or pelvis or inserting harmful substances into the rectum.
Risk factors include:
Autoimmune disorders
, including inflammatory bowel disease
High-risk sexual practices, such as anal sex
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Bloody stools
Constipation
Rectal bleeding
Rectal discharge, pus
Rectal pain or discomfort
Tenesmus
(pain with bowel movement)
Exams and Tests
Tests that may be used include:
Exam of a stool sample
Proctoscopy
Rectal culture
Sigmoidoscopy
Treatment
Most of the time, proctitis will go away when the cause of the problem is treated. Antibiotics are used if an infection is causing the problem.
Corticosteroids or mesalamine suppositories or enemas may relieve symptoms for some people.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome is good with treatment.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Anal fistula
Anemia
Recto-vaginal
fistula
(women)
Severe bleeding
