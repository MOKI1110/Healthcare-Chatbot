Pleural effusion
is a buildup of fluid in the pleural space. The pleural space is the area between the layers of the tissue lining the lung and the chest cavity.
In a person with parapneumonic pleural effusion, the fluid buildup is caused by
pneumonia
.
Causes
Pneumonia, most commonly from bacteria, causes parapneumonic pleural effusion.
Symptoms
Symptoms can include any of the following:
Chest pain, usually a sharp pain that is worse with cough or deep breaths
Cough with sputum
Fever
Rapid breathing
Shortness of breath
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms. Your provider will also listen to your lungs with a stethoscope and tap (percuss) your chest and upper back.
The following tests may help to confirm a diagnosis:
Complete blood count
(CBC)
Chest CT scan
Chest x-ray
Thoracentesis
(a sample of fluid is removed with a needle inserted between the ribs)
Ultrasound
of the chest and heart
Treatment
Antibiotics are prescribed to treat the pneumonia.
If the person has shortness of breath, thoracentesis might be used to drain the fluid. If better drainage of the fluid is needed due to more severe infection, a drain tube can be inserted.
Outlook (Prognosis)
This condition improves when the pneumonia improves.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Lung damage
Infection that turns into an abscess, called an
empyema
, which will need to be drained with a chest tube
Collapsed lung (
pneumothorax
) after thoracentesis
Scarring of the pleural space (lining of the lung)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of pleural effusion.
Contact your provider or go to the emergency room if shortness of breath or difficulty breathing occurs right after thoracentesis.
