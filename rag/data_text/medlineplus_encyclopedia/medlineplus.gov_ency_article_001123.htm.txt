The aortic arch is the top part of the main artery carrying blood away from the heart. Aortic arch syndrome refers to a group of signs and symptoms associated with structural problems in the arteries that branch off the aortic arch.

Causes
Aortic arch syndrome problems can be due to trauma, blood clots, or malformations that develop before birth. These defects result in abnormal blood flow to the head, neck, or arms.
In children, there are many types of aortic arch syndromes, including:
Congenital absence of a branch of the aorta
Isolation of the subclavian arteries
Vascular rings
An inflammatory disease called Takayasu syndrome may result in narrowing (stenosis) of the vessels of the aortic arch. This typically occurs in women and girls. This disease is seen more often in people of Asian descent.
Symptoms
Symptoms vary according to which artery or other structure that has been affected. Symptoms may include:
Blood pressure changes
Breathing problems
Dizziness, blurred vision, weakness, and other brain and nervous system (neurological) changes
Numbness of an arm
Reduced
pulse
Swallowing problems
Transient ischemic attacks (TIA)
Treatment
Surgery is often needed to treat the underlying cause of aortic arch syndrome.
Alternative Names
Subclavian artery occlusive syndrome; Carotid artery occlusion syndrome; Subclavian steal syndrome; Vertebral-basilar artery occlusive syndrome; Takayasu disease; Pulseless disease
