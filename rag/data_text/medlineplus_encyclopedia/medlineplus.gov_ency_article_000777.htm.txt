Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP) is a disorder that involves nerve swelling and irritation (inflammation) that leads to a loss of strength or sensation.
Causes
CIDP is one cause of damage to nerves outside the brain or spinal cord (
peripheral neuropathy
). Polyneuropathy means several nerves are involved. CIDP often affects both sides of the body.
CIDP is caused by an abnormal
immune response
. CIDP occurs when the immune system attacks the
myelin cover
of the nerves. For this reason, CIDP is thought to be an
autoimmune disease
.
Health care providers also consider CIDP as the
chronic
form of
Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome
.
The specific triggers of CIDP vary. In many cases, the cause cannot be identified.
CIDP may occur with other conditions, such as:
Chronic
hepatitis
Diabetes
Infection with the bacterium
Campylobacter jejuni
HIV/AIDS
Immune system disorders due to cancer
Inflammatory bowel disease
Systemic lupus erythematosus
Cancer of the lymph system
Overactive thyroid
Side effects of medicines to treat cancer or HIV
Symptoms
Symptoms include any of the following:
Problems walking
due to weakness or lack of feeling in the feet
Trouble using the arms and hands or legs and feet due to weakness
Sensation changes
, such as numbness or decreased sensation, pain, burning, tingling, or other abnormal sensations (usually affects the feet first, then the arms and hands)
Other symptoms that can occur with CIDP include:
Abnormal or uncoordinated movement
Problems breathing
Fatigue
Hoarseness or changing voice
or slurred speech
Exams and Tests
The provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms, focusing on the nervous system and muscles.
Tests that may be ordered include:
Electromyography
(EMG) to check the muscles and the nerves that control the muscles
Nerve conduction tests
to check how fast electrical signals move through a nerve
Nerve biopsy
to remove a small piece of a nerve for examination
Spinal tap
(lumbar puncture) to check the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord
Blood tests may be done to look for specific proteins that are causing the immune attack on the nerves
Lung function tests to check if breathing is affected
Depending on the suspected cause of CIDP, other tests, such as
x-rays
, imaging scans, and blood tests, may be done.
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to reverse the attack on the nerves. In some cases, nerves can heal and their function can be restored. In other cases, nerves are badly damaged and cannot heal, so treatment is aimed at preventing the disease from getting worse.
Which treatment is given depends on how severe the symptoms are, among other things. The most aggressive treatment is only given if you have difficulty walking, breathing, or if symptoms don't allow you to care for yourself or work.
Treatments may include:
Corticosteroids to help reduce inflammation and relieve symptoms
Other medicines that suppress the immune system (for some severe cases)
Plasmapheresis or plasma exchange to remove
antibodies
from the blood
Intravenous immune globulin (IVIg), which involves injecting antibodies into the bloodstream to reduce the effect of the antibodies that are causing the problem
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome varies. The disorder may continue long term, or you may have repeated episodes of symptoms. Complete recovery is possible, but permanent loss of nerve function is not uncommon.
Possible Complications
Complications of CIDP include:
Pain
Permanent decrease or loss of sensation in areas of the body
Permanent weakness or paralysis in areas of the body
Repeated or unnoticed injury to an area of the body
Side effects of medicines used to treat the disorder
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have a loss of movement or sensation in any area of the body, especially if your symptoms get worse.
