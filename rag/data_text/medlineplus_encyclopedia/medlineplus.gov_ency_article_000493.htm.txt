Distal renal tubular acidosis is a disease that occurs when the kidneys do not properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called
acidosis
).
Causes
When the body performs its normal functions, it produces acid. If this acid is not removed or neutralized, the blood becomes too acidic. This can lead to
electrolyte
imbalances in the blood. It can also cause problems with normal function of some cells.
The kidneys help control the body's acid level by removing acid from the blood and excreting it into the urine.
Distal renal tubular acidosis (type I RTA) is caused by a defect in the kidney tubes that causes acid to build up in the blood.
Type I RTA is caused by a variety of conditions, including:
Amyloidosis
, a buildup of abnormal protein, called amyloid, in the tissues and organs
Fabry disease, an abnormal buildup in the body of a certain type of fatty substance
High level of calcium in the blood
Sickle cell disease
, red blood cells that are normally shaped like a disk take on a sickle or crescent shape
SjÃ¶gren syndrome
, an autoimmune disorder in which the glands that produce tears and saliva are destroyed
Systemic lupus erythematosus
, an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue
Wilson disease
, an inherited disorder in which there is too much copper in the body's tissues
Use of certain medicines, such as amphotericin B, lithium, and analgesics
Symptoms
Symptoms of distal renal tubular acidosis include any of the following:
Confusion
or
decreased alertness
Fatigue
Impaired growth in children
Increased breathing rate
Kidney stones
Nephrocalcinosis
(too much calcium deposited in the kidneys)
Osteomalacia
(softening of the bones)
Muscle weakness
Other symptoms may include:
Bone pain
Decreased urine output
Increased
heart rate
or
irregular heartbeat
Muscle cramps
Pain in the back, flank, or abdomen
Skeletal abnormalities
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.
Tests that may be ordered include:
Arterial blood gas
Blood chemistry
Urine pH
and
acid loading test
Bicarbonate infusion test
Urinalysis
Calcium deposits in the kidneys and kidney stones may be seen on:
X-rays
Ultrasound
CT scan
Treatment
The goal is to restore normal acid level and electrolyte balance in the body. This will help correct bone disorders and reduce calcium buildup in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis) and kidney stones.
The underlying cause of distal renal tubular acidosis should be corrected if it can be identified.
Medicines that may be prescribed include potassium citrate, sodium bicarbonate, and thiazide diuretics. These are alkaline medicines that help correct the acidic condition of the body. Sodium bicarbonate may correct the loss of potassium and calcium.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The disorder must be treated to reduce its effects and complications, which can be permanent or life threatening. Most people get better with treatment.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of distal renal tubular acidosis.
Get medical help right away if you develop emergency symptoms such as:
Decreased consciousness
Seizures
Severe
decrease in alertness
or
orientation
Prevention
There is no prevention for this disorder.
