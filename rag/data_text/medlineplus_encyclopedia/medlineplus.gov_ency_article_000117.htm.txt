Metastatic pleural tumor

Metastatic pleural tumor is a type of
cancer
that has spread from another organ to the thin membrane (pleura) surrounding the lungs and lining the inside of the chest cavity.
Causes
The blood and lymph systems can carry cancer cells to other organs in the body. There, they can produce new growths or tumors.
Almost any type of cancer can spread to the lungs and involve the pleura.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Chest pain
, especially when taking a deep breath
Cough
Wheezing
Coughing up blood (hemoptysis)
General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (
malaise
)
Shortness of breath
Weight loss
Loss of appetite
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine you and ask about your medical history and symptoms. Tests that may be done include:
Chest x-ray
CT
or
MRI scan of the chest
Procedure to remove and examine part of the pleura (
open pleural biopsy
)
Test that examines a sample of fluid that has collected in the pleural space (
pleural fluid analysis
)
Procedure that uses a needle to remove a sample of the pleura (
pleural needle biopsy
)
Removal of fluid from around the lungs (
thoracentesis
)
Treatment
Pleural tumors usually can't be removed with surgery. The original (primary) cancer should be treated.
Chemotherapy
and
radiation therapy
may be used, depending on the type of primary cancer.
Your provider may recommend thoracentesis if you have a lot of fluid collecting around your lungs and you have shortness of breath or low blood oxygen levels.Â After the fluid is removed, your lungs will be able to expand more. This allows you to breathe easier.
To prevent the fluid from collecting again, medicine may be placed directly into your chest space through a tube, called a catheter. Or, your surgeon may spray a medicine or talc on the lung surface during the procedure. This helps seal the space around your lungs to prevent the fluid from returning.
Support Groups
You can ease the stress of illness by joining a
support group
where members share common experiences and problems.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The survival time varies greatly from several months to several years. The outlook depends on:
The location of pleural tumors
The cell type of pleural tumors
The stage of the tumor
The person's age and general health
Whether surgery is an option
The person's response to treatment
You and your family may want to start thinking about end-of-life planning, such as:
Palliative care
Hospice care
Advance care directives
Health care agents
The 5-year survival rate (number of people who live for more than 5 years after diagnosis) is less than 25% for people with pleural tumors that have spread from other parts of the body.
Possible Complications
Health problems that may result include:
Side effects of chemotherapy or radiation therapy
Continued spread of the cancer
Prevention
Early detection and treatment of primary cancers may prevent metastatic pleural tumors in some people.
Alternative Names
