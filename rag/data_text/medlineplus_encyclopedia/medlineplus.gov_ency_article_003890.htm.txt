Anoscopy and high-resolution anoscopy

Anoscopy is a method to look at the:
Anus
Anal canal
Lower rectum
How the Test is Performed
The procedure is usually done in a health care provider's office.
A digital anorectal examination (DARE) is done first. Then, a lubricated instrument called an anoscope is placed a few inches or centimeters into the rectum. You will feel some discomfort when this is done.
The anoscope has a light on the end, so your health care provider can see the entire area. High-resolution anoscopy (HRA) uses an additional magnifying device called a colposcope. This device allows for a closer examination of the tissues to detect small changes. HRA may be used to help detect abnormal cells in your anal lining.
A sample for
biopsy
can be taken, if needed.
How to Prepare for the Test
Often, there is no preparation needed. Or, you may receive a laxative, enema, or other preparation to empty your bowel. You should empty your bladder before the procedure. Your provider may suggest that you avoid anal penetration and anal medicines or products before the procedure.
How the Test will Feel
There will be some discomfort during the procedure. You may feel the need to have a bowel movement. You may feel a pinch when a biopsy is taken.
You can usually return to normal activities after the procedure.
Why the Test is Performed
This test may be used to determine whether you have:
Anal fissures
(small split or tear in the lining of the anus)
Anal polyps
(growth on the lining of the anus)
Foreign object in the anus
Hemorrhoids
(swollen veins in the anus)
Infection
Inflammation
Tumors
Abnormal growth of cells (dysplasia)
Anal cancer
Anoscopy and HRA may also be used as a yearly screening test for anal cancer in people withÂ HIV.
Normal Results
The anal canal appears normal in size, color, and tone. There is no sign of:
Bleeding
Polyps
Hemorrhoids
Other abnormal tissue
What Abnormal Results Mean
Abnormal results may include:
Abscess
(collection of pus in the anus)
Fissures
Foreign object in the anus
Hemorrhoids
Infection
Inflammation
Polyps (non-cancerous or cancerous)
Tumors or dysplasia
Risks
There are few risks. If a biopsy is needed, there is a slight risk for bleeding and mild pain.
