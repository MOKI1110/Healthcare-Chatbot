Porphyrins blood test

Porphyrins help form many important substances in the body. One of these is hemoglobin. This is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen in the blood.
Porphyrins can be measured in the blood or the
urine
. This article discusses the blood test.
How the Test is Performed
A
blood sample
is needed.
The sample is then placed in ice and taken immediately to the lab. Three porphyrins can normally be measured in small amounts in human blood. They are:
Coproporphyrin
Protoporphyrin (PROTO)
Uroporphyrin
Protoporphyrin is normally found in the highest amount. More tests are needed to show the levels of specific porphyrins.
How to Prepare for the Test
You should not eat for 12 to 14 hours before this test. You may drink water right before the test. Your test results may be affected if you do not follow these instructions.
How the Test will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.
Why the Test is Performed
This test is used to diagnose
porphyrias
. This is a group of rare disorders often passed down through family members.
It may also be used along with other tests to diagnose lead poisoning and certain nervous system and skin disorders.
Normal Results
This test specifically measures total porphyrin levels. But, reference values (a range of values seen in a group of healthy people) for the individual components are also included:
Total porphyrin levels: 0 to 1.0 mcg/dL (0 to 15 nmol/L)
Coproporphyrin level: <2 mcg/dL (<30 nmol/L)
Protoporphyrin level: 16 to 60 mcg/dL (0.28 to 1.07 Âµmol/L)
Uroporphyrin level: <2 mcg/dL (<2.4 nmol/L)
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different lab. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Increased levels of coproporphyrins may be a sign of:
Congenital erythropoietic porphyria
Hepatic coproporphyria
Sideroblastic anemia
Variegate porphyria
An increased protoporphyrin level may be a sign of:
Anemia of chronic disease
Congenital
erythropoietic protoporphyria
Increased erythropoiesis
Infection
Iron deficiency anemia
Lead poisoning
Sideroblastic anemia
Thalassemia
Variegate porphyria
An increased uroporphyrin level may be a sign of:
Congenital erythropoietic porphyria
Porphyria cutanea tarda
Risks
There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:
Excessive bleeding
Fainting or feeling lightheaded
Multiple punctures to locate veins
Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
Alternative Names
Protoporphyrin levels; Porphyrins - total; Coproporphyrin levels; PROTO test
