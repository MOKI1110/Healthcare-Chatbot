Uvulitis

Uvulitis is inflammation of the uvula. This is the small tongue-shaped tissue that hangs from the top of the back part of the mouth. Uvulitis is usually associated with inflammation of other mouth parts, such as the palate, tonsils, or throat (pharynx).
Causes
Uvulitis is mainly caused by an infection with streptococcus bacteria. Other causes are:
An injury to the back of the throat
An allergic reaction from pollen, dust, pet dander, or foods such as peanuts or eggs
Inhaling or swallowing certain chemicals
Reflux of acid from the stomach into the esophagus
Smoking
Injury can occur due to:
Endoscopy
- test that involves inserting a tube through the mouth into the esophagus to view the lining of the esophagus and stomach
Surgery such as tonsil removal
Damage due to acid reflux
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Fever
Feeling like something is in your throat
Choking or gagging
Coughing
Pain while swallowing
Excessive saliva
Decreased or no appetite
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and look in your mouth to view the uvula and throat.
Tests that may done include:
Throat swab
to identify any germs that are causing your uvulitis
Blood tests
Allergy tests
Treatment
Uvulitis may get better on its own without medicines. Depending on the cause, you may be prescribed:
Antibiotics to treat an infection
Steroids to reduce swelling of the uvula
Antihistamines to treat an allergic reaction
Reflux medicines to treat reflux-related irritation
Your provider may suggest you do the following at home to ease your symptoms:
Get lots of rest.
Drink plenty of fluids.
Gargle with warm salt water to reduce swelling.
Take over the counter pain medicine.
Use throat lozenges or a throat spray to help with the pain.
Don't smoke and avoid secondhand smoke, both of which can irritate your throat.
If the swelling does not go away with medicines, your provider may advise surgery. Surgery is done to remove a part of the uvula.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Uvulitis usually resolves in 1 to 2 days either on its own or with treatment.
Possible Complications
If swelling of the uvula is severe and goes untreated, it may cause choking and restrict your breathing.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
You are unable to eat properly
Your symptoms are not getting better
You have a fever
Your symptoms return after treatment
If you are choking and having trouble breathing, call 911 or the local emergency number, or go to the emergency room right away. There, the provider may insert a breathing tube to open your airway to help you breathe.
Prevention
If you test positive for an allergy, avoid the allergen in future. An allergen is a substance that can cause an allergic reaction.
