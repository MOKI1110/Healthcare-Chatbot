A tremor is a type of shaking movement. A tremor is most often noticed in the hands and arms. It may affect any body part, including the head, tongue, or vocal cords.
Considerations
Tremors can happen at any age. They are more common in older people. Everyone has some tremor when they move their hands. Stress, fatigue, anger, fear, caffeine, and smoking may make this type of tremor worse.
A tremor that does not go away over time may be a sign of a medical problem and should be checked by your health care provider.
Essential tremor
is the most common type of tremor. The shaking most often involves small, rapid movements. It usually occurs when you are trying to do something, such as reaching for an object or writing. This type of tremor may also run in families.
Causes
A tremor may be caused by:
Certain medicines
Brain, nerve, or movement disorders (such as
Parkinson disease
), including uncontrolled muscle movements (
dystonia
)
Brain tumor
Alcohol use or alcohol withdrawal
Multiple sclerosis
Muscle tiredness or weakness
Normal aging
Overactive thyroid
Stress, anxiety, or fatigue
Stroke
Too much coffee or other caffeinated drink or food
Home Care
Your provider will likely suggest
self-care measures
to help with daily life.
For tremors caused by stress, try ways to relax, such as meditation or breathing exercises. For tremors of any cause, avoid caffeine and get enough sleep.
For tremors caused by a medicine, talk to your provider about stopping the medicine, reducing the dosage, or switching to another medicine. Do not change or stop medicines on your own.
For tremors caused by alcohol use, seek treatment to help you
stop drinking alcohol
.
Severe tremors may make it hard to do daily activities. You may need help with these activities.
Devices that may help include:
Buy clothes with Velcro fasteners instead of buttons or hooks.
Cook or eat with utensils that have larger handles that are easier to grip.
Drink from half-filled cups or use sippy cups to avoid spilling.
Use straws to drink so you do not have to pick up your glass.
Wear slip-on shoes and use shoehorns.
Wear a heavier bracelet or watch. It may reduce a hand or arm tremor.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if your tremor:
Is worse at rest and gets better with movement such as when you reach for something
Is prolonged, severe, or interferes with your life
Occurs with other symptoms, such as headache, weakness, abnormal tongue movements, muscle tightening, or other movements that you cannot control
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will perform a physical exam, including a detailed brain and nervous system (neurologic) exam. You may be asked questions to help your provider find the cause of your tremors:
The following tests may be ordered:
Blood tests such as
CBC
,
blood differential
,
thyroid function tests
, and
glucose test
Electromyography
(EMG) or
nerve conduction studies
to check the functions of the muscles and nerves
Head CT scan
MRI of the head
Urine tests
Once a cause of the tremor has been determined, treatment may be recommended.
You may not need treatment unless the tremor interferes with your daily activities or causes embarrassment.
Treatment depends on the cause. Tremor caused by a medical condition, such as
hyperthyroidism
, will likely get better when the condition is treated.
If the tremor is caused by a certain medicine, stopping or changing the medicine will usually help it go away. Never stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.
You may be prescribed medicines to help relieve symptoms. How well medicines work depends on your overall health and the cause of the tremor.
In some cases, surgery is done to relieve the tremors.
