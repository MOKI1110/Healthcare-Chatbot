High cholesterol - children

Cholesterol is a fat (also called a lipid) that the body needs to work properly. There are many types of cholesterol. The ones talked about most are:
Total cholesterol - all the cholesterols combined
High density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol -- also called good cholesterol
Low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol -- also called bad cholesterol
Too much bad cholesterol can increase the chance of getting heart disease, stroke, and other problems.
This article is about high cholesterol in children.
Causes
Most children with high cholesterol have one or more parent who has high cholesterol. The main causes of high cholesterol in children are:
Family history of high cholesterol
Being overweight or obese
Unhealthy diet
Certain health conditions can also lead to a high cholesterol level, including:
Diabetes
Kidney disease
Liver disease
Underactive thyroid gland
Several disorders that are passed down through families lead to abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. They include:
Familial hypercholesterolemia
Familial combined hyperlipidemia
Familial dysbetalipoproteinemia
Familial hypertriglyceridemia
Exams and Tests
A cholesterol test is done to diagnose high blood cholesterol.
Guidelines from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute recommend screening all children for high cholesterol:
Between ages 9 and 11 years
Again between ages 17 and 21 years
However, not all expert groups recommend screening all children and instead focus on screening children at higher risk. Factors that increase a child's risk include:
The child's parents have total blood cholesterol of 240 mg/dL or higher
The child has a family member with a history of heart disease before age 55 in men and age 65 in women
The child has risk factors, such as diabetes or high blood pressure
The child has certain health conditions, such as kidney disease or Kawasaki disease
The child is obese (BMI at or above 95th percentile)
The child smokes cigarettes
General targets for children are:
LDL -- Less than 110 mg/dL (lower numbers are better).
HDL -- More than 45 mg/dL (high numbers are better).
Total cholesterol -- Less than 170 mg/dL (lower numbers are better).
Triglycerides -- Less than 75 mg/dL for children up to 9 years and less than 90 mg/dL for children ages 10 to 19 years (lower numbers are better).
If cholesterol results are abnormal, children may also have other tests such as:
Blood sugar (glucose) test to look for diabetes
Kidney function tests
Thyroid function tests to look for an underactive thyroid gland
Liver function tests
Your child's health care provider also may ask about a medical or family history of:
Diabetes
Hypertension
Obesity
Poor food habits
Lack of physical activity
Tobacco use
Treatment
The best way to treat high cholesterol in children is with diet and exercise. If your child is overweight, losing excess weight may help treat high cholesterol. But you should not restrict your child's diet unless your child's provider recommends it. Instead, offer healthy foods and encourage physical activity.
DIET AND EXERCISE
Help your child make healthy food choices by following these guidelines:
Eat foods that are naturally high in fiber and low in fat, such as whole grains, fruits, and vegetables
Use low-fat toppings, sauces, and dressings
Avoid foods that are high in saturated fat and added sugar
Use skim milk or low-fat milk and milk products
Avoid sugary drinks, such as soda and flavored fruit drinks
Eat lean meat and avoid red meat
Eat more fish
Encourage your child to be
physically active
. Children ages 5 years and older should be active at least 1 hour a day. Other things you can do include:
Be active as a family. Plan walks and bike rides together instead of playing video games.
Encourage your child to join school or local sports teams.
Limit screen time
to no more than 2 hours a day.
Other steps include teaching children about the dangers of tobacco use.
Make your home a smoke-free environment.
If you or your partner smoke,
try to quit
. Never smoke around your child.
DRUG THERAPY
Your child's provider may want your child to take medicine for cholesterol if lifestyle changes do not work. For this the child must:
Be at least 10 years old.
Have an LDL cholesterol level 190 mg/dL or higher after 6 months of following a healthy diet.
Have an LDL cholesterol level 160 mg/dL or higher with other risk factors.
Have family history of cardiovascular disease.
Have one or more risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
Children with very high cholesterol may need to start these medicines earlier than age 10. Your child's provider will tell you if this may be needed.
There are several types of medicines to help lower blood cholesterol levels. The medicines work in different ways. Statins are one kind of medicine that lowers cholesterol and has been proven to reduce the chance of heart disease.
Outlook (Prognosis)
High cholesterol levels can lead to
hardening of the arteries
, also called atherosclerosis. This occurs when fat, cholesterol, and other substances build up in the walls of arteries and form hard structures called plaques.
Over time, these plaques can block the arteries and cause heart disease, stroke, and other symptoms or problems throughout the body.
Disorders that are passed down through families often lead to higher cholesterol levels that are harder to control.
