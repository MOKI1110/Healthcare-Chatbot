BUN stands for blood urea nitrogen. Urea nitrogen is what forms when protein breaks down.
A test can be done to measure the amount of urea nitrogen in the blood.
How the Test is Performed
A blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is
drawn from a vein
located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.
How to Prepare for the Test
Many medicines can interfere with blood test results.
Your health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test.
DO NOT stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.
How the Test will Feel
You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.
Why the Test is Performed
The BUN test is often done to check kidney function.
Normal Results
The normal result is generally 6 to 20 mg/dL.
Note: Normal values may vary among different labs. Talk to your provider about your specific test results.
