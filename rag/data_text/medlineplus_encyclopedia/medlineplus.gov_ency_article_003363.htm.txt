Hemoglobinuria test is a urine test that checks for hemoglobin in the urine.
How the Test is Performed
A
clean-catch (midstream) urine sample
is needed. The clean-catch method is used to prevent germs from the penis or vagina from getting into a urine sample. To collect your urine, you may get a special clean-catch kit from your health care provider that contains a cleansing solution and sterile wipes. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate.
How to Prepare for the Test
No special preparation is necessary for this test. If the collection is being taken from an infant, a couple of extra collection bags may be necessary.
How the Test will Feel
The test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.
Why the Test is Performed
Hemoglobin is a molecule contained within red blood cells. Hemoglobin helps move oxygen through the body.
Red blood cells have an average life span of 120 days. After this time, they are broken down into parts that can make a new red blood cell. This breakdown takes place in the spleen, bone marrow, and liver. If the red blood cells break down in the blood vessels, their parts move freely in the bloodstream.
If the level of hemoglobin in the blood rises too high, then hemoglobin begins to appear in the urine. This is called hemoglobinuria.
This test may be used to help diagnose causes of hemoglobinuria.
Normal Results
Normally, hemoglobin does not appear in the urine.
