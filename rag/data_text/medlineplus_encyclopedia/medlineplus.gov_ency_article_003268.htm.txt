Natal teeth

Natal teeth are teeth that are already present at birth. They are different from neonatal teeth, which grow in during the first 30 days after birth.
Considerations
Natal teeth are uncommon. They most often develop on the lower gum, where the central incisor teeth will appear. They have little root structure. They are attached to the end of the gum by soft tissue and are often wobbly.
Natal teeth are usually not well-formed, but they may cause irritation and injury to the infant's tongue when nursing. Natal teeth may also be uncomfortable for a nursing mother.
Natal teeth are often removed shortly after birth while the
newborn infant
is still in the hospital. This is done very often if the tooth is loose and the child runs a risk of "breathing in" the tooth.
Causes
Most of the time, natal teeth are not related to a medical condition. However, sometimes they may be associated with:
Ellis-van Creveld syndrome
Hallermann-Streiff syndrome
Cleft palate
Pierre-Robin syndrome
Soto syndrome
Home Care
Clean the natal teeth by gently wiping the gums and teeth with a clean, damp cloth. Examine the infant's gums and tongue often to make sure the teeth are not causing injury.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if an infant with natal teeth develops a sore tongue or mouth, or other symptoms.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Natal teeth are most often discovered by the provider shortly after birth.
Dental x-rays
may be done in some cases. If there are signs of another condition that may be linked with natal teeth, exams and testing for that condition may need to be done.
