Acetylcholine receptor antibody is a protein found in the blood of many people with
myasthenia gravis
. The
antibody
affects the part of the muscle that receives signals from nerves.
This article discusses the blood test for acetylcholine receptor antibody.
How the Test is Performed
A blood sample is needed. Most of the time, blood is
drawn from a vein
located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.
How to Prepare for the Test
Most of the time, you do not need to take special steps before this test.
How the Test will Feel
You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.
Why the Test is Performed
This test is used to help diagnose myasthenia gravis.
Normal Results
Normally, there is no acetylcholine receptor antibody (or less than 0.02 nmol/L) in the bloodstream.
Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
An abnormal result means acetylcholine receptor antibody has been found in your blood. It confirms the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis in people who have symptoms of myasthenia gravis. Nearly one half of people with myasthenia gravis that is limited to their eye muscles (ocular myasthenia gravis) have this antibody in their blood. This antibody can also be present in the blood of people who have a thymus gland tumor (thymoma), with or without myasthenia gravis.
However, the lack of this antibody does not rule out myasthenia gravis. About 1 in 5 people with myasthenia gravis do not have signs of this antibody in their blood. Your provider may also consider testing you for the muscle specific kinase (MuSK) or other antibodies.
