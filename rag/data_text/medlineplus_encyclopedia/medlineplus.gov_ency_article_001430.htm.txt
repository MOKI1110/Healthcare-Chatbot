A speech disorder is a condition in which a person has problems creating or forming the speech sounds needed to communicate with others. This can make the person's speech difficult to understand.
Common speech disorders are:
Articulation disorders
Phonological disorders
Disfluency
Voice disorders or resonance disorders
Speech disorders are different from
language disorders in children
. Language disorders refer to someone having difficulty with:
Getting their meaning or message across to others (expressive language)
Understanding the message coming from others (receptive language)
Causes
Speech is one of the main ways in which we communicate with those around us. It develops naturally, along with other signs of
normal growth and development
. Disorders of speech and language are common in preschool age children.
Disfluencies are disorders in which a person repeats a sound, word, or phrase.
Stuttering
may be the most serious disfluency. It may be caused by:
Genetic abnormalities
Emotional stress
Any trauma to the brain or infection
Articulation and phonological disorders may occur in other family members. Other causes include:
Problems or changes in the structure or shape of the muscles and bones used to make speech sounds. These changes may include
cleft palate
and tooth problems.
Damage to parts of the brain or the nerves (such as from
cerebral palsy
) that control how the muscles work together to create speech.
Hearing loss.
Voice disorders are caused by problems when air passes from the lungs, through the vocal cords, and then through the throat, nose, mouth, and lips. A voice disorder may be due to:
Acid from the stomach moving upward (
GERD
)
Cancer of the throat
Cleft palate or other problems with the palate
Conditions that damage the nerves
that supply the muscles of the vocal cords
Laryngeal webs or clefts (a birth defect in which a thin layer of tissue is between the vocal cords)
Noncancerous growths (polyps, nodules, cysts, granulomas, papillomas, or ulcers) on the vocal cords
Overuse of the vocal cords from screaming, constantly clearing the throat, or singing
Hearing loss
Symptoms
DISFLUENCY
Stuttering is the most common type of disfluency.
Symptoms of disfluency can include:
Repetition of sounds, words, or parts of words or phrases after age 4 (I want...I want my doll. I...I see you.)
Putting in (interjecting) extra sounds or words (We went to the...uh...store.)
Making words longer (I am Boooobbby Jones.)
Pausing during a sentence or words, often with the lips together
Tension in the voice or sounds
Frustration with attempts to communicate
Head jerking while talking
Eye blinking while talking
Embarrassment with speech
ARTICULATION DISORDER
The child is not able to produce speech sounds clearly, such as saying "coo" instead of "school."
Certain sounds (like "r", "l", or "s") may be consistently distorted or changed (such as making the 's' sound with a whistle).
Errors may make it hard for people to understand the person (only family members may be able to understand a child).
PHONOLOGICAL DISORDER
The child does not use some or all of the speech sounds to form words as expected for their age.
The last or first sound of words (most often consonants) may be left out or changed.
The child may have no problem pronouncing the same sound in other words (a child may say "boo" for "book" and "pi" for "pig", but may have no problem saying "key" or "go").
VOICE DISORDERS
Other speech problems include:
Hoarseness or raspiness to the voice
Voice may break in or out
Pitch of the voice may change suddenly
Voice may be too loud or too soft
Person may run out of air during a sentence
Speech may sound odd because too much air is escaping through the nose (hypernasality) or too little air is coming out through the nose (hyponasality)
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will ask about your child's developmental and family history. The provider will do some neurological screening and check for:
Fluency of speech
Any emotional stress
Any underlying condition
Effect of speech disorder on daily life
Some other evaluation tools used to identify and diagnose speech disorders are:
Denver Articulation Screening Examination.
Leiter International Performance scale-3.
Goldman-Fristoe Test of Articulation 3 (GFTA-3).
Arizona Articulation and Phonology Scale 4th Revision (Arizona-4).
Prosody-voice screening profile.
A hearing test may also be done to check for hearing loss as a cause of the speech disorder.
Treatment
Children may outgrow milder forms of speech disorders. The type of treatment will depend on the severity of the speech disorder and its cause.
Speech therapy may help with more severe symptoms or any speech problems that do not improve.
In therapy, the therapist may teach your child how to use their tongue to create certain sounds.
If a child has a speech disorder, parents are encouraged to:
Avoid expressing too much concern about the problem, which can make matters worse by making the child more self-conscious.
Avoid stressful social situations whenever possible.
Listen patiently to the child, make eye contact, don't interrupt, and show love and acceptance. Avoid finishing sentences for them.
Set aside time for talking.

Outlook (Prognosis)
The outlook depends on the cause of the disorder. Speech can often be improved with speech therapy. Early treatment is likely to have better results.
Possible Complications
Speech disorders may lead to challenges with social interactions due to difficulty communicating.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
Your child's speech is not developing according to normal milestones.
You think your child is in a high-risk group.
Your child is showing signs of a speech disorder.
Prevention
Hearing loss is a risk factor for speech disorders. At-risk infants should be referred to an audiologist for a hearing test. Hearing and speech therapy can then be started, if necessary.
As young children begin to speak, some disfluency is common, and most of the time, it goes away without treatment. If you place too much attention on the disfluency, a stuttering pattern may develop.
