Alternative medicine for pain relief refers to treatments that are used instead of conventional (standard) ones. Typically, they are low- or no-risk treatments. If you use an alternative treatment along with conventional medicine or therapy, it is considered complementary therapy.
Information
There are many forms of alternative medicine for pain relief. They include acupuncture, chiropractic, herbal medicine, massage, magnetic waves, hypnosis, biofeedback, meditation, yoga, and tai-chi.
Acupuncture involves stimulating certain acupoints on the body using fine needles or other methods. How acupuncture works is not entirely clear. It is thought that acupoints lie near nerve fibers. When acupoints are stimulated, the nerve fibers signal the spinal cord and brain to release chemicals that relieve pain.
Acupuncture is an effective means of relieving pain, such as for back pain and
headache
pain. Acupuncture may also help relieve pain due to:
Cancer
Carpal tunnel syndrome
Fibromyalgia
Childbirth (labor)
Musculoskeletal injuries (such as the neck, shoulder, knee, or elbow)
Osteoarthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis
Hypnosis is a focused state of concentration. With self-hypnosis, you repeat a positive statement over and over.
Hypnosis may help relieve pain for:
After surgery or labor
Arthritis
Cancer
Fibromyalgia
Irritable bowel syndrome
Migraine headache
Tension headache
Both acupuncture and hypnosis are often offered by pain management centers in the United States. Other non-drug methods used at such centers include:
Biofeedback
Massage
Relaxation training
Physical therapy
Biofeedback provides information about your body such as blood pressure, muscle tension, and others. One can find how to take control of these functions to help their symptoms. Herbal medicine involves the use of various parts of plants. Many herbal medicines can interact with prescribed medicines, or can have other undesired effects. It is important to discuss all herbal therapies with your health care provider.
Some find magnetic waves helpful for healing, but these can interfere with certain medical devices and should be used only under direction of a medical provider during pregnancy.
