Neurofibromatosis 2 (NF2) is a disorder in which tumors form on the nerves of the brain and spine (the central nervous system). It may be passed down (inherited) in families.
Although it has a similar name to
neurofibromatosis type 1
, it is a different and separate condition.
Causes
NF2 is caused by a change in the gene NF2. NF2 can be passed down through families in an
autosomal dominant
pattern. This means that if one parent has NF2, any child of that parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition. Once someone carries the genetic change, their children have a 50% chance of inheriting it.
Some cases of NF2 occur when the gene mutates on its own. This is called sporadic and is not inherited. Once someone carries the genetic change, their children have a 50% chance of inheriting it.
Symptoms
Symptoms of NF2 include:
Balance problems
Cataracts
at a young age
Changes in vision
Coffee-colored marks on the skin (cafÃ©-au-lait), less common
Headaches
Hearing loss
Ringing and noises in the ears
Weakness of the face
Exams and Tests
Signs of NF2 include:
Brain and spinal tumors
Hearing-related (acoustic) tumors
Skin tumors
Tests include:
Physical examination
Medical history
MRI
CT scan
Genetic testing
Treatment
Acoustic nerve tumors can be observed or treated with surgery or
radiation
.
People with this disorder may benefit from genetic counseling.
People with NF2 should be regularly evaluated with these tests:
MRI of the brain and spinal cord
Hearing and
speech evaluation
Eye exam
