A serum iron test measures how much iron is in your blood.
How the Test is Performed
A
blood sample
is needed.
How to Prepare for the Test
The serum iron level can change, depending on how recently you ingested iron. Your health care provider will likely have you do this test in the morning or after fasting.
Certain medicines may affect the results of this test. Your provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines. Do not stop any medicine before talking to your provider.
Medicines that can affect the test result include:
Antibiotics
Birth control pills and estrogens
Blood pressure medicines
Cholesterol medicines
Deferoxamine (removes excess iron from the body)
Gout medicines
Testosterone
How the Test will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.
Why the Test is Performed
Your provider may recommend this test if you have:
Signs of low iron (iron deficiency)
Signs of too much iron
Anemia caused by a chronic disease
Normal Results
Normal value range is:
Iron: Males: 50 to 150 mcg/dL (8.95 to 26.85 micromol/L); Females: 35 to 145 mcg/dL (6.26 to 25.95 micromol/L)
Total iron binding capacity
(TIBC):Â Males: 171 to 505 mcg/dL (30.6 to 90.3 micromol/L); Females: 149 to 492 mcg/dL (26.7 to 88.0 micromol/L)
Iron saturation: Males: 20% to 50%; Females: 15% to 45%
The numbers above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Higher-than-normal iron level may be a sign of:
Too much iron in the body (
hemochromatosis
)
Anemia due to red blood cells being destroyed too quickly (
hemolytic anemia
)
Liver tissue death
Inflammation of the liver (
hepatitis
)
Iron poisoning
Frequent blood transfusions
Lower-than-normal level may be a sign of:
Long-term digestive tract bleeding
Heavy menstrual bleeding
Intestinal conditions that cause poor absorption of iron
Not enough iron in the diet
Pregnancy
Risks
There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:
Excessive bleeding
Fainting
or feeling lightheaded
Multiple punctures to locate veins
Hematoma
(blood buildup under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
Alternative Names
Fe+2; Ferric ion; Fe++; Ferrous ion; Iron - serum; Anemia - serum iron; Hemochromatosis - serum iron
