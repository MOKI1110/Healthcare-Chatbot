Incense is a product that creates a smell when it is burned. Incense poisoning can occur when someone sniffs or swallows liquid incense. This can be by accident or on purpose. Solid incense is not considered poisonous.
This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.
Poisonous Ingredient
The ingredients in liquid incense that can be harmful are:
Aromatic oils
Nitrates
Nitrites (including amyl nitrite)
Where Found
Liquid incense is sold on the internet and in stores under a variety of brand names. Nitrates such as amyl nitrate may be sold as video head cleaners, liquid incense, air fresheners or deodorizers, or cleaning products, but they are also often purchased for the purpose of getting 'high.'
Liquid incense that is breathed in (inhaled) is often called a "popper."

This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the liquid incense with you to the hospital, if possible.
The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated.
The person may receive:
Blood and urine tests
Breathing support, including a tube through the mouth into the lungs, and a breathing machine (ventilator)
Chest x-ray
ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)
Endoscopy -- camera placed down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and the stomach.
Fluids through a vein (by IV)
Laxatives
Medicine called an antidote to reverse the effect of the poison
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well someone does depends on how much liquid incense they swallowed and how quickly they receive treatment. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.
Abusing liquid incense is as dangerous as taking other illicit drugs, and it may cause death.
