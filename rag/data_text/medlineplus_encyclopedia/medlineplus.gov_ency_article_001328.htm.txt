Cryptococcosis is infection with the fungi
Cryptococcus neoformans
Â orÂ
Cryptococcus gattii
.
Causes
C neoformans
and
C gattii
are the fungi that cause this disease. Infection with
C neoformans
is seen worldwide. Infection with
C gattii
has mainly been seen in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, British Columbia in Canada, Southeast Asia, and Australia. In the United States, sporadic cases have been seen in many states including Washington, Oregon, California, Idaho, Hawaii, Georgia, Rhode Island, and Florida. Cryptococcus is the most common fungus that causes serious infection worldwide.
Both types of fungi are found in soil. If you breathe the fungus in, it can infect your lungs. The infection may go away on its own, remain in the lungs only, or spread throughout the body (disseminate).
C neoformans
infection is most often seen in people with a weak immune system, such as those who:
Have HIV infection
Take corticosteroid medicines
Have
cancer
Are on
chemotherapy
medicines for cancer
Have had an organ transplant
C gattii
may affect people with normal immune system (not immunocompromised).
C neoformans
is the most common life-threatening cause of fungal infection in people with HIV/AIDS.
People between 20 to 40 years of age are the most common age group that has this infection.
Symptoms
The infection may spread to the brain in people who have a weakened immune system. Neurological (brain) symptoms start slowly. Most people have swelling and irritation of the brain and spinal cord when they are diagnosed. Symptoms of brain infection may include:
Fever
and
headache
Neck stiffness
Nausea
and vomiting
Blurred vision
or double vision
Confusion
The infection can also affect the lungs and other organs. Lung symptoms may include:
Difficulty in breathing
Cough
Chest pain
Other symptoms may include:
Bone pain
or tenderness of the breastbone
Fatigue
Skin rash
, including pinpoint red spots (
petechiae
),
ulcers
, or other skin lesions
Sweating
-- unusual, excessive at night
Swollen glands
Unintentional weight loss
People with a healthy immune system may have no symptoms at all.
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about symptoms and travel history. The physical exam may reveal:
Abnormal breath sounds
Fast heart rate
Fever
Mental status changes
Stiff neck
Tests that may be done include:
Blood culture to differentiate between the two fungi
CT scan of the head
Sputum culture
and stain
Lung biopsy
Bronchoscopy
and bronchoalveolar lavage
Spinal tap
to obtain a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture
and other tests to check for signs of infection
Chest x-ray
Cryptococcal antigen test (looks for a certain molecule that is shed from the cell wall of the Cryptococcus fungus into the bloodstream or CSF)
Treatment
Antifungal medicines are prescribed for people infected with Cryptococcus.
Medicines include:
Amphotericin B (can have severe side effects)
Flucytosine
Fluconazole
Outlook (Prognosis)
Central nervous system
involvement often causes death or leads to permanent damage.
