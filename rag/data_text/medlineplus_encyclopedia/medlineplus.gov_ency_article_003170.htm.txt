Skeletal limb abnormalities refers to a variety of bone structure problems in the arms or legs (limbs).
Considerations
The term skeletal limb abnormalities is most often used to describe defects in the legs or arms that are due to a problem with genes or chromosomes, or that occur due to an event that happens during pregnancy.
The abnormalities are often present at birth.
Limb abnormalities can develop after birth if a person has
rickets
or other diseases that affect bone structure.
Causes
Skeletal limb abnormalities may be due to any of the following:
Cancer
Genetic diseases and chromosomal abnormalities, including
Marfan syndrome
,
Down syndrome
,
Apert syndrome
, and
Basal cell nevus syndrome
Improper position in the womb
Infections during pregnancy
Injury during birth
Malnutrition
Metabolism
problems
Pregnancy problems, including limb amputation from amniotic band disruption sequence
Use of certain medicines during pregnancy including thalidomide, which causes the upper part of the arms or legs to be missing, and aminopterin, which leads to shortness of the forearm
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you have any concerns about limb length or appearance.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
An infant with limb abnormalities generally has other symptoms and signs that, when taken together, define a specific syndrome or condition or give a clue as to the cause of the abnormality. The diagnosis is based on a family history, your medical history, and a thorough physical evaluation.
Medical history questions may include:
Does anyone in your family have skeletal abnormalities?
Were there any problems during pregnancy?
What illicit drugs or medicines were taken during the pregnancy?
What other symptoms or abnormalities are present?
Other tests such as
chromosome studies
,
enzyme
assays, x-rays, and metabolic studies may be done.
