Apert syndrome

Apert syndrome is a genetic disease in which the seams between the skull bones close earlier than normal. This affects the shape of the head and face. Children with Apert syndrome often have deformities of the hands and feet as well.
Causes
Apert syndrome can be passed down through families (inherited) as an
autosomal dominant
trait. This means that only one parent needs to pass on the altered gene to a child to have the condition.
Most cases may occur without a known family history.
Apert syndrome is caused by one of two changes to the
FGFR2
gene. This gene change causes some of the bony sutures of the skull to close too early. This condition is called
craniosynostosis
.
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Early closure of sutures between bones of the skull, noted by ridging along sutures (craniosynostosis)
Frequent ear infections
Fusion or severe webbing of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th fingers, often called "mitten hands"
Hearing loss
Large or late-closing soft spot on a baby's skull (fontanelle)
Possible, slow intellectual development (varies from person to person)
Prominent or bulging eyes
Severe under-development of the midface
Skeletal (limb) abnormalities
Short height
Webbing or fusion of the toes
Several other syndromes can lead to a similar appearance of the face and head, but do not include the severe hand and foot features of Apert syndrome. These similar syndromes include:
Carpenter syndrome (kleeblattschadel, cloverleaf skull deformity)
Crouzon disease (craniofacial dysostosis)
Pfeiffer syndrome
Saethre-Chotzen syndrome
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. Hand, foot, and
skull x-rays
will be done. Hearing tests should always be performed.
Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis of Apert syndrome.
Treatment
Treatment consists of surgery to correct abnormal bone growth of the skull, as well as for the fusion of the fingers and toes. Children with this disorder should be examined by a specialized craniofacial surgery team at a children's medical center.
A hearing specialist should be consulted if there are hearing problems.
Support Groups
More information and support for people with Apert syndrome and their families can be found at:
Children's Craniofacial Association:

When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have a family history of Apert syndrome or you notice your baby's skull is not developing normally.
Prevention
Genetic counseling may be helpful if you have a family history of this disorder and are planning to become pregnant. Your provider can test your baby for this disease during pregnancy.
