Retroperitoneal inflammation causes swelling that occurs in the retroperitoneal space. Over time, it can lead to a mass behind the abdomen and its contents called
retroperitoneal fibrosis
.
The retroperitoneal space is in front of the lower back and behind the abdominal lining (peritoneum). Organs in this space include the:
Kidneys
Lymph nodes
Pancreas
Ureters
Adrenal glands
Esophagus
Abdominal aorta
Parts of the colon and stomach
Rectum
Causes
Retroperitoneal inflammation and fibrosis is a rare condition. There is no clear cause in about 70% of cases. It most likely develops due to inflammation of the abdominal aortic artery.
It has been associated with certain risk factors and medicines.
Conditions that can rarely lead to this include:
Abdominal radiation therapy for cancer
Cancer -- bladder, breast, colon, lymphoma, prostate, sarcoma
Carcinoid tumor
Crohn disease
Infections -- tuberculosis, histoplasmosis
Certain medicines,Â such as methysergide, ergotamine, pergolide, methyldopa, etanercept and infliximab
Surgery on structures in the retroperitoneum
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Abdominal pain
Anorexia
Flank pain

Exams and Tests
Your health care provider usually diagnoses the condition based on a computed tomography (CT) scan, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or ultrasound exam of your abdomen. A biopsy of tissues in your abdomen may be needed.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the underlying cause of retroperitoneal inflammation and fibrosis.
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well you do with the condition depends on the underlying cause. It can lead to kidney failure.
