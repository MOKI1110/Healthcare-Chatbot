Anticoagulant rodenticides are poisons used to kill rats. Rodenticide means rodent killer. An anticoagulant is a blood thinner.
Anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning occurs when someone swallows a product containing one or more of these chemicals.

This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

What to Expect at the Emergency Room
If you go to the emergency room, take the container for the poison with you, if possible.
The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Blood and urine tests will be done. The person may receive:
Airway and breathing support, including oxygen. In extreme cases, a tube may be passed through the mouth into the lungs to prevent the person from breathing in blood. A breathing machine (ventilator) would then be needed.
Blood transfusion, including clotting factors (which help your blood clot), and red blood cells.
Chest x-ray
.
ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)
.
Endoscopy
-- a camera down the throat to see the esophagus and stomach.
Fluids through a vein (IV).
Medicines to treat symptoms.
Medicine (activated charcoal) to absorb any remaining poison (activated charcoal may be given only if it can be done safely within one hour of poison ingestion).
Laxatives to move the poison through the body more quickly.
Medicine (antidote) such as vitamin K to reverse the effect of the poison.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Death may occur as late as 2 weeks after the poisoning as a result of bleeding. However, getting the right treatment most often prevents serious complications. If blood loss has damaged the heart or other vital organs, recovery may take longer. The person may not fully recover in these cases.
