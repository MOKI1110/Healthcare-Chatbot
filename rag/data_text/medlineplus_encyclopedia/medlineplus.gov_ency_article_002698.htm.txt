Aftershave is a lotion, gel, or liquid applied to the face after shaving. Many men use it. This article discusses the harmful effects from swallowing aftershave products.
This article is for information only. Do NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

Home Care
Seek medical help right away. DO NOT make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to.

Time it was swallowed
Amount swallowed
Poison Control
Your local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.
The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated.
The person may receive:
Blood and urine tests
Breathing support, including tube through the mouth into the lungs and breathing machine (ventilator)
Chest x-ray
ECG (electrocardiogram or heart tracing)
Dialysis (kidney machine)
Endoscopy
(camera placed down the throat to see burns in the esophagus and the stomach, if vomiting blood)
Fluids through a vein (by IV)
Laxative
Medicine to treat the effects of the poison
Outlook (Prognosis)
Aftershave poisoning is more common in small children than in older children or adults. Alcoholics may drink aftershave when other alcohol runs out.
The outcome depends on how much the person swallows. The range of illness may vary from a condition similar to being drunk to coma, seizures, and severe lung problems. A product with more isopropyl alcohol could cause a more serious illness. Complications, such as pneumonia, muscle damage from lying on a hard surface for a prolonged period of time, or brain damage from lack of oxygen, may cause permanent disability.
Aftershave poisoning is not deadly in most cases.
