This article discusses poisoning from copper.
This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.
Poisonous Ingredient
Copper can be poisonous if it is swallowed or inhaled.
Where Found
Copper is found in these products:
Certain coins - all pennies in the United States made before 1982 contain copper
Certain insecticides and fungicides
Copper wire
Some aquarium products
Vitamin and mineral supplements (copper is an essential micronutrient, but too much can be toxic)
Other products may also contain copper.
Symptoms
Swallowing large amounts of copper may cause:
Abdominal pain
Diarrhea
Vomiting
Yellow skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)
Touching large amounts of copper can cause the hair to turn a different color (green). Breathing in copper dust and fumes may cause an acute syndrome of metal fume fever (MFF). People with MFF have:
Chest pain
Chills
Cough
Fever
General weakness
Headache
Metallic taste
in the mouth
Long-term exposure may cause lung inflammation and permanent scarring. This can lead to decreased lung function.
Symptoms of long-term exposure include:
Anemia
(low red blood cell count)
Burning sensation
Chills
Convulsions
Dementia
Diarrhea
(often bloody and may be blue in color)
Difficulty speaking
Fever
Involuntary movements
Jaundice (yellow skin)
Kidney failure
Liver failure
Metallic taste in the mouth
Muscle aches
Nausea
Pain
Shock
Tremor (shaking)
Vomiting
Weakness
Home Care
Seek medical help right away. Do not make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to.
Before Calling Emergency
Have this information ready:
The person's age, weight, and condition
The name of the product (and ingredients and strength, if known)
The time it was swallowed or inhaled
The amount swallowed or inhaled
Poison Control
Your local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Your provider will measure and monitor your vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.
Tests that may be done include:
Blood and urine tests
Chest x-ray
Electrocardiogram
(ECG)
Treatment may include:
Activated charcoal by mouth or tube through the nose into the stomach
Breathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the lungs, and breathing machine (ventilator)
Dialysis (kidney machine)
Fluids through a vein (IV)
Medicine to treat symptoms
Medicine to reverse the effect of copper
Oral fluids to dilute the effect of swallowing copper, but only if the person does not have abdominal pain, vomiting, or is unable to protect their airway from aspiration (fluid entering the lungs)
Outlook (Prognosis)
Sudden (acute) copper poisoning is rare. However, serious health problems from long-term exposure to copper can occur. Severe poisoning can cause liver failure and death.
In poisonings from a long-term buildup of copper in the body, the outcome depends on how much damage there is to the body's organs.
