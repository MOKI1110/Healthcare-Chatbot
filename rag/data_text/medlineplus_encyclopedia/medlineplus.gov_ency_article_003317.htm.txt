A cloudy cornea is a loss of transparency of the cornea.
Causes
The cornea is the front wall of the eye. It is normally clear. It helps focus the light entering the eye.
Causes of cloudy cornea include:
Inflammation of the cornea
Sensitivity to non-infectious bacteria or toxins
Infection of the cornea
Keratitis
Trachoma
River blindness
Corneal ulcers
Swelling (edema)
Acute
glaucoma
Birth injury
Fuchs dystrophy
Dryness of the eye due to
SjÃ¶gren syndrome
, vitamin A deficiency, or LASIK eye surgery
Corneal dystrophy (inherited metabolic disease)
Keratoconus
Injury to the eye, including chemical burns and welding injury
Tumors or growths on the eye
Pterygium
Bowen disease
Clouding may affect all or part of the cornea. It leads to different amounts of
vision loss
. You may not have any symptoms in the early stages.
Home Care
Contact your health care provider. There is no appropriate home care.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
The outer surface of your eye appears cloudy.
You have trouble with your vision.
Note: You will need to see an ophthalmologist (eye doctor) for vision or eye problems. However, your primary care provider may also be involved if the problem could be due to a whole-body (systemic) disease.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
The provider or eye doctor will examine your eyes and ask about your medical history. The two main questions will be if your vision is affected and if you have seen a spot on the front of your eye.
Other questions may include:
When did you first notice this?
Does it affect both eyes?
Do you have trouble with your vision?
Is it constant or intermittent?
Do you wear contact lenses?
Is there any history of injury to the eye?
Has there been any discomfort? If so, is there anything that helps?
Tests may include:
Biopsy of eyelid tissue
Computer mapping of the cornea (corneal topography)
Schirmer test for eye dryness
Special photographs to measure the cells of the cornea
Standard eye exam
Ultrasound
to measure corneal thickness
Alternative Names
