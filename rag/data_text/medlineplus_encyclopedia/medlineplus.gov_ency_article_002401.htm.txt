Thiamin is one of the B vitamins. The B vitamins are a group of water-soluble vitamins that are part of many of the chemical reactions in the body.
Function
Thiamin (vitamin B1) helps the body's cells change carbohydrates into energy. The main role of carbohydrates is to provide energy for the body, especially the brain and nervous system.
Thiamin also plays a role in muscle contraction and conduction of nerve signals.
Thiamin is essential for the metabolism of pyruvate, which is an important molecule in several chemical reactions in the body.
Food Sources
Thiamin is found in:
Enriched, fortified, and whole grain products such as bread, cereals, rice, pasta, and flour
Wheat germ
Beef steak and pork
Trout and bluefin tuna
Egg
Legumes and peas
Nuts and seeds
Dairy products, fruits, and vegetables are not very high in thiamin in small amounts. But when you eat large amounts of these, they become a significant source of thiamin.
Side Effects
A lack of thiamin can cause
weakness
,
fatigue
, confusion,
psychosis
, and nerve damage.
Thiamin deficiency in the United States is most often seen in people who consume too much alcohol (usually due to an alcohol use disorder). Consuming a lot of alcohol makes it hard for the body to absorb thiamin from foods.
Unless those with heavy alcohol use receive higher-than-normal amounts of thiamin to make up for the difference, the body will not get enough thiamin. This can lead to a disease called
beriberi
.
In severe thiamin deficiency, brain damage can occur. One type is called
Korsakoff syndrome
. The other is
Wernicke disease
. Either or both of these conditions can occur in the same person.
There is no known poisoning linked to excessive intake of thiamin.
Recommendations
Recommendations for thiamin, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:
Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)
: The average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people. An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence.
Adequate Intake (AI)
: This level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA. It is set at a level that is thought to ensure enough nutrition.
Dietary reference intakes for thiamin:
Infants (AI)
0 to 6 months: 0.2 milligrams per day (mg/day)
7 to 12 months: 0.3 mg/day
Children (RDA)
1 to 3 years: 0.5 mg/day
4 to 8 years: 0.6 mg/day
9 to 13 years: 0.9 mg/day
Adolescents and adults (RDA)
Males age 14 and older: 1.2 mg/day
Females age 14 to 18 years: 1.0 mg/day
Females age 19 and older: 1.1 mg/day (1.4 mg needed during pregnancy and lactation)
The best way to get the daily requirement of essential vitamins is to eat a balanced diet that contains a variety of foods.
