Achilles tendon repair
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Your Achilles tendon joins your calf muscle to your heel. You can tear your Achilles tendon if you land hard on your heel during sports, from a jump, accelerating when you are pushing off, or when stepping into a hole.
Surgery to repair the Achilles tendon is done if your Achilles tendon has a complete tear.
Description
To fix your torn Achilles tendon, the surgeon will:
Make a cut down the back of your heel
Make several small cuts rather than one large cut
After that, the surgeon will:
Bring the ends of your tendon together
Sew the ends together
Stitch the wound closed
Why the Procedure is Performed
Before surgery is considered, you and your health care provider will talk about ways to
take care of your Achilles tendon rupture
.
You may need this surgery if your Achilles tendon has torn and separated.
You need your Achilles tendon to point your toes and push off your foot when walking. If your Achilles tendon is not fixed, you can have problems walking up stairs or rising up on your toes. However, studies have shown that Achilles tendon tears can be treated without surgery and have similar outcomes. Talk to your provider about which course of treatment is best for you.
Risks
Risks from anesthesia and surgery are:
Breathing problems
Reactions to medicines
Bleeding or infection
Possible problems from Achilles tendon repair are:
Damage to nerves in the foot
Foot swelling
Problems with blood flow to the foot
Wound healing problems, which may require more surgeries
Scaring of the Achilles tendon
Blood clot or deep vein thrombosis
Some loss of calf muscle strength
There is a small chance that your Achilles tendon could tear again. About 5 out of 100 people will have their Achilles tendon tear again.
Before the Procedure
Always tell your surgeon:
If you could be pregnant
What medicines you are taking, including medicines, herbs, or supplements you bought without a prescription
If you have been drinking a lot of alcohol
During the days before the surgery:
You may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other medicines that make it hard for your blood to clot.
Ask your provider which medicines you should still take on the day of the surgery.
If you smoke, ask your provider for help quitting.
You should elevate your ankle to decrease swelling.
On the day of the surgery:
You will probably be asked not to drink or eat anything for several hours before the surgery. Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.
Your surgeon will tell you when to arrive.
After the Procedure
Work with your surgeon to keep your pain in control. Your heel may be very sore.
You will be wearing a cast or splint for a period of time.
Many people can be discharged the same day of the surgery. Some people may require a short stay in the hospital.
Keep your leg elevated for as much as possible during the first 2 weeks to reduce swelling and promote wound healing.
Outlook (Prognosis)
You will be able to resume full activity in about 6 months. Expect full recovery to take about 9 months.
