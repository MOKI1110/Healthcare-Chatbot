Interstitial nephritis
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Interstitial nephritis is a kidney disorder in which the spaces between the kidney tubules become swollen (inflamed). This can cause problems with the way your kidneys work.
Causes
Interstitial nephritis may be temporary (
acute
), or it may be long-lasting (
chronic
) and get worse over time.
The acute form of interstitial nephritis is most often a side effect of certain drugs.
The following can cause interstitial nephritis:
Allergic reaction
to a drug (acute interstitial allergic nephritis).
Autoimmune disorders, such as anti-tubular basement membrane disease or
Kawasaki disease
.
Infections.
Long-term use of medicines such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). This is called
analgesic nephropathy
.
Side effect of certain antibiotics such as penicillin, ampicillin, methicillin, and sulfonamide medicines.
Side effect of other medicines such as furosemide, thiazide diuretics, omeprazole, triamterene, and allopurinol.
Too little potassium in your blood.
Too much calcium or uric acid in your blood.
Symptoms
Interstitial nephritis can cause mild to severe kidney problems, including
acute kidney failure
. In about half of cases, people will have
decreased urine output
and other signs of acute kidney failure.
Symptoms of this condition may include:
Blood in the urine
Fever
Increased or
decreased urine output
Mental status changes
(
drowsiness
,
confusion
,
coma
)
Nausea
,
vomiting
Rash
Swelling
of any area of body
Weight gain
(from retaining fluid)
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may reveal:
Abnormal lung or heart sounds
High blood pressure
Fluid in the lungs (
pulmonary edema
)
Common tests include:
Blood chemistry
BUN
and blood
creatinine
levels
Complete blood count
Kidney biopsy
Kidney ultrasound
Urinalysis
Treatment
Treatment depends on the cause of the problem. Avoiding medicines that lead to this condition may quickly relieve symptoms.
Limiting
salt
and fluid in the diet can improve swelling and high blood pressure. Limiting
protein
in the diet can help control the buildup of waste products in the blood (
azotemia
), which can lead to symptoms of acute kidney failure.
If dialysis is necessary, it usually is required for only a short time.
Corticosteroids or stronger anti-inflammatory medicines such as cyclophosphamide can sometimes be helpful.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Most often, interstitial nephritis is a short-term disorder. In rare cases, it can cause permanent damage, including long-term (chronic) kidney failure.
Acute interstitial nephritis may be more severe and more likely to lead to long-term or permanent
kidney damage
in older people.
Possible Complications
Metabolic acidosis
can occur because the kidneys aren't able to remove enough acid. The disorder can lead to acute or
chronic kidney failure
or
end-stage kidney disease
.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of interstitial nephritis.
If you have interstitial nephritis, contact your provider if you get new symptoms, especially if you are less alert or have a decrease in urine output.
Prevention
Often, the disorder can't be prevented. Avoiding or reducing your use of medicines that can cause this condition can help reduce your risk. If needed, your provider will tell you which medicines to stop or reduce.
