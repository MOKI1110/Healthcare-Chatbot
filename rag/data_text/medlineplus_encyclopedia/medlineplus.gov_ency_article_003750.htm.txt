Urethral discharge culture is a laboratory test done on men and boys. This test is used to identify germs in the urethra that may be causing inflammation of the urethra (
urethritis
). The urethra is the tube that drains urine from the bladder.
How the Test is Performed
The health care provider uses sterile cotton or gauze to clean the opening of the urethra at the tip of the penis. To collect the sample, a cotton swab is then gently inserted about three-fourths inch (2 centimeters) into the urethra and turned. To get a good sample, the test should be done at least 2 hours after urinating.
The sample is sent to a lab. There, it is placed in a special dish (culture). It is then watched to see if bacteria or any other germs grow.
How to Prepare for the Test
DO NOT urinate for 1 hour before the test. Urinating washes away some of the germs needed for accurate test results.
How the Test will Feel
There is usually some discomfort from swabbing the urethra.
Why the Test is Performed
The provider often orders the test when there is a discharge from the urethra or other symptoms of infection. This test can detect sexually transmitted infections (STIs), such as
gonorrhea
and
chlamydia
.
Normal Results
A negative culture, or no growth appearing in the culture, is normal.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Abnormal results can be a sign of infection in the genital tract. These infections can include gonorrhea or chlamydia.
Risks
Fainting may occur when the swab is introduced into the urethra. This is due to stimulation of the vagus nerve. Other risks include infection or bleeding.
Alternative Names
Culture of urethral discharge; Genital exudate culture; Culture - genital discharge or exudate; Urethritis - culture
