Crush injury

A crush injury occurs when excessive force or pressure is put on a body part. This type of injury most often happens when part of the body is squeezed between two heavy objects.
Damage related to crush injuries include:
Bleeding
Bruising
Compartment syndrome
(increased pressure, usually in an arm or leg, that causes serious muscle, nerve, blood vessel, and tissue damage)
Broken bone
(fracture)
Open wound
(laceration)
Nerve injury
Infection (caused by bacteria that enter the body through a wound)
First Aid
Steps for first aid treatment of a crush injury are:
Stop bleeding by applying direct pressure.
Cover the area with a moist cloth or bandage. Then, raise the area above the level of the heart, if possible.
If there is suspicion of a head, neck, or spinal injury, immobilize those areas if possible and then limit movement to only the crushed area.
Call 911 or the local emergency number.
Crush injuries most often need to be evaluated in a hospital emergency department. Surgery may be needed.
