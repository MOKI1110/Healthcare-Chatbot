Multiple system atrophy- parkinsonian type (MSA-P) is a rare condition that causes symptoms similar to
Parkinson disease
. However, people with MSA-P have more widespread damage to the part of the nervous system that regulates important functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and sweating.
The other subtype of MSA is
MSA-cerebellar
. It mainly affects the cerebellum, an area deep in the brain, just above the spinal cord.
Causes
The cause of MSA-P is unknown. The affected areas of the brain overlap with areas affected by Parkinson disease, with similar symptoms. For this reason, this subtype of MSA is called parkinsonian.
MSA-P is most often diagnosed in men older than 60.
Symptoms
MSA damages the nervous system. The disease tends to progress rapidly. About one half of people with MSA-P have lost most of their motor skills within 5 years of onset of the disease.
Symptoms may include:
Passing out (syncope) due to drops in blood pressure
Tremors
Movement difficulties, such as slowness, loss of balance, shuffling when walking
Frequent falls
Muscle aches and pains (
myalgia
), and stiffness
Face changes, such as a masklike appearance to the face and staring
Difficulty chewing or
swallowing
(occasionally), not able to close the mouth
Disrupted sleep patterns (often during rapid eye movement [REM] sleep late at night)
Dizziness
or fainting when standing up or after standing still
Erection problems
Loss of control over
bowels
or
bladder
Problems with activities that requires small movements (loss of fine motor skills), such as writing that is small and hard to read
Loss of sweating in any part of the body
Decline in mental function
Nausea
and problems with digestion
Posture problems, such as unstable, stooped, or slumped over
Vision changes
, decreased or blurred vision
Voice and speech changes
Other symptoms that may occur with this disease:
Confusion
Dementia
Depression
Sleep-related breathing difficulties, includingÂ
sleep apnea
or a blockage in the air passage that leads to a harsh vibrating sound
Restless legs
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine you, and check your eyes, nerves, and muscles.
Your blood pressure will be taken while you are lying down and standing up.
There are no specific tests to confirm this disease. A specialist in the nervous system (neurologist) can make the diagnosis based on:
History of symptoms
Physical exam results
Ruling out other causes of symptoms
Testing to help confirm the diagnosis may include:
Autonomic nervous system testing
MRI ofÂ  head
Plasma
norepinephrine
levels
Urine exam for norepinephrine breakdown products (
urine catecholamines
)
Treatment
There is no cure for MSA-P. There is no known way to prevent the disease from getting worse. The goal of treatment is to control symptoms.
Dopaminergic medicines, such as levodopa and carbidopa, may be used to reduce early or mild tremors.
But, for many people with MSA-P, these medicines do not work well.
Medicines may be used to treat low blood pressure.
A
pacemaker
that is programmed to stimulate the heart to beat at a rapid rate (faster than 100 beats per minute) may increase blood pressure for some people.
Constipation can be treated with a high-fiber diet and laxatives. Medicines are available to treat erection problems.
Support Groups
More information and support for people with MSA-P and their families can be found at:

The MSA Coalition --

Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome for MSA is poor. Loss of mental and physical functions slowly get worse. Early death is likely. People typically live 7 to 9 years after diagnosis.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of this disorder.
Contact your provider if you have been diagnosed with MSA and your symptoms return or get worse. Also contact your provider if new symptoms appear, including possible side effects of medicines, such as:
Changes in alertness/behavior/mood
Delusional behavior
Dizziness
Hallucinations
Involuntary movements
Loss of mental functioning
Nausea or vomiting
Severe confusion or disorientation
If you have a family member with MSA and their condition declines to the point that you are unable to care for the person at home, seek advice from your family member's provider.
