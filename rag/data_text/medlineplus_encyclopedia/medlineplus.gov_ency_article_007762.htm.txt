Human papillomavirus infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection. The infection is caused by the human papilloma virus (HPV).
HPV can cause genital warts and lead to
cervical cancer
. Certain types of HPV can cause an infection in the mouth and throat. In some people, this can cause
oral cancer
.
This article is about oral HPV infection.
Causes
Oral HPV is thought to spread mainly through oral sex and deep tongue kissing. The virus passes from one person to another during sexual activity.
Your risk of getting the infection goes up if you:
Have more sexual partners
Use tobacco or alcohol
Have a weak immune system
Men are more likely to have oral HPV infection than women.
Certain types of HPV are known to cause cancer of the
throat or larynx
. This is called oropharyngeal cancer. HPV-16 is associated with almost all oral cancers.
Symptoms
Oral HPV infection shows no symptoms. You can have HPV without ever knowing it. You can pass on the virus because you don't know you have it.
Most people who develop oropharyngeal cancer from an HPV infection have had the infection for a long time.
Symptoms of oropharyngeal cancer may include:
Abnormal (high-pitched) breathing sounds
Cough
Coughing up blood
Trouble swallowing, pain when swallowing
Sore throat that lasts more than 2 to 3 weeks, even with antibiotics
Hoarseness that does not get better in 3 to 4 weeks
Swollen lymph nodes
White or red area (lesion) on tonsils
Jaw pain or swelling
Neck or cheek lump
Unexplained weight loss
Exams and Tests
An oral HPV infection has no symptoms and cannot be detected by a test.
If you have symptoms that concern you, it does not mean you have cancer, but you should see your health care provider to get it checked.
You may undergo a physical exam. Your provider may examine your mouth area. You may be asked about your medical history and any symptoms you noticed.
Your provider may look in your throat or nose using a flexible tube with a small camera at the end.
If your provider suspects cancer, other tests may be ordered, such as:
Biopsy
of suspected tumor. This tissue will also be tested for HPV.
Chest x-ray
.
CT scan of chest
.
CT scan of head
and neck.
MRI of the head
or neck.
PET scan
.
Treatment
Most oral HPV infections go away on their own without treatment within 2 years and do not cause any health problems.
Possible Complications
Certain types of HPV can cause oropharyngeal cancer.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider right away if you notice any of the symptoms of mouth and throat cancer.
Prevention
Using
condoms and dental dams
may help prevent the spread of oral HPV. But be aware that condoms or dams cannot fully protect you. This is because the virus can be on the nearby skin.
The
HPV vaccine
can help prevent cervical cancer. It's not clear if the vaccine can also help prevent oral HPV.
Ask your provider whether vaccination is right for you.
