Mucopolysaccharidosis type IV

Mucopolysaccharidosis type IV (MPS IV) is a rare disease in which the body is missing or does not have enough of an
enzyme
needed to break down long chains of sugar molecules. These chains of molecules are called glycosaminoglycans (formerly called mucopolysaccharides). As a result, the molecules build up in different parts of the body and cause various health problems.
The condition belongs to a group of diseases called
mucopolysaccharidoses
(MPSs). MPS IV is also known as Morquio syndrome.
There are several other types of MPSs, including:
MPS I
(Hurler syndrome; Hurler-Scheie syndrome; Scheie syndrome)
MPS II
(Hunter syndrome)
MPS III
(Sanfilippo syndrome)
Causes
MPS IV is an inherited disorder. This means it is typically passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of a gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease. This is called an
autosomal recessive
trait.
There are two forms of MPS IV: type A and type B.
Type A is caused by a defect in the
GALNS
gene. People with type A do not have an enzyme called
N
-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase.
Type B is caused by a defect in the
GLB1
gene. People with type B do not produce enough of an enzyme called beta-galactosidase.
The body needs these enzymes to break down long strands of sugar molecules called keratan sulfate. In both types, abnormally large amounts of glycosaminoglycans build up in the body. This can damage bodily organs.
Symptoms
Symptoms usually start between ages 1 and 3 years. They include:
Abnormal development of bones, including the spine
Bell-shaped chest with ribs flared out at the bottom
Cloudy cornea
Coarse facial features
Enlarged liver
Heart murmur
Hernia in the groin
Hypermobile joints
Knock-knees
Large head
Loss of nerve function below the neck
Short stature
with a particularly short trunk
Widely spaced teeth
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam that may find:
Abnormal curvature of the spine
Cloudy cornea
Heart murmur
Hernia in the groin
Enlarged liver
Loss of nerve function below the neck
Short stature (especially short trunk)
Urine tests are usually done first. These tests may show extra mucopolysaccharides, but they can't determine the specific form of MPS.
Other tests may include:
Blood enzyme levels
Echocardiogram
Genetic testing
Hearing test
Slit-lamp
eye exam
Skin fibroblast culture
X-rays
of the long bones, ribs, and spine
MRI
of the lower skull and upper neck
Treatment
For type A, the medicine called elosulfase alfa (Vimizim), which replaces the missing enzyme, may be tried. It is given through a vein (IV, intravenously). Talk to your provider for more information.
Enzyme replacement therapy is not available for type B.
For both types, symptoms are treated as they occur. A spinal fusion may prevent permanent spinal cord injury in people whose neck bones are underdeveloped.

Outlook (Prognosis)
Cognitive function (ability to think clearly) is usually normal in people with MPS IV.
Bone problems can lead to major health problems. For example, the small bones at the top of the neck may slip and damage the spinal cord, causing paralysis. Surgery to correct such problems should be done if possible.
Heart problems may lead to death.
Possible Complications
These complications may occur:
Breathing problems
Heart failure
Spinal cord damage and possible paralysis
Vision problems
Walking problems related to abnormal curvature of the spine and other bone problems
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if symptoms of MPS IV occur.
Prevention
Genetic counseling
is recommended for couples who want to have children and who have a family history of MPS IV. Prenatal testing is available.
