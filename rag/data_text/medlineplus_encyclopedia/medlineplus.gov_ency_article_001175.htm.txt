Sheehan syndrome is a condition that can occur in a woman who bleeds severely during childbirth. Sheehan syndrome is a type of
hypopituitarism
.
Causes
Severe bleeding during childbirth can cause tissue in the pituitary gland to die. This prevents the pituitary gland from functioning normally.
The pituitary gland is at the base of the brain. It makes hormones that stimulate growth, production of breast milk, reproductive functions, the thyroid, and the adrenal glands. A lack of these hormones can lead to a variety of symptoms. Conditions that increase the risk of bleeding during childbirth and Sheehan syndrome include multiple pregnancy (twins or triplets) and problems with the placenta. The placenta is the organ that develops during pregnancy to feed the fetus.
The condition is rare today due to advances in obstetric care.
Symptoms
Symptoms of Sheehan syndrome may include:
Inability to breastfeed (breast milk never "comes in")
Fatigue
Lack of menstrual bleeding
Loss of pubic and armpit (axillary) hair
Low blood pressure
Note: Other than not being able to breastfeed, symptoms may not develop for several years after the delivery.
Exams and Tests
Tests done may include:
Blood tests to measure
hormone levels
MRI of the head
to check for other pituitary problems, such as a tumor
Treatment
Treatment involves estrogen and progesterone hormone replacement therapy. These hormones must be taken at least until the normal age of menopause. Thyroid and adrenal hormones must also be taken. These will be needed for the rest of your life.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outlook with early diagnosis and treatment is excellent.
Possible Complications
This condition can be life threatening if not treated.
Prevention
Severe loss of blood during childbirth can often be prevented by proper medical care. Otherwise, Sheehan syndrome is not preventable.
Alternative Names
Postpartum hypopituitarism; Postpartum pituitary insufficiency; Hypopituitarism syndrome; Sheehan's syndrome
