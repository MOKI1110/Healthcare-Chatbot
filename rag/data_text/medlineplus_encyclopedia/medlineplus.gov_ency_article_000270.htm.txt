A pancreatic abscess is an area filled with pus within the pancreas.
Causes
Pancreatic
abscesses
develop in people who have:
Pancreatic pseudocysts
Severe pancreatitisÂ that becomes infected
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Abdominal mass
Abdominal pain
Chills
Fever
Inability to eat
Nausea and vomiting
Exams and Tests
Most people with pancreatic abscesses have had pancreatitis. However, the complication often takes 7 or more days to develop.
Signs of an abscess can be seen on:
CT scan
of the abdomen
MRI of the abdomen
Ultrasound
of the abdomen
Blood tests will show high white blood cell count. A blood culture may grow bacteria.
Treatment
It may be possible to drain the abscess through the skin (percutaneous). Abscess drainage can be done through an endoscope using endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) in some cases. Surgery to drain the abscess and remove dead tissue is often needed.
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well a person does depends on how severe the infection is. The death rate from undrained pancreatic abscesses is very high.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Multiple abscesses
Sepsis
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you have:
Abdominal pain with fever
Other signs of a pancreatic abscess, especially if you have recently had a pancreatic pseudocyst or pancreatitis
Prevention
Draining a pancreatic pseudocyst may help prevent some cases of pancreatic abscess. However, in many cases, the disorder is not preventable.
