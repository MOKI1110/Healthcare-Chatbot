Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type I is a disease in which one or more of the endocrine glands are overactive or forms a tumor. It is passed down through families.
Endocrine glands most commonly involved include:
Pancreas
Parathyroid
Pituitary
Causes
MEN I is caused by a defect in a gene that carries the code for a protein called menin. The condition causes tumors of various glands to appear in the same person, but not necessarily at the same time.
The disorder may occur at any age, and it affects men and women equally. A family history of this disorder raises your risk.
Symptoms
Symptoms vary from person to person, and depend on which gland is involved. They may include:
Abdominal pain
Anxiety
Black, tarry stools
Bloated feeling after meals
Burning, aching, or
hunger
discomfort in the upper abdomen or lower chest that is relieved by antacids, milk, or food
Decreased sexual interest
Fatigue
Headache
Lack of menstrual periods (in women)
Loss of appetite
Loss of body or facial hair (in men)
Mental changes
or confusion
Muscle pain
Nausea and vomiting
Sensitivity to the cold
Unintentional weight loss
Vision problems
Weakness
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions about your medical history and symptoms. The following tests may be done:
Blood cortisol level
CT scan of the abdomen
CT scan of the head
Fasting blood sugar
Genetic testing
Insulin test
MRI of the abdomen
MRI of the head
Â
Serum adrenocorticotropic hormone
Serum calcium
Serum follicle stimulating hormone
Serum gastrin
Serum glucagon
Serum luteinizing hormone
Serum parathyroid hormone
Serum prolactin
Serum thyroid stimulating hormone
Ultrasound of the neck
Treatment
Surgery to remove the diseased gland is often the treatment of choice. Medicines such as cabergoline and bromocriptine may be used instead of surgery for pituitary tumors that release the hormone prolactin.
The parathyroid glands, which control calcium production, can be removed. However, it is difficult for the body to regulate calcium levels without these glands, so a total parathyroid removal is not done first in most cases.
Medicine is available to decrease the excess stomach acid production caused by some tumors (gastrinomas), and to reduce the risk of ulcers.
Hormone replacement therapy is given when entire glands are removed or do not produce enough hormones.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Pituitary and parathyroid tumors areÂ usually noncancerous (
benign
), but some pancreatic tumors may become cancerous (malignant) and spread to the liver. These can lower life expectancy.
The symptoms of
peptic ulcer
disease, low blood sugar, excess calcium in the blood, and pituitary dysfunction usually respond well to appropriate treatment.
Possible Complications
The tumors can keep coming back. Symptoms and complications depend on which glands are involved.Â Regular check-upsÂ by your providerÂ are essential.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you notice symptoms of MEN I or have a family history of this condition.
Prevention
Screening close relatives of people affected with this disorder is recommended.
