Small for gestational age means that a fetus or an infant is smaller or less developed than normal for the baby's sex and gestational age.
Gestational age
is the age of a fetus or baby that starts on the first day of the mother's last menstrual period.
Information
Ultrasound is used to find out if a fetus is smaller than normal for their age. This condition is called intrauterine growth restriction. The most common definition of small for gestational age (SGA) is a birth weight that is below the 10th percentile. At the time of the ultrasound exam, your health care provider may use other findings, such as the amount of amniotic fluid surrounding the baby, to further understand the baby's condition.
Causes for SGA fetus may include:
Genetic diseases
Inherited metabolic diseases
Chromosome anomalies
Multiple gestations (twins, triplets, and more)
Abnormal placenta
High blood pressure
A developing baby with intrauterine growth restriction will be small in size and can have problems such as:
Increased red blood cells
Low blood sugar
Low body temperature
Alternative Names
Low birth weight
