Hysteroscopy is a procedure to look at the inside of the womb (uterus). Your health care provider can look at the:
Cervix, the opening to the womb
Inside of the womb
Openings of the fallopian tubes
This procedure is commonly used to diagnose bleeding problems in women, remove polyps or
fibroids
, or perform sterilization procedures. It may be done in a hospital, outpatient surgery center, or the provider's office.
Description
Hysteroscopy gets its name from the thin, lighted tool used to view the womb, called a hysteroscope. This tool sends images of the inside of the womb to a video monitor.
Before the procedure, you will be given medicine to help you relax and to block pain. Sometimes, medicine is given to help you fall asleep. During the procedure:
The provider places the scope through the vagina and cervix, into the womb.
Gas or fluid may be placed into the womb so it expands. This helps the provider see the area better.
Pictures of the womb can be seen on the video screen.
Small tools can be placed through the scope to remove abnormal growths (fibroids or polyps) or tissue for examination (
biopsy
).
Certain treatments, such as ablation, can also be done through the scope. Ablation uses heat, cold, electricity, or radio waves to damage the lining of the womb.
Hysteroscopy can last from 15 minutes to more than 1 hour, depending on what is done.
Why the Procedure is Performed
This procedure may be done to:
Treat heavy or irregular periods
Block the fallopian tubes to prevent pregnancy
Identify any abnormal structure of the womb
Diagnose thickening of the lining of the womb seen on ultrasound or other imaging tests
Find and remove abnormal growths such as polyps or fibroids
Find the cause of repeated miscarriages or remove tissue after a pregnancy loss
Remove an intrauterine device (IUD)
Remove scar tissue from the womb
Take a tissue sample (biopsy) from the cervix or womb
This procedure may also have other uses not listed here.
Risks
Risks of hysteroscopy may include:
Hole (perforation) in the wall of the womb
Infection of the uterus
Scarring of the lining of the womb
Damage to the cervix
Need for surgery to repair damage
Unusual fluid absorption during the procedure leading to low sodium levels
Severe bleeding
Damage to the bowelsÂ
Risks of any pelvic surgery may include:
Damage to nearby organs or tissues
Blood clots, which could travel to the lungs and be deadly (rare)
Risks of anesthesia include:
Nausea and vomiting
Dizziness
Headache
Breathing problems
Lung infection
Risks of any surgery include:
Infection
Bleeding
Biopsy results are usually available within 1 to 2 weeks.
Before the Procedure
Your provider may prescribe medicine to open your cervix. This makes it easier to insert the scope. You need to take this medicine about 8 to 12 hours before your procedure.
Before the procedure, tell your provider:
You are or could be pregnant
You are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription
During the week before your surgery:
You may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.
Ask your provider which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.
Tell your provider if you have a cold, flu, fever, herpes outbreak, or other sickness.
You will be told when to arrive for the procedure. Ask if you need to arrange for someone to drive you home.Â
On the day of the procedure:
Follow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.
Take the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.
Arrive at the hospital on time.
After the Procedure
You may go home the same day. Rarely, you may need to stay overnight. You may have:
Menstrual-like cramps and light vaginal bleeding for 1 to 2 days. Ask if you can take over-the-counter pain medicine for the cramping.
A watery discharge for up to several weeks.
You can return to normal daily activities within 1 to 2 days. Do not have sex until your provider says it is OK.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Your provider will tell you the results of your procedure.
