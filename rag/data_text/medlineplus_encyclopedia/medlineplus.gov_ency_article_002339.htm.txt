Virilization is a condition in which a female develops characteristics associated with male hormones (androgens), or when a newborn has characteristics of male hormone exposure at birth.
Information
Virilization may be caused by:
Excess testosterone production
Use of anabolic steroids (used for performance-enhancement or other purposes)
In newborn boys or girls, the condition may be caused by:
Certain medicines taken by the mother during pregnancy
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
in the baby or the mother
Other medical conditions in the mother (such as tumors of the ovaries or adrenal glands that release male hormones)
In girls who are going through puberty, the condition may be caused by:
Polycystic ovary syndrome
Certain medicines, or anabolic steroids
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia
Tumors of the ovaries, or adrenal glands that release male hormones (androgens)
In adult women, the condition may be caused by:
Certain medicines, or anabolic steroids
Tumors of the ovaries or adrenal glands that release male hormones
Signs of virilization in a female often depend on the level of testosterone in the body.
Low level (common):
Thick, dark facial hair in the beard or mustache area
Increase in body hair
Oily skin or acne
Irregular menstrual periods
Moderate level (uncommon):
Male-pattern baldness
Loss of female fat distribution
Decreased breast size
High level (rare):
Enlargement of the clitoris
Deepening of the voice
Male muscle pattern
Tests may include:
Blood tests to detect excess testosterone or other androgen hormones in females
CT scan
,
MRI
, or
ultrasound
to check for tumors of the ovaries and adrenal glands
If virilization is caused by exposure to androgens (male hormones) in female adults, many of the symptoms go away when the hormones are stopped. However, deepening of the voice is a permanent effect of exposure to androgens.
