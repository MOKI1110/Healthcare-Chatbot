Trisomy 18

Trisomy 18 is a genetic disorder in which a person has a third copy of material from
chromosome
18, instead of the usual 2 copies. Rarely, the extra material may be attached to another chromosome (translocation). Most cases are not passed down through families. Instead, the problems that lead to this condition occur in either the sperm or the egg that forms the fetus.
Causes
Trisomy 18 occurs in 1 in 6000 live births. It is 3 times more common in girls than boys.
The syndrome occurs when there is extra material from chromosome 18. The extra material affects normal development.
Trisomy 18: the presence of an extra (third) chromosome 18 in all of the cells.
Mosaic trisomy 18: the presence of an extra chromosome 18 in some of the cells.
Partial trisomy 18: the presence of a part of an extra chromosome 18 in the cells.
Most cases of Trisomy 18 are not passed down through families (inherited). Instead, the events that lead to trisomy 18 occur in either the sperm or the egg that forms the fetus.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
Clenched hands
Crossed legs
Feet with a rounded bottom (rocker-bottom feet)
Low birth weight
Low-set ears
Mental delay
Poorly developed fingernails
Small head (
microcephaly
)
Small jaw (
micrognathia
)
Undescended testicle
Unusual shaped chest (
pectus carinatum
)
Exams and Tests
An exam during pregnancy may show an unusually large uterus and extra
amniotic fluid
. There may be an unusually small placenta when the baby is born. A physical exam of the infant may show unusual facial features and fingerprint patterns. X-rays may show a short breast bone.
Chromosome studies
will show trisomy 18. The chromosome abnormality may be present in every cell or present in only a certain percentage of the cells (called mosaicism). Studies may also show part of the chromosome in some cells. Rarely, part of the chromosome 18 becomes attached to another chromosome. This is called
translocation
.
Other signs include:
Hole, split, or cleft in the iris of the eye (
coloboma
)
Separation between the left and right side of the abdominal muscle (
diastasis recti
)
Umbilical hernia
or
inguinal hernia
There are often signs of
congenital heart disease
, such as:
Atrial septal defect
(ASD)
Patent ductus arteriosus
(PDA)
Ventricular septal defect
(VSD)
Tests may also show kidney problems, including:
Horseshoe kidney
Hydronephrosis
Polycystic kidney
Treatment
There are no specific treatments for trisomy 18. Which treatments are used depend on the person's individual condition.
Support Groups

Outlook (Prognosis)
One half of infants with this condition do not survive beyond the first week of life. Nine out of ten children will die by 1 year of age. Some children have survived to the teenage years, but with serious medical and developmental problems.
Possible Complications
Complications depend on the specific defects and symptoms.
Complications may include:
Breathing difficulty or lack of breathing (apnea)
Deafness
Feeding problems
Heart failure
Seizures
Vision problems
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Genetic counseling can help families understand the condition, the risks of inheriting it, and how to care for the person.
Prevention
Tests can be done during pregnancy to find out if the child has this syndrome.
Genetic counseling is recommended for parents who have a child with this syndrome and who want to have more children.
Alternative Names
Edwards syndrome
