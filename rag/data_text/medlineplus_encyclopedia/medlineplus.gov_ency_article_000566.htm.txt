Hereditary ovalocytosis is a rare condition passed down through families (inherited). The blood cells are oval-shaped instead of round. It is a form of
hereditary elliptocytosis
.
Causes
Hereditary ovalocytosis is mainly found in Southeast Asian populations.
Symptoms
Newborn infants with hereditary ovalocytosis may have
anemia
and
jaundice
. Adults most often do not show symptoms.
Exams and Tests
An exam by your health care provider may show an enlarged spleen.
This condition is diagnosed by looking at the shape of blood cells under a microscope. The following tests may also be done:
Complete blood count
(CBC) to check for anemia or red blood cell destruction
Blood smear to determine cell shape
Bilirubin level
(may be high)
Lactate dehydrogenase level (may be high)
Ultrasound of the abdomen (may show gallstones)
Treatment
In severe cases, the disease may be treated by removal of the spleen (
splenectomy
).
Possible Complications

gallstones
or kidney problems.
