Absence of sweating
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
An abnormal lack of sweat in response to heat may be harmful because sweating allows heat to be released from the body. The medical term for absent sweating is anhidrosis.
Considerations
Anhidrosis sometimes goes unrecognized until a substantial amount of heat or exertion fails to cause sweating.
Overall lack of
sweating
can be life threatening because the body will overheat. If the lack of sweating happens in a small area only, it is usually not as dangerous.
Causes
Cause of anhidrosis may include:
Burns
Brain tumor
Certain genetic syndromes
Certain nerve problems (neuropathies)
Congenital disorders including
ectodermal dysplasia
Dehydration
Nervous system disorders such as
Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome
Skin diseases or scarring of the skin that block sweat glands
Trauma to sweat glands
Use of certain drugs
Home Care
If there is a danger of overheating, take the following measures:
Take a cool shower or sit in a bathtub with cool water
Drink plenty of fluids
Stay in a cool environment
Move slowly
DO NOT do heavy exercise
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Call your health care provider if you have a general lack of sweating or an abnormal lack of sweating when exposed to heat or strenuous exercise.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will perform a physical exam. In emergencies, the health care team will perform rapid cooling measures and give you fluids to stabilize you.
You may be asked about your symptoms and medical history.
You may be asked to wrap yourself in an electric blanket or sit in a sweatbox while the health care team watches your body's reaction. Other tests to cause and measure sweating may also be done.
A
skin biopsy
may be done. Genetic testing may be done if appropriate.
Treatment depends on the cause of your lack of sweating. You may be given medicine to cause sweating.
Alternative Names
Decreased sweating; Anhidrosis
