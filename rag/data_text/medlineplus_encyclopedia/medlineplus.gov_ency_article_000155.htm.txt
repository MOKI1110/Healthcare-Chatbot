Drug-induced hypertension is
high blood pressure
caused by a chemical substance or medicine.
Causes
Blood pressure is determined by the:
Amount of blood the heart pumps
Condition of the heart valves
Pulse rate
Pumping power of the heart
Size and condition of the arteries
There are several types of high blood pressure:
Essential hypertension has no cause that can be found (many different genetic traits contribute to essential hypertension, each one having a relatively small effect).
Secondary hypertension occurs because of another disorder.
Drug-induced hypertension is a form of secondary hypertension caused by the effects of a chemical substance or medicine.
Pregnancy-induced hypertension.
Chemical substances and medicines that can cause high blood pressure include:
Acetaminophen
Alcohol, amphetamines, ecstasy (MDMA and derivatives), and cocaine
Angiogenesis inhibitors (including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and monoclonal antibodies)
Antidepressants (including venlafaxine, bupropion, and desipramine)
Black licorice
Caffeine (including the caffeine in coffee and energy drinks)
Corticosteroids and mineralocorticoids
Ephedra and many other herbal products
Erythropoietin
Estrogens (including birth control pills)
Immunosuppressants (such as cyclosporine)
Many over-the-counter medicines such as cough/cold and
asthma
medicines, particularly when the cough/cold medicine is taken with certain antidepressants,Â such asÂ tranylcypromine or tricyclics
Migraine
medicines
Nasal decongestants
Nicotine
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
Phentermine (a weight loss medicine)
Testosterone and other anabolic steroids and performance-enhancing medicines
Thyroid hormone (when taken in excess)
Yohimbine (and Yohimbe extract)
Rebound hypertension occurs when blood pressure rises after you stop taking or lower the dose of a medicine (typically a medicine you are taking to lower high blood pressure).
This is common for medicines that block the sympathetic nervous system like beta blockers and clonidine.
Talk to your health care provider to see if your medicine needs to be gradually tapered before stopping.
Many other factors can also affect blood pressure, including:
Age
Condition of the kidneys, nervous system, or blood vessels
Genetics
Foods eaten, weight, and other body-related variables, including the amount of added
sodium in processed foods
Levels of various hormones in the body
Volume of water in the body
Alternative Names
Hypertension - medication related; Drug-induced hypertension
