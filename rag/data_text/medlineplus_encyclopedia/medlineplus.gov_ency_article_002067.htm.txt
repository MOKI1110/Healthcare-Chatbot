Chicken soup has been a popular home remedy for the
common cold
since at least the 12th century. Eating chicken soup while you have a cold will not do you any harm, but it will not cure your cold.
Drinking warm liquids, such as soup, may give you relief from your symptoms for a short time. The steam from chicken soup may open up congested noses and throats. Soup also provides fluid, which thins mucus and helps prevent dehydration.
