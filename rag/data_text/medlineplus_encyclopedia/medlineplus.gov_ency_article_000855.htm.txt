Cellulitis

Cellulitis is a common skin infection caused by bacteria. It affects the middle layer of the skin (dermis) and the tissues below. Sometimes, muscle below the skin can be affected.
Causes
Staphylococcus and streptococcus bacteria are the most common causes of cellulitis.
Normal skin has many types of bacteria living on it. When there is a break in the skin, these bacteria can cause a skin infection.
Risk factors for cellulitis include:
Cracks or peeling skin between the toes
History of
peripheral vascular disease
Injury or trauma with a break in the skin (skin wounds)
Insect bites and stings
, animal bites, or human bites
Ulcers
from certain diseases, including diabetes and vascular disease
Use of corticosteroid medicines or other medicines that suppress the immune system
Wound from a recent surgery
Symptoms
Symptoms of cellulitis include:
Fever
with
chills
and
sweating
Fatigue
Pain or tenderness in the affected area
Skin redness or inflammation
that gets bigger as the infection spreads
Skin sore or
rash
that starts suddenly, and grows quickly in the first 24 hours
Tight, glossy, stretched appearance of the skin
Warm skin in the area of redness
Muscle aches
and joint stiffness from swelling of the tissue over the joint
Nausea and vomiting
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may reveal:
Redness, warmth, tenderness, and swelling of the skin
Possible drainage, if there is a buildup of pus (
abscess
) with the skin infection
Swollen glands
(lymph nodes) near the affected area
Your provider may mark the edges of the redness with a pen, to see if the redness goes past the marked border over the next several days.
Tests that may be ordered include:
Blood culture
Complete blood count (CBC)
Culture of any fluid or material inside the affected area
A
biopsy
may be done if other conditions are suspected
Treatment
You will likely be prescribed antibiotics to be taken by mouth. You may be given pain medicine as well, if needed.
At home, raise the infected area higher than your heart to reduce swelling and speed up healing. Rest until your symptoms improve.
You may need to stay in a hospital if:
You are very sick (for example, you have a very high temperature, low blood pressure, or nausea and vomiting that does not go away)
You have been on antibiotics and the infection is getting worse (spreading beyond the original pen marking)
Your immune system is not working well (due to cancer, HIV, or other medical condition)
You have an infection around your eyes
You require antibiotics through a vein (IV)
Outlook (Prognosis)
Cellulitis usually goes away after taking antibiotics for 7Â to 10 days. Longer treatment may be needed if cellulitis is more severe. This may occur if you have a chronic disease or your immune system is not working properly.
People with fungal infections of the feet may have cellulitis that keeps coming back, especially if you have
diabetes
. Cracks in the skin from the fungal infection allow the bacteria to get into the skin.
Possible Complications
The following may result if cellulitis isn't treated or treatment doesn't work:
Blood infection (
sepsis
)
Bone infection (
osteomyelitis
)
Inflammation of the lymph vessels (lymphangitis)
Inflammation of the heart (
endocarditis
)
Infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (
meningitis
)
Shock
Tissue death (
gangrene
)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Call your provider right away if:
You have symptoms of cellulitis
You are being treated for cellulitis and you develop new symptoms, such as persistent fever, drowsiness,
lethargy
, blistering over the cellulitis, or red streaks that spread
Prevention
Protect your skin by:
Keeping your skin moist with lotions or ointments to prevent cracking
Wearing shoes that fit well and provide enough room for your feet
Learning how to trim your nails to avoid harming the skin around them
Wearing appropriate protective equipment when participating in work or sports
Whenever you have a break in the skin:
Clean the break carefully with soap and water. Apply petroleum jelly every day.
Cover with a bandage and change it every day.
Watch for redness, pain, drainage, or other signs of infection.
