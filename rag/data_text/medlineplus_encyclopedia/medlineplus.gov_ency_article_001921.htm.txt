WHY PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE IS IMPORTANT
Even if you feel fine, you should still see your provider for regular checkups. These visits can help you avoid problems in the future. For example, the only way to find out if you have high blood pressure is to have it checked regularly. High blood sugar and high cholesterol levels also may not have any symptoms in the early stages. A simple blood test can check for these conditions.
Below are some of the tests that may be done or scheduled:
Blood pressure
Blood sugar
Cholesterol (blood)
Colon cancer screening
test
Depression
screening
Genetic testing
for breast cancer or ovarian cancer in certain women
HIV test
Breast cancer screening test
Osteoporosis screening
Cervical cancer screening test
Lung cancer screening test
Tests for
chlamydia
,
gonorrhea
,
syphilis
, and other sexually transmitted diseases
Your provider can recommend
how often you might want to schedule a visit
.
Another part of preventive health is learning to recognize changes in your body that may not be normal. This is so you can see your provider right away. Changes may include:
A lump anywhere on your body
Losing weight without trying
A lasting
fever
A
cough
that does not go away
Body aches and pains that do not go away
Changes or blood in your stools
Skin changes or sores that do not go away or get worse
Other changes or symptoms that are new or do not go away
WHAT YOU CAN DO TO STAY HEALTHY

healthy weight
