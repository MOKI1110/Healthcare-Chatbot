If the medicine was prescribed for the person
Poison Control
Your local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the container to the hospital with you, if possible.
The provider will measure and monitor the person's
vital signs
, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.
Tests that may be done include:
Blood and urine tests
Chest x-ray
Electrocardiogram
(ECG)
Endoscopy
-- camera placed down the throat to check for burns in the esophagus and stomach
Treatment may include:
Fluids through a vein (by IV)
Medicine to treat stomach inflammation and bleeding, breathing problems, and other symptoms
Activated charcoal
Laxative
Tube through the mouth into the stomach to empty the stomach (gastric lavage)
Breathing support, including tube through the mouth into the lungs and connected to a breathing machine (
ventilator
)
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well someone does depends on how much meclofenamate was swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.
A mild overdose of meclofenamate does not usually cause serious problems. The person may have some stomach pain and vomiting (possibly with blood).
However, a large amount of internal bleeding is possible, and a blood transfusion may be needed. Passing a tube with a camera through the mouth into the stomach may be needed to stop the internal bleeding.
If kidney damage is severe, dialysis may be needed until kidney function returns. In some cases, the damage is permanent.
A large overdose can cause serious damage to children and adults. Death may occur.
