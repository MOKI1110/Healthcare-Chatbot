Panic disorder is a type of anxiety disorder in which you have repeated attacks of intense fear that something bad will happen.
Causes
The cause is unknown. Genes may play a role. Other family members may have the disorder. But panic disorder often occurs when there is no family history.
Panic disorder is twice as common in women as it is in men. Symptoms often begin before age 25 but may first occur in the mid-30s. Children can also have panic disorder, but it is often not diagnosed until they are older.
Symptoms
A panic attack begins suddenly and most often peaks within 10 to 20 minutes. Some symptoms continue for an hour or more. A panic attack may be mistaken for a heart attack.
A person with panic disorder often lives in fear of another attack, and may be afraid to be alone or far from medical help.
People with panic disorder have at least 4 of the following symptoms during an attack:
Chest pain
or discomfort
Dizziness
or feeling faint
Fear of dying
Fear of losing control or impending doom
Feeling of choking
Feelings of detachment
Feelings of unreality
Nausea or upset stomach
Numbness or tingling
in the hands, feet, or face
Palpitations
, fast heart rate, or pounding heart
Sensation of
shortness of breath
or smothering
Sweating
,
chills
, or hot flashes
Trembling
or shaking
Panic attacks may change behavior and function at home, school, or work. People with the disorder often worry about the effects of their panic attacks.
People with panic disorder may misuse alcohol or other substances. They may feel sad or depressed.
Panic attacks cannot be predicted. At least in the early stages of the disorder, there is no trigger that starts the attack. Recalling a past attack may trigger panic attacks.
Exams and Tests
Many people with panic disorder first seek treatment at the emergency room. This is because the panic attack often feels like a heart attack.
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and a mental health assessment.
Blood tests may be done. Other medical disorders must be ruled out before panic disorder can be diagnosed. Disorders related to substance use will be considered because symptoms can resemble panic attacks.
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to help you function well during everyday life. Using both medicines and talk therapy works best.
Talk therapy (cognitive-behavioral therapy, or CBT) can help you understand panic attacks and how to cope with them. During therapy, you will learn how to:
Understand and control distorted views of life stressors, such as other people's behavior or life events.
Recognize and replace thoughts that cause panic and decrease the sense of helplessness.
Manage stress and relax when symptoms occur.
Imagine the things that cause the anxiety, starting with the least fearful. Practice in real-life situations to help you overcome your fears.
Certain medicines, often also used to treat depression, may be very helpful for this disorder. They work by preventing your symptoms or making them less severe. You must take these medicines every day. Do not stop taking them without talking with your provider.
Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are most often the first choice of antidepressant.
Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are another choice.
Other medicines used to treat depression or medicines used to treat
seizures
may also be tried.
Medicines called sedatives or hypnotics may also be prescribed.
These medicines should only be taken under your provider's direction.
Your provider will prescribe a limited amount of these medicines. They should not be used every day.
They may be used when symptoms become very severe or when you are about to be exposed to something that always brings on your symptoms.
If you are prescribed a sedative, do not drink alcohol while on this type of medicine.
The following may also help reduce the number or severity of panic attacks:
Do not drink alcohol.
Eat at regular times.
Get plenty of exercise.
Get enough sleep.
Reduce or avoid caffeine, certain cold medicines, and stimulants.
Support Groups
You can ease the stress of having panic disorder by joining a support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.
Support groups are usually not a good substitute for talk therapy or taking medicine, but can be a helpful addition.
