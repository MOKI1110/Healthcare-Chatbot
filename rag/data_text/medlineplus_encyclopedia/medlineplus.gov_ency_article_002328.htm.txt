A titer is a measurement of the amount or concentration of a substance in a solution. It usually refers to the amount of
antibodies
found in a person's blood.
Information
Blood titer measurements can help determine medical treatment. Antibody titers show if a person is immune to diseases such as
measles
, chickenpox, or
hepatitis
. They can also help measure harmful antibodies related to lupus or other autoimmune diseases.
A titer measurement is expressed as a ratio, such as 1:40.
