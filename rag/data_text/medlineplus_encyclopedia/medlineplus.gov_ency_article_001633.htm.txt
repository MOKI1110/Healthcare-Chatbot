Fusion of the ear bones is an abnormal joining of the three bones of the middle ear. These are the incus, malleus, and stapes bones. Fusion or fixation of the bones leads to hearing loss because the bones are not moving and vibrating in reaction to sound waves.
Treatment options include hearing aids to amplify the sound and surgery to improve the middle ear conduction of sound.
