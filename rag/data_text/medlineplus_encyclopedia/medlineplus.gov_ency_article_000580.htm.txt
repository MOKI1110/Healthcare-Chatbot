Hodgkin lymphoma

Hodgkin lymphoma is a cancer of lymph tissue. Lymph tissue is found in the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, bone marrow, and other sites.
Causes
The cause of Hodgkin lymphoma is not known. Hodgkin lymphoma is most common among people 15 to 35 years old and those 55 and older. Past infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is thought to contribute to some cases. People with HIV infection are at increased risk compared to the general population.
Symptoms
The first sign of Hodgkin lymphoma is often a painless swollen lymph node that appears without a known cause. The disease can spread to nearby lymph nodes. Later it may spread to the spleen, liver, bone marrow, or other organs.
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Feeling tired all the time
Fever and chills that come and go
Itching all over the body that cannot be explained
Loss of appetite
Drenching night sweats
Painless swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck, armpits, or groin (
swollen glands
)
Weight loss that cannot be explained
Other symptoms that may occur with this disease:
Coughing, chest pains, or breathing problems if there are swollen lymph nodes in the chest
Excessive sweating
Pain or feeling of fullness below the ribs due to swollen spleen or liver
Pain in lymph nodes after drinking alcohol
Skin blushing or flushing
Symptoms caused by Hodgkin lymphoma may occur with other conditions. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific symptoms.
Exams and Tests
Your provider will perform a physical exam and check body areas with lymph nodes to feel if they are swollen.
The disease is diagnosed based on a biopsy of abnormal tissue, usually a lymph node.
The following procedures will usually be done:
Blood chemistry tests
including liver function tests, kidney function tests, and
lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH)
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
(ESR)
Bone marrow biopsy
CT scans
of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis
Complete blood count
(CBC) and
white blood cell differential
to check for anemia and low white blood cell count
PET scan
If tests show that you have Hodgkin lymphoma, more tests may be done to see how far the cancer has spread. This is called staging.
Staging
helps guide treatment and follow-up.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the following:
The type of Hodgkin lymphoma
The stage (where the disease has spread)
Your age and other medical issues
Other factors, including whether you have weight loss, night sweats, and fever
You may receive
chemotherapy
,
radiation therapy
, chemoimmunotherapy, chemoradiation therapy, or a combination of all therapies. Your provider can tell you more about your specific treatment.
High-dose chemotherapy may be given when Hodgkin lymphoma returns after treatment or does not respond to the first treatment. This is followed by a
stem cell transplant
that uses your own stem cells.
Blood transfusions or platelet transfusions may be required if blood counts are low.
You and your provider may need to manage other concerns during your lymphoma treatment, including:
Having chemotherapy at home
Managing your pets during chemotherapy
Bleeding problems
Dry mouth
Eating enough calories
Support Groups
You can ease the stress of illness by joining a
cancer support group
. Sharing with others who have common experiences can help you not feel alone.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Hodgkin lymphoma is one of the most curable cancers. A cure is even more likely if it is diagnosed and treated early. Unlike many other cancers, Hodgkin lymphoma is also very curable in its late stages.
You will need to have regular exams for years after your treatment. This helps your provider check for signs of the cancer returning and for any long-term treatment effects.
Possible Complications
Treatments for Hodgkin lymphoma can have complications. Long-term complications of chemotherapy or radiation therapy include:
Bone marrow diseases (such as
leukemia
)
Heart disease
Inability to have children (
infertility
)
Lung problems
Other cancers
Thyroid problems
Keep following up with a provider who knows about monitoring and preventing these complications.
