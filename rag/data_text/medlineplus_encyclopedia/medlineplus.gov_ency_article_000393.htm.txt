Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors

Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are rare
tumors
of the pancreas that start from a type of cell called the islet cell.
Causes
In the healthy pancreas, cells called islet cells produce hormones that regulate several bodily functions. These include blood sugar level and the production of stomach acid.
Tumors that arise from islet cells of the pancreas can also produce a variety of hormones, which can lead to specific symptoms.
Pancreatic NETs can be noncancerous (
benign
) or cancerous (
malignant
).
NETs include:
Gastrinoma (
Zollinger-Ellison syndrome
)
Glucagonoma
Insulinoma
Somatostatinoma
VIPoma (
Verner-Morrison syndrome
)
A family history of multiple
endocrine
neoplasia, type I (
MEN I
) is a risk factor for the development of NETs.
Symptoms
Symptoms depend on which hormone is made by the tumor.
For example, insulinomas produce insulin, which lowers blood sugar level. Symptoms may include:
Feeling tired or weak
Shaking or sweating
Headache
Hunger
Nervousness, anxiety, or feeling irritable
Unclear thinking or feeling uneasy
Double or blurry vision
Fast or pounding heartbeat
If your blood sugar level gets too low, you may faint, have a seizure, or even go into a coma.
Gastrinomas make the hormone gastrin, which tells the body to make stomach acid. Symptoms may include:
Abdominal pain
Diarrhea
Ulcers in the stomach and small bowel
Vomiting blood (occasionally)
Glucagonomas make the hormone glucagon, which helps the body raise blood sugar level. Symptoms can include:
Diabetes
Red, blistery rash in the groin or buttocks
Weight loss
Frequent urination and thirst
Somatostatinomas make the hormone somatostatin. Symptoms may include:
High blood sugar
Gallstones
Yellowish appearance to skin, and eyes
Weight loss
Diarrhea with foul smelling stools
VIPomas make the hormone vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) which is involved in maintaining the balance of sodium, potassium and other minerals in the GI tract. VIPomas may cause:
Severe diarrhea that may lead to dehydration
Low blood potassium levels, and high calcium levels
Abdominal cramps
Weight loss
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will take your medical history and perform a physical exam.
Blood tests may vary, depending upon the symptoms, but may include:
Fasting glucose
level
Gastrin level
Glucose tolerance test
Secretin stimulation test
for pancreas
Blood glucagon
level
Blood insulin C-peptide
Â level
Blood insulin level
Fasting serum somatostatin level
Serum vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) level
Imaging tests may be done:
Abdominal CT scan
Abdominal ultrasound
Endoscopic
ultrasound
MRI of abdomen
A blood sample may also be taken from a vein in the pancreas for testing.
Sometimes, surgery is needed to diagnose and treat this condition. During this procedure, the surgeon examines the pancreas by hand and with ultrasound.
Treatment
Treatment depends on the type of tumor and if it is cancerous.
Cancerous tumors can grow quickly and spread to other organs. They may not be treatable. Tumors are often removed with surgery, if possible.
If cancer cells spread to the liver, a part of the liver may also be removed, if possible. If the cancer is widespread, chemotherapy may be used to try to shrink the tumors.
If the abnormal production of hormones is causing symptoms, you may receive medicines to counteract their effects. For example, with gastrinomas, the overproduction of gastrin leads to too much acid in the stomach. Medicines that block stomach acid release can reduce symptoms.
Support Groups
You can ease the stress of illness by joining a
cancer support group
. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.
Outlook (Prognosis)
You may be cured if the tumors are surgically removed before they have spread to other organs. If tumors are cancerous, chemotherapy may be used, but it usually cannot cure people.
Life-threatening problems (such as very low blood sugar) can occur due to excess hormone production, or if the cancer spreads throughout the body.
Possible Complications
Complications of these tumors include:
Diabetes
Hormone crises (if the tumor releases certain types of hormones)
Severe low blood sugar (from insulinomas)
Severe ulcers in the stomach and small intestine (from gastrinomas)
Spread of the tumor to the liver
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of these tumors, especially if you have a family history of MEN I.
Prevention
There is no known prevention for these tumors.
