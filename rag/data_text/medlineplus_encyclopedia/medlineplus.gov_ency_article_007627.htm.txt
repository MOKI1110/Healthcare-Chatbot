Nasal endoscopy is a test to view the inside of the nose and sinuses to check for problems.
How the Test is Performed
The test takes 1 to 5 minutes. Your health care provider will:
Spray your nose with a medicine to reduce swelling and numb the area.
Insert the nasal endoscope into your nose. This is a long flexible or rigid tube with a camera at the end to look inside the nose and sinuses. Pictures may be projected onto a screen.
Examine the inside of your nose and sinuses.
Remove
polyps
, mucus, or other masses from the nose or sinuses.
How to Prepare for the Test
You do not need to do anything to prepare for the test.
How the Test will Feel
This test does not hurt.
You will feel discomfort or pressure as the tube is put into your nose.
The spray numbs your nose. It can numb your mouth and throat, and you may feel like you cannot swallow. This numbness goes away in 20 to 30 minutes.
You might sneeze during the test. If you feel a sneeze coming on, let your provider know.
It is normal to have tearing from the eyes during this test.
Why the Test is Performed
You may have a nasal endoscopy to figure out what is causing problems in your nose and sinuses.
During the procedure, your provider may:
Look at the inside of your nose and sinuses
Take a sample of tissue for a
biopsy
Do small surgeries to remove polyps, excess mucus, or other masses
Suction out crusts or other debris to clear your nose and sinuses
Your provider may recommend nasal endoscopy if you are having:
A lot of sinus infections
Lots of drainage from your nose
Face pain or pressure
Sinus headaches
A hard time breathing through your nose
Nose bleeds
Loss of sense of smell
Normal Results
The inside of the nose and bones look normal.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Nasal endoscopy helps with the diagnosis of:
Polyps in the nose (nasal polyps)
Blockages
Sinusitis
Swollen and runny nose that will not go away
Nasal masses or
tumors
A foreign object (like a marble) in the nose or sinus
Deviated septum (many insurance plans require a nasal endoscopy prior to surgery to correct it)
Risks
There is very little risk with a nasal endoscopy for most people.
If you have a bleeding disorder or take blood-thinning medicine, let your provider know so they are extra careful to decrease bleeding.
If you have heart disease, there is a small risk that you could feel lightheaded or faint.
