Vitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin. Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water so the body cannot store them. Leftover amounts of the vitamin leave the body through the urine. Although the body maintains a small pool of water-soluble vitamins, they have to be taken regularly.
Lack of vitamin B6 in the body is uncommon. It can occur in people with kidney failure, liver disease, or excessive alcohol use.
Function

Make hemoglobin. Hemoglobin carries oxygen in the red blood cells to the tissues. A vitamin B6 deficiency can cause a form of
anemia
.
Break down
proteins
. The more protein you eat, the more vitamin B6 you need.
Keep blood sugar (glucose) in normal ranges.

Recommendations
Recommendations for vitamin B6, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:
Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)
: The average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people. An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence.
Adequate Intake (AI)
: This level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA. It is set at a level that is thought to ensure enough nutrition.
Dietary reference intakes for vitamin B6:
Infants (AI)
0 to 6 months: 0.1 milligrams per day (mg/day)
7 to 12 months: 0.3 mg/day
Children (RDA)
1 to 3 years: 0.5 mg/day
4 to 8 years: 0.6 mg/day
9 to 13 years: 1.0 mg/day
Adolescents and adults (RDA)
Males age 14 to 50 years: 1.3 mg/day
Males over 50 years: 1.7 mg/day
Females age 14 to 18 years: 1.2 mg/day
Females age 19 to 50 years: 1.3 mg/day
Females over 50 years: 1.5 mg/day
Females of all ages 1.9 mg/day during pregnancy and 2.0 mg/day during lactation
