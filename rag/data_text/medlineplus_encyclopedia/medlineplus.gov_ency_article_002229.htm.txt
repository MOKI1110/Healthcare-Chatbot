An allergen is a substance that can cause an
allergic reaction
. In some people, the immune system recognizes allergens as foreign or dangerous. As a result, the immune system reacts by making a type of
antibody
called immunoglobulin E (IgE) to defend against the allergen. This reaction leads to allergy symptoms.
