To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Many people are
allergic to pollens from grass and weeds
. These
allergies
most often occur in the late spring and summer.
This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.
Poisonous Ingredient
Although the grass itself may not be harmful, fertilizers,
insecticides
, and herbicides applied to the grass can be poisonous.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
Breathing difficulty
Headache
Itchy, watery eyes
Runny nose
Sneezing
Stuffy nose
Home Care
Contact your health care provider if you have trouble breathing. If breathing becomes extremely difficult, seek immediate medical help.
Before Calling Emergency
Get the following information:
Person's age, weight, and condition
Type of symptoms the person is having
If the grass was recently treated with a chemical of any sort such as fertilizer, insecticide, or herbicide, find out the product name and ingredients.
Poison Control
A call to the poison control center is most often not needed unless the person is having a severe allergic reaction to the grass or is having trouble breathing. If the grass has recently been fertilized, sprayed with an insecticide or herbicide, or treated with a chemical in any way, contact poison control.
Your local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does not need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
An emergency room visit is not necessary most of the time, unless the person has an asthma attack or severe allergic reaction. If an emergency room visit is needed, the person may receive:
Breathing support
Medicines to treat symptoms
Outlook (Prognosis)
Normally there are no major problems unless the person has
asthma
or a severe allergic reaction to the grass or chemical treatments. Recovery is likely. People with a severe grass allergy might need to be treated by an allergy specialist.
