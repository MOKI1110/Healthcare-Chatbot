Sweeteners - sugar substitutes

Sugar substitutes are substances that are used in place of sweeteners with
sugar (sucrose) or sugar alcohols
. They may also be called artificial sweeteners, non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS), and noncaloric sweeteners.
Function
Sugar substitutes may be helpful for people trying to lose weight. They provide sweetness to foods and drinks without adding a lot of extra calories. Most of these contain almost no calories.
Using sugar substitutes in place of sugar can help prevent dental decay. They also may help with blood sugar control in people with diabetes.
Food Sources
Sugar substitutes can be added to food when you eat. Most can also be used during cooking and baking. Most "sugar-free" or low-calorie food products you buy at the store are made using sugar substitutes.
Commonly used sugar substitutes include:
Aspartame (Equal and NutraSweet)
Nutritive sweetener -- has calories, but is very sweet, so little is needed.
A combination of two amino acids -- phenylalanine and aspartic acid.
200 times sweeter than sucrose.
Loses its sweetness when exposed to heat. It is best used in beverages rather than baking.
Hasn't shown any serious side effects.
FDA approved.
The FDA requires that foods containing aspartame must have information on the label for people with PKU (phenylketonuria, a rare genetic disorder) alerting them about the presence of phenylalanine.
Many studies have been done on aspartame, and none have found that it is linked to cancer. However, one expert group has classified it as "possibly carcinogenic (cancer causing) in humans." The FDA disagrees with this and states that aspartame is safe to use within recommended use levels. The FDA recommends consuming no more than 40 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight per day. This is equal to 10 or more 12-ounce cans of diet soft drink per day for a person weighing 150 pounds.
Sucralose (Splenda)
Non-nutritive sweetener -- no or very low calories
600 times sweeter than sucrose
Used in many foods and drinks, chewing gum, frozen dairy desserts, baked goods, and gelatin
Can be added to food at the table or used in baked goods
FDA approved
Saccharin (Sweet 'N Low, Sweet Twin, NectaSweet)
Non-nutritive sweetener
200 to 700 times sweeter than sucrose
Used in many diet foods and drinks
May have a bitter or metallic aftertaste in some liquids
Not used in cooking and baking
FDA approved
Stevia (Truvia, Pure Via, Sun Crystals)
Non-nutritive sweetener.
Made from the plant
Stevia rebaudiana
, which is grown for its sweet leaves.
Rebaudiana extract is approved as a food additive. It is considered a dietary supplement.
Generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA.
Acesulfame K (Sunett and Sweet One)
Non-nutritive sweetener
200 times sweeter than sugar
Heat-stable, can be used in cooking and baking
Can be added to food at the table
Used together with other sweeteners, such as saccharin, in carbonated low-calorie beverages and other products
Most similar to table sugar in taste and texture
FDA approved
Neotame (Newtame)
Non-nutritive sweetener
7,000 to 13,000 times sweeter than sugar
Used in many diet foods and drinks
Can be used for baking
Used as a tabletop sweetener
FDA approved
Monk Fruit (Luo Han Guo)
Non-nutritive sweetener
Plant-based extract of monk fruit, a round green melon that grows in southern China
100 to 250 times sweeter than sucrose
Heat stable and can be used in baking and cooking and is more concentrated than sugar (Â¼ teaspoon or 0.5 grams equals the sweetness of 1 teaspoon or 4 grams sugar)
Generally recognized as safe (GRAS) by the FDA
Advantame
Non-nutritive sweetener
20, 000 times sweeter than sugar
Used as general sweetener and is heat stable, so may be used in baking
Not commonly used
FDA approved
Side Effects
People often have questions about the safety and health effects of sugar substitutes. Many studies have been done on FDA-approved sugar substitutes, and they have been shown to be safe. Based on these studies, the FDA states they are safe for use for the general population.
Aspartame is not recommended for people with
PKU
. Their body is not able to break down one of the amino acids used to make aspartame.
In July 2023, the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer classified aspartame as "possibly carcinogenic (cancer causing) in humans". The FDA disagrees with this assessment. The WHO's Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) has not recommended any change in the acceptable amount of aspartame that can be safely consumed.
There is little evidence to support the use of or avoidance of sugar substitutes during pregnancy. FDA-approved sweeteners are fine to use in moderation. However, the American Medical Association suggests avoiding saccharin during pregnancy due to possible slow fetal clearance.
Recommendations
The FDA regulates all sugar substitutes that are sold or used in prepared foods in the United States. The FDA has set an acceptable daily intake (ADI). This is the amount a person can safely eat each day over a lifetime. Most people eat far less than the ADI.
In 2012, the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association published a report that concluded that sensible use of sugar substitutes could help lower caloric and carbohydrate intake. There is also not enough evidence at this time to determine if sugar substitute use leads to weight loss or lower heart disease risk. Some research suggests that they may lead to an increase in weight. Further research is still needed.
