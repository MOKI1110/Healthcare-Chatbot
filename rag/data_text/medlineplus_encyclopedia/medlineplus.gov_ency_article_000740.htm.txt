Delirium is sudden severe
confusion
due to rapid changes in brain function that can occur with physical or mental illness.
Causes
Delirium is most often caused by physical or mental illness and is usually temporary and reversible. Many disorders may cause delirium. Often, these disorders do not allow the brain to get oxygen or other substances. They may also cause dangerous chemicals (toxins) to build up in the brain. Delirium is common in the intensive care unit (ICU), especially in older adults.
Causes include:
Alcohol or medicine overdose or withdrawal
Drug use or overdose, including being sedated in the ICU
Electrolyte
or other body chemical disturbances
Infections such as
urinary tract infections
,
pneumonia
, or meningitis
Severe lack of sleep
Poisons
General anesthesia and surgery
Autoimmune disease
Symptoms
Delirium involves a quick change between mental states (for example, from
lethargy
to
agitation
and back to lethargy).
Symptoms include:
Changes in alertness
(usually more alert in the morning, less alert at night)
Changes in feeling (sensation) and perception
Changes in level of consciousness or awareness
Changes in movement (for example, may be slow moving or hyperactive)
Changes in sleep patterns,
drowsiness
Confusion (disorientation) about time or place
Decrease in short-term memory and recall
Disorganized thinking, such as talking in a way that doesn't make sense
Emotional or personality changes, such as anger, agitation, depression, irritability, and overly happy
Incontinence
Movements triggered by changes in the nervous system
Problem concentrating
Exams and Tests
The following tests may have abnormal results:
An examination of the nervous system (neurologic examination), including tests of feeling (sensation), mental status, thinking (cognitive function), and motor function
Neuropsychological studies
The following tests may also be done:
Blood and urine tests
Chest x-ray
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis
(spinal tap, or lumbar puncture)
Electroencephalogram
(EEG)
Head CT scan
Head MRI scan
Mental status test
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to control or reverse the cause of the symptoms. Treatment depends on the condition causing delirium. The person may need to stay in the hospital for a short time.
Stopping or changing medicines that may worsen confusion, or that are no longer needed, may improve mental function.
Disorders that contribute to confusion should be treated. These may include:
Anemia
Decreased oxygen (
hypoxia
)
Heart failure
High carbon dioxide levels (hypercapnia)
Infections
Kidney failure
Liver failure
Metabolic disorders
Nutritional disorders
Psychiatric conditions (such as
depression
or
psychosis
)
Thyroid disorders
Treating medical and mental disorders often greatly improves mental function.
Medicines may be needed to control aggressive or agitated behaviors. These are usually started at very low dosages and adjusted as needed.
Some people with delirium may benefit from hearing aids, glasses, or
cataract surgery
.
Other treatments that may be helpful:
Behavior modification to control unacceptable or dangerous behaviors
Reality orientation to reduce disorientation
Outlook (Prognosis)
Acute conditions that cause delirium may occur with long-term (
chronic
) disorders that cause
dementia
. Acute brain syndromes may be reversible by treating the cause.
Delirium often lasts about 1 week. It may take several weeks for mental function to return to normal. Full recovery is usually expected, but depends on the underlying cause of the delirium.
Possible Complications
Problems that may result from delirium include:
Loss of ability to function or care for self
Loss of ability to interact
Progression to
stupor
or
coma
Side effects of medicines used to treat the disorder
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if there is a rapid change in mental status.
Prevention
Treating the conditions that cause delirium can reduce its risk. In hospitalized people, avoiding or using a low dosage of sedatives, prompt treatment of metabolic disorders and infections, and using reality orientation programs will reduce the risk of delirium in those at high risk.
