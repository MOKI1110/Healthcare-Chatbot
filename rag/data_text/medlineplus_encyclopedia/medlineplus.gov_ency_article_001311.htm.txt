Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome is a rare, genetic disease. It causes problems with the skin, sinuses, lungs, bones, and teeth.
Causes
Hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome is also called Job syndrome. It is named after the biblical character Job, whose faithfulness was tested by an affliction with draining skin sores and
pustules
. People with this condition have long-term, severe skin infections.
The symptoms are most often present in childhood, but because the disease is so rare, it often takes years before a correct diagnosis is made.
Recent research suggests that the disease is often caused by a genetic change that takes place in the
STAT3
gene
on
chromosome
17. How this gene abnormality causes the symptoms of the disease is not well understood. However, people with the disease have a higher-than-normal level of a type of
antibody
called IgE.
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Bone and tooth defects, including fractures and losing the baby teeth late
Eczema
Skin
abscesses
and infection
Repeated
sinus infections
Repeated lung infections
Exams and Tests
A physical exam may show:
Curving of the spine (
kyphoscoliosis
)
Osteomyelitis
Repeat sinus infections
Tests used to confirm the diagnosis include:
Absolute eosinophil count
CBC
with
blood differential
Serum globulin electrophoresis
to look for high blood IgE level
Genetic testing of
STAT3
gene
An eye exam may reveal signs of
dry eye syndrome
.
A chest x-ray may reveal lung abscesses.
Other tests that may be done:
CT scan
of the chest
Cultures of the infected site
Special blood tests to check parts of the
immune system
X-ray of the bones
CT scan of the sinuses
A scoring system that combines the different problems of Hyper IgE syndrome may be used to help make the diagnosis.
Treatment
There is no known cure for this condition. The goal of treatment is to control the infections. Medicines include:
Antibiotics
Antifungal and antiviral medicines (when appropriate)
Surgery is sometimes needed to drain abscesses.
Gamma globulin given through a vein (IV) may help build up the immune system if you have severe infections.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Hyper IgE syndrome is a lifelong chronic condition. Each new infection requires treatment.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Repeated infections
Sepsis
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you have symptoms of Hyper IgE syndrome.
Prevention
There is no proven way to prevent Hyper IgE syndrome. Good general hygiene is helpful in preventing skin infections.
Some providers may recommend preventive antibiotics for people who develop many infections, especially with
Staphylococcus aureus
. This treatment does not change the condition, but it can lessen its complications.
Alternative Names
Job syndrome; Hyper IgE syndrome
