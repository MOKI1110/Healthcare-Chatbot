Poison Control
Your local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. The person may receive:
Intravenous (IV) fluids through the vein
Medicines to treat symptoms
Tube through the mouth into the stomach to wash out the stomach (
gastric lavage
)
Endoscopy - camera placed down the throat to see burns in the esophagus and the stomach
Medicine (antidote) to reverse the effect of the poison
Washing of the skin (irrigation), perhaps every few hours for several days
Skin debridement (surgical removal of burned skin)
Breathing tube
Oxygen
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well a person does depends on the severity of the poisoning and how quickly medical help was received.
Severe lung damage may occur. Survival past 72 hours usually means the person will have a complete recovery.
Sniffing Freon is extremely dangerous and can lead to long-term brain damage and sudden death.
Alternative Names
Coolant poisoning; Freon poisoning; Fluorinated hydrocarbon poisoning; Sudden sniffing death syndrome
