Porphyria

Porphyrias are a group of rare disorders in which an important part of
hemoglobin
, called heme, is not made properly. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. Heme is also found in myoglobin, a protein found in certain muscles.
Causes
Normally, the body makes heme in a multi-step process. Porphyrins are made during several steps of this process. People with porphyria are lacking certain
enzymes
needed for this process. This causes abnormal amounts of porphyrins or related chemicals to build up in the body.
There are several forms of porphyria. The most common type is porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT).
Medicines, infection, alcohol, and hormones such as estrogen may trigger attacks of certain types of porphyria.
Porphyria can be passed down through families (inherited) or acquired.
Symptoms
Porphyria causes three major symptoms:
Abdominal pain or cramping (only in some forms of the disease)
Sensitivity to light that can cause rashes, blistering, and scarring of the skin (photodermatitis)
Problems with the nervous system and muscles (
seizures
, mental disturbances, nerve damage)
Attacks can occur suddenly. They often start with severe abdominal pain followed by vomiting and constipation. Being out in the sun can cause pain, sensations of heat, blistering, and skin redness and swelling. Blisters heal slowly, often with scarring or skin color changes. The scarring may be disfiguring. Urine may turn red or brown after an attack.
Other symptoms include:
Muscle pain
Muscle weakness or paralysis
Numbness or tingling
Pain in the arms or legs
Pain in the back
Personality changes or
psychosis
Attacks can sometimes be life threatening, producing:
Low blood pressure
Severe
electrolyte
imbalances
Shock
Exams and Tests
These disorders can be difficult to diagnose and are often initially misdiagnosed.
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam, which includes listening to your heart. You may have a fast heart rate (tachycardia). The provider may find that your deep tendon reflexes (knee jerks or others) do not work properly.
Blood and urine tests may reveal kidney problems or other problems. Some of the other tests that may be done include:
Blood gases
Comprehensive metabolic panel
Porphyrin levels and levels of other chemicals linked to this condition (checked in the
blood
,
urine
, or stool)
Ultrasound of the abdomen
Urinalysis
Genetic analysis to identify alterations in certain genes
Treatment
Some of the medicines used to treat a sudden (acute) attack of porphyria may include:
Hematin given through a vein (
intravenously
)
Pain medicine
Propranolol to regulate the heartbeat
Sedatives to help you feel calm and less anxious
Other treatments may include:
Beta-carotene supplements to lessen photosensitivity
Chloroquine in low doses to reduce levels of porphyrins
Fluids and glucose to boost
carbohydrate
levels, which helps limit the production of porphyrins
Removal of blood (phlebotomy) to reduce levels of porphyrins
Depending on the type of porphyria you have, your provider may tell you to:
Avoid all alcohol
Avoid certain medicines that may trigger an attack
Avoid injuring the skin
Avoid sunlight as much as possible and use sunscreen when outside
Eat a high-carbohydrate diet

Outlook (Prognosis)
Porphyria is a life-long disease with symptoms that come and go. Some forms of the disease cause more symptoms than others. Getting proper treatment and staying away from triggers can help lengthen the time between attacks.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Coma
Gallstones
Paralysis
Respiratory failure (due to weakness of chest muscles)
Scarring of the skin
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Get medical help as soon as you have signs of an acute attack. Talk to your provider about your risk for this condition if you have a long history of undiagnosed abdominal pain, muscle and nerve problems, and sensitivity to sunlight.
Prevention
Genetic counseling
may benefit people who want to have children and who have a family history of any type of porphyria.
