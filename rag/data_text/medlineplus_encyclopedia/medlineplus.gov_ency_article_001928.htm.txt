Well-child visits
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Childhood is a time of rapid growth and change. Children have more well-child visits when they are younger. This is because development is faster during these years.
Each visit includes a physical exam. At this exam, your child's health care provider will check your child's growth and development in order to find or prevent problems.
Your provider will record your child's height, weight, and other important information. Hearing, vision, and other screening tests will be part of some visits. So will immunizations.
Even if your child is healthy, well-child visits are a good time to focus on your child's wellness. Talking about ways to improve care and prevent problems helps keep your child healthy.
Information
At your well-child visits, you will get information on topics such as:
Sleep
Safety
Childhood diseases
What to expect as your child grows
Write down your questions and concerns and bring them with you. This will help you get the most out of the visit.
Your provider will pay special attention to how your child is growing compared to normal developmental milestones. Your child's height, weight, and head circumference are recorded on a
growth chart
. This chart remains part of your child's medical record. Talking about your child's growth is a good place to begin a discussion about your child's general health. Ask your provider about the body mass index (BMI) curve, which is the most important tool for identifying and preventing obesity.
Your provider will also talk about other wellness topics such as family relationship issues, school, and access to community services.
There are several schedules for routine well-child visits. One schedule, recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics, is given below.
PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE SCHEDULE
A visit with your provider
before
the baby is born can be particularly important for:
First-time parents.
Parents with a high-risk pregnancy.
Any parent who has questions about issues such as feeding,
circumcision
, and general child health issues.
After the baby is born, the next visit should be 2 to 3 days after bringing the baby home (for breastfed babies) or when the baby is 3 to 5 days old (for all babies who are released from a hospital before they are 2 days old). Some providers will delay the visit until the baby is 1 to 2 weeks old for parents who have had babies before.
After that, it is recommended that visits occur at the following ages (your provider may have you add or skip visits depending on your child's health or your parenting experience):
By 1 month
2 months
4 months
6 months
9 months
12 months
15 months
18 months
2 years
2 1/2 years
3 years
Each year after that until age 21
Also, you should call or visit your provider any time your baby or child seems ill or whenever you are worried about your baby's health or development.
