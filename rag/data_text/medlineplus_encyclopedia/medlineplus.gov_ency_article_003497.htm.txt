ALP isoenzyme test

Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme found in many body tissues such as liver, bile ducts, bone, and intestine. There are several different structural forms of ALP called isoenzymes. The structure of the enzyme depends on where in the body it is produced. This test is most often used to test ALP made in the tissues of the liver and bones.
The ALP isoenzyme test is a lab test that measures the amounts of different types of ALP in the blood.
The
ALP test
is a related test.
How the Test is Performed
A blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is
drawn from a vein
located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.
How to Prepare for the Test
Many medicines can interfere with blood test results.
Your health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test.
DO NOT stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.
How the Test will Feel
You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.
Why the Test is Performed
When the ALP test result is high, you may need to have the ALP isoenzyme test. This test will help determine what part of the body is causing higher ALP levels.
This test may be used to diagnose or monitor:
Bone disease
Liver
, gallbladder, or bile duct disease
Pain in the abdomen
Parathyroid gland disease
Vitamin D deficiency
It may also be done to check liver function and to see how medicines you take may affect your liver.
Normal Results
The normal value for total ALP is 44 to 147 international units per liter (IU/L) or 0.73 to 2.45 microkatal per liter (Âµkat/L). ALP isoenzyme testing may have differing normal values.
Adults have lower levels of
ALP
than children. Bones that are still growing produce higher levels of ALP. During some growth spurts, levels can be as high as 500 IU/L or 835 ÂµKat/L. For this reason, the test is usually not done in children, and abnormal results refer to adults.
The isoenzyme test results can reveal whether the increase is in "bone" ALP or "liver" ALP.
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
The example above shows the common measurement range for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Higher-than-normal ALP levels:
Biliary obstruction
Bone disease
Eating a fatty meal if you have blood type O or B
Healing fracture
Hepatitis
Hyperparathyroidism
Hyperthyroidism
Leukemia
Liver disease
Lymphoma
Osteoblastic bone tumors
Osteomalacia
Paget disease
of bone
Sarcoidosis
Lower-than-normal levels of ALP:
Hypophosphatasia
Hypothyroidism
Malnutrition
Pernicious anemia
Protein
deficiency
Wilson disease
Zinc deficiency
Levels that are only slightly higher than normal may not be a problem unless there are other signs of a disease or medical problem.
Other conditions for which the test may be done:
Alcoholic liver disease (hepatitis/cirrhosis)
Alcohol use disorder
Biliary stricture
Gallstones
Giant cell (temporal, cranial) arteritis
Multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) II
Pancreatitis
Renal cell carcinoma
