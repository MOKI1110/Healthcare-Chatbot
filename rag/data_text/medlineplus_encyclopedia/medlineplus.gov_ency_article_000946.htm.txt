Cocaine intoxication

Cocaine is an illegal stimulant drug that affects your central nervous system. Cocaine comes from the coca plant. When used, cocaine causes the brain to release higher than normal amounts of some chemicals. These produce a sense of euphoria, or a "high."
Cocaine intoxication is a condition in which you're not only high from
using the drug
, but you also have body-wide symptoms that can make you ill and impaired.
Causes
Cocaine intoxication may be caused by:
Taking too much cocaine, or taking a too-concentrated form of cocaine
Using cocaine when the weather is hot, which leads to more harm and side effects due to dehydration
Using cocaine with certain other drugs
Symptoms
Symptoms of cocaine intoxication include:
Feeing high, excited, talking and rambling, sometimes about bad things happening
Anxiety, agitation, restlessness, confusion
Muscle tremors, such as in the face and fingers
Enlarged pupils that don't get smaller when a light shines into the eyes
Increased heart rate and blood pressure
Lightheadedness
Paleness
Nausea and vomiting
Fever, sweating
With higher doses or an overdose, more severe symptoms can occur, including:
Seizures
Loss of awareness of surroundings
Loss of urine control
High body temperature, severe sweating
High blood pressure, very fast heart rate or irregular heart rhythm
Bluish color of the skin
Fast or difficulty breathing
Death
Cocaine is often cut (mixed) with other substances. When taken, additional symptoms can occur.
Exams and Tests
If cocaine intoxication is suspected, your health care provider may order the following tests:
Cardiac enzymes (to look for evidence of heart damage or heart attack)
Chest x-ray
CT scan of the head
, if head injury or bleeding is suspected
Electrocardiogram
(ECG, to measure electrical activity in the heart)
Toxicology screening (poison and drug)Â
Urinalysis
Treatment
Your provider will measure and monitor your vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.
Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. You may receive:
Breathing support, including oxygen, a tube down the throat, and ventilator (breathing machine)
IV fluids (fluids through a vein)
Medicines to treat symptoms such as pain, anxiety, agitation, nausea, seizures, and high blood pressure
Other medicines or treatments for heart, brain, muscle, and kidney complications
Long-term treatment requires drug counseling in combination with medical therapy.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outlook depends on the amount of cocaine used and what organs are affected. Permanent damage may occur, which may cause:
Seizures,
stroke
, and paralysis
Chronic anxiety and psychosis (severe mental disorders)
Decreased mental functioning
Heart irregularities and decreased heart function
Kidney failure requiring dialysis (kidney machine)
Destruction of muscles, which can lead to amputation
