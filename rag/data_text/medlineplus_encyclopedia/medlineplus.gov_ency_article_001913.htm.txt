Laser therapy is a medical treatment that uses a strong beam of light to cut, burn, or destroy tissue. The term LASER stands for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.
Information
The laser light beam does not pose health risks to the person or medical team. Laser treatment has some of the same risks as open surgery, including pain, bleeding, and scarring. But recovery time from laser surgery is usually faster than recovery from open surgery.
Lasers can be used for many medical purposes. Because the laser beam is so small and precise, it allows health care providers to safely treat tissue without injuring the surrounding area.
Lasers are often used to:
Treat varicose veins
Improve vision during
eye surgery on the cornea
Repair a detached retina of the eye
Remove parts of the prostate
Remove kidney stones
Remove
tumors
Lasers are also often used during
skin surgery
