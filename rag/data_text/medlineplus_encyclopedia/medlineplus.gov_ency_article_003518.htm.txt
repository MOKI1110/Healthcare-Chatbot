B-cell leukemia/lymphoma panel

B-cell leukemia/lymphoma panel is a blood test that looks for certain proteins on the surface of white blood cells called B-lymphocytes. The proteins are markers that may help diagnose
leukemia
or lymphoma.
How the Test is Performed
A
blood sample
is needed.
In some cases, white blood cells are removed during a
bone marrow biopsy
. The sample may also be taken during a
lymph node biopsy
or other biopsy when lymphoma is suspected.
The blood sample is sent to a laboratory, where a laboratory specialist checks the cell type and characteristics. This procedure is called immunophenotyping. The test is often done using a technique called flow cytometry.
How to Prepare for the Test
No special preparation is usually necessary.
How the Test will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.
Why the Test is Performed
This test may be done for the following reasons:
When other tests (such as a
blood smear
) show signs of abnormal white blood cells
When leukemia or lymphoma is suspected
To find out the type of leukemia or lymphoma
What Abnormal Results Mean
Abnormal results usually indicate either:
B-cell
lymphocytic leukemia
Lymphoma
Risks
There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:
Excessive bleeding
Fainting or feeling lightheaded
Multiple punctures to locate veins
Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
Alternative Names
B lymphocyte cell surface markers; Flow cytometry - leukemia/lymphoma immunophenotyping
