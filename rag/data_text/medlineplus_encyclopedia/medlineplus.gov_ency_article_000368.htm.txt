Hereditary amyloidosis is a condition in which abnormal protein deposits (called amyloid) form in almost every tissue in the body. Harmful deposits most often form in the heart, kidneys, and nervous system. These
protein
deposits damage the tissues and interfere with how organs work.
Causes
Hereditary amyloidosis is passed down from parents to their children (inherited). Genes may also play a role in
primary amyloidosis
.
Other types of amyloidosis are not inherited. They include:
Senile systemic: seen in people older than 70
Spontaneous: occurs without a known cause
Secondary: results from diseases such as cancer of certain blood cells (myeloma)
Specific conditions include:
Cardiac amyloidosis
Cerebral amyloidosis
Secondary systemic amyloidosis
Treatment
Treatment to improve the function of damaged organs will help relieve some symptoms of hereditary amyloidosis. A liver transplant may be helpful to reduce the creation of harmful amyloid proteins. Talk to your health care provider about treatments.
