Pyruvate kinase deficiency

Pyruvate kinase deficiency is an inherited lack of the
enzyme
pyruvate kinase, which is used by red blood cells. Without this enzyme, red blood cells break down too easily, resulting in a low level of these cells (
hemolytic anemia
).
Causes
Pyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) is passed down as an
autosomal recessive
trait. This means that a child must receive a non-working gene from each parent to develop the disorder.
There are many different types of enzyme-related defects of the red blood cell that can cause hemolytic anemia. PKD is the second most common cause, after
glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase
(G6PD) deficiency.
PKD is found in people of all ethnic backgrounds. But, certain populations, such as the Amish, are more likely to develop the condition.
Symptoms
Symptoms of PKD include:
Low count of healthy red blood cells (
anemia
)
Swelling of the spleen (
splenomegaly
)
Yellow color of the skin, mucous membranes, or white part of the eyes (
jaundice
)
Neurologic condition, called
kernicterus
, that affects the brain
Fatigue, lethargy
Pale skin (
pallor
)
In infants, not gaining weight and growing as expected (
failure to thrive
)
Gallstones, usually in the teens and older
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about and check for symptoms such as an
enlarged spleen
. If PKD is suspected, tests that will likely be ordered include:
Bilirubin
in the blood
CBC blood test
Genetic testing for changes in the pyruvate kinase gene
Haptoglobin blood test
Osmotic fragility
Pyruvate kinase
activity
Stool urobilinogen
Treatment
People with severe anemia may need blood transfusions. Removing the spleen (
splenectomy
) may help reduce the destruction of red blood cells. But, this does not help in all cases. In newborns with a dangerous level of jaundice, the provider may recommend an
exchange transfusion
. This procedure involves slowly removing the infant's blood and replacing it with fresh donor blood or plasma.
Someone who had a splenectomy should receive the
pneumococcal vaccine
at recommended intervals. They also should receive preventive antibiotics until age 5.

Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome varies. Some people have few or no symptoms. Others have severe symptoms. Treatment can usually make symptoms less severe.
Possible Complications
Gallstones are a common problem. They are made of too much bilirubin, which is produced during hemolytic anemia. Severe pneumococcal disease is a possible complication after splenectomy.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
See your provider if:
You have jaundice or anemia.
You have a family history of this disorder and are planning to have children.
Genetic counseling
can help you know how likely it will be that your child would have PKD. You can also learn about tests that check for genetic disorders, such as PKD, so that you can decide if you'd like to have these tests.
