Health screenings for women age 65 and older
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
You should visit your health care provider from time to time, even if you are healthy. The purpose of these visits is to:
Screen for medical issues
Assess your risk for future medical problems
Encourage a healthy lifestyle
Update vaccinations and other preventive care services
Help you get to know your provider in case of an illness
Information
Even if you feel fine, you should still see your provider for regular checkups. These visits can help you avoid problems in the future. For example, the only way to find out if you have
high blood pressure
is to have it checked regularly. High blood sugar and
high cholesterol
levels also may not have any symptoms in the early stages. A simple blood test can check for these conditions.
There are specific times when you should see your provider or receive specific health screenings. The US Preventive Services Task Force publishes a list of recommended screenings. Below are screening guidelines for women age 65 and older.
BLOOD PRESSURE SCREENING
Have your
blood pressure
checked at least once every year. Watch for blood pressure screenings in your area. Ask your provider if you can stop in to have your blood pressure checked. You can also check your blood pressure using the automated machines at local grocery stores and pharmacies.
Ask your provider if you need your blood pressure checked more often if:
You have diabetes,
heart disease
,
kidney problems
, or are overweight or have certain other health conditions.
You have a first-degree relative with high blood pressure.
You are Black.
Your blood pressure top number is from 120 to 129 mm Hg, or the bottom number is from 70 to 79 mm Hg.
If the top number is 130 mm Hg or greater, but lower than 140 mm Hg or the bottom number is 80 mm Hg or greater but lower than 90 mm Hg, this is considered to be stage 1 hypertension. Readings above these are considered to be stage 2 hypertension. Schedule an appointment with your provider to learn how you can reduce your blood pressure. Record your blood pressure numbers and bring this information to share with your provider.
BREAST CANCER SCREENING
Experts do not agree about the benefits of breast self-exams in finding
breast cancer
or saving lives. Talk to your provider about what is best for you.
Mammography is performed to screen women to detect early breast cancer when it is more likely to be cured. The recommendations of different expert organizations can differ.
Women up to age 75 should have a
mammogram
every 1 to 2 years, depending on their risk factors, to check for breast cancer.
Women with a family history of breast cancer should work with their health care provider to assess their risk of breast cancer. In some situations, additional testing may be considered.
Mammograms work best at finding breast cancer in women ages 40 to 74. It is not clear how well mammograms work at finding cancer in women age 75 and older. Talk to your provider about what is best for you.
CERVICAL CANCER SCREENING
After age 65, most women who have not been diagnosed with cervical cancer or precancer can stop having screening tests, as long as:
They have had 3 consecutive negative Pap test results or 2 consecutive negative HPV tests results within 10 years.
The most recent test occurred within 5 years.
CHOLESTEROL SCREENING
If your cholesterol level is normal, have it rechecked at least every 5 years.
You should have repeat testing sooner if:
Changes occur in your lifestyle (including weight gain and diet)
You have high cholesterol, diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, or blood flow problems in the legs or feet, or certain other health conditions
COLORECTAL CANCER SCREENING
Until age 75, you should have
screening for colorectal cancer
on a regular basis. Several tests are available for colorectal cancer screening:
A stool-based fecal occult blood (FOBT) or fecal immunochemical test (
FIT
) every year
A stool sDNA-FIT test every 1 to 3 years (colonoscopy is needed if results are positive)
Flexible sigmoidoscopy
every 5 years or every 10 years with stool testing with FOBT or FIT done every year
CT colonography (
virtual colonoscopy
) every 5 years
Colonoscopy
every 10 years
You may need a colonoscopy more often if you have risk factors for colon cancer, including:
Ulcerative colitis
A personal or family history of
colorectal cancer
A history of growths in your colon called
adenomatous polyps
A family history of inherited colorectal cancer syndromes such as familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC).
People ages 76 through 85 should talk with their health care provider about whether to continue to get screened. People ages 86 and older no longer need colorectal cancer screening.
DENTAL EXAM
Go to the dentist once or twice every year for an exam and cleaning. Your dentist will evaluate if you have a need for more frequent visits.
PREDIABETES AND TYPE 2 DIABETES SCREENING
You should be screened for
prediabetes
and
type 2 diabetes
every 3 years up to age 70 if you are overweight or have obesity.
EYE EXAM
Have an eye exam every year. Your provider may recommend more frequent eye exams if you have vision problems or glaucoma risk.
Have an eye exam that includes an examination of your retina (back of your eye) at least every year if you have diabetes.
HEARING TEST
Have your hearing tested if you have symptoms of
hearing loss
.
IMMUNIZATIONS
Commonly needed vaccines include:
Flu
shot:
get one every year
COVID-19 vaccine:
ask your doctor what is best for you
Pneumococcal vaccines
:
you should receive this vaccine
Shingles (herpes zoster) vaccine:
Â 2 doses at or after age 50
Tetanus-diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine:
have as one of your tetanus-diphtheria vaccines if you did not receive it as an adolescent
Tetanus-diphtheria:
have a booster (Td or Tdap) every 10 years
INFECTIOUS DISEASE SCREENING
Screening for hepatitis C:
All adults ages 18 to 79 should get a one-time test for
hepatitis C
.
Screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV):
All people ages 15 to 65 should get a one-time test for HIV
Depending on your lifestyle and medical history, you may need to be screened for infections such as syphilis, chlamydia, and other infections.
LUNG CANCER SCREENING
You should have an annual screening for
lung cancer
with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) if:
You are age 50 to 80 years AND
You have a 20 pack-year smoking history AND
You currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years
OSTEOPOROSIS SCREENING
All women age 65 or older should have a
bone density test
(DEXA scan).
Ask your provider which exercises or other interventions can help prevent
osteoporosis
or bone fractures.
PHYSICAL EXAMS
All adults should visit their provider from time to time, even if they are healthy. The purpose of these visits is to:
Screen for diseases
Assess risk of future medical problems
Encourage a healthy lifestyle
Update vaccinations and other preventive care services
Maintain a relationship with a provider in case of an illness
In addition:
Your blood pressure should be checked at least every year.
Your height, weight, and body mass index (BMI) should be checked at every exam.
During the exam, your provider will ask questions about:
Depression
and anxiety
Diet and exercise, including exercises to improve your balance and reduce your risk of falling
Alcohol and tobacco use
Safety, such as use of seat belts and smoke detectors and intimate partner violence
Whether you have had any falls or are afraid of falling
Whether you have symptoms of urinary incontinence
Your medicines and risk for interactions
SKIN EXAM
Your provider may check your skin for signs of
skin cancer
, especially if you're at high risk. You may be at risk if you:
Have had skin cancer before
Have close relatives with skin cancer
Have a weakened immune system
Professional organizations do not recommend for or against performing a skin self-exam.
