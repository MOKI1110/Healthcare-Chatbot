High potassium level

High potassium level is a problem in which the amount of potassium in the blood is higher than normal. The medical name of this condition is hyperkalemia.
Causes
Potassium is needed for cells to function properly. You get potassium through food. Your kidneys remove excess potassium through the urine to keep a proper balance of this mineral in your body.
If your kidneys are not working well, they may not be able to remove the proper amount of potassium. As a result, potassium can build up in the blood. This buildup can also be due to:
Addison disease --
Disease in which the
adrenal glands
do not make enough hormones, reducing the kidneys' ability to remove potassium from the body
Burns over large areas of the body
Certain blood pressure lowering drugs, most often
angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors
and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)
Damage to muscle and other cells from certain illicit street drugs, alcohol abuse, untreated seizures, surgery, crush injuries and falls, certain chemotherapies, or certain infections
Disorders that cause red blood cells to burst
(hemolytic anemia)
Severe bleeding from the stomach or intestines
Taking extra potassium, such as salt substitutes or supplements
Tumors
Symptoms
There are often no symptoms with a high level of potassium. When symptoms do occur, they may include:
Chest pain
Difficulty breathing
Nausea or vomiting
Palpitations
(irregular or abnormal-feeling heartbeats)
Slow, weak, or irregular pulse
Sudden collapse, when the heartbeat gets too slow or even stops
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.
Tests that may be ordered include:
Electrocardiogram (ECG)
Blood potassium level
Your provider will likely check your blood potassium level and do
kidney blood tests
on a regular basis if you:
Have been prescribed extra potassium
Have long-term (chronic) kidney disease
Take medicines to treat heart disease or high blood pressure
Use salt substitutes
Treatment
You will need emergency treatment if your potassium level is very high, or if you have danger signs, such as changes in your
ECG
.
Emergency treatment may include:
Calcium given into your veins (IV) to treat the muscle and heart effects of high potassium levels
Glucose and insulin given into your veins (IV) to help lower potassium levels long enough to correct the cause
Kidney dialysis if your kidney function is poor
Medicines that help remove potassium from the intestines before it is absorbed
Sodium bicarbonate if the problem is caused by acidosis
Some diuretics (most often given by vein) that increase the excretion of potassium by your kidneys into your urine
Changes in your diet can help both prevent and treat high potassium levels. You may be asked to:
Limit or avoid asparagus, avocados, potatoes, tomatoes or tomato sauce, winter squash, pumpkin, and cooked spinach
Limit or avoid oranges and orange juice, nectarines, kiwifruit, raisins, or other dried fruit, bananas, cantaloupe, honeydew, prunes, and nectarines
Limit or avoid taking salt substitutes if you are asked to follow a
low-salt diet
Your provider may make the following changes to your medicines:
Reduce or stop potassium supplements
Stop or change the doses of medicines you are taking, such as ones for heart disease and high blood pressure
Take a certain type of water pill to reduce potassium and fluid levels if you have chronic kidney failure
Follow your provider's directions when taking your medicines:
DO NOT stop or start taking medicines without first talking to your provider
Take your medicines on time
Tell your provider about any other medicines, vitamins, or supplements you are taking
Outlook (Prognosis)
If the cause is known, such as too much potassium in the diet, the outlook is good once the problem is corrected. In severe cases or those with ongoing risk factors, high potassium will likely recur.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Heart suddenly stops beating (cardiac arrest)
Kidney failure
Weakness
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider right away if you have vomiting, palpitations, weakness, or difficulty breathing, or if you're taking a potassium supplement and have symptoms of high potassium.
