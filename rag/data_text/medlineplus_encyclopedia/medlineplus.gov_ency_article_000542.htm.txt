Acute myeloid leukemia - adult

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is cancer that starts inside bone marrow. This is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells. The cancer grows from cells that would normally turn into white blood cells.
Acute means the disease grows quickly and usually has an aggressive course.
Causes
AML is one of the most common types of
leukemia
among adults.
AML is more common in men than women.
The bone marrow helps the body fight infections and makes other blood components. People with AML have many abnormal immature white blood cells inside their bone marrow. The cells grow very quickly, and replace healthy blood cells. As a result, people with AML are more likely to have infections. They also have an increased risk of bleeding as the numbers of healthy blood cells decrease.
Most of the time, a health care provider cannot tell you what caused AML. However, the following things can lead to some types of leukemia, including AML:
Blood disorders, including
polycythemia vera
,
essential thrombocythemia
, and myelodysplasia
Certain chemicals (for example, benzene)
Certain
chemotherapy
drugs, including etoposide and drugs known as alkylating agents
Exposure to certain chemicals and harmful substances
Radiation
Weak immune system due to an organ transplant
Problems with your genes may also cause AML to develop.
Symptoms
Symptoms of AML are mainly due to the effects on blood elements. Symptoms of AML may include any of the following:
Bleeding from the nose
Bleeding
and
swelling
(rare) in the gums
Bruising
Bone pain or tenderness
Fever and fatigue
Heavy menstrual periods
Pale skin
Shortness of breath
(gets worse with exercise)
Weight loss
Exams and Tests
The provider will perform a physical exam. There may be signs of a swollen spleen, liver, or lymph nodes. Tests done include:
A complete blood count (
CBC
) may show anemia and a low number of platelets. A white blood cell count (
WBC
) can be high, low, or normal.
Bone marrow aspiration
and
biopsy
will show if there are any leukemia cells.
If your provider learns you do have this type of leukemia, further tests will be done to determine the specific type of AML. Subtypes are based on specific changes in genes (mutations) and how the leukemia cells appear under the microscope.
Treatment
Treatment involves using medicines (
chemotherapy
) to kill the cancer cells. Most types of AML are treated with more than one chemotherapy medicine. Drugs that are targeted to specific mutations in the leukemic cells are also often used.
Chemotherapy kills normal cells, too. This may cause side effects such as:
Increased
risk of bleeding
Increased risk for infection (your doctor may want you to keep away from other people to prevent infection)
Weight loss (
you will need to eat extra calories
)
Mouth sores
Other supportive treatments for AML may include:
Antibiotics to treat infection
Red blood cell transfusions to fight
anemia
Platelet
transfusions to control bleeding
A
bone marrow (stem cell) transplant
may be tried. This decision is decided by several factors, including:
Your age and overall health
Certain genetic changes in the leukemia cells
The availability of donors
Support Groups
You can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer
support group
. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.
Outlook (Prognosis)
When a bone marrow biopsy shows no evidence of AML, you are said to be in remission. How well you do depends on your overall health and the genetic subtype of the AML cells.
Remission is not the same as a cure. More therapy is usually needed, either in the form of more chemotherapy or a bone marrow transplant.
With treatment, younger people with AML tend to do better than those who develop the disease at an older age. The 5-year survival rate is much lower in older adults than in younger people. Experts say this is partly due to the fact that younger people are better able to tolerate strong chemotherapy medicines. Also, leukemia in older people tends to be more resistant to current treatments.
If the cancer does not come back (relapse) within 5 years of the diagnosis, you are likely cured.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider to schedule an appointment if you:
Develop symptoms of AML
Have AML and have a fever that will not go away or other signs of infection
Prevention
If you work around radiation or chemicals linked to leukemia, always wear protective gear.
