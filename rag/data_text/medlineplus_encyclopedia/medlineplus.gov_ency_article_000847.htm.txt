Neurofibromatosis-1 (NF1) is an inherited disorder in which nerve tissue
tumors
(neurofibromas) form in the:
Upper and lower layers of the skin
Nerves from the brain (cranial nerves) and spinal cord (spinal root nerves)
Causes
NF1 is a genetic disease. If either parent has NF1, each of their children has a 50% chance of having the disease.
NF1 also appears in families with no history of the condition. In these cases, it is caused by a new gene change (variant or mutation) in the sperm or egg. NF1 is caused by problems with a gene for a protein called neurofibromin.
Symptoms
NF1 causes tissue along the nerves to grow uncontrollably. This growth can put pressure on affected nerves.
If the growths are in the skin, there can be cosmetic issues. If the growths are in other nerves or parts of the body, they can cause pain, severe nerve damage, and loss of function in the area the nerve affects. Problems with feeling or movement can occur, depending on which nerves are affected.
The condition can be very different from person to person, even among people in the same family who have the same NF1 gene change.
"Coffee-with-milk" (
cafÃ© au lait
) spots are the hallmark symptom of NF1. Many healthy people have one or two small cafÃ© au lait spots. However, adults who have six or more spots that are bigger than 1.5 cm in diameter (0.5 cm in children) could have NF1. In some people with the condition, these spots may be the only symptom.
Other symptoms may include:
Tumors of the eye, such as
optic glioma
Seizures
Freckles in the underarm or groin
Large, soft tumors called plexiform neurofibromas, which may have a dark color and may spread under the surface of the skin
Pain (from affected nerves)
Small, rubbery tumors of the skin called nodular neurofibromas
Exams and Tests
A health care provider who treats NF1 will diagnose this condition. The provider may be a:
Dermatologist
Developmental pediatrician
Geneticist
Neurologist
The diagnosis will most likely be made based on the unique symptoms and signs of NF1.
Signs include:
Colored, raised spots (Lisch nodules) on the colored part (iris) of the eye
Bowing of the lower leg in early childhood that may lead to fractures
Freckling in the armpits, groin, or underneath the breast in women
Large tumors under the skin (plexiform neurofibromas), which can affect the appearance and put pressure on nearby nerves or organs
Many soft tumors on the skin or deeper in the body
Mild cognitive impairment,
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
(ADHD), learning disorders
Tests may include:
Eye exam by an ophthalmologist familiar with NF1
Genetic tests to find a change (mutation) in the neurofibromin gene
MRI
of the brain or other affected sites
Other tests for complications
Treatment
There is no specific treatment for NF1. Tumors that cause pain or loss of function may be removed. Tumors that have grown quickly should be removed promptly as they may become cancerous (malignant). The drug selumetinib (Koselugo) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2020 for use in children with severe tumors.
Some children with learning disorders may need special schooling.

Outlook (Prognosis)
If there are no complications, the life expectancy of people with NF1 is almost normal. With the right education, people with NF1 can live a normal life.
Although mental impairment is generally mild, NF1 is a known cause of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Learning disabilities are a common problem.
Some people are treated differently because they have hundreds of tumors on their skin.
People with NF1 have an increased chance of developing severe tumors. In rare cases, these can shorten a person's lifespan.
Possible Complications
Complications can include:
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
Blindness caused by a tumor in an optic nerve (optic nerve glioma)
Break in the leg bones that does not heal well
Cancerous tumors
Loss of function in nerves that a neurofibroma has put pressure on over the long term
High blood pressure due to pheochromocytoma or renal artery stenosis
Regrowth of neurofibroma tumors
Scoliosis
, or curvature of the spine
Tumors of the face, skin, and other exposed areas
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
You notice multiple coffee-with-milk colored spots on your child's skin or any other symptoms of this condition.
You have a family history of NF1 and are planning to have children, or you would like to have your child examined.
Prevention
Genetic counseling is recommended for anyone with a family history of NF1.
An annual checkup should be performed of the:
Eyes
Skin
Back
Nervous system
Blood pressure
