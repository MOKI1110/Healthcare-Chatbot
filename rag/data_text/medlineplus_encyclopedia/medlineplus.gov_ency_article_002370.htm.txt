Glucuronyl transferase is a liver
enzyme
. It changes bilirubinÂ in the blood into a form that can be removed from the body through the
bile
. It also changes some hormones, medicines, and toxins into non-harmful products.
The skin can take on a yellow color (jaundice) if the body does not produce enough glucuronyl transferase.
