To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Butazolidin is an NSAID (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicine drug). Butazolidin overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose.
Butazolidin is no longer sold for human use in the United States. However, it is still used to treat animals, such as horses.
This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with has an overdose, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

Poison Control
Your local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.Â This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.
Your provider will measure and monitor your vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.
Tests that may be done include:
Blood and urine tests
Chest x-ray
Electrocardiogram
(ECG)
Treatment may include:
Breathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the lungs, and breathing machine (ventilator)
Fluids through a vein (IV)
Laxatives
Medicine to treat symptoms
Outlook (Prognosis)
Recovery is very likely. However, bleeding in the stomach or intestines may be severe and require blood transfusion. If there is kidney damage, it may be permanent. If bleeding does not stop, even with medicine, an endoscopy may be needed to stop the bleeding. In an endoscopy, a tube is placed through the mouth and into the stomach and upper intestine.
