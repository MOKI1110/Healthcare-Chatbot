Hiatal hernia is a condition in which part of the stomach extends through an opening of the diaphragm into the chest. The diaphragm is the sheet of muscle that divides the chest from the abdomen.
Causes
The exact cause of hiatal hernia is not known. The condition may be due to weakness of the supporting tissue. Your risk for the problem goes up with age,
obesity
, and smoking. Hiatal hernias are very common. The problem occurs often in people over 50 years of age.
This condition may be linked to
reflux
(backflow) of gastric acid from the stomach into the esophagus.
Children with this condition are most often born with it (congenital). In infants, it often occurs with
gastroesophageal reflux
.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
Chest pain
Heartburn
, worse when bending over or lying down
Swallowing difficulty
A hiatal hernia by itself rarely causes symptoms. Pain and discomfort are due to the upward flow of stomach acid, air, or bile.
Exams and Tests
Tests that may be used include:
Barium swallow x-ray
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (
EGD
)
Treatment
The goals of treatment are to relieve symptoms and prevent complications. Treatments may include:
Medicines to control stomach acid
Surgery to repair the hiatal hernia
and prevent reflux
Other measures to reduce symptoms include:
Avoiding large or heavy meals
Not lying down or bending over right after a meal
Reducing weight and not smoking
Raising the head of the bed 4 to 6 inches (10 to 15 centimeters)
If medicines and lifestyle measures do not help control symptoms, you may need surgery.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Treatment can relieve most symptoms of hiatal hernia.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Pulmonary (lung)
aspiration
Slow bleeding and
iron deficiency anemia
(due to a large hernia)
Strangulation (closing off) of the hernia (very uncommon)
