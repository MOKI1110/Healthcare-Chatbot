Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome

Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome is a rare disease passed down through families. The person is unable to fully absorb dietary fats through their intestines.
Causes
Bassen-Kornzweig syndrome is caused by changes in the
MTTP
gene that tells the body to create lipoproteins (molecules of fat combined with
protein
). These variants make it hard for the body to properly digest fat and essential vitamins.
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Balance and coordination difficulties
Curvature of spine
Decreased vision that gets worse over time
Developmental delay
Failure to thrive (grow) in infancy
Muscle weakness
Poor muscle coordination that usually develops after age 10
Protruding abdomen
Slurred speech
Stool abnormalities, including fatty stools that appear pale in color, frothy stools, and abnormally foul-smelling stools
Exams and Tests
There may be damage to the retina of the eye (
retinitis pigmentosa
).
Tests that may be done to help diagnose this condition include:
Apolipoprotein B
blood test
Blood tests to look for vitamin deficiencies (fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K)
"Burr-cell" malformation of the red cells (acanthocytosis)
Complete blood count
(CBC)
Cholesterol studies
Electromyography
Eye exam
Nerve conduction velocity
Stool sample analysis
Genetic testing may be available for genetic variants in the
MTTP
gene.
Treatment
Treatment involves large doses of vitamin supplements containing fat-soluble vitamins (
vitamin A
,
vitamin D
,
vitamin E
, and
vitamin K
).
Linoleic acid supplements are also recommended.
People with this condition should talk to a dietitian. Diet changes are needed to prevent stomach problems. This may involve limiting intake of some types of fat.
Supplements of medium-chain triglycerides are taken under the supervision of a health care provider. They should be used with caution, because they may cause liver damage.
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well a person does depends on the amount of brain and nervous system problems.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Blindness
Mental deterioration
Loss of function of peripheral nerves, uncoordinated movement (ataxia)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if your infant or child has symptoms of this disease. Genetic counseling can help families understand the condition and the risks of inheriting it, and learn how to care for the person.
Prevention
High doses of fat-soluble vitamins may slow the progression of some problems, such as retina damage and decreased vision.
Alternative Names
Abetalipoproteinemia; Acanthocytosis; Apolipoprotein B deficiency
