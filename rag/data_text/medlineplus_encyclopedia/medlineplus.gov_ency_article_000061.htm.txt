Nose fracture
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
A nose fracture is a break in the bone or cartilage over the bridge, or in the sidewall or septum (structure that divides the nostrils) of the nose.
Considerations
A fractured nose is the most common
fracture
of the face. It most often occurs after an injury and often occurs with other fractures of the face.
Nose injuries and neck injuries are often seen together. A blow that is forceful enough to injure the nose may be hard enough to injure the neck.
Serious nose injuries cause problems that need a health care provider's attention right away. For example, damage to the cartilage can cause a collection of blood to form inside the nose. If this blood is not drained right away, it can cause an
abscess
or a permanent deformity that blocks the nose. It may lead to tissue death and cause the nose to collapse.
For minor nose injuries, the provider may want to see the person within the first week after the injury to see if the nose has moved out of its normal shape.
Sometimes, surgery may be needed to correct a nose or septum that has been bent out of shape by an injury.Â A doctor may be able to return nasal bones that have moved out of place back to their normal position within the first 2 weeks after the break.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
Blood coming from the nose
Bruising
around the eyes
Difficulty breathing through the nose
Misshapen appearance (may not be apparent until the swelling goes down)
Pain
Swelling
The bruised appearance most often disappears after 2 weeks.
First Aid
If a nose injury happens:
Try to stay calm.
Breathe through your mouth and lean forward in a sitting position to keep blood from going down the back of your throat.
Squeeze the nostrils closed and hold pressure to stop the bleeding.
Apply cold compresses to your nose to reduce swelling. If possible, hold the compress so that there isn't too much pressure on the nose.
To help relieve pain, try acetaminophen (Tylenol).
DO NOT
If a nose injury happens or if someone may have a broken nose:
Do not try to straighten a broken nose.
Do not move the person if there is reason to suspect a head or
neck injury
.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Get medical help right away if:
Bleeding does not stop
Clear fluid keeps draining from the nose
You suspect a
blood clot
in the septum
You suspect a neck or
head injury
The nose looks deformed or out of its usual shape
The person is having
difficulty breathing
Prevention
Wear protective headgear while playing contact sports, orÂ riding bicycles, skateboards, roller skates, or rollerblades.
Use seat belts and appropriate car seats when driving.
