To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
The vitamin A test measures the level of vitamin A in the blood.
How the Test is Performed
A
blood sample is needed
.
How to Prepare for the Test
Follow your health care provider's instructions about not eating or drinking anything for up to 24 hours before the test.
How the Test will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterwards, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.
Why the Test is Performed
This test is done to check if you have too much or too little vitamin A in your blood. (These conditions are uncommon in the United States.)
Normal Results
Normal values range from 20 to 60 micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL) or 0.69 to 2.09 micromoles per liter (micromol/L).
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
A lower than normal value means you do not have enough vitamin A in your blood. This may cause:
Bones or teeth that do not develop correctly
Dry or inflamed eyes
Feeling more irritable
Hair loss
Loss of appetite
Night blindness
Recurring infections
Skin rashes
A higher than normal value means you have excess vitamin A in your blood (toxic levels). This may cause:
Anemia
Bone and muscle pain
Diarrhea
Double vision
Hair loss
Increased pressure in the brain (pseudotumor cerebri)
Lack of muscle coordination (ataxia)
Liver and spleen enlargement
Loss of appetite
Nausea
Vitamin A deficiency may occur if your body has trouble absorbing fats through the digestive tract. This may occur if you have:
Chronic lung disease called
cystic fibrosis
Pancreas problems, such as swelling and inflammation (
pancreatitis
) or the organ not producing enough enzymes (pancreatic insufficiency)
Small intestine disorders that reduce nutrient absorption, such as
celiac disease
Risks
There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:
Excessive bleeding
Fainting or feeling lightheaded
Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
Multiple punctures to locate veins
Alternative Names
Retinol test
