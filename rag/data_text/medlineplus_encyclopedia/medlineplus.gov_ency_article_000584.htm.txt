Iron deficiency anemia

Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. There are many types and causes of anemia.
Iron deficiency anemia occurs when your body does not have enough iron. Iron helps make red blood cells. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common form of anemia.
Causes
Red blood cells bring oxygen to your body's tissues. Red blood cells are made in your bone marrow. Red blood cells circulate through your body for 3 to 4 months. Parts of your body, such as your spleen, remove old blood cells.
Iron is a key part of red blood cells. Without iron to make hemoglobin, your blood cannot carry oxygen effectively. Your body normally gets iron through your diet. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells.
Iron deficiency anemia develops when your body's iron stores run low. This can occur because:
You lose more blood cells and iron than your body can replace
Your body does not absorb iron well
Your body is able to absorb iron, but you are not eating enough foods that contain iron
Your body needs more iron than normal (such as if you are pregnant or breastfeeding)
Bleeding can cause iron loss. Common causes of bleeding are:
Heavy, long, or frequent menstrual periods
Cancer in the
esophagus
,
stomach
, small bowel, or
colon
Esophageal varices
, often from cirrhosis
The use of aspirin, ibuprofen, or medicines that may thin the blood for a long time, which can cause gastrointestinal bleeding
Peptic ulcer disease
Your body may not absorb enough iron from your diet due to:
Celiac disease
Crohn disease
Gastric bypass surgery
Taking too many antacids or too much of the antibiotic tetracycline
You may not get enough iron in your diet if:
You are a strict vegetarian
You do not eat enough foods that contain iron
Symptoms
You may have no symptoms if the anemia is mild.
Most of the time, symptoms are mild at first and develop slowly. Symptoms may include:
Feeling weak or tired more often than usual, or with exercise
Headaches
Dizziness
Palpitations
Problems concentrating or thinking
As the anemia gets worse, symptoms may include:
Brittle nails
Blue color to the whites of the eye
Desire to eat ice or other non-food things (
pica
)
Feeling lightheaded when you stand up
Pale skin color
Shortness of breath
Sore or inflamed tongue
Mouth ulcers
Uncontrolled movement of legs (during sleep) - known as restless leg syndrome
Hair loss
Symptoms of the conditions associated with bleeding that cause iron deficiency anemia include:
Dark,
tar-colored stools
or blood in the stool
Heavy menstrual bleeding
Pain in the upper belly (from ulcers)
Exams and Tests
To diagnose anemia, your health care provider may order these blood tests:
Complete blood count
(CBC)
Reticulocyte count
To check iron levels, your provider may order:
Serum iron
level
Total iron binding capacity
(TIBC) in the blood
Serum ferritin
Bone marrow biopsy
(if the diagnosis is not clear)
To check for causes of blood loss, your provider may order:
Colonoscopy
Fecal occult blood test
Upper endoscopy
Tests to detect sources of blood loss in the urinary tract or uterus
Treatment
Treatment may include
taking iron supplements
and eating
iron-rich foods
.
Iron supplements (most often ferrous sulfate) build up the iron stores in your body. Most of the time, your provider will measure your iron level before you start supplements.
If you cannot take iron by mouth, you may need to take it through a vein (
intravenous
) or, less commonly, by an injection into the muscle.
Pregnant and breastfeeding women will need to take extra iron because they often cannot get enough iron from their normal diet.
Often your anemia will improve or resolve with 6 weeks of iron therapy. You will need to keep taking iron for another 6 months to replace your body's iron stores in your bone marrow.
Iron supplements are mostly well tolerated, but may cause:
Nausea
Vomiting
Constipation
Iron-rich foods include:
Chicken and turkey
Dried lentils, peas, and beans
Fish
Meats (liver is the highest source)
Soybeans, baked beans, chickpeas
Whole-grain bread
Other sources include:
Oatmeal
Raisins, prunes, apricots, and peanuts
Spinach, kale, and other greens
Vitamin C helps your body to absorb iron. Good sources of vitamin C are:
Oranges
Grapefruits
Kiwi
Strawberries
Broccoli
Tomatoes
Outlook (Prognosis)
With treatment, the outcome is likely to be good, but it does depend on the cause.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
You have symptoms of iron deficiency
You notice blood or a black tar-appearance in your stool
Prevention
A balanced diet should include enough iron. Food sources of iron are listed above. If advised by your provider, take iron supplements.
