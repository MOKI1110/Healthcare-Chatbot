Hydrocodone and acetaminophen overdose
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Hydrocodone is a painkiller in the opioid family (related to morphine). Acetaminophen is an over-the-counter medicine used to treat pain and inflammation. They may be combined in one prescription medicine to treat moderate to severe pain. An overdose occurs when someone takes more than the recommended amount of this medicine. The treatment of this overdose must consider both the opioid and acetaminophen components.

What to Expect at the Emergency Room
The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.
Tests that may done include:
Blood and urine tests including the blood level of acetaminophen
CT scan of the head
Chest x-ray
ECG (
electrocardiogram
or heart tracing)
Treatment may include:
Activated charcoal
Breathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth and breathing machine (ventilator)
Fluids through a vein (by IV)
Laxative
Medicine to lower acetaminophen level in the blood or to counteract its effects (n-acetylcysteine)
Medicine to reverse the effects of the hydrocodone
Tube through the mouth into the stomach to wash out the stomach (gastric lavage), if unable to swallow medicines
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well you do depends on how much hydrocodone and acetaminophen you swallowed and how quickly you receive treatment. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.
You may need to stay in the hospital to receive more doses of the medicine that reverses the effects of the hydrocodone and acetaminophen. Complications may cause permanent disability. These possible complications are:
Pneumonia
Muscle damage from lying on a hard surface for a prolonged period of time
Brain damage from lack of oxygen
Kidney injury or failure
Liver damage or failure
If there are no complications, long-term effects and death are rare.
If you receive medical attention before serious breathing problems occur, you should have few long-term health problems, and will probably be back to normal within several days.
A person may survive the hydrocodone overdose and still have serious injury from the acetaminophen, including liver failure. This, might require a liver transplant.
Alternative Names
Lorcet overdose; Lortab overdose; Vicodin overdose; Norco overdose
