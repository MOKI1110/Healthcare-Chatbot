Point tenderness - abdomen
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Abdominal point tenderness is the localized pain you feel when pressure is placed over a certain part of the belly area (abdomen).
Considerations
The abdomen is an area of the body a health care provider can easily examine by touch. The provider can feel growths and organs in the belly area and find where you feel pain.
Abdominal tenderness can be mild to severe. Rebound tenderness means that there is more pain when pressure on the tender area is released. It occurs when the tissue that lines the abdominal cavity (the peritoneum) is irritated, inflamed, or infected. This is called
peritonitis
.
Causes
Causes include:
Abdominal abscess
Appendicitis
Certain types of
hernias
Meckel diverticulum
Ovarian torsion (twisted fallopian tube)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Get emergency medical help right away if you have abdominal point tenderness.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will examine you and gently push on places on your belly. People with peritonitis will often tense the abdominal muscles when the area is touched. This is called guarding.
The provider will note any point of tenderness. The location of the tenderness can indicate the problem that is causing it. For example, if you have appendicitis, you will likely have tenderness when a certain place in the lower right abdomen is touched. This spot is called McBurney point.
The provider will also ask questions about your symptoms and medical history. These may include:
When did the symptoms start?
Is this the first time you have had such discomfort?
If not, when does the discomfort tend to occur?
Are you having other symptoms, such as
constipation
,
diarrhea
, fainting,
vomiting
, or fever?
You may need to have the following tests:
Abdominal x-ray
Abdominal CT scan
(occasionally)
Abdominal ultrasound
Blood tests, such as a
complete blood count
In some cases, you may need surgery right away. This may involve an
exploratory laparotomy
or an emergency
appendectomy
.
