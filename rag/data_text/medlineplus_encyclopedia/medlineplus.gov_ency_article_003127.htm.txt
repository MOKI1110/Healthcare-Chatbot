Follow your health care provider's advice.
A liquid diet may be helpful.
You may need to keep a detailed diet log. This is a place where you write down what you eat, how much, and when.
You may be more comfortable if you eat small, frequent meals rather than big meals.
A diet high in fat or high in fiber may worsen the feeling.

Tests that may be performed include:
Complete blood count

blood differential
to check for anemia
