CSF total protein is a test to determine the amount of
protein
in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a clear fluid that is in the space around the spinal cord and brain.
How the Test is Performed
A sample of CSF is needed [1 to 5 milliliters (ml)]. A
lumbar puncture
(spinal tap)is the most common way to collect this sample. Rarely, other methods are used for collecting CSF such as:
Cisternal puncture
Ventricular puncture
Removal of CSF from a tube that is already in the CSF, such as a shunt or ventricular drain.
After the sample is taken, it is sent to a lab for evaluation.
Why the Test is Performed
You may have this test to help diagnose:
Tumors
Infection
Inflammation of the
central nervous system
Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome
Vasculitis
Blood in the spinal fluid
Multiple sclerosis
(MS)
Normal Results
The normal protein range varies from lab to lab, but is typically 15 to 60 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) orÂ 0.15 to 0.6 milligrams per milliliter (mg/mL).
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
The examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens.
What Abnormal Results Mean
An abnormal protein level in the CSF suggests a problem in the central nervous system.
An increased protein level may be a sign of a tumor, bleeding, nerve inflammation, infection or injury. A blockage in the flow of spinal fluid can cause the rapid buildup of protein in the lower spinal area.
A decrease in the protein level can mean your body is rapidly producing spinal fluid or you have a more generalized protein deficiency.
