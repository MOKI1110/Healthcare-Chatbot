Scarlet fever is caused by an infection with bacteria called group A streptococcus
.
This is the same bacteria that cause
strep throat
.
Causes
Scarlet fever used to be a severe childhood disease. The group A strep bacteria produce a toxin that causes a distinctive red
rash
, which led to the name.
The main risk factor for getting scarlet fever is infection with the bacteria that cause strep throat. An outbreak of strep throat or scarlet fever in the community, neighborhood, or school may increase the risk of infection.
Symptoms
The time between infection and symptoms is short, most often 1 to 2 days. The illness will likely begin with a
fever
and sore throat.
The rash first appears on the neck and chest, then spreads over the body. People say it feels like sandpaper. The texture of the rash is more important than the appearance to confirm the diagnosis. The rash can last for more than a week. As the rash fades, the skin around the fingertips, toes, and groin area may peel.
Other symptoms include:
Abdominal pain
Bright red color in the creases of the underarm and groin
Chills
Fever
General discomfort (malaise)
Headache
Muscle aches
Sore throat
Swollen, red tongue (strawberry tongue)
Vomiting
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider may check for scarlet fever by doing a:
Physical examination
Throat culture
that shows bacteria from group A streptococcus
Throat swab to do a test called rapid antigen detection for group A streptococcus ("rapid strep test")
Treatment
Antibiotics are used to kill the bacteria that cause the throat infection. This is crucial to prevent rheumatic fever, a serious complication of strep throat and scarlet fever.
Outlook (Prognosis)
With proper antibiotic treatment, the symptoms of scarlet fever should get better quickly. However, the rash can last for up to 2 to 3 weeks before it fully goes away.
Possible Complications
Complications are rare with the right treatment, but may include:
Acute
rheumatic fever
, which can affect the heart, joints, skin, and brain
Ear infection
Kidney damage
Liver damage
Pneumonia
Sinus infection
Swollen lymph glands or
abscess
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
You develop symptoms of scarlet fever
Your symptoms do not go away 24 hours after beginning antibiotic treatment
You develop new symptoms
Prevention
Bacteria are spread by direct contact with infected people, or by droplets an infected person coughs or exhales. Avoid contact with infected people.
Alternative Names
Scarlatina; Strep infection - scarlet fever; Streptococcus - scarlet fever
