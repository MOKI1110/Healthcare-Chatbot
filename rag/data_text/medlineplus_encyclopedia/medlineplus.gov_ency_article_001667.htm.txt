Ellis-van Creveld syndrome

Ellis-van Creveld syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects bone growth.
Causes
Ellis-van Creveld is passed down through families (inherited). It is caused by defects in 1 of 2 Ellis-van Creveld syndrome genes (
EVC
and
EVC2
). These genes are positioned next to each other on the same chromosome.
The severity of the disease varies from person to person. The highest rate of the condition is seen among the Old Order Amish population of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. It is fairly rare in the general population.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
Cleft lip or palate
Epispadias
or
undescended testicle
(cryptorchidism)
Extra fingers (
polydactyly
)
Limited range of motion
Nail problems
, including missing or deformed nails
Short arms and legs, especially forearm and lower leg
Short height, between 3.5Â to 5 feet (1Â to 1.5 meters) tall
Sparse, absent, or fine textured hair
Tooth abnormalities, such as
peg teeth
,
widely-spaced teeth
Teeth present at birth (
natal teeth
)
Delayed or missing teeth
Exams and Tests
Signs of this condition include:
Growth hormone deficiency
Heart defects, such as a hole in the heart (
atrial septal defect
), occur in about half of all cases
Tests include:
Chest x-ray
Echocardiogram
Genetic testing may be performed for genetic variants in one of the two EVC genes
Skeletal
x-ray
Ultrasound
Urinalysis
Treatment
Treatment depends on which body system is affected and the severity of the problem. The condition itself is not treatable, but many of the complications can be treated.
Support Groups
More information and support for people with EVC and their families can be found at:
National Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias (NFED) --

Little People of America, Inc --

Outlook (Prognosis)
Many babies with this condition die in early infancy. Most often this is due to a small chest or heart defect.
Stillbirth
is common.
The outcome depends on which body system is involved and to what extent that body system is involved. Like many genetic conditions involving bones or the physical structure, intelligence is normal.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Bone abnormalities
Breathing difficulty
Congenital heart disease
(CHD) especially
atrial septal defect
(ASD)
Kidney disease
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if your child has symptoms of this syndrome. If you have a family history of EVC syndrome and your child has any symptoms, visit your provider.
Genetic counseling can help families understand the condition and how to care for the person.
Prevention
Genetic counseling is recommended for prospective parents from a high-risk group, or who have a family history of EVC syndrome.
