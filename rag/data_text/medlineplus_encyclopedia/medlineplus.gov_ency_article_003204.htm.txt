Speech and language impairment may be any of several problems that make it difficult to communicate.
Considerations
The following are common speech and language disorders.
APHASIA
Aphasia is loss of the ability to understand or express spoken or written language. It commonly occurs after strokes or traumatic brain injuries. It can also occur in people with brain tumors or degenerative diseases that affect the language areas of the brain. This term does not apply to children who have never developed communication skills. There are many different types of aphasia.
In some cases of aphasia, the problem eventually corrects itself, but in others, it doesn't get better.
DYSARTHRIA
With
dysarthria
, the person has problems expressing certain sounds or words. They have poorly pronounced speech (such as slurring) and the rhythm or speed of speech is changed. Usually, a nerve or brain disorder has made it difficult to control the tongue, lips, larynx, or vocal cords, which make speech.
Dysarthria, which is difficulty pronouncing words, is sometimes confused with aphasia, which is difficulty producing language. They have different causes.
People with dysarthria may also have problems swallowing.
VOICE DISTURBANCES
Anything that changes the shape of the vocal cords or the way they work will cause a voice disturbance. Lump-like growths such as nodules, polyps, cysts, papillomas, granulomas, and cancers can be to blame. These changes cause the voice to sound different from the way it normally sounds.
Causes
Some of these disorders develop gradually, but anyone can develop a speech and language impairment suddenly, usually due to a stroke or trauma. In some cases, people may have both aphasia and dysarthria.
APHASIA
Alzheimer disease
Brain tumor (more common in aphasia than dysarthria)
Dementia
Head trauma
Stroke
Transient ischemic attack
(TIA)
DYSARTHRIA
Alcohol intoxication
Dementia
Diseases that affect nerves and muscles (neuromuscular diseases), such as
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
(ALS or Lou Gehrig disease),
cerebral palsy
,
myasthenia gravis
, or
multiple sclerosis
(MS)
Facial trauma
Facial weakness, such as
Bell's palsy
or tongue weakness
Head trauma
Head and neck cancer surgery
Nervous system (neurological) disorders that affect the brain, such as
Parkinson disease
or
Huntington disease
(more common in dysarthria than aphasia)
Poorly fitting dentures
Side effects of medicines that act on the central nervous system, such as narcotics, phenytoin, or carbamazepine
Stroke
Transient ischemic attack (TIA)
VOICE DISTURBANCES
Growths or nodules on the vocal cords
People who use their voice heavily (teachers, coaches, vocal performers) are more likely to develop voice disorders.
Home Care
For dysarthria, ways to help
improve communication
include speaking slowly and using hand gestures. Family and friends need to provide plenty of time for those with dysarthria to express themselves. Typing on an electronic device or using pen and paper can also help with communication. People with aphasia or dysarthria may benefit from speech therapy.
For aphasia, family members may need to provide frequent orientation reminders, such as the day of the week. Disorientation and confusion often occur with aphasia. Using
nonverbal ways of communicating
may also help.
It's important to maintain a relaxed, calm environment and keep external
stimuli
to a minimum.
Speak in a normal tone of voice (this condition is not a hearing or emotional problem).
Use simple phrases to avoid misunderstandings.
Don't assume that the person understands.
Provide communication aids, if possible, depending on the person and condition.
Mental health counseling may help with
depression
or frustration that many people with speech impairment have.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if:
Impairment or loss of communication comes on suddenly
There is any unexplained impairment of speech or written language
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Unless the problems have developed after an emergency event, your provider will take a medical history and perform a physical exam. The medical history may require the assistance of family or friends.
Your provider will likely ask about the speech impairment. Questions may include when the problem developed, whether there was an injury, and what medicines the person takes.
Diagnostic tests that may be performed include the following:
Blood tests
Cerebral angiography
to check blood flow in the brain
CT
or
MRI
scan of the head to check for problems such as tumor or stroke
Electroencephalogram
(EEG) to measure electrical activity of the brain
Electromyography
(EMG) to check the health of the muscles and the nerves that control the muscles
Lumbar puncture
to check the cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord
Urine tests
Swallowing study (X-rays while one swallows)
X-rays of the skull
If the tests find other medical problems, other specialists will need to be consulted.
For help with the speech problem, a speech and language therapist or social worker will likely need to be consulted.
