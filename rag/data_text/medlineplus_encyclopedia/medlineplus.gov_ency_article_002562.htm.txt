Acetaminophen and codeine overdose
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Acetaminophen (Tylenol) and codeine is a prescription pain medicine. It is an opioid pain reliever used only for pain that is severe and is not helped by other types of painkillers.
Acetaminophen and codeine overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine, either by accident or on purpose.
This article is for information only. Do not use it to treat or manage an actual
overdose
. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

Home Care
Seek medical help right away. This type of overdose can cause death. Do not make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to.
Before Calling Emergency
Have this information ready:
The person's age, weight, and condition
Name of the medicine and the strength of the medicine (if known)
Time it was swallowed
Amount swallowed
If the medicine was prescribed for the person
Poison Control
Your local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.
Your provider will measure and monitor your vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated. You may be admitted to the hospital.
Tests that may be done include:
Blood and urine tests
Chest x-ray
CT scan (advanced imaging) of the brain
Electrocardiogram
(ECG)
Treatment may include:
Activated charcoal
Breathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the lungs, and breathing machine (ventilator)
Fluids through a vein (IV)
Laxative
Medicine to reverse the effects of the overdose and treat symptoms.
If there is a high level of acetaminophen in the blood, the person will be given N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) as soon as possible.
This medicine is called an antidote. It counteracts the effects of the acetaminophen. Without it, deadly liver failure may occur. Several doses may be required until the blood level drops to a safer value.
If there are signs of a severe opioid overdose, the antidote naloxone will be given.
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well a person does, depends on the amount of medicine swallowed and how quickly the treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery. If breathing has been depressed for a long period before treatment, brain injury may occur.
If an antidote can be given, recovery from an
acute
overdose often occurs within 24 to 48 hours. Recovery takes longer, if the liver is affected, and the person may not fully recover.
Alternative Names
Tylenol #3 overdose; Phenaphen with codeine overdose; Tylenol with codeine overdose
