Treacher Collins syndrome is a genetic condition that leads to problems with the structure of the face. Most cases are not passed down through families.
Causes
Changes to one of three genes,
TCOF1
,
POLR1C
, or
POLR1D
, can lead to Treacher Collins syndrome. The condition can be passed down through families (inherited). However, most of the time, there is not another affected family member.
This condition may vary in severity from generation to generation and from person to person.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
Outer part of the ears are abnormal or almost completely missing
Hearing loss
Very small jaw (
micrognathia
)
Very large mouth
Defect in the lower eyelid
Scalp hair that reaches to the cheeks
Cleft palate
Exams and Tests
The child most often will show normal intelligence. An exam of the infant may reveal a variety of problems, including:
Abnormal eye shape
Flat cheekbones
Cleft palate or lip
Small jaw
Low-set ears
Abnormally formed ears
Abnormal ear canal
Hearing loss
Defects in the eye
Decreased eyelashes on the lower eyelid
Genetic tests can help identify gene changes linked to this condition.
Treatment
Hearing loss is treated to ensure better performance in school.
Being followed by a plastic surgeon is very important, because children with this condition may need a series of operations to correct birth defects. Plastic surgery can correct the
receding chin
and other changes in face structure.

Communication problems
Vision problems

Genetic counseling can help families understand the condition and how to care for the person.
Prevention
Genetic counseling is recommended if you have a family history of this syndrome and wish to become pregnant.
