Body temperature norms

Normal body temperature varies by person, age, activity, and time of day. The average normal body temperature is generally accepted as 98.6Â°F (37Â°C). Some studies have shown that the normal body temperature can have a wide range, from 97Â°F (36.1Â°C) to 99Â°F (37.2Â°C).
A temperature over 100.4Â°F (38Â°C) most often means you have a fever caused by an infection or illness.
Body temperature normally changes throughout the day and in adults, it is lowest in the early morning.
