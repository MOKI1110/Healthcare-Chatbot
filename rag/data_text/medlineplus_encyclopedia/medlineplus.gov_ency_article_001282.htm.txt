Retrograde ejaculation

Retrograde ejaculation occurs when semen goes backward into the bladder. Normally, it moves forward and out of the penis through the urethra during ejaculation.
Causes
Retrograde ejaculation is uncommon. It most often occurs when the opening of the bladder (bladder neck) does not close. This causes semen to go backward into the bladder rather than forward out of the penis.
Retrograde ejaculation may be caused by:
Diabetes
Some medicines, including medicines used to treat
high blood pressure
and some mood-altering medicines
Medicines or surgery to treat prostate or urethra problems
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Cloudy urine after orgasm
Little or no semen is released during ejaculation
Exams and Tests
A
urinalysis
that is taken soon after ejaculation will show a large amount of sperm in the urine.
Treatment
Your health care provider may recommend that you stop taking any medicines that may cause retrograde ejaculation. This can make the problem go away.
Retrograde ejaculation that is caused by diabetes or surgery may be treated with medicines such as pseudoephedrine or imipramine.
Outlook (Prognosis)
If the problem is caused by a medicine, normal ejaculation will often come back after the medicine is stopped. Retrograde ejaculation caused by surgery or diabetes often can't be corrected. This is most often not a problem unless you are trying to conceive. Some men do not like how it feels and seek treatment. Otherwise, there is no need for treatment.
Possible Complications
The condition may cause
infertility
. However, semen can often be removed from the bladder and used during assistive reproductive techniques.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you are worried about this problem or are having trouble conceiving a child.
Prevention

If you have diabetes,
maintain good control of your blood sugar
.
Avoid medicines that can cause this problem.
