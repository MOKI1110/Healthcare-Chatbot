Person's age, weight, and condition (for example, is the person awake or alert?)

Do not delay calling for help if you do not have this information.
Poison Control
Your local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the container to the hospital with you, if possible.
The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.
Tests that may be done include:
Blood and urine tests
Chest x-ray
CT scan of the head
Electrocardiogram
(ECG)
Treatment may include:
Fluids through a vein (by IV)
Medicine to reverse the effects of the drug and treat symptoms
Activated charcoal
Laxative
Breathing support, including a tube through the mouth into the lungs and connected to a
breathing machine
(ventilator)
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outlook depends on how severe the overdose is:
Mild overdose -- Supportive therapy alone may be all that is needed. Recovery is likely.
Moderate overdose -- With proper treatment, the person usually makes a complete recovery within 24 to 48 hours.
Severe overdose -- If the person is unconscious or has abnormal
vital signs
, more aggressive treatments may be necessary. It may take 3 to 5 days before the person becomes conscious. Complications such as pneumonia, muscle damage from lying on a hard surface for a long period of time, or brain damage from lack of oxygen may cause permanent disability. However, unless there are complications, long-term effects and death are uncommon. If death occurs, it is usually from liver failure.
