Biliary atresia

Biliary atresia is a blockage in the tubes (ducts) that carry a liquid called bile from the liver to the gallbladder.
Causes
Biliary atresia occurs when the bile ducts inside or outside the liver are abnormally narrow, blocked, or absent. The bile ducts carry a digestive fluid from liver to small bowel to break down fats and filter out waste from the body.
The cause of the disease is not clear. It may be due to:
Viral infection after birth
Exposure to toxic substances
Multiple genetic factors
Perinatal injury
Some medicines such as carbamazepine
It more commonly affects people of East Asian and African-American descent.
The bile ducts help remove waste from the liver and carry salts that help the small intestine break down (digest) fat.
In babies with biliary atresia, bile flow from the liver to the gallbladder is blocked. This can lead to liver damage and cirrhosis of the liver, which can be deadly.
Symptoms
Symptoms usually start to occur between 2 to 8 weeks. Jaundice (a yellow color to the skin and mucus membranes) develops slowly 2 to 3 weeks after birth. The infant may gain weight normally for the first month. After that point, the baby will lose weight and become irritable, and will have worsening jaundice.
Other symptoms may include:
Dark urine
Swollen belly
Foul-smelling
and
floating stools
Pale or clay-colored stools
Slow growth
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will take medical history of your child and do a physical exam to check for enlarged liver.
Tests to diagnose biliary atresia include:
Abdominal x-ray
to check for enlarged liver and spleen
Abdominal ultrasound
to check internal organs
Blood tests to check total and direct bilirubin levels
Hepatobiliary scintigraphy or HIDA scan to check whether the bile ducts and gallbladder are working properly
Liver biopsy
to check the severity of cirrhosis or to rule out other causes of jaundice
X-ray of the bile ducts (cholangiogram) to check if the bile ducts are opened or closed
Treatment
An operation called the Kasai procedure is done to connect the liver to the small intestine. The abnormal ducts are bypassed. The surgery is more successful if done before the baby is 8 weeks old.
Liver transplant may still be needed before 20 years of age in most of the cases.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Early surgery will improve the survival of more than one third of babies with this condition. The long-term benefit of aÂ liver transplant is not yet known, but it is expected to improve survival.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Infection
Irreversible cirrhosis
Liver failure
Surgical complications, including failure of the Kasai procedure
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if your child appears jaundiced, or if other symptoms of biliary atresia develop.
