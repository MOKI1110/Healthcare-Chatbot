Alcohol use involves drinking beer, wine, or hard liquor.
Information
Alcohol is one of the most widely used drug substances in the world.
TEEN DRINKING
Alcohol use is not only an adult problem. It's a
teen problem
too. Most American high school seniors have had an alcoholic drink within the past month. This is in spite of the fact that the legal drinking age is 21 years old in the United States.
About 15 percent of teens report using alcohol in the past month. About 8 percent of teens report binge drinking in the past month. Many of these are problem drinkers. This means that they:
Get drunk
Have accidents related to alcohol use
Get into trouble with the law, family members, friends, school, or dates because of alcohol
THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL
Alcoholic drinks have different amounts of alcohol in them.
Beer is about 5% alcohol, although some beers have more.
Wine is usually 12% to 17% alcohol.
Hard liquor is about 40% alcohol.
Alcohol gets into your bloodstream quickly.
The amount and type of food in your stomach can change how quickly this occurs. For example, high-carbohydrate and high-fat foods can make your body absorb alcohol more slowly.
Certain types of alcoholic drinks get into your bloodstream faster. Stronger drinks tend to be absorbed faster.
Alcohol slows your breathing rate, heart rate, and how well your brain functions. These effects may appear within 10 minutes and peak at around 40 to 60 minutes. Alcohol stays in your bloodstream until it is broken down by the liver. The amount of alcohol in your blood is called your blood alcohol level. If you drink alcohol faster than the liver can break it down, this level rises.
Your blood alcohol level is used to legally define whether or not you are drunk. The legal limit for blood alcohol is 0.08 in the United States. Below is a list of blood alcohol levels and the likely symptoms:
0.05 -- reduced inhibitions
0.10 -- slurred speech
0.20 -- euphoria and motor impairment
0.30 -- confusion
0.40 and over -- stupor, coma, breathing stops and death
You can have symptoms of being drunk at blood alcohol levels below the legal definition of being drunk. Also, people who drink alcohol frequently may not have symptoms until a higher blood alcohol level is reached.
HEALTH RISKS OF ALCOHOL
Alcohol consumption increases the risk of:
Alcoholism
Falls, drownings, and other accidents
Head, neck, stomach, colon, breast, and other cancers
Heart attack and stroke
Motor vehicle accidents
Risky sex behaviors, unplanned or unwanted pregnancy, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs)
Suicide and homicide
Drinking during pregnancy can harm the developing baby. Severe birth defects or
fetal alcohol syndrome
are possible.
RESPONSIBLE DRINKING
If you drink alcohol, it is best to do so in moderation. Moderation means the drinking is not getting you intoxicated (or drunk) and you are drinking no more than 1 drink per day if you are a woman and no more than 2 if you are a man. A drink is defined as 12 ounces (oz) or 350 milliliters (mL) of beer, 5 oz or 150 mL of wine, or 1.5 oz or 45 (mL) of liquor.
Here are some ways to drink responsibly, provided you do not have a drinking problem, are of legal age to drink alcohol, and are not pregnant:
Never drink alcohol and drive a car.
If you are going to drink, have a designated driver, or plan an alternative way home, such as a taxi, rideshare, or bus.
Do not drink on an empty stomach. Snack before and while drinking alcohol.Â
If you are taking medicines, including over-the-counter medicines, check with your health care provider before drinking alcohol. Alcohol can make the effects of many medicines stronger. It can also interact with other medicines, making them ineffective, dangerous, or make you sick.
If alcohol misuse runs in your family, you may be at increased risk of developing this disease yourself. So, you may want to
avoid drinking alcohol altogether
