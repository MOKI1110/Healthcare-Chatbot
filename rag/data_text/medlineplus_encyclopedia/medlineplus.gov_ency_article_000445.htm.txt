Felty syndrome is a disorder that includes
rheumatoid arthritis
, a swollen spleen, decreased
white blood cell count
, and repeated infections. It is rare.
Causes
The cause of Felty syndrome is unknown. It is more common in people who have had rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for a long time. People with this syndrome are at risk for infection because they have a low white blood cell count.
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
General feeling of discomfort (
malaise
)
Fatigue
Weakness in leg or arm
Loss of appetite
Unintentional weight loss
Ulcers in the skin
Joint swelling
, stiffness, pain, and deformity
Recurrent infections
Red eye with burning or discharge
Exams and Tests
A
physical exam
will show:
Swollen spleen
Joints that show signs of RA
Possibly swollen liver and lymph nodes
A complete blood count (
CBC
) with differential will show a low number of white blood cells called neutrophils. Nearly all people with Felty syndrome have a positive test for rheumatoid factor.
An
abdominal ultrasound
may confirm a swollen spleen.
Treatment
In most cases, people who have this syndrome are not getting recommended treatment for RA. They may need other medicines to suppress their immune system and reduce the activity of their RA.
Methotrexate may improve the low neutrophil count. The drug rituximab has been successful in people who do not respond to methotrexate.
Granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) may raise the neutrophil count.
Some people benefit from removal of the spleen (
splenectomy
).
Outlook (Prognosis)
Without treatment, infections may continue to occur.
RA is likely to get worse.
Treating the RA, however, should improve Felty syndrome.
Possible Complications
You may have infections that keep coming back.
Some people with Felty syndrome have increased numbers of large granular lymphocytes, also called LGL leukemia. This will be treated with methotrexate in many cases.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you develop symptoms of this disorder.
Prevention
Prompt treatment of RA with currently recommended medicines markedly decreases the risk of developing Felty syndrome.
Alternative Names
Seropositive rheumatoid arthritis (RA); Felty's syndrome
