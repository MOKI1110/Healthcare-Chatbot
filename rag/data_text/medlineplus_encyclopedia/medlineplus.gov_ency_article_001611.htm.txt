A lacrimal gland tumor is a
tumor
in one of the glands that produces tears. The lacrimal gland is located under the outer part of each eyebrow. Lacrimal gland tumors can be harmless (
benign
) or cancerous (
malignant
). About half of lacrimal gland tumors are benign. Some masses in the lacrimal gland are not really tumors but may be due to inflammation or overgrowth of lymphoid tissue.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
Double vision
Fullness in one eyelid or the side of the face
Pain
Exams and Tests
You may first be examined by an eye doctor (ophthalmologist). You may then be evaluated by a head and neck doctor (otolaryngologist, or ENT), or a doctor who specializes in problems with the bony eye socket (orbit).
Tests most often include a
CT
or
MRI scan
.
Treatment
Most lacrimal gland tumors will need to be removed with surgery. Cancerous tumors may need other treatment too, such as radiation or chemotherapy.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outlook is most often excellent for noncancerous growths. The outlook for cancer depends on the type of cancer and stage at which it is discovered.
