Babies and heat rashes

Heat
rash
occurs in babies when the pores of the sweat glands become blocked. This happens most often when the weather is hot or humid. As your infant sweats, little red bumps and possibly tiny blisters form because the blocked glands cannot clear the sweat.
Information
To avoid heat rash, keep your baby cool and dry during warm weather.
Some helpful suggestions:
During the hot season, dress your baby in lightweight, soft, cotton clothing. Cotton is very absorbent and keeps moisture away from your baby's skin.
If air conditioning is not available, a fan may help cool your infant. Place the fan far enough away so that there is only a gentle breeze drifting over your infant.
Avoid the use of powders, creams, and ointments. Baby powders do not improve or prevent heat rash. Creams and ointments tend to keep the skin warmer and block the pores.
Alternative Names
