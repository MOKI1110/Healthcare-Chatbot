Solder poisoning

Solder is used to connect electric wires or other metal parts together. Solder poisoning occurs when someone swallows solder in large amounts. Skin burns can occur if solder touches the skin.
This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

Home Care
Get medical help right away. Do not make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to. If the solder is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.
If the solder was swallowed, give water to the person right away, unless instructed otherwise by poison control or a provider. Do not give water if the person is having symptoms (such as vomiting, seizures, or a decreased level of alertness) that make it hard to swallow.
Before Calling Emergency
Determine the following information:
Person's age, weight, and condition
Name of the product (and ingredients, if known)
Time it was swallowed
Amount swallowed
Poison Control
Your local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.
The provider will measure and monitor the person's
vital signs
, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.
Tests that may be done include:
Blood and urine tests
Bronchoscopy
-- camera down the throat to look for burns in the airways and lungs
Chest x-ray
Electrocardiogram
(ECG)
Endoscopy
-- camera down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and the stomach
Treatment may include:
Fluids through the vein (by IV)
Medicine (antidote) to reverse the effect of the poison
Activated charcoal
Tube through the mouth into the stomach to wash out the stomach (
gastric lavage
)
Washing of the skin (irrigation), perhaps every few hours for several days
Surgery to remove burned skin
Breathing support, including tube through the mouth into the lungs and connected to a
breathing machine
(ventilator)
Dialysis (kidney machine)
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well the person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.
Outcomes depend on the type of poison swallowed:
Ethylene glycol is extremely poisonous.
Complete recovery from lead poisoning may take a year or more. It may cause permanent brain, nerve, or kidney damage.
If the amount of zinc or tin swallowed is low, recovery should occur within approximately 6 hours.
Skin color changes due to silver poisoning are permanent.
Long-term poisoning with antimony and cadmium may lead to lung cancer.
Recovery from acid poisoning depends on how much tissue has been damaged.
Swallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue necrosis, resulting in infection, shock, and death even several months after the substance was first swallowed. Scars may form in these tissues leading to long-term difficulties with breathing, swallowing, and digestion.
