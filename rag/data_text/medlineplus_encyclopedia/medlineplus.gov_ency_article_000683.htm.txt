Dementia
is loss of brain function that occurs with certain diseases. Dementia may also be referred to as major
neurocognitive disorder
.
Dementia due to metabolic causes is a loss of brain function that can occur with abnormal chemical processes in the body. With some of these disorders, if treated early, brain dysfunction can be reversed. Left untreated, permanent brain damage, such as dementia, can occur.
Causes
Possible metabolic causes of dementia include:
Hormonal disorders, such as
Addison disease
,
Cushing disease
Heavy metal exposure, such as to lead, arsenic, mercury, or manganese
Repeat episodes of low blood sugar (
hypoglycemia
), most often seen in people with diabetes who use insulin
High level of calcium in the blood, such as due to
hyperparathyroidism
Low level of thyroid hormone (
hypothyroidism
) or high level of thyroid hormone (
thyrotoxicosis
) in the body
Liver cirrhosis
Kidney failure
Nutritional disorders, such as vitamin B1 deficiency,
vitamin B12
deficiency,
pellagra
, or protein-calorie
malnutrition
Porphyria
Poisons, such as methanol
Severe alcohol use
Wilson disease
Disorders of the mitochondria (energy-producing parts of cells)
Rapid changes in blood sodium level
Symptoms
Metabolic disorders may cause
confusion
and changes in thinking or reasoning. These changes may be short-term or lasting. Dementia occurs when the symptoms are not reversible. Symptoms can be different for everyone. They depend on the health condition causing the dementia.
The early symptoms of dementia can include:
Difficulty with tasks that take some thought but used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing games (such as bridge), and learning new information or routines
Getting lost on familiar routes
Language problems, such as trouble with names of familiar objects
Losing interest in things previously enjoyed, flat mood
Misplacing items
Personality changes and loss of social skills, which can lead to inappropriate behaviors
Mood changes that can cause periods of aggression and anxiety
Poor performance at work resulting in demotion or loss of job
As the dementia gets worse, symptoms are more obvious and interfere with the ability to take care of yourself:
Changing sleep patterns, often waking up at night
Forgetting details about current events, forgetting events in one's life history
Having difficulty doing basic tasks, such as preparing meals, choosing proper clothing, or driving
Having hallucinations, (for example, seeing or hearing things that are not there), arguments, striking out, and behaving violently
More difficulty reading or writing
Poor judgment and losing the ability to recognize danger
Using the wrong word, not pronouncing words correctly, speaking in confusing sentences
Withdrawing from social contact
The person may also have symptoms from the disorder that caused dementia.
Exams and Tests
Depending on the cause, a nervous system (neurologic) examination is done to identify the problems.
Tests to diagnose a medical condition causing the dementia may include:
Ammonia level in the blood
Blood chemistry
, electrolytes
Blood glucose level
BUN
,
creatinine
to check kidney function
Liver function tests
Lumbar puncture
(spinal tap) to measure chemistry of the spinal fluid
Nutritional assessment
Thyroid function tests
Urinalysis
Vitamin B12 level
To check for certain brain disorders, an
electroencephalogram
(EEG),
head CT scan
, or
head MRI scan
is usually done.
Treatment
The aim of treatment is to manage and correct the underlying disorder and control symptoms. With some metabolic disorders, treatment may stop or even reverse the dementia symptoms.
Medicines used to treat
Alzheimer disease
have not been shown to work for these types of disorders. Sometimes, these medicines are used anyway, when other treatments fail to control the underlying problems.
Plans should also be made for home care for people with dementia.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Outcome varies, depending on the cause of the dementia and the amount of damage to the brain.
Possible Complications
Complications may include the following:
Loss of ability to function or care for self
Loss of ability to interact
Pneumonia
,
urinary tract infections
, and skin infections
Pressure sores
Symptoms of the underlying problem (such as loss of sensation due to a nerve injury from vitamin B12 deficiency)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if symptoms get worse or continue. Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if there is a sudden change in mental status or a life-threatening emergency.
Prevention
Treating the underlying cause may reduce the risk for metabolic dementia.
