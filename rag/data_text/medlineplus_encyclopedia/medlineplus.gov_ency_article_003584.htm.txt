Leukocyte esterase is a urine test to look for white blood cells and other signs of infection.
How the Test is Performed
A
clean-catch urine sample
is preferred. The clean-catch method is used to prevent germs from the penis or vagina from getting into a urine sample. To collect your urine, the health care provider may give you a special clean-catch kit that contains a cleansing solution and sterile wipes. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate.
After you provide a urine sample, it is tested right away. The provider uses a dipstick made with a color-sensitive pad. The color of the dipstick changes to tell the provider if you have white blood cells in your urine.
How to Prepare for the Test
No special steps are needed to prepare for this test.
How the Test will Feel
The test will involve only normal urination. There is no discomfort.
Why the Test is Performed
Leukocyte esterase is a screening test used to detect a substance that suggests there are white blood cells in the urine. This may mean you have a
urinary tract infection
.
If this test is positive, the urine should be examined under a microscope for white blood cells and other signs that point to an infection.
Normal Results
A negative test result is normal.
What Abnormal Results Mean

The following may cause an abnormal test result, even when you do not have a urinary tract infection:

Vaginal secretions (such as blood or heavy mucus discharge)
