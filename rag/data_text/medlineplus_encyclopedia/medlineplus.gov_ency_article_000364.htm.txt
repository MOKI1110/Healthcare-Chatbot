Pseudohypoparathyroidism

Pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP)Â is a genetic disorder in which the body fails to respond to parathyroid hormone.
A related condition is
hypoparathyroidism
,Â in which the body does not make enough parathyroid hormone.Â
Causes
The parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH helps regulate calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the blood and is important for bone health.
If you have PHP, your body produces the right amount of PTH, but is resistant to its effect. This causes low blood calcium levels and high blood phosphate levels.
PHP is caused by abnormal genes. There are different types of PHP. All forms are rare and are usually diagnosed in childhood.
Type 1a is inherited in an
autosomal dominant manner
. That means only one parent needs to pass you the variant gene for you to have the condition. It is also called Albright hereditary osteodystrophy. The condition causes short stature, round face, obesity, developmental delay, and short hand bones. Symptoms depend on whether you inherit the gene from your mother or father.
Type 1b involves resistance to PTH only in the kidneys. Less is known about type 1b than type 1a. Calcium in the blood is low, but there are none of the other characteristic features of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy.
Type 2 also involves low blood calcium and high blood phosphate levels. People with this form do not have the physical traits common to people with Type 1a. The genetic abnormality that causes it is not known. It is different from Type 1b in how the kidney responds to high PTH levels.
Symptoms
Symptoms are related to aÂ low level of calcium and include:
Cataracts
Dental problems
Numbness
Seizures
Tetany (a collection of symptoms including muscle twitches and hand and foot cramps and muscle spasms)
People with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy may have the following symptoms:
Calcium deposits under the skin
Dimples that can replace knuckles on affected fingers
Round face and short neck
Short hand bones, especially the bone below the 4th finger
Short height
Exams and Tests
Blood tests will be done to check
calcium
,
phosphorus
, and
PTH
levels. You may also need urine tests.
Other tests may include:
Genetic testing
Head MRI
or
CT scan of the brain
Treatment
Your health care provider will recommend calcium and vitamin D supplements to maintain a proper blood calcium level. If the blood phosphate level is high, you may need to follow a low-phosphorus diet or take medicines called phosphate binders (such as calcium carbonate or calcium acetate). Treatment is usually life-long.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Low blood calcium in PHP is usually milder than in other forms of hypoparathyroidism, but the severity of symptoms can be different between different people.
Possible Complications
People with type 1a PHPÂ are more likely to have other endocrine system problems (such as
hypothyroidism
and
hypogonadism
).
PHP may be connected to other hormone problems, resulting in:
Low sex drive
Slow sexual development
Low energy levels
Weight gain
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you or your child have any symptoms of a low calcium level or pseudohypoparathyroidism.
