Scleredema diabeticorum is a skin condition that occurs in some people with diabetes. It causes skin to become thick and hard on the back of the neck, shoulders, arms, and upper back.
Causes
Scleredema diabeticorum is thought to be a rare disorder, but some people think that the diagnosis is often missed. The exact cause is unknown. The condition tends to occur in men with poorly-controlled diabetes who:
Are obese
Use insulin
Have poor blood sugar control
Have other diabetes complications
Symptoms
Skin changes happen slowly. Over time, you may notice:
Thick, hard skin that feels smooth. You cannot pinch the skin over the upper back or neck.
Reddish, painless lesions.
Lesions occur on the same areas on both sides of the body (symmetrical).
In severe cases, thickened skin can make it hard to move the upper body. It also can make deep breathing difficult.
Some people find it hard to make a clenched fist because the skin on the back of the hand is too tight.
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. You will be asked about your medical history and symptoms.
Tests may include:
Fasting blood sugar
Glucose tolerance test
Hemoglobin A1C test
Skin biopsy
Treatment
There is no specific treatment for scleredema. Treatments may include:
Improved control of blood sugar (this may not improve the lesions once they have developed)
Phototherapy, a procedure in which the skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light
Glucocorticoid medications (topical or oral)
Electron beam therapy (a type of radiation therapy)
Medicines that suppress the immune system
Physical therapy, if you find it hard to move your torso or breathe deeply
Outlook (Prognosis)
The condition cannot be cured. Treatment may improve movement and breathing.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you:
Have trouble controlling your blood sugar
Notice symptoms of scleredema
If you have scleredema, contact your provider if you:
Find it hard to move your arms, shoulders, and torso, or hands
Have trouble breathing deeply due to tight skin
Prevention
Keeping blood sugar levels within a healthy range helps prevent diabetes complications. However, scleredema can occur, even when blood sugar is well controlled.
Your provider may discuss adding medicines that allow insulin to work better in your body so that your insulin doses can be reduced.
