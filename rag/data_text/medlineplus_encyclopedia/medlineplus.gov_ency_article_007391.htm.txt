Aortic aneurysm repair - endovascular

Endovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is surgery to repair a widened area in your aorta. This is called an aneurysm. The aorta is the large artery that carries blood from your heart to your belly, pelvis, and legs.
An
aortic aneurysm
is when a part of this artery becomes too large or balloons outward. It occurs due to weakness in the wall of the artery.
Description
This procedure is done in an operating room, in the radiology department of a hospital, or in a catheterization lab. You will lie on a padded table. You may receive
general anesthesia
(you are asleep and pain-free) or epidural or spinal anesthesia. During the procedure, your surgeon will:
Make a small surgical cut near the groin, to find the femoral artery.
Insert a thin, flexible tube (catheter) into the artery through the cut.
Insert a stent (a metal coil) and a man-made (synthetic) graft along the catheter.
Use a dye to define the extent of the aneurysm.
Use x-rays to guide the stent graft up into your aorta, to where the aneurysm is located.
Open the stent using a spring-like mechanism and attach it to the walls of the aorta. Your aneurysm will eventually shrink around it.
Use x-rays and dye again to make sure the graft is in the right place and your aneurysm is not bleeding inside your body.
Remove the catheter and close the surgical cut where the catheter was inserted.
Why the Procedure is Performed
Endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is done because your aneurysm is very large, growing quickly, or is leaking or bleeding.
You may have an AAA that is not causing any symptoms or problems. Your health care provider may have found this problem when they examined you or you had an
ultrasound
or
CT scan
for another reason. There is a risk that this aneurysm may burst (rupture) if you do not have surgery to repair it. However, surgery to repair the aneurysm may also be risky. In such cases, EVAR is an option.
You and your provider must decide whether the risk of having this surgery is smaller than the risk for rupture if you do not have surgery to repair the problem. The provider is more likely to recommend that you have surgery if the aneurysm is:
Larger (about 2 inches or 5 centimeters)
Growing more quickly (a little less than 1/4 inch or 0.5 centimeter over the last 6 to 12 months)
EVAR has a lower risk of developing complications compared to open surgery. Your provider is more likely to suggest this type of repair if you have other serious medical problems or are an older person.
Risks
Risks of any surgery are:
Blood clots
in the legs that may travel to the lungs
Breathing problems
Infection, including in the lungs, urinary tract, and belly
Heart attack
or
stroke
Reactions to medicines
Risks of this surgery are:
Bleeding around the graft that needs more surgery
Bleeding before or after procedure
Blockage of the stent
Damage to a nerve, causing weakness, pain, or numbness in the leg
Kidney failure
Poor blood supply to your legs, your kidneys, or other organs
Problems getting or keeping an erection
Surgery is not successful and you need an open surgery
The stent graft slips
The graft leaks and requires open surgery
Death
Before the Procedure
Your provider will examine you and order tests before you have surgery.
Always tell your provider what medicines you are taking, even medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.
If you are a smoker, you should stop. Your provider can help. Here are other things you will need to do before your surgery:
About two weeks before your surgery, you will visit your provider to make sure any medical problems, such as
diabetes
,
high blood pressure
, and heart or lung problems, are well regulated.
You also may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (Coumadin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn).
Ask which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.
Always tell your surgeon if you get a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness before your surgery.
The evening before your surgery:
DO NOT drink anything after midnight, including water.
On the day of your surgery:
Take any medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.
You will be told when to arrive at the hospital.
After the Procedure
Most people stay in the hospital for a few days after this surgery, depending on the type of procedure they had. Most often, the recovery from this procedure is faster and with less pain than with open surgery. Also, you will most likely be able to go home sooner.
During a hospital stay, you may:
Be in the intensive care unit (ICU), where you will be watched very closely at first
Have a
urinary catheter
Be given medicines to thin your blood
Be encouraged to sit on the side of your bed and then walk
Wear special stockings to prevent blood clots in your legs
Receive pain medicine into your veins or into the space that surrounds your spinal cord (epidural)
Outlook (Prognosis)
Recovery after endovascular repair is quick in most cases.
You will need to be watched and checked regularly to make sure your repaired aortic aneurysm is not leaking blood.
