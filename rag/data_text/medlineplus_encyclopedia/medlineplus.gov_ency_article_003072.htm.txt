Coughing is an important way to keep your throat and airways clear. But too much coughing may mean you have a disease or disorder.

Coughing
Some coughs are dry. Others are productive. A productive cough is one that brings up mucus. Mucus is also called phlegm or sputum.
Coughs can be either acute or chronic:
Acute coughs usually begin rapidly and are often due to a
cold
,
flu
, or
sinus infection
. They usually go away after 3 weeks.
Subacute coughs last 3 to 8 weeks and often much sooner than that.
Chronic coughs last longer than 8 weeks.
Causes
Common causes of coughing are:
Allergies
that involve the nose or sinuses
Asthma
and
COPD
(emphysema or chronic bronchitis)
The common cold, flu, and other viral infections
Lung infections such as
pneumonia
or
acute bronchitis
Sinusitis
with postnasal drip
Gastroesophageal reflux disease
(GERD)
Other causes include:
ACE inhibitors
or less often ARB medicines used to treat
high blood pressure
, heart failure, or
kidney diseases
Cigarette smoking or exposure to secondhand smoke (or smoking other substances like marijuana)
Lung cancer
Lung disease such as
bronchiectasis
,
cystic fibrosis
, or
interstitial lung disease
Sometimes no specific cause is found
Home Care
If you have asthma or another chronic lung disease, make sure you are taking medicines prescribed by your health care provider.
Here are some tips to help ease your cough:
If you have a dry, tickling cough, try cough drops or hard candy. Never give these to a child under age 3, because they can cause choking.
Use a vaporizer or take a steamy shower to increase moisture in the air to help soothe a dry throat. If you use a humidifier, make sure it is properly cleaned and maintained.
Drink plenty of fluids. Liquids help thin the mucus in your throat making it easier to cough it up.
Do not smoke, and stay away from secondhand smoke.
Medicines you can buy on your own include:
Guaifenesin helps break up mucus. Follow package instructions on how much to take. Do not take more than the recommended amount. Drink lots of fluids if you take this medicine.
Decongestants help clear a runny nose and relieve postnasal drip. Check with your provider before taking decongestants if you have high blood pressure.
Talk to your child's provider before you give children ages 6 years or younger an over-the-counter cough medicine, even if it is labeled for children. These medicines likely do not work for children, and can have serious side effects.
If you have seasonal allergies, such as hay fever:
Stay indoors during days or times of the day (usually the morning) when airborne allergens are high.
Keep windows closed and use an air conditioner.
Do not use fans that draw in air from outdoors.
Shower and change your clothes after being outside.
If you have allergies year-round, cover your pillows and mattress with dust mite covers, use an air purifier, and avoid pets with fur and other triggers.
Treat the underlying cause (per above) as directed by your provider.

Your provider will examine your ears, nose, throat, and chest.
