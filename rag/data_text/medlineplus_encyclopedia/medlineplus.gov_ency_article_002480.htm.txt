Poison Control
Your
local poison control center

This is a free and confidential service. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the container that contains the acetone with you to the hospital, if possible.
The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated. The person may receive:
Blood tests
Breathing support, including oxygen and a breathing tube through the mouth into the lungs
Chest x-ray
ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)
Intravenous fluids (IV, fluids given through a vein)
Medicines to treat symptoms
Tube through the nose into the stomach to empty the stomach (
gastric lavage
)
Outlook (Prognosis)
Accidentally drinking small amounts of acetone/nail polish remover is unlikely to harm you as an adult. However, even small amounts can be dangerous to your child, so it is important to keep this and all household chemicals in a safe place.
If the person survives past 48 hours, the chances for recovery are good.
