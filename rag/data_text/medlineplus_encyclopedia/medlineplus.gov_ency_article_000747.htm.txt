Provisional (transient) tic disorder is a condition in which a person makes one or many brief, repeated, movements or noises (tics). These movements or noises are involuntary (not on purpose).
Causes
Provisional tic disorder is common in children.
The cause of provisional tic disorder can be physical or mental (psychological). It may be a mild form of
Tourette syndrome
. Provisional means that the tic has been present for less than a year.
Symptoms
Your child may have
facial tics
or tics involving movement of the arms, legs, or other areas.
Tics may involve:
Movements that occur again and again and do not have a rhythm
An overwhelming urge to make the movement
Brief and jerky movements that include blinking, clenching the fists, jerking the arms, kicking, raising the eyebrows, sticking out the tongue
The tics often look like nervous behavior. Tics appear to get worse with stress. They may be less frequent during sleep or not occur during sleep at all.
Sounds may also occur, such as:
Clicking
Grunting
Hissing
Moaning
Sniffing
Snorting
Squealing
Throat clearing
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will consider physical causes of provisional tic disorder before making a diagnosis.
In order to be diagnosed with provisional tic disorder, symptoms must be present less than one year and not be due to other conditions including use of substances.
Other disorders such as
anxiety
, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
attention deficit hyperactivity disorder
Â (ADHD),
uncontrollable movement
(myoclonus),
obsessive-compulsive disorder
Â (OCD), and
epilepsy
may need to be ruled out.
Treatment
Providers recommend that family members do not call attention to the tics at first. This is because unwanted attention may make the tics worse. If the tics are severe enough to cause problems at school or work, behavioral techniques and medicines may help.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Simple childhood tics usually disappear over a period of months. If symptoms persist for more than three months, they are more likely to become chronic.
Possible Complications
There are usually no complications. A
chronic motor tic disorder
can develop.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Talk to your child's provider if you are concerned about a provisional tic disorder, especially if it continues or disrupts your child's life. If you are not sure whether the movements are a tic or a
seizure
, contact your provider right away.
