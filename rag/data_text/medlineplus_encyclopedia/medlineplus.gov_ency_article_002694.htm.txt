If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

Poison Control
Your local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Bring the container with you to the hospital, if possible.
The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated.
The person may receive:
Blood and urine tests
Breathing support, including tube through the mouth into the lungs and breathing machine (ventilator)
ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)
Chest x-ray
Endoscopy
-- camera placed down the throat to see burns in the esophagus and the stomach, if vomiting blood
Fluids through a vein (by IV)
Laxative
Medicine to treat symptoms
Tube through the nose into the stomach if vomiting blood
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well someone does depends on the amount of cologne swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.
Cologne poisoning may make a person appear as if they are drunk. It can also cause severe breathing problems, seizures, and coma. A product with a lot of isopropyl alcohol could cause a more serious illness.
