A skin abscess is a buildup of pus in or on the skin.
Causes
Skin abscesses are common and affect people of all ages. They occur when an infection causes pus to collect in the skin.
Skin abscesses may occur after developing:
A bacterial infection (often staphylococcus)
A minor wound or injury
Boils
Folliculitis
(infection in a hair follicle)
A skin abscess may occur anywhere on the body.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
Fever
or
chills
, in some cases
Local swelling around the infected spot
Hardened skin tissue
Skin lesion that may be an open or closed sore or a raised area
Redness, tenderness, and warmth in the area
Fluid or pus drainage
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider can diagnose the problem by looking at the affected area. The drainage from the sore may be sent to the lab for a culture. This can help identify the cause of the infection.
Treatment
You can apply moist heat (such as warm compresses) to help the abscess drain and heal faster. Do not push and squeeze on the abscess.
Your provider may cut open the abscess and drain it. If this is done:
Numbing medicine will be put on or into your skin.
Packing material may be left in the wound to help it heal.
You may need to take antibiotics by mouth to control the infection.
If you have methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus
(
MRSA
) or another staph infection, follow instructions for
self-care
at home.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Most skin abscesses can be cured with proper treatment. Infections caused by MRSA respond to specific antibiotics.
Possible Complications
Complications that can occur from an abscess include:
Spread of the infection in the same area
Spread of the infection into the blood and throughout the body
Tissue death (
gangrene
)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have any signs of skin infection, including:
Drainage of any kind
Fever
Pain
Redness
Swelling
Contact your provider right away if you develop new symptoms during or after treatment of a skin abscess.
Prevention
Keep the skin around minor wounds clean and dry to prevent infection. Call your provider if you notice signs of infection. Take care of minor infections promptly.
