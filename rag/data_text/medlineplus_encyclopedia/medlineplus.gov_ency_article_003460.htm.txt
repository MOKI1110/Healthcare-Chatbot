17-ketosteroids are substances that form when the body breaks down male steroid sex hormones called androgens and other hormones released by the adrenal glands in males and females, and by the testes in males.
How the Test is Performed
A 24-hour urine sample is needed. You will need to
collect your urine over 24 hours
. Your health care provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly to ensure accurate results.
How to Prepare for the Test
Your provider will ask you to temporarily stop any medicines that may affect the test results. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take. These include:
Antibiotics
Aspirin (if you are on long-term aspirin)
Birth control pills
Diuretics (water pills)
Estrogen
Do not stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.
How the Test will Feel
The test involves normal urination. There is no discomfort.
Why the Test is Performed
Your provider may order this test if you have signs of a disorder associated with abnormal levels of androgens.
Normal Results
Normal values are as follows:
Male: 7 to 20 mg per 24 hours
Female: 5 to 15 mg per 24 hours
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Increased levels of 17-ketosteroids may be due to:
Adrenal glands making too much of their hormones (
Cushing syndrome
)
Imbalance of sex hormones in females (
polycystic ovary syndrome
)
Ovarian cancer
Testicular cancer
Overactive thyroid
Obesity
Stress
Testicular cancer
Decreased levels of 17-ketosteroids may be due to:
Adrenal glands not making enough of their hormones (
Addison disease
)
Kidney damage
Pituitary gland not making enough of its hormones (
hypopituitarism
)
Removal of the testicles (castration)
Risks
There are no risks with this test.
