Thyroid cancer is a cancer that starts in the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is located in the front of your lower neck.
Causes
Thyroid cancer can occur in people of any age.
Radiation to the thyroid increases the risk of developing thyroid cancer. Exposure may occur from:
Radiation therapy
to the neck (especially in childhood)
Radiation exposure from nuclear plant disasters
Other risk factors are a family history of thyroid cancer and chronic
goiter
(enlarged thyroid). Being overweight or having obesity may be a risk factor for papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.
There are several types of thyroid cancer:
Anaplastic carcinoma
(also called giant and spindle cell cancer) is the most dangerous form of thyroid cancer. It is rare, and spreads quickly.
Follicular carcinoma is more likely to come back and spread.
Medullary carcinoma
is a cancer of non-thyroid hormone-producing cells that are normally present in the thyroid gland. This form of thyroid cancer tends to occur in families.
Papillary carcinoma
is the most common type, and it usually affects women of childbearing age. It spreads slowly and is the least dangerous type of thyroid cancer.
Symptoms
Symptoms vary depending on the type of thyroid cancer, but may include:
Cough
Difficulty swallowing
Enlargement of the thyroid gland
Hoarseness or changing voice
Neck swelling
Thyroid lump (nodule)
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may reveal a lump in your thyroid or swollen lymph nodes in your neck.
The following tests may be done:
Calcitonin
blood test to check for medullary thyroid cancer
An examination of the airway with a fiberoptic scope (
laryngoscopy
) may show a paralyzed vocal cord.
Thyroid biopsy, which may include genetic testing of the cells obtained in the biopsy
Thyroid scan
TSH
, free
T4
(blood tests for thyroid function)
Ultrasound of the thyroid
and the lymph nodes of the neck
CT scan
of the neck (to determine the extent of the cancerous mass)
PET scan
Treatment
Treatment depends on the type of thyroid cancer. Treatment of most thyroid cancer types is effective if diagnosed early.
Surgery is most often the initial treatment. All or part of the
thyroid gland may be removed
. If your provider suspects that the cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the neck, these will also be removed. If some of your thyroid gland remains, you will need follow-up ultrasound and possibly other studies to detect any regrowth of thyroid cancer.
Radiation therapy may be done with or without surgery. It may be performed by:
Taking radioactive iodine by mouth
Aiming external beam (x-ray) radiation at the thyroid
After treatment for thyroid cancer, you must take thyroid hormone pills for the rest of your life. The dosage is usually slightly higher than what your body needs. This helps keep the cancer from coming back. The pills also replace the thyroid hormone your body needs to function normally.
If the cancer does not respond to surgery or radiation, and has spread to other parts of the body,
chemotherapy
or
targeted therapy
may be used. These are only needed by a small number of people.
Support Groups
You can ease the stress of illness by joining a
cancer support group
. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.
Possible Complications
Complications of thyroid cancer may include:
Injury to the voice box and hoarseness after thyroid surgery
Low calcium level from accidental removal of the parathyroid glands during surgery
Spread of the cancer to the lungs, bones, or other parts of the body
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you notice a lump in your neck.
Prevention
Awareness of risk (such as previous radiation therapy to the neck) can allow earlier diagnosis and treatment.
Sometimes, people with family histories and genetic mutations related to medullary thyroid cancer will have their thyroid gland removed to prevent cancer.
