Creeping eruption is a human infection with dog or cat
hookworm
larvae (immature worms).
Causes
Hookworm eggs are found in the stool of infected dogs and cats. When the eggs hatch, the larvae can infest soil and vegetation.
When you come into contact with this infested soil, the larvae can burrow into your skin. They cause an intense
inflammatory response
that leads to a
rash
and severe itching.
Creeping eruption is more common in countries with warm climates. In the United States, the Southeast has the highest rates of infection. The main risk factor for this disease is contact with damp, sandy soil that has been contaminated with infected cat or dog stool. More children than adults become infected.
Symptoms
Symptoms of creeping eruption include:
Blisters
Itching, may be more severe at night
Raised, snakelike tracks in the skin that may spread over time, usually about 1 centimeter (cm) or less than one-half inch (in) per day, usually on the feet and legs (severe infections may cause several tracks)
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider can often diagnose this condition by looking at your skin. In rare cases, a
skin biopsy
is done to check for other conditions. In very rare cases, a blood test is done to see if you have increased
eosinophils
(a type of white blood cell).
Treatment
Anti-parasitic medicines may be used to treat the infection.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Creeping eruption often goes away by itself over weeks to months. Treatment with anti-parasitic medicines helps the infection go away more quickly.
Possible Complications
Creeping eruption may lead to these complications:
Bacterial skin infections caused by scratching
Spread of the infection through the bloodstream to the lungs or small intestine (rare)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you or your child have skin sores that are:
Snake-like
Itchy
Moving from one area to another
Prevention
Public sanitation and deworming of dogs and cats have decreased hookworm infestation in the United States.
Hookworm larvae often enter the body through bare feet, so wearing shoes in areas where hookworm infestations are known to occur helps prevent infection.
