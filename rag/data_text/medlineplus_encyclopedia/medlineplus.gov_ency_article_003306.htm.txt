Micrognathia

Micrognathia is a term for a lower jaw that is smaller than normal.
Considerations
In some cases, the jaw is small enough to interfere with the infant's feeding. Infants with this condition may need special nipples in order to feed properly.
Micrognathia often corrects itself during growth. The jaw may grow a lot during puberty. The problem can be caused by certain inherited disorders and syndromes.
Micrognathia can cause the teeth not to align properly. This can be seen in the way the teeth appear when the mouth closes. Often there will not be enough room for the teeth to grow.
Children with this problem should see an orthodontist when the adult teeth come in. Because children may outgrow the condition, it often makes sense to delay treatment until a child is older.
Causes
Micrognathia may be part of other genetic syndromes, including:
Cri du chat syndrome
Hallermann-Streiff syndrome
Marfan syndrome
Pierre Robin syndrome
Progeria
Silver-Russell syndrome
Seckel syndrome
Smith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome
Treacher-Collins syndrome
Trisomy 13
Trisomy 18
XO syndrome (
Turner syndrome
)
Home Care
You may need to use special feeding methods for a child with this condition. Most hospitals have programs where you can learn about these methods.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if:
Your child seems to have a very small jaw
Your child has trouble feeding properly
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
The provider will do a physical exam and may ask questions about the problem. Some of these may include:
When did you first notice that the jaw was small?
How severe is it?
Does the child have trouble eating?
What other symptoms are present?
The physical exam will include a thorough check of the mouth.
The following tests may be performed:
Dental x-rays
Skull x-rays
Depending on the symptoms, a child may need to be tested for an inherited condition that may be the source of the problem. The child may need surgery or devices to correct tooth position.
