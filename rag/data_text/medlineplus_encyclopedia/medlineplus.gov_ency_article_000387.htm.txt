Insulinoma

An insulinoma is a
tumor
in the pancreas that produces too much insulin.
Causes
The pancreas is an organ in the abdomen. The pancreas makes several
enzymes
and hormones, including the hormone insulin. Insulin's job is to reduce the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood by helping sugar move into cells.
Most of the time when your blood sugar level decreases, the pancreas stops making insulin to make sure that your blood sugar stays in the normal range. Tumors of the pancreas that produce too much insulin are called insulinomas. Insulinomas keep making insulin, even when it's not needed, and can make your blood sugar level too low (hypoglycemia).
A high blood insulin level causes a low blood sugar level (
hypoglycemia
). Hypoglycemia may be mild, leading to symptoms such as anxiety and hunger. Or it can be severe, leading to seizures, coma, and even death.
Insulinomas are very rare tumors. They usually occur as single, small tumors. But there can also be several small tumors.
Most insulinomas are non-cancerous (benign) tumors. People with certain genetic disorders, such as
multiple endocrine neoplasia type I
, are at higher risk for insulinomas.
Symptoms
Symptoms are most common when you are fasting or skip or delay a meal. Symptoms may include:
Anxiety
, behavior changes, or
confusion
Clouded vision
Loss of consciousness
or coma
Convulsions
or tremor
Dizziness or headache
Hunger between meals; weight gain is common
Fast heart rate
or palpitations
Sweating
Exams and Tests
After fasting, your blood may be tested for:
Blood
C-peptide
level
Blood glucose level
Blood insulin level
Medicines that cause the pancreas to release insulin
The response of your body to a shot of glucagon
CT
,
MRI
, or
PET
scan of the abdomen may be done to look for a tumor in the pancreas. If a tumor is not seen in the scans, one of the following tests may be performed:
Endoscopic ultrasound
(test that uses a flexible scope and sound waves to view digestive system organs)
Octreotide scan (special test that checks for specific hormone-producing cells in the body)
Pancreatic
arteriography
(test that uses special dye to view the arteries in the pancreas)
Pancreatic venous sampling for insulin (test that helps locate the approximate location of the tumor inside the pancreas)
Treatment
Surgery is the usual treatment for insulinoma. If there is a single tumor, it will be removed. If there are many tumors, part of the pancreas will need to be removed. At least 15% of the pancreas must be left to produce normal levels of enzymes for digestion.
In rare cases, the entire pancreas is removed if there are many insulinomas or they come back after surgery. Removing the entire pancreas leads to diabetes because there is no longer any insulin being produced. Insulin shots (injections) are then required.
If no tumor is found during surgery, or if you can't have surgery, you may get the medicine diazoxide to lower insulin production and prevent hypoglycemia. A water pill (diuretic) is given with this medicine to prevent the body from retaining fluid. Octreotide is another medicine that is used to reduce insulin release in some people.
Outlook (Prognosis)
In most cases, the tumor is non-cancerous (benign), and surgery can cure the disease. But a severe hypoglycemic reaction or the spread of a cancerous tumor to other organs can be life threatening.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Severe hypoglycemic reaction
Spread of a cancerous tumor (
metastasis
)
Diabetes if the entire pancreas is removed (rare), or food not being absorbed if too much of the pancreas is removed
Inflammation and swelling of the pancreas
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you develop any symptoms of insulinoma. Seizures and losing consciousness are an emergency. Call 911 or the local emergency number right away.
