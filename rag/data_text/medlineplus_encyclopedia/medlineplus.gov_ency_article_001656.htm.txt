Noonan syndrome

Noonan syndrome is a disease present from birth (congenital) that causes many parts of the body to develop abnormally. In about 50% of cases, it is passed down through families (inherited).
Causes
Noonan syndrome is linked to variants in several genes. In general, certain proteins involved in growth and development become overactive as a result of these gene changes.
Noonan syndrome is an
autosomal dominant
condition. This means only one parent has to pass down the variant gene for the child to have the syndrome. However, some cases may not be inherited and instead happen by chance (spontaneously).
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Delayed puberty
Down-slanting or widely-spaced eyes
Hearing loss
(varies)
Low-set or abnormally shaped ears
Mild intellectual disability (only in about 25% of cases)
Sagging eyelids (
ptosis
)
Short stature
Small penis
Undescended testicles
Unusual chest shape (most often a sunken chest called pectus excavatum)
Webbed and short-appearing neck
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may show signs of heart problems the infant had from birth. These may include
pulmonary stenosis
and
atrial septal defect
.
Tests depend on the symptoms, but may include:
Platelet count
Blood clotting factor test
ECG
,
chest x-ray
, or
echocardiogram
(ECHO)
Hearing tests
Growth hormone levels
Renal ultrasound
Genetic testing can help diagnose this syndrome.
Treatment
There is no specific treatment. Your provider will suggest treatment to relieve or manage symptoms. Growth hormone has been used successfully to treat short height in some people with Noonan syndrome.

Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Abnormal bleeding or bruising
Buildup of fluid in tissues of body (lymphedema,
cystic hygroma
)
Failure to thrive in infants
Leukemia
and other cancers
Low self-esteem
Infertility in males if both testes are undescended
Problems with the structure and function of the heart
Short height
Social problems due to physical symptoms
When to Contact a Medical Professional
This condition may be found during early infant exams. A geneticist is often needed to diagnose Noonan syndrome.
Prevention
Couples with a personal or family history of Noonan syndrome may want to consider
genetic counseling
before having children.
