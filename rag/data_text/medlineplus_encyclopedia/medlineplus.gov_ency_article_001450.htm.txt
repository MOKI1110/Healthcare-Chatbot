Alopecia areata is a condition that causes round patches of hair loss. It can lead to total hair loss.
Causes
Alopecia areata is thought to be an
autoimmune condition
. This occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy hair follicles.
Some people with this condition have a family history of
alopecia
. Alopecia areata is seen in men, women, and children. In a few people, hair loss may occur after a major life event such as an illness, pregnancy, or trauma.
Symptoms
Hair loss is usually the only symptom. A few people may also feel a burning sensation or itching.
Alopecia areata usually begins as one to several patches of hair loss about 0.4 inches (1 centimeter) to 1.6 in (4 cm). Hair loss is most often seen on the scalp. It may also occur in the beard, eyebrows, pubic hair, and arms or legs in some people. Nail pitting may also occur.
Patches where hair has fallen out are smooth and round in shape. They may be peach-colored. Hairs that look like exclamation points are sometimes seen at the edges of a bald patch with a magnifying tool.
If alopecia areata leads to total hair loss, it often occurs within 6 months after symptoms first start. This is called alopecia totalis when the entire scalp is involved, and alopecia universalis when the entire body is affected.
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms, focusing on areas where you have hair loss.
A scalp
biopsy
may be done. Blood tests may also be done to check for autoimmune conditions and thyroid problems.
Treatment
If hair loss is not widespread, the hair may regrow in a few months without treatment.
For more severe hair loss, it is not clear how much treatment can help change the course of the condition.
Common treatments may include:
Steroid injection under the skin surface
Medicines applied to the skin
Ultraviolet light therapy
JAK inhibitors are a newer treatment that can target the immune response. These are medicines taken in pill form for severe cases of alopecia areata.
A wig may be used to hide areas of hair loss.

Alopecia areata that starts at a young age
Eczema
Long-term alopecia
Widespread or complete loss of scalp or body hair
