Hemochromatosis

Hemochromatosis is a condition in which there is too much iron in the body. It is also called iron overload.
Causes
Hemochromatosis may be a genetic disorder passed down through families.
People with this type absorb too much iron through their digestive tract. Iron builds up in the body. The liver, heart, and pancreas are common organs where iron builds up.
It is present at birth, but may not be diagnosed for years.
Hemochromatosis may also occur as a result of:
Too many
blood transfusions
in a person with blood disorders such as
thalassemia
or certain
anemias
. Over time this may lead to iron overload.
Long-term alcohol use and other health conditions.
This disorder affects more men than women. It is most common in white people of northern European descent.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Abdominal pain
Fatigue, lack of energy, weakness
Generalized darkening of skin color (often referred to as bronzing)
Joint pain
Loss of body hair
Loss of sexual desire
Weight loss
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may show liver and spleen swelling, and skin color changes.
Blood tests may help make the diagnosis. Tests may include:
Ferritin level
Iron level
Percentage of transferrin saturation (high)
Genetic testing
Other tests may include:
Blood sugar (glucose) level
Alpha fetoprotein
Echocardiogram
to examine the heart's function
Electrocardiogram
(ECG) to look at the electrical activity of the heart
Imaging tests such as
CT scans
,
MRI
, and
ultrasound
Liver function tests
The condition may be confirmed with a
liver biopsy
or genetic testing. If a genetic defect is confirmed, other blood tests can be used to find out if other family members are at risk for iron overload.
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to remove excess iron from the body and treat any organ damage.
A procedure called phlebotomy is the best method for removing excess iron from the body:
One half liter of blood is removed from the body each week until the body's iron stores are depleted. This may take many months to do.
After that, the procedure may be done less often to maintain normal iron stores.
Why the procedure is needed depends on your symptoms and levels of hemoglobin and serum ferritin and how much iron you take in your diet.
For people unable to undergo phlebotomy, medicines may be prescribed to reduce the body's iron.
Other health problems such as diabetes, decreased testosterone levels in men, arthritis, liver failure, and heart failure will be treated.
If you are diagnosed with hemochromatosis, your provider may recommend a diet to reduce how much iron is absorbed through your digestive tract. Your provider may recommend the following:
Do not drink alcohol, especially if you have liver damage.
Do not take iron pills or vitamins containing iron.
Do not use iron cookware.
Limit foods fortified with iron, such as 100% iron-fortified breakfast cereals.
Avoid uncooked shellfish.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Untreated, iron overload can lead to liver damage.Â
Extra iron may also build up in other areas of the body, including the thyroid gland, testicles, pancreas, pituitary gland, heart, or joints. Early treatment can help prevent complications such as liver disease, heart disease,
arthritis
or
diabetes
.
How well you do depends on the amount of organ damage. Some organ damage can be reversed when hemochromatosis is detected early and treated aggressively with phlebotomy.
Possible Complications
Complications include:
Cirrhosis
Liver failure
Liver cancer
The disease may lead to the development of:
Arthritis
Diabetes
Heart problems
Increased risk for certain bacterial infections
Testicular atrophy
Skin color changes
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if symptoms of hemochromatosis develop.
Contact your provider for an appointment (for screening) if a family member has been diagnosed with hemochromatosis.
Prevention
Screening family members of a person diagnosed with hemochromatosis may detect the disease early so that treatment can be started before organ damage has occurred in other affected relatives.
