Interstitial cystitis
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Interstitial cystitis (IC) is a long-term (chronic) problem in which pain, pressure, or burning is present in the bladder. It is often associated with urinary frequency or urgency. It is also called painful bladder syndrome.
Causes
The bladder is a hollow organ that stores urine. It has a thin layer of muscle inside it. When your bladder fills up with urine, it sends a signal to your brain, telling the muscles to squeeze. Under normal conditions, these signals are not painful. If you have interstitial cystitis, the signals from the bladder are painful and may occur even when the bladder is not full.
The condition most often occurs between ages 20 to 40, although it has been reported in younger people.
Women are 10 times more likely to have IC than men.
The exact cause of this condition is unknown.
Symptoms
Symptoms of IC are chronic. Symptoms tend to come and go with periods of lesser or worse severity. Common symptoms include:
Bladder pressure or discomfort (mild to severe)
Urge to urinate often
Burning pain in the pelvic area
Pain during intercourse
Many people who have long-term IC may also have other conditions such as
endometriosis
,
fibromyalgia
,
irritable bowel syndrome
, other chronic pain syndromes, anxiety, or
depression
.
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will look for other causes of your symptoms. These include:
Sexually transmitted infections
Bladder cancer
Bladder infections
Kidney or ureteral stones
Tests are done on your urine to look for infection or cells that suggest cancer inside the bladder. During a cystoscopy, the provider uses a special tube with a small camera on the end to look inside your bladder. A sample or biopsy of the lining of your bladder may be taken.
Tests at your provider's office may also be done to show how well your bladder fills and how well it empties.
Treatment
There is no cure for IC, and there are no standard treatments. Treatment is based on trial and error until you find relief. Results vary from person to person.
DIET AND LIFESTYLE CHANGES
Some people find that making changes in their diet can help control symptoms. Try to avoid foods and beverages that can cause bladder irritation. Stop eating certain foods, one at a time, to see if your symptoms get better. Reduce or stop consuming caffeine, chocolate, carbonated beverages, citrus drinks, and spicy or acidic foods (such as those with high levels of vitamin C).
Other foods that the
Interstitial Cystitis Association
lists as possibly causing bladder irritation are:
Aged cheeses
Alcohol
Artificial sweeteners
Fava and lima beans
Meats that are cured, processed, smoked, canned, aged, or that contain nitrites
Acidic fruits (except blueberries, honeydew melon, and pears, which are OK.)
Nuts, except almonds, cashews, and pine nuts
Onions
Rye bread
Seasonings that contain MSG
Sour cream
Sourdough bread
Soy
Tea
Tofu
Tomatoes
Yogurt
You and your provider should discuss methods you can use for bladder training. These may include training yourself to urinate at specific times or using pelvic floor physical therapy and biofeedback to relieve pelvic floor muscle tension and spasms.
MEDICINES AND PROCEDURES
Combination therapy may include medicines such as:
Pentosan polysulfate sodium, the only medicine taken by mouth that is approved for treating IC
Tricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, to relieve pain and urinary frequency
Hydroxyzine (Vistaril), an antihistamine that can help reduce inflammation. It can cause sedation as a side effect
Other therapies include:
Over-filling the bladder with fluid while under
general anesthesia
, called bladder hydrodistention
Medicines placed directly into the bladder, including dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), heparin, or lidocaine
Neuromodulation
Bladder removal (cystectomy) for extremely difficult cases, which is rarely done

Outlook (Prognosis)
Treatment results vary. Some people respond well to simple treatments and dietary changes. Others may require extensive treatments or surgery.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of IC. Be sure to mention that you suspect this disorder. It is not always easily recognized or diagnosed. It is often confused with having repeated urinary tract infection.
