Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a disorder that involves involuntary movements. Tardive means delayed and dyskinesia means abnormal movement.
Causes
TD is a serious side effect that may occur when you take medicines called neuroleptics. These medicines are also called antipsychotics or major tranquilizers. They are used to treat mental health issues.
TD often occurs when you take the medicine for many months or years. In some cases, it occurs after you take them for as little as 6 weeks.
Medicines that most commonly cause this disorder are older antipsychotics, including:
Chlorpromazine
Fluphenazine
Haloperidol
Perphenazine
Prochlorperazine
Trifluoperazine
Newer antipsychotics seem less likely to cause TD, but they are not entirely without risk.
Other medicines that can cause TD include:
Metoclopramide (treats stomach problem called
gastroparesis
)
Antidepressant medicines such as amitriptyline, fluoxetine, phenelzine, sertraline, trazodone, lithium
Anti-Parkinson medicines such as levodopa
Anti-seizure medicines such as phenobarbital and phenytoin
Symptoms
Symptoms of TD include uncontrollable movements of the face and body such as:
Facial grimacing (commonly involving lower facial muscles)
Finger movement (piano playing movements)
Rocking or thrusting of the pelvis (duck-like gait)
Jaw swinging
Repetitive chewing
Rapid eye blinking
Tongue thrusting
Restlessness
Treatment
When TD is diagnosed, your health care provider will either have you stop the medicine slowly or switch to another one.
If TD is mild or moderate, various medicines may be tried to treat it. A dopamine-depleting medicine, tetrabenazine is most effective treatment for TD. Valbenazine is an alternative. Your provider can tell you more about these treatments.
If TD is very severe, a procedure called
deep brain stimulation
Â (DBS) may be tried. DBS uses a device called a neurostimulator to deliver electrical signals to the areas of the brain that control movement.
Outlook (Prognosis)
If diagnosed early, TD may be reversed by stopping the medicine that caused the symptoms. Even if the medicine is stopped, the involuntary movements may become permanent, and in some cases, may become worse.
