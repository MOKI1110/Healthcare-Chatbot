Necrotizing soft tissue infection

Necrotizing soft tissue infection is a rare but very severe type of bacterial infection. It can destroy the muscles, skin, and underlying tissue. The word "necrotizing" refers to something that causes body tissue to die.
Causes
Many different types of bacteria can cause this infection. A very severe and usually deadly form of necrotizing soft tissue infection is due to the bacteria
Streptococcus pyogenes
, which is sometimes called "flesh-eating bacteria" or strep.
Necrotizing soft tissue infection develops when the bacteria enters the body, usually through a minor cut or scrape. The bacteria begin to grow and release harmful substances (toxins) that kill tissue and affect blood flow to the area. With flesh-eating strep, the bacteria also make chemicals that block the body's ability to respond to the organism. As the tissue dies, the bacteria enters the blood and rapidly spreads throughout the body.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
A small, red, painful lump or bump on the skin that spreads
A very painful bruise-like area then develops and grows rapidly, sometimes in less than an hour
The center becomes dark and dusky and then turns black and the tissue dies
The skin may break open and ooze fluid
Other symptoms may include:
Feeling ill
Fever
Sweating
Chills
Nausea
Dizziness
Weakness
Shock
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider may be able to diagnose this condition by looking at your skin. Or, the condition may be diagnosed in an operating room by a surgeon.
Tests that may be done include:
Ultrasound
X-ray
or
CT scan
Blood tests
Blood culture
to check for bacteria
An incision of the skin to see if pus is present
Skin tissue biopsy
and culture
Treatment
Treatment is needed right away to prevent death. You'll likely need to stay in the hospital. Treatment includes:
Powerful antibiotics given through a vein (IV)
Surgery to drain the sore and remove dead tissue
Special medicines called donor immunoglobulins (antibodies) to help fight the infection in some cases
Other treatments may include:
Skin grafts after the infection goes away to help your skin heal and look better
Amputation
if the disease spreads through an arm or leg
Hundred percent oxygen at high pressure (
hyperbaric oxygen therapy
) for certain types of bacterial infections
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well you do depends on:
Your overall health (especially if you have diabetes)
How fast you were diagnosed and how quickly you received treatment
The type of bacteria causing the infection
How quickly the infection spreads
How well treatment works
This disease commonly causes scarring and skin deformity.
Death can occur rapidly without proper treatment.
Possible Complications
Complications that may result from this condition include:
Infection that spreads throughout your body, causing a
blood infection
(sepsis), which can be deadly
Scarring and disfigurement
Loss of your ability to use an arm or leg
Death
When to Contact a Medical Professional
This disorder is severe and may be life threatening. Contact your provider right away if symptoms of infection occur around a skin injury, including:
Drainage of pus or blood
Fever
Pain
Redness
Swelling
Prevention
Always clean the skin thoroughly after a cut, scrape, or other skin injury.
