Dissect means to cut or separate tissues. Surgeons dissect tissue during surgery. Most of the time, this is done to remove a part of the body that is thought to be diseased. Pathologists dissect dead bodies. This is part of doing an autopsy to determine the cause of death. Medical students also do dissection on dead bodies to learn human anatomy.
