Osteomalacia

Osteomalacia is softening of the bones. It most often occurs because of a problem that leads to
vitamin D
Â deficiency, which helps your body absorb calcium. Your body needs calcium to maintain the strength and hardness of your bones.
In children, the condition is called
rickets
.
Causes
A lack of the proper amount of calcium in the blood can lead to weak and soft bones. Low blood calcium can be caused by low vitamin D level in the blood.
Vitamin D is absorbed from food or produced by the skin when exposed to sunlight. Lack of vitamin D produced by the skin may occur in people who:
Live in climates with little exposure to sunlight
Must stay indoors
Work indoors during the daylight hours
Wear clothes that cover most of their skin
Have dark skin pigmentation
Use very strong sunscreen
You may not get enough vitamin D from your diet if you:
Are lactose intolerant (have trouble digesting milk products)
Do not eat or drink milk products (more common in older adults)
Follow a vegetarian diet
Are not able to absorb vitamin D well in the intestines, such as after gastric bypass surgery or due to a gastrointestinal disease
Other conditions that may cause osteomalacia include:
Cancer -- rare tumors that cause low phosphate level in the blood
Kidney failure
and
acidosis
Lack of enough phosphates in the diet
Liver disease -- the liver cannot convert vitamin D to its active form
Side effects of medicines used to treat
seizures
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Bone fractures that happen without a significant injury
Muscle weakness
Widespread
bone pain
, especially in the hips
Symptoms may also occur due to a low calcium level. These include:
Numbness
around the mouth
Numbness or tingling of the arms and legs
Spasms or cramps of the hands or feet
Exams and Tests
Blood tests will be done to check vitamin D, creatinine, calcium,
phosphate
, electrolyte, alkaline phosphatase, and parathyroid hormone levels.
Bone x-rays
and a
bone density test
can help detect pseudofractures, bone loss, and bone softening. More importantly, osteomalacia can look like weakening of the bones from
osteoporosis
on bone density testing.
In some cases, a
bone biopsy
will be done to see if bone softening is present.
Treatment
Treatment may involve vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus supplements taken by mouth. People who cannot absorb nutrients well through the intestines may need larger doses of vitamin D and calcium. This includes people who have some types of weight loss surgery.
People with certain conditions may need regular blood tests to monitor blood levels of phosphorus and calcium.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Some people with vitamin deficiency disorders will get better within a few weeks. With treatment, healing should happen within 6 months.
Possible Complications
Symptoms can return.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you have symptoms of osteomalacia, or if you think that you may be at risk for this disorder.
Prevention
Eating a diet rich in vitamin D and calcium and getting sufficient exposure to sunlight can help prevent osteomalacia due to vitamin D deficiency.
Alternative Names
Vitamin D deficiency - osteomalacia; Calcium - osteomalacia
