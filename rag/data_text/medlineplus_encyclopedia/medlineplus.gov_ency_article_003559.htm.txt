Leucine aminopeptidase blood test
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
The leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) test measures how much of this
enzyme
is in your blood.
Your
urine
can also be checked for LAP.
How the Test is Performed
A
blood sample
is needed.
How to Prepare for the Test
You need to fast for 8 hours before the test. This means you can't eat or drink anything during the 8 hours.
How the Test will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.
Why the Test is Performed
LAP is a type of protein called an enzyme. This enzyme is normally found in cells of the liver, bile, blood, urine and the placenta.
Your health care provider may order this test to check if your liver is damaged. Too much LAP is released into your blood when you have a liver tumor or damage to your liver cells.
This test is not done very often. Other tests, such as
gamma-glutamyl transferase
, are as accurate and easier to get.
Normal Results
Normal range is:
Male: 80 to 200 U/mL
Female: 75 to 185 U/mL
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurement methods. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
An abnormal result may be a sign of:
Bile flow from the liver is blocked (
cholestasis
)
Scarring of the liver and poor liver function (
cirrhosis
)
Heart Failure
Inflamed liver (
hepatitis
)
Liver cancer or tumor
Reduced blood flow to the liver (liver ischemia)
Death of liver tissue (
liver necrosis
)
Use of medicines that are toxic to the liver
Risks
There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:
Excessive bleeding
Fainting or feeling lightheaded
Multiple punctures to locate veins
Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
Alternative Names
Serum leucine aminopeptidase; LAP - serum
