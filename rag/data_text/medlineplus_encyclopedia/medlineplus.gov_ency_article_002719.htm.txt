Talcum powder is a powder made from a mineral called talc. Talcum powder poisoning may occur when someone breathes in or swallows talcum powder. This can be by accident or on purpose.

If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the container to the hospital with you, if possible.
The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate.
The person may receive:
Blood and urine tests
Breathing support, including a tube through the mouth into the lungs, and a breathing machine (ventilator)
Chest x-ray
ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)
Fluids through a vein (by IV)
Medicine to treat symptoms
The person may be admitted to the hospital.
Outlook (Prognosis)
How well someone does depends on how much talcum powder they swallowed and how quickly they receive treatment. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery. Breathing in talcum powder can lead to very serious lung problems, even death.
Use caution when using talcum powder on babies. Talc-free baby powder products are available.
Workers who have regularly breathed in talcum powder over long periods of time have developed serious lung damage and cancer.
Injecting heroin that contains talc into a vein may lead to heart and lung infections and serious organ damage, and even death.
