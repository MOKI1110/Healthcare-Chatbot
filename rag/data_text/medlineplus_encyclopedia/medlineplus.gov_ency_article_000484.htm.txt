Glomerulonephritis

Glomerulonephritis is a type of kidney disease in which the part of your kidneys that helps filter waste and fluids from the blood is damaged.
Causes
The filtering unit of the kidney is called the glomerulus. Each kidney has many thousands of glomeruli. The glomeruli help the body get rid of harmful substances.
Glomerulonephritis may be caused by problems with the body's immune system. Often, the exact cause of this condition is unknown.
Damage to the glomeruli causes blood and protein to be lost in the urine.
The condition may develop quickly, and kidney function is lost within weeks or months. This is called rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.
Some people with chronic glomerulonephritis have no history of kidney disease.
The following may increase your risk for this condition:
Blood or lymphatic system disorders
Exposure to hydrocarbon solvents
History of
cancer
Infections such as
strep infections
, viruses, heart infections, or
abscesses
Many conditions cause or increase the risk for glomerulonephritis, including:
Amyloidosis (disorder in which a protein called amyloid builds up in the organs and tissues)
Disorder that affects the glomerular basement membrane, the part of the kidney that helps filter waste and extra fluid from the blood
Blood vessel diseases, such as vasculitis or
polyarteritis
Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis
(scarring of the glomeruli)
Anti-glomerular basement membrane disease
(disorder in which the immune system attacks the glomeruli)
Analgesic nephropathy syndrome
(kidney disease due to heavy use of pain relievers, especially NSAIDs)
Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura
(disease that involves purple spots on the skin, joint pain, gastrointestinal problems and glomerulonephritis)
IgA nephropathy
(disorder in which antibodies called IgA build up in kidney tissue)
Lupus nephritis
(kidney complication of systemic lupus erythematosus)
Membranoproliferative GN
(form of glomerulonephritis due to abnormal buildup of antibodies in the kidneys)
Symptoms
Common symptoms of glomerulonephritis are:
Blood in the urine (dark, rust-colored, or brown urine)
Foamy urine (due to excess protein in the urine)
Swelling (edema) of the face, eyes, ankles, feet, legs, or abdomen
Symptoms may also include the following:
Abdominal pain
Blood in the vomit or stools
Cough
and shortness of breath
Diarrhea
Excessive urination
Fever
General ill feeling,
fatigue
, and loss of appetite
Joint
or
muscle aches
Nosebleed
The symptoms of chronic kidney disease may develop over time.
Chronic kidney failure
symptoms may gradually develop.
Exams and Tests
Because symptoms may develop slowly, the disorder may be discovered when you have an abnormal
urinalysis
during a routine physical or examination for another condition.
Signs of glomerulonephritis can include:
Anemia
High blood pressure
Signs of reduced kidney function
A
kidney biopsy
confirms the diagnosis.
Later, signs of chronic kidney disease may be seen, including:
Nerve inflammation (polyneuropathy)
Signs of fluid overload, including abnormal heart and lung sounds
Swelling (
edema
)
Imaging tests that may be done include:
Abdominal CT scan
Kidney ultrasound
Chest x-ray
Intravenous pyelogram (
IVP
)
Urinalysis and other urine tests include:
Creatinine clearance
Examination of the urine under a microscope
Uric acid in the urine
Urine concentration test
Urine creatinine
Urine protein
Urine RBC
Urine specific gravity
Urine osmolality
This disease may also cause abnormal results on the following blood tests:
Albumin
Antiglomerular basement membrane
antibody test
Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs)
Antinuclear antibodies
BUN
and
creatinine
Complement
levels
Uric acid
Treatment
Treatment depends on the cause of the disorder, and the type and severity of symptoms. Controlling high blood pressure is usually an important part of treatment.
Medicines that may be prescribed include:
Blood pressure drugs, most often angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)
Corticosteroids
Drugs that suppress the immune system
A procedure called plasmapheresis may sometimes be used for glomerulonephritis caused by immune system problems. The fluid part of the blood that contains
antibodies
is removed and replaced with intravenous fluids or donated plasma (that does not contain antibodies). Removing antibodies may reduce inflammation in the kidney tissues.
You may need to limit your intake of sodium, fluids, protein, and other substances.
People with this condition should be closely watched for signs of kidney failure.
Dialysis
or a
kidney transplant
may eventually be needed.

Outlook (Prognosis)
Glomerulonephritis may be temporary and reversible, or it may get worse. Progressive glomerulonephritis may lead to:
Chronic kidney failure
Reduced kidney function
End-stage kidney disease
If you have nephrotic syndrome and it can be controlled, you may also be able to control other symptoms. If it cannot be controlled, you may develop end-stage kidney disease.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if:
You have a condition that increases your risk for glomerulonephritis
You develop symptoms of glomerulonephritis
Prevention
Most cases of glomerulonephritis can't be prevented. Some cases may be prevented by avoiding or limiting exposure to organic solvents, mercury, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).
