Canavan disease is a condition that affects how the body breaks down and uses
aspartic acid
.
Causes
Canavan disease is passed down (inherited) through families. It is more common among the Ashkenazi Jewish population than in the general population.
The lack of the enzyme aspartoacylase leads to a buildup of material called N-acetylaspartic acid in the brain. This causes the
white matter of the brain
to break down.
There are two forms of the disease:
Neonatal (infantile) -- This is the most common form. Symptoms are severe. Babies seem to be normal the first few months after birth. By 3 to 5 months, they have developmental problems, such as those mentioned below under the Symptoms section of this article.
Juvenile -- This is a less common form. Symptoms are mild. Developmental problems are less severe than those of the neonatal form. In some cases, the symptoms are so mild that they go undiagnosed as Canavan disease.
Symptoms
Symptoms often begin in the first year of life. Parents tend to notice it when their child is not reaching certain developmental milestones, including head control.
Symptoms include:
Abnormal posture with flexed arms and straight legs
Food material flows back into the nose
Feeding problems
Increasing head size
Irritability
Poor muscle tone
, especially of the neck muscles
A lack of head control when baby is pulled from a lying to a sitting position
Poor visual tracking, or blindness
Reflux
(gastrointestinal) with vomiting
Seizures
Severe intellectual disability
Swallowing difficulties
Exams and Tests
A physical exam may show:
Exaggerated reflexes
Joint stiffness
Loss of tissue in the optic nerve of the eye
Tests for this condition include:
Blood chemistry
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) chemistry
Genetic testing for aspartoacylase gene mutations
Head CT scan
Head MRI scan
Urine or blood chemistry for elevated aspartic acid
DNA analysis
Treatment
There is no specific treatment available. Supportive care is very important to ease the symptoms of the disease. Lithium and gene therapy are being studied.

Outlook (Prognosis)
With Canavan disease, the
central nervous system
breaks down. People are likely to become disabled.
Those with the neonatal form often do not live beyond childhood. Some children may live into their teens. Those with the juvenile form often live a normal lifespan.
Possible Complications
This disorder may cause severe disabilities such as:
Blindness
Inability to walk
Intellectual disability
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if your child has any symptoms of Canavan disease.
Prevention
Genetic counseling is recommended for people who want to have children and have a family history of Canavan disease. Counseling should be considered if both parents are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. For this group, DNA testing can almost always tell if the parents are carriers.
A diagnosis may be made before the baby is born (prenatal diagnosis) by testing the
amniotic fluid
, the fluid that surrounds the womb.
Alternative Names
Spongy degeneration of the brain; Aspartoacylase deficiency; Canavan - van Bogaert disease
