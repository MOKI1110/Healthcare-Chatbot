Multiple mononeuropathy is a nervous system disorder that involves damage to at least two separate nerve areas. Neuropathy means damage to a peripheral nerve.
Causes
Multiple mononeuropathy is due to damage to one or more peripheral nerves. These are the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. It is a group of symptoms (syndrome), not a disease.
However, certain diseases can cause the injury or nerve damage that leads to the symptoms of multiple mononeuropathy. Common conditions include:
Blood vessel diseases such as
polyarteritis nodosa
Connective tissue diseases such as
rheumatoid arthritis
or
systemic lupus erythematosus
(the most common cause in children)
Diabetes
Hereditary causes that predispose to nerve injury (such as hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsy)
Less common causes include:
Amyloidosis
, an abnormal buildup of proteins in tissues and organs
Blood disorders (such as hypereosinophilia and cryoglobulinemia)
Infections such as
Lyme disease
, HIV/AIDS, or
hepatitis
Leprosy
Sarcoidosis
, which also may cause inflammation of the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, eyes, skin, or other tissues
SjÃ¶gren syndrome
, a disorder in which the glands that produce tears and saliva are destroyed
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis
, an inflammation of the blood vessel
Symptoms
Symptoms depend on the specific nerves involved, and may include:
Loss of bladder or bowel control
Loss of sensation in one or more areas of the body
Paralysis
in one or more areas of the body
Tingling, burning, pain, or other abnormal sensations in one or more areas of the body
Weakness in one or more areas of the body
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms, focusing on the nervous system.
To diagnose this syndrome, there usually needs to be problems with two or more unrelated nerve areas. Common nerves affected are the:
Axillary nerve
in either arm or shoulder
Common peroneal nerve
in the lower leg
Distal median nerve
to the hand
Femoral nerve
in the thigh
Radial nerve
in the arm
Sciatic nerve
in the back of the leg
Ulnar nerve
in the arm
Tests may include:
Electromyogram
(EMG, a recording of electrical activity in the muscles)
Nerve biopsy
to examine a piece of the nerve under a microscope
Nerve conduction tests
to measure how fast nerve impulses move along the nerve
Imaging tests, such as
x-rays
Blood tests that may be done include:
Antinuclear antibody panel
(ANA)
Blood chemistry tests
C-reactive protein
Imaging scans
Pregnancy test
Rheumatoid factor
Sedimentation rate
Thyroid tests
X-rays
Treatment
The goals of treatment are to:
Treat the illness that is causing the problem, if possible
Provide supportive care to maintain independence
Control symptoms
To improve independence, treatments may include:
Occupational therapy
Orthopedic help (for example, a wheelchair, braces, and splints)
Physical therapy (for example, exercises and retraining to increase muscle strength)
Vocational therapy
Safety is important for people with sensation or movement problems. Lack of muscle control and decreased sensation may increase the risk for falls or injuries. Safety measures include:
Having adequate lighting (such as leaving lights on at night)
Installing railings
Removing obstacles (such as loose rugs that may slip on the floor)
Testing water temperature before bathing
Wearing protective shoes (no open toes or high heels)
Check shoes often for grit or rough spots that may injure the feet.
People with decreased sensation should check their feet (or other affected area) often for bruises, open skin areas, or other injuries that may go unnoticed. These injuries may become severely damaged or infected because the pain nerves of the area are not signaling the injury.
People with multiple mononeuropathy may be prone to new nerve injuries at pressure points such as the knees and elbows. They should avoid putting pressure on these areas, for example, by not leaning on the elbows, crossing the knees, or holding similar positions for long periods. Some people may benefit from pads on the elbows or knees.
Medicines that may help include:
Over-the-counter or prescription pain medicines
Antiseizure or antidepressant medicines to reduce stabbing pains
Depending on the cause, surgery may be recommended to reduce pressure on nerves.
Outlook (Prognosis)
A full recovery is possible if the cause is found and treated, and if the nerve damage is limited. Some people have no disability. Others have a partial or complete loss of movement, function, or sensation.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Deformity, loss of tissue or muscle mass
Disturbances of organ functions
Medicine side effects
Repeated or unnoticed injury to the affected area due to lack of sensation
Relationship problems due to
erectile dysfunction
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you notice signs of multiple mononeuropathy.
Prevention
Preventive measures depend on the specific disorder. For example, with diabetes, eating healthy foods and keeping a tight control of blood sugar may help prevent multiple mononeuropathy from developing.
