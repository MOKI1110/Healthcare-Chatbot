Celiac disease - nutritional considerations
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Celiac disease is an immune disorder passed down through families.
Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, or rye. It may also be found in some medicines. When a person with
celiac disease
eats or drinks anything containing gluten, the immune system responds by damaging the lining of the small intestine. This affects the body's ability to absorb nutrients.
Carefully following a gluten-free diet helps prevent symptoms of the disease.
Food Sources
To follow a gluten-free diet means, you need to avoid all foods, drinks, and medicines made with gluten. This means not eating anything made with barley, rye, and wheat. All items made with all-purpose, white, or wheat flour should be eliminated from the diet.
FOODS YOU CAN EAT
Beans
Cereals made without wheat or barley malt
Corn
Fruits and vegetables
Meat, poultry, and fish (not breaded or made with regular gravies)
Milk-based items
Gluten-free oats
Potatoes
Rice
Gluten-free products such as crackers, pasta, and breads
Common sources of gluten include:
Breaded foods
Breads, bagels, croissants, and buns
Cakes, donuts, and pies
Cereals (most)
Crackers and many snacks bought at the store, such as potato chips and tortilla chips
Gravy
Pancakes and waffles
Pasta and pizza (other than gluten-free pasta and pizza crust)
Soups (most)
Stuffing
Less obvious foods that must be eliminated if they contain gluten include:
Beer
Candies (some)
Cold cuts, hot dogs, salami or sausage
Communion breads
Croutons
Some marinades, sauces, soy, and teriyaki sauces
Salad dressings (some)
Self-basting turkey
There is a risk for cross-contamination of foods. Items that are naturally gluten-free may become contaminated if they are made on the same production line, or moved together in the same place, as foods containing gluten.
Eating at restaurants, work, school, and social gatherings can be challenging. Call ahead and plan. Due to the widespread use of wheat and barley in foods, it is important to read labels before buying food or eating.
Despite its challenges, maintaining a healthy, balanced gluten-free diet is possible with education and planning.
Recommendations
Talk to a registered dietitian who specializes in celiac disease and the gluten-free diet to help you plan your diet. This is especially helpful because gluten contamination can happen even if a restaurant or label assures you a product is gluten-free. A dietician can help recommend products that will be safe.
You may also want to join a
local support group
. These groups can help people with celiac disease share practical advice on ingredients, baking, and ways to cope with this life-altering, lifelong disease.
Your health care provider might suggest you take a multivitamin and mineral or an individual nutrient supplement to correct or prevent a deficiency.
