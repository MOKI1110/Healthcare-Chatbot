Abnormal tooth color is any color other than white to yellowish-white.
Considerations
Many things can cause teeth to become discolored. The change in color may affect the entire tooth, or it may appear as spots or lines in the tooth enamel. Enamel is the hard outer layer of the tooth. The discoloration can be either temporary or permanent. It may also appear on many teeth or only one area.
Your genes affect your tooth color. Other things that can affect tooth color include:
Diseases that are present at birth
Environmental factors
Infections
Inherited diseases may affect the thickness of enamel or the calcium or protein content of the enamel. This can cause color changes. Metabolic diseases may cause changes in tooth color and shape.
Drugs and medicines taken by a mother during pregnancy or by a child during the time of tooth development can cause changes in the color and hardness of the enamel.
Causes
Some things that can cause teeth to become discolored are:
Antibiotic tetracycline use before age 8
Eating or drinking items that temporarily stain the teeth, such as tea, coffee, red wine, or iron-containing liquids
Smoking and chewing tobacco
Genetic defects that affect the tooth enamel, such as dentinogenesis and
amelogenesis
High
fever
at an age when teeth are forming
Poor oral care
Tooth nerve damage
Porphyria
(a group of disorders caused by a buildup of natural chemicals in the body)
Severe neonatal jaundice
Too much fluoride from environmental sources (naturally high water fluoride levels) or ingestion of fluoride rinses, toothpaste, and high amount of fluoride supplements
Home Care
Good oral hygiene will help if teeth are stained from a food or fluid, or if they are discolored due to poor cleaning.
Talk to your dentist about abnormal tooth color. However, if the color seems to be related to a medical condition, you should talk to your regular health care provider as well.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
Your teeth are an abnormal color without an apparent cause
Abnormal tooth color lasts, even after cleaning your teeth well
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your dentist will examine your teeth and ask about your symptoms. Questions may include topics such as:
When the discoloration began
Foods you have been eating
Medicines you are taking
Personal and family health history
Exposure to fluoride
Oral care habits such as not brushing enough or brushing too aggressively
Other symptoms you may have
Diet-related discoloration and discoloration that is only on the surface may be eliminated with proper oral hygiene or teeth-whitening systems. More severe discoloration may need to be masked using fillings, veneers, or crowns.
Testing may not be necessary in many cases. However, if your provider suspects the discoloration may be related to a medical condition, testing may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.
Dental x-rays may be taken.
Alternative Names
