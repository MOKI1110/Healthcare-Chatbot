Urine immunoelectrophoresis is a lab test that measures immunoglobulins in a urine sample.
Immunoglobulins are proteins that function as
antibodies
, which fight infection.Â There are many types of immunoglobulins that fight different types of infections. Some immunoglobulins can be abnormal and may be due to some types of
cancer
.
Immunoglobulins can also be measured in the
blood
.
How the Test is Performed
A
clean-catch urine sample
is needed. The clean-catch method is used to prevent germs from the penis or vagina from getting into a urine sample. To collect your urine, your health care provider may give you a special clean-catch kit that contains a cleansing solution and sterile wipes. Follow instructions exactly.
After you provide a urine sample, it is sent to the lab. There, a lab specialist will place the urine sample on special paper and apply an electric current. The various proteins move and form visible bands, which reveal the amounts of each protein.
How to Prepare for the Test
Your provider may ask you to collect the first morning urine, which is the most concentrated.
If you are taking the collection from an infant, you may need extra collection bags.
How the Test will Feel
The test involves only normal urination, and there is no discomfort.
Why the Test is Performed
This test is used to measure the amounts of various immunoglobulins in urine. Most often, it is done after a large amount of protein is found in the urine.
Normal Results
Normally there is no protein, or only a small amount of protein in the urine. When there is protein in the urine, it normally consists of mainly albumin.
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Immunoglobulin in the urine can result from:
Amyloidosis
(buildup of abnormal proteins in tissues and organs)
Leukemia
(cancer of the bone marrow)
WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia
(a type of lymphoma)
Lymphoma (cancer of the lymph tissue)
Monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS, a type of blood disorder)
Multiple myeloma
(a type of blood cancer)
Other cancers
Infection
Kidney disorders such as
IgA nephropathy
or IgM nephropathy
Some people have monoclonal immunoglobulins, but do not have cancer. This is called monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance, or MGUS.
Risks
There are no risks with this test.
