Rhabdomyolysis is the breakdown of muscle tissue that leads to the release of muscle fiber contents into the blood. These substances are harmful to the kidney and often cause kidney damage.
Causes
When muscle is damaged, a protein called myoglobin is released into the bloodstream. It is then filtered out of the body by the kidneys. Myoglobin breaks down into substances that can damage kidney cells.
Rhabdomyolysis may be caused by injury or any other condition that damages skeletal muscle.
Problems that may lead to this disease include:
Trauma or crush injuries
Use of drugs or medicines such as
cocaine
, amphetamines, statins,
heroin
, or PCP
Genetic muscle diseases
Extremes of body temperature
Ischemia or death of muscle tissue
Low phosphate levels
Seizures
or muscle tremors
Severe exertion, such as marathon running or calisthenics
Lengthy surgical procedures
Severe dehydration
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
Dark, red, or cola-colored urine
Decreased urine output
General weakness
Muscle stiffness or aching (
myalgia
)
Muscle tenderness
Weakness
of the affected muscles
Other symptoms that may occur with this disease:
Fatigue
Joint pain
Seizures
Weight gain (unintentional)
Exams and Tests
A physical exam will show tender or damaged skeletal muscles.
The following tests may be done:
Creatine kinase
(CK) level
Serum calcium
Serum myoglobin
Serum potassium
Urinalysis
Urine myoglobin
test
This disease may also affect the results of the following tests:
CK isoenzymes
Serum creatinine
Urine creatinine
Treatment
You will need to get fluids containing bicarbonate to help prevent kidney damage. You may need to get fluids through a vein (IV). Some people may need kidney dialysis.
Your health care provider may prescribe medicines including diuretics and bicarbonate (if there is enough urine output).
Hyperkalemia
and low blood calcium levels (hypocalcemia) should be treated right away.
Kidney failure
should also be treated.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome depends on the amount of
kidney damage
. Acute kidney failure occurs in many people. Getting treated soon after rhabdomyolysis will reduce the risk of permanent kidney damage.
People with milder cases may return to their normal activities within a few weeks to a month. However, some people continue to have problems with fatigue and muscle pain.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Acute tubular necrosis
Acute renal failure
Harmful chemical imbalances in the blood
Shock
(low blood pressure)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of rhabdomyolysis.
Prevention
Rhabdomyolysis can be avoided by:
Avoiding drugs or medicines that may cause rhabdomyolysis.
Drinking plenty of fluids after strenuous exercise.
Removing extra clothes and immersing the body in cold water in case of heat stroke.
