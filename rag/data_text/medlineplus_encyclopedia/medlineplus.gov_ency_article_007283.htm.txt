A venogram is a way to look at veins in your body. It uses
x-rays
and a radiographic contrast material. It is most often used to look at veins in the legs and belly area (abdomen).
Veins are not normally seen in an x-ray. That is why the contrast material is used. The health care provider injects this dye into a vein so it shows up better on x-rays.
