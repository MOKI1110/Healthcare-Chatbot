Agitation
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Agitation is an unpleasant state of extreme arousal. An agitated person may feel stirred up, excited, tense, confused, or irritable.
Considerations
Agitation can come on suddenly or over time. It can last for a few minutes, for weeks, or even months. Pain, stress, and
fever
can all increase agitation.
Agitation by itself may not be a sign of a health problem. But if other symptoms occur, it can be a sign of disease.
Agitation with a change in alertness (altered consciousness) can be a sign of
delirium
. Delirium has a medical cause and should be checked by your health care provider right away.
Causes
There are many causes of agitation. Some of them are:
Alcohol intoxication or
withdrawal
Allergic reaction
Caffeine intoxication
Certain forms of heart, lung, liver, or kidney disease
Intoxication or withdrawal from drugs of abuse (such as cocaine, marijuana, hallucinogens, PCP, or opiods)
Hospitalization (older adults often have delirium while in the hospital)
Overactive thyroid gland (
hyperthyroidism
)
Infection (especially in elderly people)
Nicotine withdrawal
Poisoning (for example, carbon monoxide poisoning)
Some medicines, including theophylline, amphetamines, and steroids
Trauma
Vitamin B6
deficiency
Agitation can occur with brain and mental health disorders, such as:
Anxiety
Dementia
(such as
Alzheimer disease
)
Depression
Mania
Schizophrenia
Home Care
The most important way to deal with agitation is to find and treat the cause. Agitation may lead to an increased risk of
suicide
and other forms of violence.
After treating the cause, the following measures can reduce agitation:
A calm environment
Enough lighting during the day and darkness at night
Medicines such as benzodiazepines, and in some cases, antipsychotics
Plenty of sleep
Do not physically hold back an agitated person, if possible. This usually makes the problem worse. Use restraints only if the person is at risk of harming themselves or others, and there is no other way to control their behavior.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider for agitation that:
Lasts a long time
Is very severe
Occurs with thoughts or actions of hurting yourself or others
Occurs with other, unexplained symptoms
If you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat
988lifeline.org
. You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night.
You can also call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the hospital emergency room. DO NOT delay.
If someone you know has attempted suicide, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. DO NOT leave the person alone, even after you have called for help.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will take a medical history and do a physical exam. To better understand your agitation, your provider may ask you specific things about your agitation.
Tests may include:
Blood tests (such as a
complete blood count
, infection screening, thyroid tests, or vitamin levels)
Head CT
or
head MRI
scan
Lumbar puncture
(spinal tap)
Urine tests (for infection screening, drug screening)
Vital signs
(temperature,
pulse
, breathing rate, blood pressure)
Treatment depends on the cause of your agitation.
