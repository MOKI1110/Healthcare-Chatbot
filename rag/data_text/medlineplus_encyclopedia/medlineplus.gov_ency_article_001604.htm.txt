Kwashiorkor is a form of
malnutrition
that occurs when there is not enough
protein
in the diet.
Causes
Kwashiorkor is most common in areas where there is:
Famine
Limited food supply
Low levels of education (when people do not understand how to eat a proper diet)
This disease is more common in very poor countries. It may occur during:
Drought or other natural disaster
Political unrest
These events often lead to a lack of food, causing malnutrition.
Kwashiorkor is rare in children in the United States. There are only isolated cases. However, one government estimate suggests that as many as half of older age people living in nursing homes in the United States do not get enough protein in their diet.
When kwashiorkor does occur in the United States, it is most often a sign of
child abuse
and severe neglect.
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Changes in
skin pigment
Decreased muscle mass
Diarrhea
Failure to gain weight and grow
Fatigue
Hair changes (change in color or texture)
Increased and more severe infections due to damaged immune system
Irritability
Large belly that sticks out (protrudes)
Lethargy
or apathy
Loss of muscle mass
Rash (dermatitis)
Shock (late stage)
Swelling (
edema
)
Exams and Tests
The
physical exam
may show an enlarged liver (
hepatomegaly
) and general bodily swelling.
Tests may include:
Arterial blood gas
BUN
Complete blood count
(CBC)
Creatinine clearance
Serum creatinine
Serum potassium
Total protein
levels
Urinalysis
Treatment
People who start early treatment can recover fully. The goal is to get more calories and protein into their diet. Children with the disease cannot reach their complete height and growth.
Calories are given first in the form of
carbohydrates
,
simple sugars
, and fats. Proteins are started after other sources of calories have already provided energy. Vitamin and mineral supplements will be given.
Food must be restarted slowly since the person has been without much food for a long period of time. Suddenly eating high-calorie foods can cause problems.
Many malnourished children will develop intolerance to milk sugar (
lactose intolerance
). They will need to be given supplements with the
enzyme
lactase so that they can tolerate milk products.
People who are in shock need treatment right away to restore blood volume and maintain blood pressure.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Getting treatment early generally leads to good results. Treating kwashiorkor in its late stages will improve the child's general health. However, the child may be left with permanent physical and mental problems. If treatment is not given or comes too late, this condition is life threatening.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Coma
Permanent mental and physical disability
Shock
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if your child has symptoms of kwashiorkor.
Prevention
To prevent kwashiorkor, make sure your diet has enough carbohydrates, fat (at least 10% of total calories), and protein (12% of total calories).
Alternative Names
