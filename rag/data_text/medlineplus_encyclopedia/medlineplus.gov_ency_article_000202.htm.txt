Myocardial contusion is a bruise of the heart muscle.
Causes
The most common causes are:
Car crashes
Getting hit by a car
Cardiopulmonary resuscitation
(CPR)
Falling from a height, most often greater than 20 feet (6 meters)
Symptoms
A severe myocardial contusion may lead to signs and symptoms of a heart attack.
Symptoms can include:
Pain in the front of the ribs or breastbone
Feeling that your heart is racing
Lightheadedness
Nausea or vomiting
Shortness of breath
Weakness
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may show:
Bruise or scrapes on the chest wall
Crunching sensation when touching the skin if there are rib fractures and puncture of the lung
Fast heartbeat
Irregular heartbeat
Low blood pressure
Rapid or shallow breathing
Tenderness to the touch
Abnormal chest wall movement from rib fractures
Tests may include:
Blood tests (cardiac enzymes, such as Troponin-I or T or CKMB)
Chest x-ray
CT scan of the chest
Electrocardiogram
(ECG)
Echocardiogram
These tests may show:
Problems with the heart wall and the ability for the heart to contract
Fluid or blood in the thin sac surrounding the heart (pericardium)
Rib fractures, lung or blood vessel injury
Problem with the heart's electrical signaling (such as a bundle branch block or other heart block)
Fast heartbeat starting at the sinus node of the heart (sinus
tachycardia
)
Abnormal heartbeat starting in the ventricles or lower chambers of the heart (ventricular dysrhythmia)
Treatment
In most cases, you will be closely monitored for at least 24 hours. An ECG will be done continually to check your heart beat and function.
Emergency room treatment may include:
Catheter placement through a vein (IV)
Medicines to relieve pain, heart rate disturbances, or low blood pressure
Pacemaker (temporary, may be permanent later)
Oxygen
Other therapies may be used to treat a heart injury, include:
Chest tube placement
Draining blood from around the heart
Surgery to repair blood vessels in the chest
Outlook (Prognosis)
People with a mild myocardial contusion will recover completely most of the time.
Serious heart injuries can increase your risk for heart failure or heart rhythm problems.
Prevention
The following safety tips may help prevent a heart bruise:
Wear a seat belt when driving.
Choose a car with air bags.
Take steps to ensure safety when working at heights.
