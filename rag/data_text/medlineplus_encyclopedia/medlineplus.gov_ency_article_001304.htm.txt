Bleeding disorders
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Bleeding disorders are a group of conditions in which there is a problem with the body's blood clotting process. These disorders can lead to heavy and prolonged bleeding after an injury or surgery. Bleeding can also begin on its own and may be difficult to stop.
Specific bleeding disorders include:
Acquired platelet function defects
Congenital platelet function defects
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
Prothrombin deficiency
Factor V deficiency
Factor VII deficiency
Factor X deficiency
Factor XI deficiency (hemophilia C)
Glanzmann disease
Hemophilia A
Hemophilia B
Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)
Von Willebrand disease
(types I, II, and III)
Causes

Blood clotting
Normal blood clotting involves blood particles, called platelets, and as many as 20 different plasma proteins that layer over the platelets. These proteins are known as blood clotting or coagulation factors. These factors interact with other chemicals to form a substance called fibrin that stops bleeding.
Problems can occur when platelets are low in number or do not work properly or when certain coagulation factors are low or missing. Bleeding problems can range from mild to severe.
Some bleeding disorders are present at birth and are passed down through families (inherited). Others develop from:
Illnesses, such as vitamin K deficiency or severe liver disease
Treatments, such as the use of medicines to stop blood clots (anticoagulants) or the long-term use of antibiotics
Bleeding disorders can also result from a problem with the number or function of platelets. These disorders can also be either inherited or develop later (acquired). The side effects of certain medicines can lead to the acquired forms.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Bleeding into joints or muscles
Bruising easily
Heavy bleeding
Heavy menstrual bleeding
Nosebleeds that do not stop easily
Excessive bleeding with surgical procedures
Umbilical cord bleeding after birth
The problems that occur depend on the specific bleeding disorder, and how severe it is.
Exams and Tests
Tests that may be done include:
Complete blood count
(CBC)Â to check the number of platelets
Partial thromboplastin time
(PTT)
Platelet aggregation test
Prothrombin time
(PT)
Thrombin time
Measurement of levels of the different clotting factors
Treatment
Treatment depends on the type of disorder. It may include:
Clotting factor replacement
Fresh frozen plasma transfusion
Platelet transfusion
Other treatments

Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome depends on the disorder. Most primary bleeding disorders can be managed. When the disorder is due to diseases, such as DIC, the outcome will depend on how well the underlying disease can be treated.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Bleeding in the brain
Severe bleeding (usually from the gastrointestinal tract or injuries)
Other complications can occur, depending on the disorder.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you notice any unusual or severe bleeding.
Prevention
Prevention depends on the specific disorder.
