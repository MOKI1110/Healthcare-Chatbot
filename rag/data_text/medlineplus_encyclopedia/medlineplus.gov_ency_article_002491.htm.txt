Ammonium hydroxide poisoning
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Ammonium hydroxide is a colorless liquid chemical solution. It is in a class of substances called caustics. Ammonium hydroxide forms when ammonia dissolves in water. This article discusses poisoning from ammonium hydroxide.
This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.
Poisonous Ingredient
Ammonium hydroxide is poisonous.
Where Found
Ammonium hydroxide is found in many industrial products and cleaners. Some of these are flooring strippers, brick cleaners, and cements.
Ammonium hydroxide can also release ammonia gas into the air.
Ammonia alone (not ammonium hydroxide) can be found in many household items such as detergents, stain removers, bleaches, and dyes. The symptoms and treatment for ammonia exposure are similar to those for ammonium hydroxide.
Other products may also contain ammonium hydroxide and ammonia.
Ammonium hydroxide is used in the illegal production of methamphetamine.
Symptoms
Below are symptoms of ammonia exposure or poisoning in different parts of the body.
AIRWAYS AND LUNGS
Breathing difficulty (if the ammonia is inhaled)
Coughing
Throat swelling (can also cause breathing difficulty)
Wheezing
EYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT
Inability to swallow
Severe pain in the throat
Severe pain or burning in the nose, eyes, ears, lips, or tongue
Vision loss
ESOPHAGUS, STOMACH, AND INTESTINES
Blood in the stool
Burns of the esophagus (food pipe) and stomach
Severe abdominal pain
Vomiting, possibly with blood
HEART AND BLOOD
Collapse
Low blood pressure (develops rapidly)
Severe change in pH (too much or too little acid in the blood, which leads to damage in all of the body organs)
SKIN
Burns
Holes in skin tissue
Irritation
Home Care
Do not make the person throw up.
If ammonium hydroxide is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.
If the person swallowed ammonium hydroxide, give them milk or water right away. You may also give them fruit juice. But, do not give anything to drink if they have symptoms that make it hard to swallow. These include vomiting,
convulsions
, or a
decreased level of alertness
.
If the person breathed in fumes, move them to fresh air right away.
Before Calling Emergency
Have this information ready:
The person's age, weight, and condition
The name of the product (ingredients and strength, if known)
The time it was inhaled, swallowed, or touched the skin
The amount inhaled, swallowed, or on the skin
Poison Control
Your local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.
Your health care provider will measure and monitor your vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.
You may receive:
Breathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the lungs, and breathing machine (ventilator)
Blood and urine tests
Bronchoscopy
-- camera down the throat to view burns in the airways and lungs
Chest x-ray
ECG (
electrocardiogram
)
Endoscopy
-- camera down the throat to view burns in the esophagus and the stomach
Fluids through a vein (IV)
Medicines to treat symptoms
Surgery to remove burned skin (debridement)
Washing of the skin (irrigation), sometimes every few hours for several days
You may need to stay in the hospital overnight.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Survival past 48 hours usually means the person will recover. If the
chemical burned
their eye, permanent blindness will probably occur in that eye.
How well a person does depends on the strength of the chemical and how fast it was diluted and neutralized. Extensive damage to the mouth, throat, eyes, lungs, esophagus, nose, and stomach are possible.
The ultimate outcome depends on how severe the damage is. If the chemical was swallowed, damage to the esophagus and stomach continues to occur for several weeks. Infection and holes (perforation) may result, and surgery may be needed. Some people won't recover and death can occur weeks or months later.
Keep all cleaning materials, caustics, and poisons in their original containers and out of reach of children.
