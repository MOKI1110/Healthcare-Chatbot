Neurocognitive disorder is a general term that describes decreased mental function due to a medical disease other than a psychiatric illness.
Neurocognitive disorders are grouped into three subcategories:
Delirium
.
Mild neurocognitive disorder - some decreased mental function, but able to stay independent and do daily tasks.
Major neurocognitive disorder - decreased mental function and loss of ability to do daily tasks. Also called
dementia
.
Causes
Listed below are conditions associated with neurocognitive disorder.
BRAIN INJURY CAUSED BY TRAUMA
Bleeding into the brain (intracerebral hemorrhage)
Bleeding into the space around the brain (
subarachnoid hemorrhage
)
Blood clot inside the skull but outside the brain and its covering, which may cause pressure on the brain (
subdural hematoma
or
epidural hematoma
)
Concussion
BREATHING CONDITIONS
Low oxygen in the body (hypoxia)
High carbon dioxide level in the body (hypercapnia)
CARDIOVASCULAR DISORDERS
Dementia due to many strokes (
multi-infarct dementia
)
Heart infections (
endocarditis
,
myocarditis
)
Stroke
Transient ischemic attack
Â (TIA)
DEGENERATIVE DISORDERS
Alzheimer disease
(also called senile dementia, Alzheimer type)
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
Diffuse Lewy body disease
Huntington disease
Normal pressure hydrocephalus
Parkinson disease
Pick disease
AUTOIMMUNE DISEASES
Multiple sclerosis
Autoimmune encephalitis
DEMENTIA DUE TO METABOLIC CAUSES
Kidney disease
Liver disease
Thyroid disease (
hyperthyroidism
or
hypothyroidism
)
Vitamin deficiency (B1, B12, or folate)
DRUG AND ALCOHOL-RELATED CONDITIONS
Alcohol withdrawal state
Intoxication from drug or
alcohol use
Medicine effect, such as corticosteroids, sedative-hypnotics, antihistamines, and antidepressants
Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome
, a long-term effect of deficiency of thiamine (vitamin B1)
Withdrawal from medicines, such as sedative-hypnotics and corticosteroids
INFECTIONS
Any sudden onset (
acute
) or long-term (
chronic
) infection
Blood poisoning (
septicemia
)
Brain infection (
encephalitis
)
Meningitis
(infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord)
Prion infections, such as mad cow disease
Late-stage syphilis
Complications of cancer and cancer treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the brain can also lead to neurocognitive disorder.
Other conditions that may mimic neurocognitive disorder include:
Depression
Neurosis
Psychosis
Symptoms
Symptoms can differ based on the disease. In general, neurocognitive disorder causes:
Agitation
Confusion
Long-term loss of brain function (mild cognitive impairment or dementia)
Severe, short-term loss of brain function (delirium)
Exams and Tests
Tests depend on the disorder, but may include:
Blood tests
Neuropsychological testing
Electroencephalogram
(EEG)
Head CT scan
Head MRI
Â
Lumbar puncture
(spinal tap)
Treatment
Treatment depends on the underlying condition. Many conditions are treated mainly with rehabilitation and supportive care to help the person with activities lost due to areas where brain function is affected.
Medicines may be needed to reduce aggressive behaviors that can occur with some of the conditions.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Some disorders are short-term and reversible. But many are long-term or get worse over time.
Possible Complications
People with neurocognitive disorder often lose the ability to interact with others or function on their own.
