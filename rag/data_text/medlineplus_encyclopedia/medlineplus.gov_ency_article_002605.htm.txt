Calcium carbonate is commonly found in antacids (for heartburn) and some dietary supplements. Calcium carbonate overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of a product containing this substance. This can be by accident or on purpose.
This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.
Your provider will measure and monitor your vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.

Blood and urine tests
Chest x-ray
CT scan (advanced imaging) of the brain for neurologic symptomsÂ
Electrocardiogram

Outlook (Prognosis)
Calcium carbonate is not very poisonous. Few people die from an antacid overdose, and recovery is quite likely. However, high calcium levels can cause serious heart rhythm disturbances, as well as kidney stones and damage to kidney function. Long-term overuse is often more serious than a single overdose.
Always keep all medicines in child-proof bottles and out of the reach of children.
