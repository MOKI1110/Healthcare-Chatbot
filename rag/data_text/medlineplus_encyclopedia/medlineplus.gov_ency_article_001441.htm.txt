A cherry angioma is a noncancerous (
benign
) skin growth made up of blood vessels.
Causes
Cherry angiomas are fairly common skin growths that vary in size. They can occur almost anywhere on the body, but usually develop on the trunk.
They are most common after age 30. The cause is unknown, but they tend to be inherited (genetic).
Symptoms
A cherry angioma is:
Bright cherry-red
Small -- pinhead size to about one quarter inch (0.64 centimeter) in diameter
Smooth, or can stick out from the skin
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will look at the growth on your skin to diagnose a cherry angioma. No further tests are usually necessary. Sometimes a
skin biopsy
is used to confirm the diagnosis.
Treatment
Cherry angiomas usually do not need to be treated. If they affect your appearance or bleed often, they may be removed by:
Burning (electrosurgery or cautery)
Freezing (
cryotherapy
)
Laser
Shave excision
Outlook (Prognosis)
Cherry angiomas are noncancerous. They usually do not harm your health. Removal usually does not cause scarring.
Possible Complications
A cherry angioma may cause:
Bleeding if it is injured
Changes in appearance
Emotional distress

You have symptoms of a cherry angioma and you would like to have it removed
