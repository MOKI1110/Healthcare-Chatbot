Home Care
People with cancer or a chronic illness that causes weight loss need to increase theirÂ
protein
and calorie intake by eating high-calorie, nutritious snacks or several small meals during the day. Liquid protein drinks may be helpful.
Family members should try to supply favorite foods to help stimulate the person's appetite.
Keep a record of what you eat and drink for 24 or more hours. This is called a diet history.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you lose more than 10 pounds or 4.5 kilograms (kg) without trying.
Seek medical help if decreased appetite occurs along with other signs of depression, prescription medicine, illegal drug or alcohol use, or an eating disorder.
For loss of appetite caused by medicines, ask your provider about changing the dosage or medicine. Do not stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will perform a physical exam and will check your height and weight.
You'll be asked about diet and medical history. Questions may include:
Is the decreased appetite severe or mild?
Have you lost any weight? How much?
Is the decreased appetite a new symptom?
If so, did it start after an upsetting event, such as the death of a family member or friend?
What other symptoms are present?
Tests that may be done include imaging tests, such as
x-ray
or
ultrasound
. Blood and urine testsÂ may also be ordered.
In cases of severe malnutrition, nutrients are given through a vein (
intravenously
). This may require a hospital stay.
