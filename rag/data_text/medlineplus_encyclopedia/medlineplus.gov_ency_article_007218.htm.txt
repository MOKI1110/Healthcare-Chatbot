Gangrene is the death of tissue in part of the body.
Causes
Gangrene happens when a body part loses its blood supply. This may happen from injury, an infection, or other causes. You have a higher risk for gangrene if you have:
A serious injury
A blood vessel disease (such as arteriosclerosis, also called hardening of the arteries, in your arms or legs)
Diabetes
A suppressed immune system (for example, from HIV/AIDS or chemotherapy)
Surgery
Symptoms
The symptoms depend on the location and cause of the gangrene. If the skin is involved, or the gangrene is close to the skin, the symptoms may include:
Discoloration (blue or black if skin is affected; red or bronze if the affected area is beneath the skin)
Foul-smelling discharge
Loss of feeling in the area (which may happen after severe pain in the area)
If the affected area is inside your body (such as gangrene of the gallbladder or
gas gangrene
), the symptoms may include:
Confusion
Fever
Gas in tissues beneath the skin
General ill feeling
Low blood pressure
Persistent or severe pain
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider may diagnose gangrene from a physical exam. The following tests and procedures may also be used to diagnose gangrene:
Arteriogram (special x-ray to see any blockages in the blood vessels) to help plan treatment for a blood vessel disease
Blood tests (white blood cell [WBC] count may be high)
CT scan to examine internal organs
Culture of the tissue or fluid from wounds to identify bacterial infection
Examining tissue under the microscope to look for cell death
X-rays
Treatment
Gangrene requires urgent evaluation and treatment. In general, dead tissue should be removed to allow healing of the surrounding living tissue and prevent further infection. Depending on the area that has the gangrene, the person's overall condition, and the cause of the gangrene, treatment may include:
Amputating the body part that has gangrene
An emergency operation to find and remove dead tissue
An operation to improve blood supply to the area
Antibiotics
Repeated operations to remove dead tissue (debridement)
Treatment in the intensive care unit (for severely ill people)
Hyperbaric oxygen therapy
to improve the amount of oxygen in the blood
Outlook (Prognosis)
What to expect depends on:
Where the gangrene is in the body
How much gangrene there is
The person's overall condition
The person may die if:
Treatment is delayed
Gangrene is extensive
The person has other significant medical problems
Possible Complications
Complications depend on:
Where in the body the gangrene is
How much gangrene there is
The cause of the gangrene
The person's overall condition
Complications can include:
Disability from amputation or removal of dead tissue
Prolonged wound healing or the need for reconstructive surgery, such as skin grafting
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider right away if:
A wound does not heal or there are frequent sores in an area
An area of your skin turns blue or black
There is foul-smelling discharge from any wound on your body
You have persistent, unexplained pain in an area
You have persistent, unexplained fever
Prevention
Gangrene may be prevented if it is treated before the tissue damage can't be reversed. Wounds should be treated properly and watched carefully for signs of infection (such as spreading redness, swelling, or drainage) or failure to heal.
People with diabetes or blood vessel disease should routinely examine their feet for any signs of injury, infection, or change in skin color and seek care as needed.
