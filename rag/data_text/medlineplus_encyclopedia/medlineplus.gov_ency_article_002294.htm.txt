Systemic means affecting the entire body, rather than a single organ or body part.
For example, systemic disorders, such as
high blood pressure
, or systemic diseases, such as influenza (theÂ
flu
), affect the entire body.
An infection that is in the bloodstream is called a systemic infection.
An infection that affects only one body part or organ is called a localized infection.
