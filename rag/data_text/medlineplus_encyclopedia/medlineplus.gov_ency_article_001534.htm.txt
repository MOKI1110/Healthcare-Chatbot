Mathematics disorder is a condition in which a child's math ability is far below normal for their age, intelligence, and education.
Causes
Children who have mathematics disorder have trouble with simple mathematical activities, such as counting and adding.
Mathematical disorder may appear with:
Developmental coordination disorder
Developmental reading disorder
Mixed receptive-expressive language disorder
Symptoms
The child may have trouble with math, as well as low scores in math classes and on tests.
Problems the child may have are:
Trouble with reading, writing, and copying numbers
Problems counting and adding numbers, often making simple mistakes
A hard time telling the difference between adding and subtracting
Problems understanding math symbols and word problems
Can't line up numbers properly to add, subtract, or multiply
Can't arrange numbers from smallest to largest, or the opposite
Can't understand graphs
Exams and Tests
Standardized tests can assess the child's math ability. Grades and class performance can also help.
Treatment
The best treatment is special (remedial) education. Computer-based programs may also help.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Early intervention improves the chances of a better outcome.
Possible Complications
The child may have problems in school, including behavior problems and loss of self-esteem. Some children with mathematics disorder become anxious or afraid when given math problems, making the problem even worse.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you have any concerns about your child's development.
Prevention
Recognizing the problem early is important. Treatment may begin as early as kindergarten or elementary school.
