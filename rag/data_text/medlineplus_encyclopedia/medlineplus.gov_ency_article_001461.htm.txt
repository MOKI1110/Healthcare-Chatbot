Hypomelanosis of Ito (HMI) is a very rare birth defect that causes unusual patches of light-colored (
hypopigmented
) skin and may be associated with eye, nervous system, and skeletal problems.
Causes
Health care providers do not know the exact cause of HMI, but they believe it may involve a genetic condition called mosaicism. It is twice as common in girls as in boys.
Symptoms
Skin symptoms are most often visible by the time a child is about 2 years old.
Other symptoms develop as the child grows, and may include:
Crossed eyes
(strabismus)
Hearing problems
Increased body hair (
hirsutism
)
Scoliosis
Seizures
Streaked, whorled or mottled patches of skin on the arms, legs, and middle of the body
Intellectual disability, including
autism spectrum disorder
and learning disability
Mouth or tooth problems
Exams and Tests
Ultraviolet light (
Wood lamp
) examination of the skin lesions may help confirm the diagnosis.
Tests that may be done include any of the following:
CT
or
MRI
scan of the head for a child with seizures and nervous system symptoms
X-rays for a child with skeletal problems
EEG
to measure the electrical activity of the brain in a child with seizures
Genetic testing
Treatment
There is no treatment for the skin patches. Cosmetics or clothing may be used to cover the patches. Seizures, scoliosis, and other problems are treated as needed.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outlook depends on the type and severity of symptoms that develop. In most cases, skin color eventually turns to normal.
Possible Complications
Problems that may result from HMI include:
Discomfort and walking problems due to scoliosis
Emotional distress, related to the physical appearance
Intellectual disability
Injury from seizures
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if your child has an unusual pattern of the color of the skin.Â However, any unusual patterns are likely to have another cause than HMI.
