Genital sores - female

Sores or lesions on the female genitalia or in the vagina may occur for many reasons.
Considerations
Genital sores may be painful or itchy, or may produce no symptoms. Other symptoms that may be present include pain when you urinate or painful sexual intercourse. Depending on the cause, a discharge from the vagina may be present.
Causes
Infections spread through sexual contact can cause these sores:
Genital herpes -- small, painful blisters filled with clear or straw-colored fluid
Genital warts -- flesh-colored spots that are raised or flat, and may look like the top of a cauliflower
Chancroid -- a small bump in the genitals, which becomes an ulcer within a day of its appearance
Syphilis -- small, painless open sore or ulcer (called a chancre) on the genitals
Granuloma inguinale -- small, beefy-red bumps appear on the genitals or around the anus
Lymphogranuloma venereum -- small painless sore on the genitals
Changes that may lead to cancer of the vulva (vulvar dysplasia) may appear as white, red, or brown patches on the vulva. These areas may itch. Skin cancers such as
melanoma
and basal cell and
squamous cell carcinomas
may also be found, but are less common.
Other common causes of genital sores include:
Long-term (chronic) skin disorder that involves red itchy rashes (
atopic dermatitis
)
Skin that becomes red, sore, or inflamed after contact with perfumes, detergents, fabric softeners, feminine sprays, ointments, creams, douches (
contact dermatitis
)
Cysts or
abscesses of the Bartholin
or other glands
Trauma or scratches
Flu-type viruses that can cause genital sores or ulcers in some cases
Inflammation of the hair follicles (folliculitis)
Molluscum contagiosum
Home Care
See a health care provider before treating yourself. Self-treatment may make it harder for your provider to find the source of the problem.
A
sitz bath
may help relieve itching and crusting.
If the sores are caused by a sexually transmitted infection, your sexual partner may need to be tested and treated as well. Do not have any type of sexual activity until your provider says the sores can no longer be spread to others.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you:
Find any unexplained genital sore
Have a change in a genital sore
Have genital itching that does not go away with home care
Think you might have a sexually transmitted infection
Have pelvic pain, fever, vaginal bleeding, or other new symptoms as well as genital sores
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will perform a physical examination. This most often includes a pelvic examination. You will be asked about your symptoms and medical history. Questions may include:
What does the sore look like? Where is it located?
When did you first notice it?
Do you have more than one sore?
Does it hurt or itch? Has it grown bigger?
Have you ever had one before?
How often do you have sexual activity?
Do you have painful urination or pain during sexual intercourse?
Do you have abnormal vaginal drainage?
Has a partner tested positive for an STD or noted similar sores?
Have you shaved or waxed recently?
The following tests may be done:
Complete blood count
(CBC)
Blood differential
Skin or mucosal biopsy
Vaginal or
cervical culture
Microscopic vaginal secretion exam (wet mount)
Treatment may include medicines that you put on the skin or take by mouth. The type of medicine depends on the cause.
