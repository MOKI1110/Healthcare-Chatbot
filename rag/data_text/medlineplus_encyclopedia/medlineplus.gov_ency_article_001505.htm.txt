Premenstrual syndrome

Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) refers to a wide range of symptoms. The symptoms start during the second half of the menstrual cycle (14 or more days after the first day of your last menstrual period). These usually go away 1 to 2 days after the menstrual period starts.
Causes
The exact cause of PMS is not known. Changes in brain hormone levels may play a role. However, this has not been proven. Women with PMS may also respond differently to these hormones.
PMS may be related to social, cultural, biological, and psychological factors.
Most women experience PMS symptoms during their childbearing years. PMS occurs more often in women:
Between their late 20s and 40s
Who have had at least one child
With a personal or family history of
major depression
With a history of
postpartum depression
or an affective mood disorder
The symptoms often get worse in late 30s and 40s as menopause approaches.
Symptoms
The most common symptoms of PMS include:
Bloating
or
feeling gassy
Breast tenderness
Clumsiness
Constipation
or
diarrhea
Food cravings
Headache
Less tolerance for noises and lights
Other symptoms include:
Confusion, trouble concentrating, or forgetfulness
Fatigue
and feeling slow or sluggish
Feelings of sadness, depression, or hopelessness
Feelings of tension, anxiety, or edginess
Irritable, hostile, or aggressive behavior, with outbursts of anger toward self or others
Loss of sex drive (may increase in some women)
Mood swings
Poor judgment
Poor self-image, feelings of guilt, or increased fears
Sleep problems (sleeping too much or too little)
Exams and Tests
There are no specific signs or lab tests that can detect PMS. To rule out other possible causes of symptoms, it is important to have a:
Complete medical history
Physical exam (including pelvic exam)
A symptom calendar carried out over several months can help women identify the most troublesome symptoms. This also helps in confirming the diagnosis of PMS.
Treatment
Keep a daily diary or log for at least 3 months. Record the:
Type of symptoms you have
How severe they are
How long they last
This record will help you and your health care provider find the best treatment.
A healthy
lifestyle is the first step to managing PMS
. For many women, lifestyle approaches are often enough to control symptoms. To manage PMS:
Drink plenty of fluids like water or juice. Do not drink soft drinks, alcohol, or other beverages with caffeine. This will help reduce bloating, fluid retention, and other symptoms.
Eat frequent, small meals. Do not go more than 3 hours between snacks. Avoid overeating.
Eat a balanced diet. Include extra whole grains, vegetables, and fruit in your diet. Limit your intake of salt and sugar.
Your provider may suggest that you take nutritional supplements.
Vitamin B6
, calcium, and magnesium are commonly used. Tryptophan, which is found in dairy products, may also be helpful.
Get regular aerobic exercise throughout the month. This helps in reducing the severity of PMS symptoms. Exercise more often and harder during the weeks when you have PMS.
Try changing your nighttime sleep habits before taking drugs for sleep problems.
Symptoms such as
headache
, backache,
menstrual cramping,
and
breast tenderness
may be treated with:
Aspirin
Ibuprofen
Other NSAIDs
Birth control pills may decrease or increase PMS symptoms.
In severe cases, some medicines used to treat depression may be helpful. Antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often tried first. These have been shown to be very helpful. You may also want to seek the advice of a counselor or therapist.
Other medicines that you may use include:
Anti-anxiety drugs for severe anxiety
Diuretics, which may help with severe fluid retention, which causes bloating, breast tenderness, and weight gain
Outlook (Prognosis)
Most women who are treated for PMS symptoms get good relief.
PMS symptoms may become severe enough to prevent you from functioning normally.
The suicide rate in women with depression is much higher during the second half of the menstrual cycle. Mood disorders need to be diagnosed and treated.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact or make an appointment with your provider if:
PMS does not go away with self-treatment
Your symptoms are so severe that they limit your ability to function
You feel like you want to hurt yourself or others
