Avoidant personality disorder is a mental condition in which a person has a lifelong pattern of feeling very:
Shy
Inadequate
Sensitive to rejection
Causes
Causes of avoidant personality disorder are unknown. Genes or a physical illness that changed the person's appearance may play a role.
Symptoms
People with this disorder cannot stop thinking about their own shortcomings. They form relationships with other people only if they believe they will not be rejected. Loss and rejection are so painful that these people often choose to be lonely rather than trying to connect with others.
A person with avoidant personality disorder may:
Be easily hurt when people criticize or disapprove of them
Hold back too much in intimate relationships
Be reluctant to become involved with people
Avoid activities or jobs that involve contact with others
Be shy in social situations out of fear of doing something wrong
Make potential difficulties seem worse than they are
Hold the view they are not good socially, not as good as other people, or unappealing
Exams and Tests
Avoidant personality disorder is diagnosed based on a psychological evaluation. The health care provider will consider how long and how severe the person's symptoms have been.
Treatment
Talk therapy is considered to be the most effective treatment for this condition. It helps people with this disorder be less sensitive to rejection. Antidepressant medicines may be used in addition.
Outlook (Prognosis)
People with this disorder may develop some ability to relate to others. With treatment this can be improved.
Possible Complications
Without treatment, a person with avoidant personality disorder may lead a life of near or total isolation. They may go on to develop a second mental health disorder, such as a
substance use disorder
or
depression
and may be at higher risk for suicide.
