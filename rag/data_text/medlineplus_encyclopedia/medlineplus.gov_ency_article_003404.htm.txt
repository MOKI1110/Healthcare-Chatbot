Hysterosalpingography
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Hysterosalpingography is a special x-ray using dye to look at the womb (uterus) and fallopian tubes.
How the Test is Performed
This test is done in a radiology department. You will lie on a table beneath an x-ray machine. You will place your feet in stirrups, like you do during a pelvic exam. A tool called a speculum is placed into yourÂ
vagina
.
After the
cervix
is cleaned, the health care provider places a thin tube (catheter) through the cervix. Dye, called contrast, flows through this tube, filling the womb and fallopian tubes. X-rays are taken. The dye makes these areas easier to see on
x-rays
.
How to Prepare for the Test
Your provider may give you antibiotics to take before and after the test. This helps prevent infections. You may also be given medicines to take the day of the procedure to help you relax.
The best time for this test is in the first half of the menstrual cycle. Doing it at this time enables the provider to see uterine cavity and tubes more clearly. It also reduces the risk for infection, and ensures that you are not pregnant.
Tell your provider if you have had an allergic reaction to contrast dye before.
You can eat and drink normally before the test.
How the Test will Feel
You may have some discomfort when the speculum is inserted into your vagina. This is similar to a pelvic exam with a Pap test.
Some women have cramps during or after the test, like those you may get during your period.
You may have some pain if the dye leaks out of the tubes, or if the tubes are blocked.
Why the Test is Performed
This test is done to check for blockages in your fallopian tubes or other problems in your womb and tubes. It is often done as part of an infertility exam. It may also be done after you have your tubes tied to confirm that the tubes are fully blocked after you have had a hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure to prevent pregnancy.
Normal Results
A normal result means everything looks normal. There are no defects.
Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Abnormal results may be due to:
Developmental disorders of the structures of the uterus or fallopian tubes
Scar tissue (adhesions) in the uterus or tubes
Blockage of the fallopian tubes
Presence of foreign bodies
Tumors or polyps in the uterus
Risks
Risks may include:
Allergic reaction to the contrast
Endometrial infection (
endometritis
)
Fallopian tube infection (
salpingitis
)
Perforation of (poking a hole through) the uterus
Considerations
This test should not be performed if you have
pelvic inflammatory disease
(PID) or have unexplained
vaginal bleeding
.
After the test, tell your provider right away if you have any signs or symptoms of infection. These include foul-smelling
vaginal discharge
, pain, or fever. You may need to take antibiotics if this occurs.
