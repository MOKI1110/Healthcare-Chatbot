Peritonsillar abscess is a collection of infected material in the area around the tonsils.
Causes
Peritonsillar abscess is a complication of
tonsillitis
. It is most often caused by a type of bacteria called group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.
Peritonsillar abscess most often occurs in older children, adolescents, and young adults. The condition is rare now that antibiotics are used to treat tonsillitis.
Symptoms
One or both tonsils become infected. The infection may spread to the area around the tonsil. It can then spread down into the neck and chest. Swollen tissues can block the airway. This is a life-threatening medical emergency.
The abscess can break open (rupture) into the throat. The contents of the abscess can travel into the lungs and cause pneumonia.
Symptoms of peritonsillar abscess include:
Fever and chills
Severe throat pain that is usually on one side
Ear pain on the side of the abscess
Difficulty opening the mouth, and pain with opening the mouth
Swallowing problems
Drooling
or inability to swallow saliva
Facial or neck swelling
Fever
Headache
Muffled voice
Tender glands of the jaw and throat
Neck stiffness
Exams and Tests
An exam of the throat often shows swelling on one side and on the roof of the mouth.
The uvula in the back of the throat may be shifted away from the swelling. The neck and throat may be red and swollen on one or both sides.
The following tests may be done:
Aspiration
of the abscess using a needle
CT scan
Fiberoptic endoscopy
to check if the airway is blocked
Treatment
The infection can be treated with antibiotics if it is caught early. If an abscess has developed, it will need to be drained with a needle or by cutting it open. You will be given pain medicine before this is done.
If the infection is very severe, the tonsils will be removed at the same time the abscess is drained, but this is rare. In this case, you will have general anesthesia so you will be asleep and pain-free.Â
Outlook (Prognosis)
In most cases, peritonsillar abscess goes away with treatment. The infection may return in the future.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Airway obstruction
Cellulitis
of the jaw, neck, or chest
Endocarditis
(rare)
Fluid around the lungs (
pleural effusion
)
Inflammation around the heart (
pericarditis
)
Pneumonia
Sepsis
(infection in the blood)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider right away if you have had tonsillitis and you develop symptoms of peritonsillar abscess.
Get medical help right away if you have:
Breathing trouble
High-pitched breathing sounds (stridor)
Retraction of the muscles between the ribs when breathing
Difficulty turning the head
Difficulty swallowing
Prevention
Quick treatment of tonsillitis, especially if it is caused by bacteria, may help prevent this condition.
