Otitis is a term for infection or inflammation of the ear.
Causes
Otitis can affect the inner or outer parts of the ear. The condition can be:
Acute ear infection
-- Starts suddenly and lasts for a short period of time. It is often painful.
Chronic ear infection
-- Occurs when the ear infection does not go away or keeps coming back. It may cause long-term damage to the ear.
Based on location otitis can be:
Otitis externa
(swimmer's ear) -- Involves the outer ear and ear canal. A more severe form can spread into the bones and cartilage around the ear.
Otitis media (ear infection) -- Involves the middle ear, which is located just behind the eardrum.
Otitis media with effusion
-- Occurs when there is thick or sticky fluid behind the eardrum in the middle ear, but there is no ear infection. Also called serous otitis media.
