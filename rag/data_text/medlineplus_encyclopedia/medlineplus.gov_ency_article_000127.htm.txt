Pulmonary aspergilloma is a mass caused by an infection by the fungus aspergillus. It usually grows in preexisting lung cavities. The infection can also appear in the brain, kidney, or other organs.
Causes
Aspergillosis
is an infection caused by the fungus aspergillus. Aspergillomas are formed when the fungus grows in a clump in a lung cavity. The cavity is often created by a previous condition. Cavities in the lung may be caused by diseases such as:
Tuberculosis
Coccidioidomycosis
Cystic fibrosis
Histoplasmosis
Lung
abscess
Lung cancer
Sarcoidosis
The most common species of fungus that causes disease in humans is
Aspergillus fumigatus
.
Aspergillus is a common fungus. It grows on dead leaves, stored grain, bird droppings, compost piles, and other decaying vegetation.
Symptoms
You may not have any symptoms. When symptoms do develop, they can include:
Chest pain
Cough
Coughing up blood
, which can be a life-threatening sign
Fatigue
Fever
Unintentional weight loss
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider may suspect you have a fungal infection after
x-rays
of your lungs show the ball of fungus. Other tests that may be done include:
Biopsy
of lung tissue
Blood test for presence of aspergillus in the body (galactomannan)
Blood test to detect immune response to aspergillus (
aspergillus precipitin
)
Bronchoscopy
or bronchoscopy with lavage
Chest CT
Sputum culture
Treatment
Many people never develop symptoms. Often, no treatment is needed, unless you are coughing up blood.
Sometimes, antifungal medicines may be used.
If you have bleeding in the lungs, your provider may recommend a test to inject dye into the blood vessels (
angiography
) to find the site of bleeding. The bleeding is stopped by either:
Surgery to remove the aspergilloma
A procedure that inserts material into the blood vessels to stop the bleeding (
embolization
)
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome can be good for many people. However, it depends on the severity of the condition and your overall health.
Surgery may be very successful in some cases, but it is complex and can have a high risk of serious complications.
Possible Complications
Complications of pulmonary aspergilloma may include:
Difficulty breathing
that gets worse
Massive bleeding from the lung
Spread of the infection
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you cough up blood, and be sure to mention any other symptoms that have developed.
Prevention
People who have had related lung infections or who have weakened immune systems should try to avoid environments where the aspergillus fungus is found.
