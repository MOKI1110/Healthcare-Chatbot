Intestinal obstruction repair is surgery to relieve a
bowel obstruction
. A bowel obstruction occurs when the contents of the intestines cannot pass through and exit the body. A complete obstruction is a surgical emergency.
Description
Intestinal obstruction repair is done while you are under
general anesthesia
. This means you are asleep and do not feel pain.
Your surgeon makes a cut in your belly to see your intestines. Sometimes, the surgery can be done using a laparoscope, which means smaller cuts are used.
Your surgeon locates the area of your intestine (bowel) that is blocked and unblocks it.
Any damaged parts of your bowel will be repaired or removed. This procedure is called
bowel resection
. If a section is removed, the healthy ends will be reconnected with stitches or staples. Sometimes, when part of the intestine is removed, the ends cannot be reconnected. If this happens, your surgeon will bring one end out through an opening in the abdominal wall. This may be done using a
colostomy
or
ileostomy
.
Why the Procedure is Performed
This procedure is done to relieve a blockage in your intestine. A blockage that lasts for a long time can reduce or block blood flow to the area. This can cause the bowel to die.
Risks
Risks of anesthesia and surgery in general include:
Reactions to medicines
Breathing problems
Bleeding, blood clots, infection
Risks of this procedure:
Bowel obstruction after surgery
Damage to nearby organs in the body
Formation of scar tissue (
adhesions
)
More scar tissue forming in your belly and causing a blockage of your intestines in the future
Opening of the edges of your intestines that are sewn together (anastomotic leak), which may cause life-threatening problems
Problems with the colostomy or ileostomy
Temporary paralysis (freezing up) of the bowel (
paralytic ileus
)
After the Procedure
How long it takes to recover depends on your overall health and the type of operation.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome is usually good if the obstruction is treated before bowel blood flow is affected.
People who have had many abdominal surgeries may form scar tissue. They are more likely to have bowel obstructions in the future.
