Dry mouth

Dry mouth occurs when you don't make enough saliva. This causes your mouth to feel dry and uncomfortable. Dry mouth that is ongoing may be a sign of illness, and can lead to problems with your mouth and teeth.
Considerations
Saliva helps you break down and swallow foods and protects teeth from decay. A lack of saliva may cause a sticky, dry feeling in your mouth and throat. Your saliva may become thick or stringy. Other symptoms may include:
Cracked lips
Dry, rough, or raw tongue
Loss of taste
Sore throat
Burning or tingling sensation in the mouth
Feeling thirsty
Difficulty speaking
Difficulty chewing and swallowing
Too little saliva in your mouth allows acid-producing bacteria to increase. This can lead to:
Bad breath
Increase in dental cavities and gum disease
Increased risk for
yeast infection (thrush)
Mouth sores or infections
Causes
Dry mouth occurs when salivary glands do not produce enough saliva to keep your mouth wet or they stop making it altogether.
Common causes of dry mouth include:
Many medicines, both prescription and over-the-counter, such as antihistamines, decongestants, and medicines for conditions including high blood pressure, anxiety, depression, pain, heart disease, asthma or other respiratory conditions, and epilepsy
Dehydration
Radiation therapy to the head and neck that can damage the salivary glands
Chemotherapy that can affect the production of saliva
Injury to the nerves involved in the production of saliva
Health problems such as
SjÃ¶gren syndrome
, diabetes, HIV/AIDS, Parkinson disease, cystic fibrosis, or Alzheimer disease
Removal of salivary glands due to an infection or tumor
Tobacco use
Drinking alcohol
Street drug use, such as smoking marijuana or using methamphetamine (meth)
You can also get dry mouth if you feel stressed or anxious, breathe through your mouth, or become dehydrated.
Dry mouth is common in older adults. But aging itself does not cause dry mouth. Older adults tend to have more health conditions and take more medicines, which increases the risk of dry mouth.
Home Care
Try these tips to soothe dry mouth symptoms:
Drink plenty of water or fluids to stay hydrated.
Suck on ice chips, frozen grapes, or sugar-free frozen fruit pops to help keep your mouth moist.
Chew sugar-free gum or hard candy to stimulate saliva flow.
Try to breathe through your nose and not your mouth.
Use a humidifier at night when sleeping.
Try over-the-counter artificial saliva or mouth sprays or moisturizers.
Use oral rinses made for dry mouth to help moisten your mouth and maintain oral hygiene.
Making these changes in your diet may help:
Eat soft, easy-to-chew food.
Include cool and bland foods. Avoid hot, spicy and acidic foods.
Eat foods with a high liquid content, such as those with gravy, broth, or a sauce.
Drink liquids with your meals.
Dunk your bread or other hard or crunchy food in a liquid before swallowing.
Cut your food into small pieces to make it easier to chew.
Eat small meals and eat more often.
Certain things can make dry mouth worse, so it's best to avoid:
Sugary drinks
Caffeine from coffee, tea, and soft drinks
Alcohol and alcohol-based mouth washes
Acidic foods such as orange or grapefruit juice
Dry, rough foods that may irritate your tongue or mouth
Tobacco and tobacco products
To take care of your
oral health
:
Floss at least once per day. It is best to floss before brushing.
Use a fluoride toothpaste and brush your teeth with a soft-bristled toothbrush. This helps prevent damage to tooth enamel and gums.
Brush after every meal.
Schedule regular checkups with your dentist. Talk with your dentist about how often to have checkups.
