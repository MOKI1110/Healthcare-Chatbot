CPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It is an emergency life-saving procedure that is done when someone's breathing or heartbeat has stopped. This may happen after a medical emergency, such as an
electric shock
, heart attack, or drowning.
CPR combines rescue breathing and chest compressions.
Rescue breathing provides oxygen to the person's lungs.
Chest compressions keep oxygen-rich blood flowing until the heartbeat and breathing can be restored.
Permanent brain damage or death can occur in as little as 4 minutes if blood flow stops. Therefore, it is very important that blood flow and breathing be continued until trained medical help arrives. Emergency operators at 911 or the local emergency number can guide you through the process.
CPR techniques vary slightly depending on the age or size of the person, including different techniques for
adults and children who have reached puberty
,
children 1 year old until the onset of puberty
, and
infants (babies less than 1 year of age)
.
