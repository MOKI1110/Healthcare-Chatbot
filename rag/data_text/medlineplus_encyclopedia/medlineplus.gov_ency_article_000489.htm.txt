Hepatorenal syndrome is a condition in which there is progressive kidney failure that occurs in a person with
cirrhosis
of the liver. It is a serious complication that can lead to death.
Causes
Hepatorenal syndrome occurs when the kidneys stop working well in people with serious liver problems. Less urine is produced by the body, so waste products that contain nitrogen build up in the bloodstream (
azotemia
).
The disorder occurs in up to 1 in 10 people who are in the hospital with liver failure. It leads to
kidney failure
in people with:
Acute liver failure
Alcoholic
hepatitis
Cirrhosis
Infected abdominal fluid
Â (peritonitis)
Risk factors include:
Blood pressure that falls when a person rises or suddenly changes position (orthostatic hypotension)
Use of medicines called diuretics ("water pills")
Gastrointestinal bleeding
Infection
Recent
abdominal fluid removal
(paracentesis)
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Abdominal swelling due to fluid
(called ascites, a symptom of liver disease)
Mental
confusion
Muscle jerks
Dark-colored urine
Â (a symptom of liver disease)
Decreased urine output
Nausea and vomiting
Weight gain
Yellow skin (jaundice, a symptom of liver disease)
Exams and Tests
This condition is diagnosed after testing to check for other causes of kidney failure.
A physical exam does not detect kidney failure directly. However, the exam will very often show signs of chronic liver disease, such as:
Confusion (often due to
hepatic encephalopathy
)
Excess fluid in the abdomen (ascites)
Jaundice
Other signs of liver failure
Other signs include:
Abnormal reflexes
Smaller testicles
Dull sound in the belly area when tapped with the tips of the fingers
Increased breast tissue in men (gynecomastia)
Sores (lesions) on the skin
The following may be signs of kidney failure:
Very little or no urine output
Fluid retention in the abdomen or extremities
Increased
BUN
and
creatinine
blood levels
Increased
urine specific gravity
and
osmolality
Low
blood sodium
Very low
urine sodium
concentration
The following may be signs of liver failure:
Abnormal
prothrombin time
Â (PT)
Increased blood
ammonia
level
Low
blood albumin
Abdominal ultrasound shows ascites
Signs of
hepatic encephalopathy
(an
EEG
may be done to diagnose this condition)
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to help the liver work better and to make sure the heart is able to pump enough blood to the body.
Treatment is about the same as for kidney failure from any cause. It includes:
Stopping all unnecessary medicines, especially ibuprofen and other NSAIDs, certain antibiotics, and diuretics ("water pills")
Having dialysis to improve symptoms
Taking medicines to improve blood pressure and help your kidneys work better; infusion of albumin may also be helpful
Placing a shunt known as transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) to relieve the symptoms of ascites (This may also help kidney function, but the procedure can be risky.)
Surgery to place a shunt from the abdominal space to the jugular vein to relieve some symptoms of kidney failure (This procedure is risky and is rarely done.)
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome is often poor. Death often occurs due to an infection or severe bleeding (hemorrhage).
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Bleeding
Damage to, and failure of, many organ systems
End-stage kidney disease
Fluid overload and
heart failure
Coma caused by liver failure
Secondary infections
When to Contact a Medical Professional
This disorder most often is diagnosed in the hospital during treatment for a liver disorder.
