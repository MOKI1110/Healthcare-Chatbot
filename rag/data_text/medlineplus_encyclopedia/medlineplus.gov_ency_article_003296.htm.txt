Muscle twitching

Muscle twitches are fine movements of a small area of muscle.
Considerations
Muscle twitching is caused by minor
muscle contractions
in the area, or uncontrollable twitching of a muscle group that is served by a single motor nerve fiber.
Muscle twitches are minor and often go unnoticed. Some are common and normal. Others are signs of a nervous system disorder.
Causes
Causes may include:
Autoimmune disorders
, such as Isaac syndrome.
Drug overdose (caffeine, amphetamines, or other stimulants).
Lack of sleep.
Medicine side effect (such as from diuretics, corticosteroids, or estrogens).
Exercise (twitching is seen after exercise).
Lack of nutrients in the diet (deficiency).
Stress.
Medical conditions that cause metabolic disorders, including low potassium, kidney disease, and uremia.
Twitches not caused by disease or disorders (benign twitches), often affecting the eyelids, calf, or thumb. These twitches are normal and quite common, and are often triggered by stress or
anxiety
. These twitches can come and go, and usually do not last for more than a few days.
Nervous system conditions that can cause muscle twitching include:
AmyotrophicÂ lateral sclerosis (
ALS
), also sometimes called Lou Gehrig disease or motor neuron disease
Neuropathy or damage to the nerve that leads to a muscle
Spinal muscular atrophy
Weak muscles (myopathy)
Symptoms of a nervous system disorder include:
Loss of, or change in, sensation
Loss of muscle size (wasting)
Weakness
Home Care
No treatment is needed for benign muscle twitching in most cases. In other cases, treating an underlying medical cause may improve symptoms.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you have long-term or persistent muscle twitches or if twitching occurs with weakness or loss of muscle.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will take a medical history and perform a physical exam.
Medical history questions may include:
When did you first notice the twitching?
How long does it last?
How often do you experience twitching?
What muscles are affected?
Is it always in the same location?
Are you pregnant?
Are there cramps with the twitching?
What other symptoms do you have?
Tests depend on the suspected cause, and may include:
Blood tests to look for problems with
electrolytes
,
thyroid gland function
, and blood chemistry
CT scan
of the spine or brain
Electromyogram
(EMG)
Nerve conduction studies
MRI scan
of the spine or brain
