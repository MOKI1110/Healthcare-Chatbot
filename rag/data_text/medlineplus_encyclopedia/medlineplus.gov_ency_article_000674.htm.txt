Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) is a rare infection that damages the material (
myelin
) that covers and protects nerves in the
white matter of the brain
.
Causes
The John Cunningham virus, or JC virus (JCV), causes PML. JCV is also known as human polyomavirus 2. By age 10, most people have been infected with JCV, but it rarely causes symptoms. The virus remains in the body, but normally is inactive and causes no problems. But people with a weakened immune system are at risk of developing PML. Causes of a weakened immune system include:
HIV/AIDS (less common now because of better management of HIV/AIDS).
Medicines that suppress the immune system, including monoclonal antibodies. These medicines are used to prevent organ transplant rejection or to treat multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and other autoimmune disorders, and related conditions.
Cancers, such as leukemia and Hodgkin lymphoma.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Loss of coordination, clumsiness
Loss of language ability (
aphasia
)
Memory loss
Vision problems
Weakness of the legs and arms that gets worse
Personality changes
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about symptoms.
Tests may include:
Brain biopsy (in rare cases)
Cerebrospinal fluid analysis
and blood test for the JCV
CT scan of the brain
Electroencephalogram
(EEG)
MRI of the brain
Treatment
In people with HIV/AIDS, treatment to strengthen the immune system can lead to recovery from the symptoms of PML. No other treatments have proved effective for PML. Medicines to treat PML are being developed and may be available in the near future.
Outlook (Prognosis)
PML is a life-threatening condition. Depending on how severe the infection is, up to one half of people diagnosed with PML die within the first few months. Talk to your provider about care decisions.
