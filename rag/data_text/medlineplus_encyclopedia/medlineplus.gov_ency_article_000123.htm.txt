Empyema is a collection of pus in the space between the lung and the inner surface of the chest wall (pleural space).
Causes
Empyema is usually caused by an infection that spreads directly from the lung. It leads to a buildup of pus in the pleural space.
There can be 2 cups (1/2 liter) or more of infected fluid. This fluid puts pressure on the lungs.
Risk factors include:
Bacterial pneumonia
Tuberculosis
Chest surgery
Lung
abscess
Trauma or injury to the chest
In rare cases, empyema can occur after
thoracentesis
. This is a procedure in which a needle is inserted through the chest wall to remove fluid in the pleural space for medical diagnosis or treatment.
Symptoms
Symptoms of empyema may include any of the following:
Chest pain
, which worsens when you breathe in deeply (pleurisy)
Dry
cough
Excessive sweating
, especially night sweats
Fever
and chills
General discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (
malaise
)
Shortness of breath
Weight loss
(unintentional)
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider may note decreased breath sounds or an abnormal sound (friction rub) when listening to your chest with a stethoscope (
auscultation
).
Tests that may be ordered include:
Chest x-ray
(may require multiple positions)
CT scan of chest
Thoracentesis
Pleural fluid analysis
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to cure the infection. This involves the following:
Placing a tube in your chest to drain the pus
Giving you antibiotics to control the infection
If you have problems breathing, you may need surgery to help your lung expand properly.
Outlook (Prognosis)
When empyema complicates pneumonia, the risk for permanent lung damage and death goes up. Long-term treatment with antibiotics and drainage are needed.
In general, most people fully recover from empyema.
Possible Complications
Having empyema may lead to the following:
Pleural thickening
Reduced lung function
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of empyema.
Prevention
Prompt and effective treatment of lung infections may prevent some cases of empyema.
