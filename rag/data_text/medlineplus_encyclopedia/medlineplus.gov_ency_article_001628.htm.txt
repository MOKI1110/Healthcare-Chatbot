Cavernous sinus thrombosis is a
blood clot
in an area at the base of the brain.
Causes
The cavernous sinus is a structure inside the head that receives blood from veins of the face and brain. The blood drains it into other blood vessels that carry it back to the heart. This area also contains nerves that control vision and eye movements.
Cavernous sinus thrombosis is most often caused by a bacterial infection that has spread from the sinuses, teeth, ears, eyes, nose, or skin of the face.
You are more likely to develop this condition if you have an increased risk of blood clots.
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Bulging eyeball, usually on one side of face
Cannot move the eye in a particular direction
Drooping eyelids
Headaches
Vision loss
Exams and Tests
Tests that may be ordered include:
CT scan of the head
MRI of the brain
Magnetic resonance venogram
Sinus x-ray
Treatment
Cavernous sinus thrombosis is treated with high-dose antibiotics given through a vein (
IV
) if an infection is the cause.
Blood thinners help dissolve the blood clot and prevent it from getting worse or recurring.
Surgery is sometimes needed to drain the infection.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Cavernous sinus thrombosis can lead to death if left untreated.
