Chlamydia is an infection caused by the bacteria
Chlamydia trachomatis
. It is most often spread through sexual contact.
Causes
Both males and females may have chlamydia. However, they may not have any symptoms. As a result, you may become infected or pass the infection to your partner without knowing it.
You are more likely to become infected with chlamydia if you:
Have sex without wearing a male or female condom
Have more than one sexual partner
Use drugs or alcohol and then have sex
Have been infected with chlamydia before
Symptoms
In men, chlamydia
may cause symptoms similar to
gonorrhea
. Symptoms may include:
Burning feeling during urination
Discharge from the penis or rectum
Tenderness
or pain in the testicles
Rectal discharge or pain
Symptoms that may occur
in women
include:
Burning feeling during urination
Painful sexual intercourse
Rectal pain or discharge
Symptoms of
pelvic inflammatory disease
(PID),
salpingitis
(inflammation of the fallopian tubes), or liver inflammation similar to
hepatitis
Vaginal discharge
or bleeding after intercourse
Exams and Tests
If you have symptoms of a chlamydia infection, your health care provider will collect a sample for culture or a test called a nucleic acid amplification.
In the past, testing required an exam by a provider. Today, very accurate tests can be done on urine samples or vaginal swabs. Results take 1 to 2 days to come back. Your provider may also check if you have other types of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Common STIs are:
Gonorrhea
HIV
Syphilis
Hepatitis
Herpes
Even if you have no symptoms, you may need a chlamydia test if you:
Are 24 years old or younger and sexually active (get tested every year)
Are any age and have an increased risk for chlamydia infection such as having a new sexual partner, more than one partner or a partner with an STI
Treatment
The most common treatment for chlamydia is an antibiotic.
Both you and your sexual partners must be treated. This will ensure that you do not pass the infection back and forth. A person may become infected with chlamydia many times.
You and your partner are asked to abstain from sexual intercourse during the time of treatment.
A follow-up may be done in 4 weeks to see if the infection has been cured.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Antibiotic treatment almost always works. You and your partner should take the medicines as directed.
If chlamydia spreads into your uterus and fallopian tubes, it can cause scarring. Scarring can make it harder for you to get pregnant.
You can help prevent infection with chlamydia by:
Finishing your antibiotics when you are treated
Making sure your sexual partners also take antibiotics
Talking to your provider about being tested for chlamydia
Going to see your provider if you have symptoms
Wearing condoms and practicing
safer sex
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of chlamydia.
Many people with chlamydia may not have symptoms. Therefore, many sexually active adults should be screened for the infection yearly. Check with your provider about what is best for you.
