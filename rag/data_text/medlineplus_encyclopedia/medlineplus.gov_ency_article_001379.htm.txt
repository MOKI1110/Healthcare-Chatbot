Kuru is a disease of the nervous system.
Causes
Kuru is a very rare disease. It is caused by an infectious protein (prion) found in contaminated human brain tissue.
Kuru is found among people from New Guinea who practiced a form of cannibalism in which they ate the brains of dead people as part of a funeral ritual. This practice stopped in 1960, but cases of kuru were reported for many years afterward because the disease has a long incubation period. The incubation period is the time it takes for symptoms to appear after being exposed to the agent that causes disease.
Kuru causes brain and nervous system changes similar to
Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
. Similar diseases appear in cows as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also called mad cow disease.
The main risk factor for kuru is eating human brain tissue, which can contain the infectious particles.
Symptoms
Symptoms of kuru include:
Arm and leg pain
Coordination problems
that become severe
Difficulty walking
Headache
Swallowing difficulty
Tremors
and muscle jerks
Difficulty swallowing and being unable to feed oneself can lead to
malnutrition
or starvation.
The average incubation period is 10 to 13 years, but an incubation period of 50 years or longer has also been reported.
Exams and Tests
A neurologic exam may show changes in coordination and walking ability.
Treatment
There is no known treatment for kuru.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Death usually occurs within 1 year after the first sign of symptoms.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
See your health care provider if you have any walking, swallowing, or coordination problems. Kuru is extremely rare. Your provider will check for other nervous system diseases.
