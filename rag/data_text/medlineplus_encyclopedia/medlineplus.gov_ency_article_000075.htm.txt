Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is a very rare disease. It leads to high blood pressure in the lung arteries (
pulmonary hypertension
).
Causes
In most cases, the cause of PVOD is unknown. The high blood pressure occurs in the pulmonary arteries. These lung arteries are directly connected to the right side of the heart.
The condition may be related to a viral infection. It may occur as a complication of certain diseases such as
lupus
, or
bone marrow transplantation
.
The disorder is most common among children and young adults. As the disease gets worse, it causes:
Narrowed pulmonary veins
Pulmonary artery hypertension
Congestion and swelling of the lungs
Possible risk factors for PVOD include:
Family history of the condition
Smoking
Exposure to substances like trichloroethylene or
chemotherapy
medicines
Systemic sclerosis
(autoimmune skin disorder)
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Shortness of breath
Dry cough
Fatigue
on exertion
Fainting
Coughing up blood
Difficulty breathing while lying flat
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine you and ask about your medical history and symptoms.
The exam may reveal:
Increased pressure in the neck veins
Clubbing
of the fingers
Bluish coloration of the skin
due to lack of oxygen (cyanosis)
Swelling in the legs
Your provider may hear abnormal
heart sounds
when listening to the chest and lungs with a stethoscope.
The following tests may be done:
Arterial blood gases
Blood oximetry
Chest x-ray
Chest CT
Cardiac catheterization
Lung function tests
Echocardiogram
Lung biopsy
Treatment
There is currently no known effective medical treatment. However, the following medicines may be helpful for some people:
Medicines that widen the blood vessels (vasodilators)
Medicines that control the immune system response (such as azathioprine or steroids)
A
lung transplant
may be needed.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome is often very poor in infants, with a survival rate of just a few weeks. Survival in adults may be months to a few years.
Possible Complications
Complications of PVOD may include:
Difficulty breathing
that gets worse, including at night (
sleep apnea
)
Pulmonary hypertension
Right-sided heart failure (
cor pulmonale
)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
