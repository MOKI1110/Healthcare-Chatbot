Acute cholecystitis

Acute cholecystitis is sudden swelling and irritation of the gallbladder. It causes severe belly pain.
Causes
The gallbladder is an organ that sits below the liver. It stores bile, which is produced in the liver. Your body uses bile to digest fats in the small intestine.
Acute cholecystitis occurs when
bile
becomes trapped in the gallbladder. This often happens because a
gallstone
blocks the cystic duct, the tube through which bile travels into and out of the gallbladder. When a stone blocks this duct, bile builds up, causing irritation and pressure in the gallbladder. This can lead to swelling and infection.
Other causes include:
Serious illnesses, such as HIV or diabetes
Tumors of the gallbladder (rare)
Some people are more at risk for gallstones. Risk factors include:
Being female
Pregnancy
Hormone therapy
Older age
Being Native American or Hispanic
Obesity
Losing or gaining weight rapidly
Diabetes
Sometimes, the bile duct becomes blocked temporarily. When this occurs repeatedly, it can lead to
long-term (chronic) cholecystitis
. This is swelling and irritation that continues over time. Eventually, the gallbladder becomes thick and hard. It does not store and release bile as well as it did.
Symptoms
The main symptom is pain in the upper right side or upper middle of your belly that usually lasts at least 30 minutes. You may feel:
Sharp, cramping, or dull pain
Steady pain
Pain that spreads to your back or below your right shoulder blade
Other symptoms that may occur include:
Clay-colored stools
Fever
Nausea and vomiting
Yellowing of skin and whites of the eyes (
jaundice
)
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. During the physical exam, you will likely have pain when the provider touches your belly.
Your provider may order the following blood tests:
Amylase
and lipase
Bilirubin
Complete blood count (
CBC
)
Liver function tests
Imaging tests can show gallstones or inflammation. You may have one or more of these tests:
Abdominal ultrasound
Abdominal CT scan
or MRI scan
Abdominal x-ray
Oral cholecystogram
Gallbladder radionuclide scan
Treatment
If you have severe belly pain, seek medical attention right away.
In the emergency room, you'll be given fluids through a vein. You also may be given antibiotics to fight infection.
Cholecystitis may clear up on its own. However, if you have gallstones, you will probably need
surgery to remove your gallbladder
.
Nonsurgical treatment includes:
Antibiotics you take at home to fight infection
Low-fat diet (if you are able to eat)
Pain medicines
You may need emergency surgery if you have complications such as:
Tissue death (
gangrene
) of the gallbladder
A hole that forms in the wall of the gallbladder (perforation)
Inflamed pancreas
(pancreatitis)
Persistent bile duct blockage
Inflammation of the common bile duct
If you are very ill, a tube may be placed through your belly into your gallbladder to drain it. Once you feel better, your provider may recommend that you have
surgery
.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Most people who have surgery to remove their gallbladder recover completely.
Possible Complications
Untreated, cholecystitis may lead to any of the following health problems:
Empyema
(pus in the gallbladder)
Gangrene
Injury to the bile ducts draining the liver (may occur after gallbladder surgery)
Pancreatitis
Perforation
Peritonitis
(inflammation of the lining of the abdomen)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have:
Severe belly pain that does not go away
Symptoms of cholecystitis return
Prevention
Removing the gallbladder and gallstones will prevent further attacks.
