Autoimmune liver disease panel

An autoimmune liver disease panel is a group of blood tests that is done to check for autoimmune liver disease. An
autoimmune
liver disease means that the body's immune system attacks the liver.
These tests include:
Anti-liver/kidney microsomal antibodies
Anti-mitochondrial antibodies
Anti-nuclear antibodies
Anti-smooth muscle antibodies
Serum IgG
The panel may also include other tests. Often, immune protein levels in the blood are also checked.
How the Test is Performed
A blood sample is taken from a
vein
.
The blood sample is sent to the lab for testing.
How to Prepare for the Test
You do not need to take special steps before this test.
How the Test will Feel
You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted to draw blood. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.
Why the Test is Performed
Autoimmune disorders are a possible cause of liver disease. The most common of these diseases are autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis (formerly called primary biliary cirrhosis).
This group of tests helps your health care provider diagnose specific liver diseases.
Normal Results
PROTEIN LEVELS:
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Please check with your provider for the normal ranges in your particular laboratory.
ANTIBODIES:
Negative results on all antibodies are normal.
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Blood tests for autoimmune diseases are not wholly accurate. They can have false negative results (you have the disease, but the test is negative) and false positive results (you do not have the disease, but the test is positive).
A weakly positive or low titer positive test for autoimmune disease is often not due to any disease.
A positive test on the panel may be a sign of autoimmune hepatitis or other autoimmune liver disease.
If the test is positive mostly for anti-mitochondrial antibodies, you are likely to have primary biliary cholangitis. If the immune proteins are high and albumin is low, you may have liver cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis.
Risks
Slight risks from having blood drawn include:
Excessive bleeding
Fainting
or feeling lightheaded
Hematoma
(blood accumulating under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
