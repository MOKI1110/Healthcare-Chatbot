Juvenile angiofibroma is a noncancerous growth that causes bleeding in the nose and sinuses. It is most often seen in boys and young adult men.
Causes
Juvenile angiofibroma is not very common. It is most often found in adolescent boys. The
tumor
contains many blood vessels andÂ spreads within the area in which it started (locally
invasive
). This can cause bone damage.
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
Difficulty breathing
through the nose
Easy bruising
Frequent or repeated nosebleeds
Headache
Swelling of the cheek
Hearing loss
Nasal discharge
, usually bloody
Prolonged
bleeding
Stuffy nose
Exams and Tests
The health care provider may see the angiofibroma when examining the upper throat.
Tests that may be done include:
Arteriogram
to see the blood supply to the growth
CT scan of the sinuses
MRI scan of the head
X-ray
Biopsy is generally not recommended due to the high risk of bleeding.
Treatment
You will need treatment if the angiofibroma is growing larger, blocking the airways, or causing repeated nosebleeds. In some cases, no treatment is needed.
Surgery may be needed to remove the tumor. The tumor may be hard to remove if it is not enclosed and has spread to other areas. Newer surgery techniques that place a camera up through the nose have made tumor removal surgery less invasive.
A procedure called embolization may be done to prevent the tumor from bleeding. The procedure may correct the nosebleeds by itself, but it is most often followed by surgery to remove the tumor.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Although not cancerous, angiofibromas may continue to grow and damage nearby tissue or bleed. Some may disappear on their own.
It is common for the tumor to return after surgery.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Anemia
Pressure on the brain (rare)
Spread of the tumor to the nose, sinuses, and other structures
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you often have:
Nosebleeds
One-sided nasal blockage
Prevention
There is no known way to prevent this condition.
