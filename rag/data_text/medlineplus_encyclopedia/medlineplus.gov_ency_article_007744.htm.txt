A midline venous catheter is a long (3 to 8 inches, or 7 to 20 centimeters) thin, soft plastic tube that is put into a small vein. It's also called a long peripheral catheter. This article addresses midline catheters in infants.
Information
WHY IS A MIDLINE VENOUS CATHETER USED?
A midline venous catheter is used when an infant needs IV fluids or medicine over a long period of time. Regular IVs only last for 1 to 3 days and need to be replaced often. Midline catheters can stay in for 2 to 4 weeks.
Midline catheters are now often used in place of:
Umbilical catheters, which may be placed soon after birth, but carry more risks
Central venous lines
, which are placed in a large vein near the heart, but carry more risks
Percutaneously inserted central catheters (PICCs)
, which reach closer to the heart, but carry more risks
Because midline catheters do not reach beyond the armpit, they are considered safer. However, there may be some IV medicines that cannot be delivered through a midline catheter. Also, routine blood draws are not advised from a midline catheter, as opposed to the more central types of venous catheters.
HOW IS A MIDLINE CATHETER PLACED?
A midline catheter is inserted into a vein in the arm, leg, or, occasionally, scalp of the infant.
Your health care provider will:
Place the infant on the exam table
Receive help from other trained staffÂ who will help calm and comfort the infant
Clean the infant's skin with a germ-killing medicine (antiseptic)
Place a hollow needle into a small vein in the arm, leg, or scalp
Place the midline catheter through the needle into a larger vein and remove the needle
Bandage the area where catheter has been placed
WHAT ARE THE RISKS OF HAVING A MIDLINE CATHETER PLACED?
Risks of midline venous catheterization:
Infection if the midline catheter stays in place for a long time.
Bleeding and bruising at the site of insertion.
Inflammation of the vein (phlebitis).
Movement of the catheter out of place, even out of the vein.
Fluid leaking from the catheter into the tissues causing swelling and redness.
Breaking of the catheter inside the vein (very rare).
