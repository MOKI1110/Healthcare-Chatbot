Congenital fibrinogen deficiency

Congenital fibrinogen deficiency is a very rare, inherited blood disorder in which the blood does not clot normally. It affects a protein called fibrinogen. This protein is needed for the blood to clot.
Causes
This disease is due to a deficiency of the amount or function of fibrinogen. How fibrinogen is affected depends on how the genes that determine how it is formed are inherited:
When the variant gene is passed down from both parents, a person will have a complete lack of fibrinogen (afibrinogenemia).
When the variant gene is passed down from one parent, a person will have either a reduced level of fibrinogen (hypofibrinogenemia) or a problem with the function of fibrinogen (dysfibrinogenemia). Sometimes, these two fibrinogen problems can occur in the same person.
Symptoms
People with a complete lack of fibrinogen may have any of the following bleeding symptoms:
Bruising
easily
Bleeding from the umbilical cord just after birth
Bleeding in the mucous membranes
Bleeding in the brain (very rare)
Bleeding in the joints
Heavy bleeding after injury or surgery
Nosebleeds that do not stop easily
People with a reduced level of fibrinogen bleed less often and the bleeding is not as severe when compared to people with no fibrinogen at all. Those with a problem with the function of fibrinogen often don't have symptoms.
Exams and Tests
If your health care provider suspects this problem, you will have lab tests to confirm the type and severity of the disorder.
Tests include:
Bleeding time
Fibrinogen test
and reptilase time to check fibrin level and quality
Partial thromboplastin time
(PTT)
Prothrombin time
(PT)
Thrombin time
Treatment
The following treatments can be used for bleeding episodes or to prepare for surgery:
Cryoprecipitate (a blood product containing concentrated fibrinogen and other clotting factors)
Fibrinogen (RiaSTAP)
Plasma (the liquid portion of the blood containing clotting factors)
People with this condition should get the
hepatitis B vaccine
. Having many transfusions raises your risk of getting hepatitis.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Excessive bleeding is common with this condition. These episodes may be severe, or even fatal. Bleeding in the brain is a leading cause of death in people with this disorder.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Blood clots with treatment
Development of antibodies (inhibitors) to fibrinogen with treatment
Gastrointestinal bleeding
Miscarriage
Rupture of the spleen
Slow healing of wounds
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider or seek emergency care if you have excessive bleeding.
Tell your surgeon before you have surgery if you know or suspect you have a bleeding disorder.
Prevention
This is an inherited condition. There is no known prevention.
