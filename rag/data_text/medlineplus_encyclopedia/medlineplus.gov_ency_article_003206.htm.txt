Numbness and tingling

Numbness and tingling are abnormal sensations that can occur anywhere in your body, but they are often felt in your fingers, hands, feet, arms, or legs.
Causes
There are many possible causes of numbness and tingling, including:
Sitting or standing in the same position for a long time
Injuring a nerve (for example, a neck injury may cause you to feel numbness anywhere along your arm or hand, while a low back injury can cause numbness or tingling along your leg or foot)
Pressure on the nerves of the spine, such as from a
herniated disk
Pressure on peripheral nerves from enlarged blood vessels, tumors, scar tissue, or infection or due to compression of a body part (such as sitting with legs crossed)
Shingles
or herpes zoster infection
Other infections such as HIV/AIDS,
leprosy
,
syphilis
, or tuberculosis
Lack of blood supply to an area, such as from
hardening of the arteries
,
frostbite
, or vessel inflammation
Abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body
Deficiency of B vitamins such as B1, B6,Â B12, or folic acid
Use of certain medicines
Use of certain illicit street drugs
Nerve damage due to lead, alcohol, or tobacco, or from chemotherapy medicines
Radiation therapy
Animal bites
Insect, tick, mite, and spider bites
Seafood toxins
Congenital conditions that affect the nerves
Autoimmune diseases that attack the nerves
Numbness and tingling can be caused by other medical conditions, including:
Carpal tunnel syndrome
(pressure on the median nerve at the wrist)
Diabetes
Migraines
Multiple sclerosis
Seizures
Stroke
Transient ischemic attack
(TIA), sometimes called a "mini-stroke"
Underactive thyroid
Raynaud phenomenon
(narrowing of the blood vessels, usually in the hands and feet)
Home Care
Your health care provider should find and treat the cause of your numbness or tingling. Treating the condition may make the symptoms go away or stop them from getting worse. For example, if you have carpal tunnel syndrome or low back pain, your provider may recommend certain exercises or other treatments.
If you have diabetes, your provider will discuss ways to regulate your blood sugar level.
Low levels of vitamins will be treated with vitamin supplements.
Medicines that cause numbness or tingling may need to be switched or changed. Do not change or stop taking any of your medicines or take large doses of any vitamins or supplements until you have talked with your provider.
Because numbness can cause a decrease in feeling, you may be more likely to accidentally injure a numb hand or foot. Take care to protect the area from cuts, bumps, bruises, burns, or other injuries. If you have chronic numbness of the feet (such as from diabetes), seeing a podiatrist regularly can help prevent complications.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Go to a hospital or call 911 or the local emergency number if:
You have weakness or are unable to move, along with numbness or tingling
Numbness or tingling occur just after a head, neck, or back injury
You cannot control the movement of an arm or a leg, or you have lost bladder or bowel control
You are confused or have lost consciousness, even briefly
You have slurred speech, a change in vision, difficulty walking, or weakness
Contact your provider if:
Your numbness or tingling has no obvious cause (like a hand or foot "falling asleep")
You have pain in your neck, forearm, or fingers
You are urinating more often
Your numbness or tingling is in your legs and gets worse when you walk
You have a rash
You have dizziness, muscle spasm, or other unusual symptoms
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will take a medical history and perform a physical exam, carefully checking your nervous system.
You will be asked about your symptoms. Questions may include when the problem began, its location, or if there's anything that improves or worsens the symptoms.
Your provider may also ask questions to determine your risk for stroke, thyroid disease, or diabetes, as well as questions about your work habits and medicines.
Blood tests that may be ordered include:
Complete blood count
Â (CBC)
Screening for diabetes with glucose tests
Electrolyte level (measurement of body chemicals and minerals) and
liver function tests
Thyroid function tests
Measurement of vitamin levels, particularly vitamin B12
Heavy metal or toxicology screening
Sedimentation rate
C-reactive protein
Imaging tests may include:
Angiogram
(a test that uses x-rays and a special dye to see inside the blood vessels)
CT angiogram of the head and neck
CT scan of the head
CT scan of the spine
MRI of the head
MRI of the spine
Ultrasound
of neck vessels to determine your risk for TIA or stroke
Vascular ultrasound
X-ray of the affected area
Other tests that may be done include:
Electromyography
and nerve conduction studies to measure how your muscles respond to nerve stimulation
Lumbar puncture
(spinal tap) to check for central nervous system disorders
Cold stimulation test may be done to check for Raynaud phenomenon
Genetic testing for nerve problems that run in families.
