Drug-induced immune
hemolytic anemia
is a blood disorder that occurs when a medicine triggers the body's defense (immune) system to attack its own red blood cells. This causes red blood cells to break down earlier than normal, a process called hemolysis.
Causes
Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues.
Normally, red blood cells last for about 120 days in the body. In people with hemolytic anemia, red blood cells in the blood are destroyed earlier than normal.
In some cases, a medicine can cause the immune system to mistake your own red blood cells for foreign substances. The body responds by making antibodies to attack the body's own red blood cells. The antibodies attach to red blood cells and cause them to break down too early.
Medicines that can cause this type of hemolytic anemia include:
Cephalosporins (a class of antibiotics), most common cause
Dapsone
Levodopa
Levofloxacin
Methyldopa
Nitrofurantoin
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
Penicillin and its derivatives
Phenazopyridine (Pyridium)
Drug-induced hemolytic anemia is rare in children.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include any of the following:
Dark urine
Fatigue
Pale skin color
Â (pallor)
Rapid heart rate
Shortness of breath
Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (
jaundice
)
Exams and Tests
A physical exam may show an
enlarged spleen
. You may have blood and urine tests to help diagnose this condition.
Tests may include:
Absolute
reticulocyte count
(immature red blood cells) to determine if red blood cells are being created in the bone marrow at an appropriate rate
Direct or indirect Coombs test
to check if there are antibodies against red blood cells that are causing red blood cells to die too early
Indirect blood bilirubin
(breakdown product of red blood cells) levels to check for jaundice
Red blood cell count
Serum haptoglobin
to check if red blood cells are being destroyed too early
Lactate dehydrogenase
level, which increases with red cell destruction
Urine hemoglobin
to check for hemolysis
Treatment
Stopping the medicine that is causing the problem may relieve or control the symptoms.
You may need to take a medicine called prednisone to suppress the immune response against the red blood cells. Special blood transfusions may be needed to treat severe symptoms. You will also be prescribed a folic acid supplement.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outcome is good for most people if they stop taking the medicine that is causing the problem.
Possible Complications
Death caused by severe anemia is rare.
Blood clots in the legs and lungs can also rarely occur.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
See your health care provider if you have symptoms of this condition.
Prevention
Avoid the medicine that caused this condition.
