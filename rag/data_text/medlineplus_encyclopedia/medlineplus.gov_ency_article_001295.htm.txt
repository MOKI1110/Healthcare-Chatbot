Agranulocytosis

White blood cells fight infections from bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other germs. One important type of white blood cell is the granulocyte, which is made in the bone marrow and travels in the blood throughout the body. Granulocytes sense infections, gather at sites of infection, and destroy the germs.
When the body has too few granulocytes, the condition is called agranulocytosis. This makes it harder for the body to fight off germs. As a result, the person may get sick from infections.
Causes
Agranulocytosis may be caused by:
Autoimmune disorders
Bone marrow diseases, such as myelodysplasia or large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia
Certain medicines used to treat diseases, including
cancer
Certain street drugs
Poor nutrition
Preparation for
bone marrow transplant
Benign familial neutropenia
Genetic variants, especially in people of certain African and Caribbean ethnicities
Symptoms
Symptoms of this condition may include:
Fever
Chills
Malaise
General weakness
Sore throat
Mouth and throat
ulcers
Bone pain
Pneumonia
Shock
Exams and Tests
A
white blood cell differential test
Â will be done to measure the percentage of each type of white blood cell in your blood.
Other tests to diagnose the condition may include:
Bone marrow biopsy
Biopsy of mouth ulcer
Neutrophil antibody tests (blood test)
Treatment
Treatment depends on the cause of the low white blood cell count. For example, if a medicine is the cause, stopping or changing to another medicine may help. In other cases, medicines to help the body make more white blood cells will be used. If the cause is due to normal genes, no treatment is required.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Treating or removing the cause often results in a good outcome.
Prevention
If you are having treatment or taking medicine that could cause agranulocytosis, your health care provider will use blood tests to monitor you.
Alternative Names
