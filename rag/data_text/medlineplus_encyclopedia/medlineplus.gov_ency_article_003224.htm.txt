Patchy skin color

Patchy skin color is areas where the skin color is irregular with lighter or darker areas. Mottling or mottled skin refers to blood vessel changes in the skin that cause a patchy appearance.
Considerations
Irregular or patchy discoloration of the skin can be caused by:
Changes in
melanin
, a substance produced in the skin cells that gives skin its color
Growth of bacteria or other organisms on the skin
Blood vessel (vascular) changes
Inflammation due to certain rashes
The following can increase or decrease melanin production:
Your genes
Heat
Injury
Exposure to radiation (such as from the sun)
Exposure to heavy metals
Changes in hormone levels
Certain conditions such as
vitiligo
Certain fungal infections
Certain rashes
Exposure to sun or ultraviolet (UV) light, especially after taking a medicine called psoralens, may increase skin color (pigmentation). Increased pigment production is called
hyperpigmentation
, and can result from certain rashes as well as sun exposure.
Decreased pigment production is called hypopigmentation.
Skin color changes can be their own condition, or they may be caused by other medical conditions or disorders.
How much skin pigmentation you have can help determine which skin diseases you may be more likely to develop. For example, lighter-skinned people are more sensitive to sun exposure and damage. This raises the risk of skin cancers. But even in darker-skinned people, too much sun exposure can lead to skin cancers.
Examples of the most common skin cancers are
basal cell carcinoma
,
squamous cell carcinoma
, and
melanoma
.
Generally, skin color changes are cosmetic and do not affect physical health. But, mental
stress
can occur because of pigment changes. Some pigment changes may be a sign that you are at risk for other medical problems.
Causes
Causes of pigment changes may include any of the following:
Acanthosis nigricans
Acne
Cafe-au-lait spots
Cuts, scrapes, wounds, insect bites, and minor skin infections
Erythrasma
Melasma (chloasma)
Melanoma
Moles (
nevi
), bathing trunk nevi, or giant nevi
Dermal melanocytosis
Pityriasis alba
Radiation therapy
Rashes
Sensitivity to the sun due to medicine reactions or certain medicines
Sunburn or suntan
Tinea versicolor
Unevenly applying sunscreen, leading to areas of burn, tan, and no tan
Vitiligo
Home Care
In some cases, normal skin color returns on its own.
You may use medicated creams that bleach or lighten the skin to reduce discoloration or to even the skin tone where hyperpigmented areas are large or very noticeable. Check with your health care provider first about using such products. Follow the instructions on the package about how to use such products.
Selenium sulfide (Selsun Blue), ketoconazole, or tolnaftate (Tinactin) lotion can help treat
tinea versicolor
, which is a fungal infection that can appear as hypopigmented patches. Apply as directed to the affected area daily until the discolored patches disappear. Tinea versicolor often returns, even with treatment.
You may use cosmetics or skin dyes to hide skin color changes. Makeup can also help hide mottled skin, but it will not cure the problem.
Avoid too much sun exposure and use sunblock with an SPF of at least 30. Hypopigmented skin sunburns easily, and hyperpigmented skin may get even darker. In darker-skinned people, skin damage may cause permanent hyperpigmentation.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
You have any lasting skin color changes that do not have a known cause
You notice a new mole or other growth
An existing growth has changed color, size, or appearance
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
Your provider will carefully examine your skin and ask about your medical history. You will also be asked about your skin symptoms, such as when you first noticed your skin color change, if it started suddenly, and if you had any skin injuries.
Tests that may be done include:
Scrapings of skin lesions
Skin biopsy
Wood lamp
(ultraviolet light) exam of the skin
Blood tests
Treatment will depend on the diagnosis of your skin problem.
