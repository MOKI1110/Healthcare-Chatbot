Anorectal abscess

An anorectal abscess is a collection of pus in the area of the anus and rectum.
Causes
Common causes of anorectal abscess include:
Blocked glands in the anal area
Infection of an
anal fissure
Sexually transmitted infection (STD)
Trauma
Deep rectal abscesses may be caused by intestinal disorders such as
Crohn disease
or
diverticulitis
.
The following factors increase the risk for an anorectal abscess:
Anal sex
Chemotherapy
medicines used to treat cancer
Diabetes
Inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn disease and
ulcerative colitis
)
Use of corticosteroid medicines
Weakened immune system (such as from HIV/AIDS)
The condition affects men more than women. The condition may occur in infants and toddlers who are still in diapers and who have a history of anal fissures.
Symptoms
Common symptoms are swelling around the anus and a constant, throbbing pain with swelling. Pain may be severe with bowel movements, coughing and sitting.
Other symptoms may include:
Constipation
Discharge of pus from the rectum or in the area of the anus
Fatigue,
fever
, night sweats, and chills
Redness, painful and hardened tissue in the area of the anus
Tenderness
In infants, the abscess often appears as a swollen, red, tender lump at the edge of the anus. The infant may be fussy and irritable from discomfort. There are usually no other symptoms.
Exams and Tests
A
rectal examination
may confirm an anorectal abscess. A
proctosigmoidoscopy
may be done to check for other diseases.
In some cases, a
CT scan
,
MRI
, or
ultrasound
is needed to help locate the collection of pus.
Treatment
The problem rarely goes away on its own. Antibiotics alone usually cannot treat an abscess.
Treatment involves surgery to open and drain the abscess.
Surgery is usually done with local numbing medicine, along with
medicine to make you sleepy
. Sometimes,
spinal or general anesthesia
is used.
Surgery is most often an outpatient procedure, which means that you go home on the same day. The surgeon cuts open the abscess and drains the pus. Sometimes a drain is put in to keep the incision open and draining, and sometimes the abscess cavity is packed with gauze.
If the pus collection is deep, you may need to stay in the hospital longer for pain control and nursing care of the abscess drainage site.
After surgery, you may need warm
sitz baths
(sitting in a tub of warm water). This helps relieve pain and reduce swelling.
Drained abscesses are usually left open and no stitches are needed.
The surgeon may prescribe painkillers and antibiotics.
Avoiding constipation will help decrease pain. You may need stool softeners. Drinking fluids and eating foods with lots of fiber can also help.
Outlook (Prognosis)
With prompt treatment, people with this condition usually do well. Infants and toddlers usually recover quickly.
Complications can occur when treatment is delayed.
Possible Complications
Complications of anorectal abscess may include:
Anal
fistula
(abnormal connection between the anus and another structure)
Infection that spreads to the blood (
sepsis
)
Continuing pain
Problem keeps coming back (recurrence)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you:
Notice rectal discharge, pain, or other symptoms of anorectal abscess
Have fever, chills, or other new symptoms after being treated for this condition
Have diabetes and your blood glucose becomes difficult to control
Prevention
Prevention or prompt treatment of STDs may prevent an anorectal abscess from forming. Use condoms during intercourse, including anal sex, to prevent such infections.
In infants and toddlers, frequent diaper changes and proper cleaning during diaper changes can help prevent both anal fissures and abscesses.
