Corticosteroids overdose
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Corticosteroids are medicines that treat inflammation in the body. They are some of the naturally-occurring hormones produced by glands and released into the blood stream. Corticosteroid overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose.
Corticosteroids come in many forms, including:
Creams and ointments that are applied to the skin
Inhaled forms that are breathed into the nose or lungs
Pills or liquids that are swallowed
Injected forms delivered to the skin, joints, muscles, or veins
Most corticosteroid overdoses occur with pills and liquids.
This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with overdoses, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure.

Outlook (Prognosis)
Most people who overdose on corticosteroids have minor changes in their body's fluids and electrolytes. If they have changes in their heart rhythm, their outlook may be more serious. Some problems related to taking corticosteroids may occur even when they are taken properly. People who have these problems may need to take both short- and long-term medicines to treat these problems.
