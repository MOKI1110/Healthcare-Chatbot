Fungal nail infection

Fungal nail infection is a fungus growing in and around your fingernail or toenail.
Causes
Fungi can live on the dead tissues of the hair, nails, and outer skin layers.
Common fungal infections include:
Athlete's foot
Jock itch
Ringworm
on the skin of the body or head
Fungal nail infections often start after a fungal infection on the feet. They occur more often in toenails than in fingernails. They are most often seen in adults as they age.
You are at higher risk of getting a fungal nail infection if you have any of the following:
Diabetes
Peripheral vascular disease
Peripheral neuropathies
Minor skin or nail injuries
Deformed nail or nail disease
Moist skin for a long time
Immune system problems
Family history
Wear footwear that does not allow air to reach your feet
Symptoms
Symptoms include
nail changes
on one or more nails (usually toenails), such as:
Brittleness
Change in nail shape
Crumbling of the outside edges of the nail
Debris trapped under the nail
Loosening or lifting of the nail
Loss of luster and shine on the nail surface
Thickening of the nail
White or yellow streaks on the side of the nail
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine your nails to find out if you have a fungal infection.
The diagnosis can be confirmed by looking at scrapings from the nail under a microscope. This can help determine the type of fungus. Samples can also be sent to a lab for a
culture
. (Results may take 4 to 6 weeks.)
Treatment
Over-the-counter creams and ointments usually do not help treat this condition.
Prescription antifungal medicines that you take by mouth may help clear the fungus.
You will need to take the medicine for about 2 to 3 months for toenails; a shorter time for fingernails.
Your provider will do lab tests to check for liver damage while you are taking these medicines.
Laser treatments may sometimes get rid of the fungus in the nails. This is less effective than medicines.
In some cases, you may need to have the nail removed.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The fungal nail infection is cured by the growth of new, non-infected nails. Nails grow slowly. Even if treatment is successful, it may take up to a year for a new clear nail to grow.
Fungal nail infections may be hard to treat. Medicines clear up fungus in about one half of the people who try them.
Even when treatment works, the fungus may return.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
You have fungal nail infections that do not go away
Your fingers become painful, red, or drain pus
Prevention
Good general health and hygiene help prevent fungal infections.
Do not share tools used for manicures and pedicures.
Keep your skin clean and dry.
Take proper care of your nails.
Wash and dry your hands thoroughly after touching any kind of fungal infection.
