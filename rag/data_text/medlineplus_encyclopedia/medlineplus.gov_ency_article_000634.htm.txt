Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is a sexually transmitted infection (STI).
Causes
LGV is a long-term (chronic) infection of the lymphatic system. It is caused by certain strains of the bacteria
Chlamydia trachomatis
. The bacteria are spread by sexual contact. The infection is not caused by the same strain of bacteria that causes genital
chlamydia
.
LGV is more common in Central and South America than in North America.
LGV is more common in men than women. The main risk factor is being HIV-positive.
Symptoms
Symptoms of LGV can begin a few days to a month after coming in contact with the bacteria. Symptoms include:
Drainage through the skin from lymph nodes in the groin
Painful bowel movements
Small painless sore on the male genitals or in the female genital tract
Swelling and redness of the skin in the groin area
Swelling of the labia (in women)
Swollen groin lymph nodes on one or both sides; it may also affect lymph nodes around the rectum in people who have anal intercourse
Blood or pus from the rectum (
blood in the stools
)
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine you. You will be asked about your medical and sexual history. Tell your provider if you had sexual contact with someone you think has had symptoms of LGV.
A physical exam may show:
An oozing, abnormal connection (fistula) in the rectal area
A sore on the genitals
Drainage through the skin from lymph nodes in the groin
Swelling of the vulva or labia in women
Swollen lymph nodes in the groin
Tests may include:
Biopsy
of the lymph node
Blood test for the bacteria that causes LGV
Laboratory test to detect chlamydia from genital lesions, pharyngeal, rectal and lymph node specimens
Treatment
LGV is treated with antibiotics,Â including doxycycline and erythromycin.
Outlook (Prognosis)
With treatment, the outlook is good and complete recovery can be expected.
Possible Complications
Health problems that may result from LGV infection include:
Abnormal connections between the rectum and vagina (
fistula
)
Brain inflammation (
encephalitis
- very rare)
Infections in the joints, eyes, heart, or liver
Long-term inflammation and swelling of the genitals
Scarring and narrowing of the rectum
Complications can occur many years after you are first infected.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
You have been in contact with someone who may have an STI, including LGV
You develop symptoms of LGV
Prevention
Not having any sexual activity is the only way to prevent an STI.
Safer sex behaviors
may reduce the risk.
The proper use of condoms, either the
male
or
female
type, greatly decreases the risk of catching an STI. You need to wear the condom from the beginning to the end of each sexual activity.
