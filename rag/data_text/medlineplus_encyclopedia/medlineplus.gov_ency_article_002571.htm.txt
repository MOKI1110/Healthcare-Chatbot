Zinc oxide overdose
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
Zinc oxide is an ingredient in many products. Some of these are certain creams and ointments used to prevent or treat minor skin burns and irritation. Zinc oxide overdose occurs when someone eats one of these products. This can be by accident or on purpose.
This article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual
overdose
. If you or someone you are with has an exposure or swallows it, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.
Poisonous Ingredient
Zinc oxide can cause symptoms if it is eaten, or if its fumes are breathed in. Local skin irritation and allergic reactions may
occur if you are sensitive to the chemical.
Where Found
Zinc oxide is used in many different products, including:
Zinc oxide ointment
Diaper rash
medicines
Hemorrhoid
medicines
Skin lotions
Calamine lotion
Caladryl lotion
Sunscreen lotion
Cosmetics
Paint
Rubber goods
Paper coating
Other products may also contain zinc oxide.
Symptoms
Zinc oxide poisoning can cause these symptoms:
Fever, chills
Cough
Diarrhea
Mouth and throat irritation
Nausea and vomiting
Stomach pain
Yellow eyes and skin
Most of the harmful effects of zinc oxide come from breathing in the gas form of zinc oxide at industrial sites in the chemical or welding industry. This leads to a condition known as metal fume fever. Symptoms of metal fume fever include a metallic taste in the mouth, fever, headache, chest pain, and shortness of breath. Symptoms start about 4 to 12 hours after breathing in the fumes and may result in serious injury to the lungs.
Home Care
If someone swallows a lot of zinc oxide, give them water or milk right away. Do NOT give water or milk if the person is vomiting or has a decreased level of alertness.
If the chemical is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.
If the chemical is breathed in (inhaled), move the person to fresh air.
Call your health care provider or poison control center.
Before Calling Emergency
Have this information ready:
Person's age, weight, and condition
Name of the product (as well as the ingredients and strength, if known)
Time it was swallowed
Amount swallowed
Poison Control
Your local
poison control center
can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States. This national hotline will let you talk to experts in poisoning. They will give you further instructions.
This is a free and confidential service. All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
What to Expect at the Emergency Room
Take the container with you to the hospital, if possible.
The provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated.
Tests that may be done include:
Blood and urine tests
Chest x-ray
ECG (electrocardiogram, or heart tracing)
Treatment may include:
Activated charcoal
Breathing support, which may include oxygen or a ventilator (tube through the mouth into the lungs and breathing machine)
Intravenous fluids (IV, given through a vein)
Laxative
Medicine to treat symptoms
Skin and eye washing if the product touched these tissues and they are irritated or swollen
Outlook (Prognosis)
Zinc oxide is not very poisonous if it is eaten. Long-term recovery is very likely. However, people who have had long-term exposure to metal fumes may develop serious lung disease.
