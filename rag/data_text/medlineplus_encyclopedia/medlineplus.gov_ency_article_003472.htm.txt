Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) blood test
To use the sharing features on this page, please enable JavaScript.
The aspartate aminotransferase (AST) blood test measures the level of the
enzyme
AST in the blood.
How the Test is Performed
A
blood sample
is needed.
How to Prepare for the Test
No special preparation is needed.
How the Test will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.
Why the Test is Performed
AST is an enzyme found in high levels in the liver, heart, and muscles. It is also found in lesser amounts in other tissues. An enzyme is a protein that causes a specific chemical change in the body.
Injury to the liver results in release of AST into the blood.
This test is mainly done along with other tests (such as
ALT
,
ALP
, and
bilirubin
) to diagnose and monitor
liver disease
.
Normal Results
The normal range is 8 to 33 U/L (0.13 to 0.55 Âµkat/L).
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
An increased AST level is often a sign of liver disease. Liver disease is even more likely when the levels of substances checked by other liver blood tests have also increased.
An increased AST level may be due to any of the following:
Scarring of the liver (
cirrhosis
)
Death of liver tissue
Heart attack
Too much iron in the body (
hemochromatosis
)
Swollen and inflamed liver (
hepatitis
)
Lack of blood flow to the liver (
liver ischemia
)
Liver cancer
or tumor
Use of medicines and drugs that are toxic to the liver, especially alcohol or acetaminophenÂ use
Mononucleosis
(mono)
Muscle disease or trauma
Swollen and inflamed pancreas (
pancreatitis
)
AST level may also increase after:
Burns (deep)
Heart procedures
Seizures
Surgery
Pregnancy and exercise may also cause an increased AST level.
Risks
There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:
Fainting or feeling lightheaded
Excessive bleeding
Multiple punctures to locate veins
Hematoma
(blood collecting under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
Alternative Names
Aspartate aminotransferase; Serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase; SGOT
