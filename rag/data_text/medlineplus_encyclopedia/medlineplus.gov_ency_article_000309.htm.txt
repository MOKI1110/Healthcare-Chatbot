Factitious hyperthyroidism

Factitious hyperthyroidism is higher-than-normal thyroid hormone levels in the blood and symptoms that suggest hyperthyroidism. It occurs from taking too much thyroid hormone medicine.
Hyperthyroidism is also known as overactive thyroid.
Causes
The thyroid gland produces the hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). In most cases of
hyperthyroidism
, the thyroid gland itself produces too much of these hormones.
Hyperthyroidism can also be caused by taking too much thyroid hormone medicine for
hypothyroidism
. This is called factitious hyperthyroidism. When this occurs because the prescribed dosage of hormone medicine is too high, it is called iatrogenic, or doctor-induced, hyperthyroidism. This is common. Sometimes this is intentional (for some people with depression or thyroid cancer), but often this happens because the dose is not adjusted based on follow-up blood tests.
Factitious hyperthyroidism can also occur when someone takes too much thyroid hormone on purpose and may conceal this. This is very uncommon. These may be people:
Who have mental disorders such as
Munchausen syndrome
Who are trying to lose weight
Who are being treated for depression or infertility
Children may take thyroid hormone pills accidentally.
Symptoms
The symptoms of factitious hyperthyroidism are the same as those of hyperthyroidism caused by a thyroid gland disorder, except that:
There is no
goiter
. The thyroid gland is often small.
The eyes do not bulge, as they do in
Graves disease
(the most common type of hyperthyroidism).
The skin over the shins does not thicken, as it sometimes does in people who have Graves disease.
Exams and Tests
Blood tests used to diagnose factitious hyperthyroidism include:
Free T4
Thyroglobulin
Total
T3
Total
T4
TSH
Other tests that may be done include
radioactive iodine uptake
or thyroid ultrasound.
Treatment
Your health care provider will tell you to stop taking thyroid hormone. If you need to take it, your provider will reduce the dosage.
You should be re-checked in 2 to 4 weeks to be sure that the signs and symptoms are gone. This also helps to confirm the diagnosis.
People with Munchausen syndrome will need mental health treatment and follow up.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Factitious hyperthyroidism will resolve on its own when you stop taking or lower the dosage of thyroid hormone.
Possible Complications
When factitious hyperthyroidism lasts a long time, the same complications as untreated or poorly treated hyperthyroidism may develop:
Abnormal heartbeat (
atrial fibrillation
)
Anxiety
Chest pain
(
angina
)
Heart attack
Loss of bone mass (if severe,
osteoporosis
)
Weight loss
Infertility
Problems sleeping
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of hyperthyroidism.
Prevention
Thyroid hormone should be taken only by prescription and under the supervision of a provider. Regular blood tests are often needed to help your provider adjust the dose you are taking.
