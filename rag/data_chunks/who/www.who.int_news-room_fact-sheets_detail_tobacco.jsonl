Tobacco use contributes to poverty by diverting household spending from basic needs such as food and shelter to tobacco. This spending behaviour is difficult to curb because tobacco is so addictive.\nThe economic costs of tobacco use are substantial and include significant health care costs for treating the diseases caused by tobacco use as well as the lost human capital that results from tobacco-attributable morbidity and mortality.\nKey measures to reduce the demand for tobacco\nSurveillance is key\nGood monitoring tracks the extent and character of the tobacco epidemic and indicates how best to tailor policies."}

There is no safe level of exposure to second-hand tobacco smoke.

They contain the highly addictive substance nicotine, non-tobacco additives and are often flavoured.\nDespite claims of “risk reduction”, there is no evidence to demonstrate that HTPs are less harmful than conventional tobacco products. Many toxicants found in tobacco smoke are at significantly lower levels in HTP aerosol but HTP aerosol contains other toxicants found sometimes at higher levels than in tobacco smoke, such as glycidol, pyridine, dimethyl trisulfide, acetoin and methylglyoxal.\nFurther, some toxicants found in HTP aerosols are not found in conventional cigarette smoke and may have associated health effects."}

ENDS contain varying amounts of nicotine and harmful emissions. Use of ENDS/ENNDS products is colloquially referred to as ‘vaping’.
