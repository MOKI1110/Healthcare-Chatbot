It manages the relationships between different actors and stakeholders involved in healthcare, including government agencies, healthcare providers, patients and their families, people and communities, civil society organizations and private sector entities.\nHealth systems governance means ensuring strategic policy frameworks exist and are combined with effective oversight, coalition-building, provision of appropriate regulations and incentives, attention to system design, and accountability.\nEffective health systems governance is essential for ensuring that healthcare services are accessible, equitable, efficient, affordable and of high quality for all."}

This requires efficient and equitable allocation of healthcare resources, the presence of policies and regulations guiding healthcare delivery, and mechanisms for monitoring, evaluating and reviewing the healthcare system’s performance.\nMoreover, health systems governance plays a crucial role in promoting equity and social justice in healthcare. It strives to ensure that the healthcare system is responsive to the needs of all members of society, regardless of their socioeconomic status, ethnicity, culture, gender or other factors.\nWHO Response\nIn the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) agenda, WHO is committed to supporting countries to exercise effective health systems governance, with a specific focus on strengthening the capacity of governments to formulate and implement strategies that will lead to the realization of UHC by 2030.\nIn line with the Thirteenth General Programme of Work 2019–2023, WHO works collaboratively across its three organizational levels, adopting"}

Improvements in health systems governance will support achieving results in both health and non-health-related SDGs, such as ending poverty (SDG 1), achieving gender equality (SDG 5), reducing inequalities (SDG 10), building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions (SDG 16), etc.\nImpact\nFor WHO, health systems governance involves not only the development of policy tools, techniques and methods but also what policy looks like in practice, including its goals and intentions."}
