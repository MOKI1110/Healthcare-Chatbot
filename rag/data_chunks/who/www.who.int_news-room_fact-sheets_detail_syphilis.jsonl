If untreated, it can cause serious health issues.\nMany people with syphilis do not have symptoms or do not notice them.\nSyphilis is transmitted during oral, vaginal and anal sex, in pregnancy and through blood transfusion. Syphilis in pregnancy may lead to stillbirth, newborn death and babies born with syphilis (congenital syphilis).\nCorrect and consistent use of condoms during sex can prevent syphilis.\nRapid tests can provide results in a few minutes, which allows treatment initiation on the same clinic visit.\nSymptoms\nMany people with syphilis do not notice any symptoms. They can also go unnoticed by healthcare providers."}
