Infection is acquired when people come into contact with\nfresh water infested with the larval forms (cercariae) of parasitic\nblood flukes, known as schistosomes. The microscopic adult worms live in\nthe veins draining the urinary tract and intestines. Most of the eggs\nthey lay are trapped in the tissues and the body’s reaction to them can\ncause massive damage.\nSchistosomiasis affects almost 240 million people worldwide, and\nmore than 700 million people live in endemic areas. The infection is\nprevalent in tropical and sub-tropical areas, in poor communities\nwithout potable water and adequate sanitation. Urogenital\nschistosomiasis is caused by Schistosoma haematobium and intestinal\nschistosomiasis by any of the organisms\nS. guineensis, S. intercalatum, S. mansoni, S. japonicum\n, and\nS."}

In highly endemic\nareas, severe morbidity due to schistosomiasis can be prevented by\nregular treatment of at risk groups targeted based on community\ndiagnosis based on sentinel groups. Praziquantel has been safely\nco-administered with albendazole and ivermectin, in areas where these\ndrugs have been used separately for preventive chemotherapy.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of schistosomiasis are caused by the body’s reaction to the worms' eggs.\nIntestinal schistosomiasis can result in abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and blood in the stool."}

Liver enlargement is common in advanced cases, and is frequently associated with an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity and hypertension of the abdominal blood vessels. In such cases there may also be enlargement of the spleen.\nThe classic sign of urogenital schistosomiasis is haematuria (blood in urine). Fibrosis of the bladder and ureter, and kidney damage are sometimes diagnosed in advanced cases. Bladder cancer is another possible complication in the later stages. In women, urogenital schistosomiasis may present with genital lesions, vaginal bleeding, pain during sexual intercourse, and nodules in the vulva. In men, urogenital schistosomiasis can induce pathology of the seminal vesicles, prostate, and other organs. This disease may also have other long-term irreversible consequences, including infertility.\nThe economic and health effects of schistosomiasis are considerable and the disease disables more than it kills."}

In children, schistosomiasis can cause anaemia, stunting and a reduced ability to learn, although the effects are usually reversible with treatment.\nTreatment\nPraziquantel is the recommended treatment against all forms of\nschistosomiasis. It is effective, safe, and low-cost. Even though\nre-infection may occur after treatment, the risk of developing severe\ndisease is diminished and even reversed when treatment is initiated and\nrepeated in childhood.\nSchistosomiasis control has been\nsuccessfully implemented over the past 40 years in several countries,\nincluding Brazil, Cambodia, China, Egypt, Mauritius, Islamic Republic of\nIran, Oman, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, Tunisia, etc. In Burundi,\nBurkina Faso, Ghana, Niger, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, the United Republic of\nTanzania, and Yemen, it has been possible to scale-up schistosomiasis\ntreatment to the national level and have an impact on the disease in a\nfew years."}
