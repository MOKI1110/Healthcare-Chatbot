It can cause mild to life-threatening illness in people of all ages, however it is the single largest infectious cause of death in children worldwide.\nPneumonia killed more than 808 000 children under the age of 5 in 2017, accounting for 15% of all deaths of children under 5 years.  People at-risk for pneumonia also include adults over the age of 65 and people with preexisting health problems.\nThe lungs are made up of small sacs called alveoli, which fill with air when a healthy person breathes. When an individual has pneumonia, the alveoli are filled with pus and fluid, which makes breathing painful and limits oxygen intake. These infections are generally spread by direct contact with infected people.\nVaccines can help prevent pneumonia.\nSymptoms\nDepending on the severity of the pneumonia, signs and symptoms may include:\nCough\nShortness of breath\nFever, sweating and shaking chills\nFatigue\nChest pain\nNausea, vomiting or diarrhea\nConfusion, especially in older adults\nTreatment\nPneumonia may be treated with antibiotics, if it is bacterial."}

The antibiotic of choice is amoxicillin dispersible tablets. Most cases of pneumonia require oral antibiotics, which are often prescribed at a health centre. These cases can also be diagnosed and treated with inexpensive oral antibiotics at the community level by trained community health workers. Hospitalization is recommended only for severe cases of pneumonia.\nRest and plenty of hydration can also help people recover quicker.\nPeople of all ages can reduce their risk of pneumonia by:\nGet vaccinated: Immunization against Hib, pneumococcus, measles, influenza and whooping cough (pertussis) is the most effective way to prevent pneumonia.\nWash your hands: Maintain good hygiene and washing your hands frequently, especially when caring for others who are sick or after blowing your nose, will keep germs from spreading.\nAddress environmental factors: Reduce indoor air pollution by providing affordable clean indoor stoves and stop smoking.\nMaintain healthy lifestyle: Eat a healthy diet, rest a"}
