It causes confusion and risk-taking behaviours that can harm health. It also leads to mistrust\nin health authorities and undermines the public health response. An infodemic can intensify or lengthen outbreaks when people are unsure about what they need to do to protect their health and the health of people around them.\nWith growing digitization – an expansion of social media and internet use – information can spread more rapidly."}
