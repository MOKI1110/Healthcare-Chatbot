This type of violence constitutes a violation of human\nrights and includes physical, sexual, psychological and emotional abuse; financial and material abuse; abandonment; neglect; and serious loss of dignity and respect.\nScope of the problem\nAbuse of older people is an important public health problem. A 2017 review of 52 studies in 28 countries from diverse regions estimated that over the past year 1 in 6 people (15.7%) aged 60 years and older were subjected to some form of abuse\n(1)\n. Although\nrigorous data are limited, the review provides prevalence estimates of the proportion of older people affected by different types of abuse (see Table 1).\nData on the extent of the problem in institutions such as hospitals, nursing homes\nand other long-term care facilities are scarce."}

Even if the proportion of victims of abuse of older people remains constant, the global number of victims will increase rapidly due to population\nageing, growing to some 320 million victims by 2050, as the global population of people aged 60 years and more increases to 2 billion by 2050.\nConsequences\nAbuse of older people can have serious physical and mental health, financial, and social consequences, including, for instance, physical injuries, premature mortality, depression, cognitive decline, financial devastation and placement in nursing homes."}

Individual level characteristics which increase\nthe risk of becoming a perpetrator of abuse include mental illness, substance abuse and dependency – often financial – of the abuser on the victim. At the relationship level, the type of relationship (e.g., spouse/partner or child/parent)\nand marital status may be associated with an elevated risk of abuse, but these factors vary by country and region. Community- and societal-level factors linked to elder abuse may include ageism against older people and certain cultural norms (e.g.,\nnormalization of violence)."}

Strategies considered most promising include caregiver interventions, which provide services\nto relieve the burden of caregiving; money management programmes for older adults vulnerable to financial exploitation; helplines and emergency shelters; and multi-disciplinary teams, as the responses required often cut across many systems, including\ncriminal justice, health care, mental health care, adults protective services and long-term care (\n5\n).\nIn some countries, the health sector has taken a leading role in raising public concern about abuse of older people, while in others the social welfare sector has taken the lead."}
