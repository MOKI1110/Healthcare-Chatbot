In the case of cystic echinococcosis preventive measures also include, deworming dogs, slaughterhouse hygiene, and public education.\nMore than 1 million people are affected with echinococcosis at any one time.\nHuman echinococcosis is a zoonotic disease (a disease that is transmitted to humans from animals) that is caused by parasites, namely tapeworms of the genus\nEchinococcus\n."}

Echinococcosis occurs in 4 forms:\ncystic echinococcosis, also known as hydatid disease or hydatidosis, caused by infection with a species complex centred on\nEchinococcus granulosus\n;\nalveolar echinococcosis, caused by infection with\nE. multilocularis\n;\ntwo forms of neotropical echinococcosis: polycystic caused by infection with\nE. vogeli\n; and\nunicystic caused by\nE. oligarthrus\n.\nThe two most important forms, which are of medical and public health relevance in humans, are cystic echinococcosis (CE) and alveolar echinococcosis (AE).\nTransmission\nA number of herbivorous and omnivorous animals act as intermediate hosts of\nEchinococcus\n. They become infected by ingesting the parasite eggs in contaminated food and water, and the parasite then develops into larval stages in the viscera.\nCarnivores act as definitive hosts for the parasite, and harbour the mature tapeworm in their intestine."}

Some genotypes are considered species distinct from\nE. granulosus\n. Not all genotypes cause infections in humans. The genotype\ncausing the great majority of cystic echinococcosis infections in humans is principally maintained in a dog–sheep–dog cycle, yet several other domestic animals may also be involved, including goats, swine, cattle, camels and yaks.\nAlveolar echinococcosis usually occurs in a wildlife cycle between foxes or other carnivores  with small mammals (mostly rodents) acting as intermediate hosts."}

Clinical signs include weight loss, abdominal pain, general\nmalaise and signs of hepatic failure.\nLarval metastases may spread either to organs adjacent to the liver (for example, the spleen) or distant locations (such as the lungs, or the brain) following dissemination of the parasite via the blood and lymphatic system.
