However, since 2007, outbreaks of Zika virus disease have been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific.\nDuring outbreaks over the last decade, Zika virus infection was found to be associated with increased incidence of Guillain-Barré syndrome."}

Similar findings were observed in French Polynesia upon retrospective review. From February to November 2016, WHO declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) regarding microcephaly, other neurological disorders and Zika virus, and the causal link between Zika virus and congenital malformations was confirmed soon thereafter\n(1,2)\n.

These clinical features are collectively referred to as congenital Zika syndrome.\nThe risk of congenital malformations following infection in pregnancy remains unknown; an estimated 5–15% of infants born to women infected with Zika virus during pregnancy have evidence of Zika-related complications\n(3)\n.
