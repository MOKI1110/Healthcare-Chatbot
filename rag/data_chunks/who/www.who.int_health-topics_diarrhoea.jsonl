The most severe threat posed by diarrhoea is dehydration. During an episode of diarrhoea, water and electrolytes including sodium, chloride, potassium and bicarbonate are lost through liquid stools, vomit, sweat, urine and breathing. A person with diarrhoea becomes dehydrated when these losses are not replaced. In addition, diarrhoea is a major cause of malnutrition, making the person more susceptible to future bouts of diarrhoea and to other diseases.\nThere are three clinical types of diarrhoea, each with its specific treatments:\nAcute watery diarrhoea, which may last several hours or days, and includes      cholera.\nAcute bloody diarrhoea, also called dysentery.\nPersistent diarrhoea, lasting 14 days or longer.\nIn the past, for most children, severe dehydration and fluid loss were the main causes of dying from diarrhoea."}

Now, other causes such as septic bacterial infections are likely to account for an increasing proportion of all diarrhoea-associated deaths.\nExclusive breastfeeding is protective and prevents diarrhoea from occurring in young children. Breastfeeding also reduces the severity of diarrhoea.\nInnovative activities and demand creation are important for achieving behaviour change and sustaining long-term preventive practices to combat preventable morbidity and mortality from diarrhoeal diseases.\nSymptoms\nDiarrhoea is the passage of 3 or more loose or liquid stools per day, or more frequently than is normal for the individual. It is usually a symptom of gastrointestinal infection, which can be caused by a variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms."}
