The vast majority occur in low- and middle-income countries.\nNon-fatal burn injuries are a leading cause of morbidity.\nBurns occur mainly in the home and workplace.\nBurns are preventable.\nOverview\nA burn is an injury to the skin or other organic tissue primarily caused by heat or due to radiation, radioactivity, electricity, friction or contact with chemicals.\nThermal (heat) burns occur when some or all the cells in the skin or other tissues are destroyed by:\nhot liquids (scalds)\nhot solids (contact burns)\nflames (flame burns).\nThe problem\nBurns are a global public health problem, accounting for an estimated 180 000 deaths annually."}

The majority of these occur in low- and middle-income countries and almost two thirds occur in the WHO African and South-East Asia Regions.\nIn many high-income countries, burn death rates have been decreasing, and the rate of child deaths from burns is currently over 7 times higher in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.\nNon-fatal burns are a leading cause of morbidity, including prolonged hospitalization, disfigurement and disability, often with resulting stigma and rejection.\nBurns are among the leading causes of disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) lost in low- and middle-income countries.\nHospitalization for burns varies by country and is influenced by health service payment programmes, but among countries studied hospitalization trends are going towards shorter stays and an increased proportion of burns being treated in specialized burn centres\n(1).\nSome country data\nIn India, over 1 million people are moderately or severely burnt every year.\nNearly 17"}

Indirect costs such as lost wages, prolonged care for deformities and emotional trauma, and commitment of family resources, also contribute to the socioeconomic impact.\nWho is at risk?\nGender\nFemales have slightly higher rates of death from burns compared to males according to the most recent data. This contrasts with the usual injury pattern, where rates of injury for the various injury mechanisms tend to be higher in males than females.\nThe higher risk for females is associated with open fire cooking, or inherently unsafe cookstoves, which can ignite loose clothing. Open flames used for heating and lighting also pose risks, and self-directed or interpersonal violence are also factors (although understudied).\nAge\nAlong with adult women, children are particularly vulnerable to burns. Burns are the fifth most common cause of non-fatal childhood injuries."}

Burns are the fifth most common cause of non-fatal childhood injuries. While a major risk is improper adult supervision, a considerable number of burn injuries in children result from child maltreatment.\nRegional factors\nThere are important regional differences in burn rates.\nChildren under 5 years of age in the WHO African Region have over 2 times the incidence of burn deaths than children under 5 years of age worldwide.\nBoys under 5 years of age living in low- and middle-income countries of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region are almost 2 times as likely to die from burns as boys living in the WHO European Region.\nThe incidence of burn injuries requiring medical care is nearly 20 times higher in the WHO Western Pacific Region than in the WHO Region of the Americas.\nSocioeconomic factors\nPeople living in low- and middle-income countries are at higher risk for burns than people living in high-income countries."}

Community surveys in Bangladesh and Ethiopia show that 80–90% of burns occur at home. Children and women are usually burned in domestic kitchens, from upset receptacles containing hot liquids or flames, or from cookstove explosions. Men are most likely to be burned in the workplace due to fire, scalds, chemical and electrical burns.\nPrevention\nBurns are preventable. High-income countries have made considerable progress in lowering rates of burn deaths, through a combination of prevention strategies and improvements in the care of people affected by burns. Most of these advances in prevention and care have been incompletely applied in low- and middle-income countries. Increased efforts to do so would likely lead to significant reductions in rates of burn-related death and disability.\nPrevention strategies should address the hazards for specific burn injuries, education for vulnerable populations and training of communities in first aid."}
