The quality of life of caregivers improves as well.\nEach year, an estimated 56.8 million people, including 25.7 million in the last year of life, are in need of palliative care.\nWorldwide, only about 14% of people who need palliative care currently receive it.\nUnnecessarily restrictive regulations for morphine and other essential controlled palliative medicines deny access to adequate palliative care.\nAdequate national policies, programmes, resources, and training on palliative care among health professionals are urgently needed in order to improve access.\nThe global need for palliative care will continue to grow as a result of the ageing of populations and the rising burden of noncommunicable diseases and some communicable diseases.\nEarly delivery of palliative care reduces unnecessary hospital admissions and the use of health services.\nPalliative care involves a range of services delivered by a range o"}

It prevents and relieves suffering through the early identification, correct assessment and treatment of pain and other problems, whether physical, psychosocial or spiritual.\nAddressing suffering involves taking care of issues beyond physical symptoms. Palliative care uses a team approach to support patients and their caregivers. This includes addressing practical needs and providing bereavement counselling. It offers a support system to help patients live as actively as possible until death.\nPalliative care is explicitly recognized under the human right to health."}

It should be provided through person-centered and integrated health services that pay special attention to the specific needs and preferences of individuals.\nPalliative care is required for a wide range of diseases. The majority of adults in need of palliative care have chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases (38.5%), cancer (34%), chronic respiratory diseases (10.3%), AIDS (5.7%) and diabetes (4.6%). Many other conditions may require palliative care, including kidney failure, chronic liver disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson’s disease, rheumatoid arthritis, neurological disease, dementia, congenital anomalies and drug-resistant tuberculosis.\nPain and\ndifficulty in breathing are two of\nthe most frequent and serious symptoms experienced by patients in need of palliative care."}
