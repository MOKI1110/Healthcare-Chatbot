In 2023, 1.1 billion people in the world were aged 60 years or over. That figure is projected to nearly double to 2.1 billion by 2050, representing around one in five people globally. By the late 2060s, the number of persons aged 60 years and over will reach 2.5 billion and surpass the number of under-18-year-olds in the world. The number of people aged 80 years or older is expected to more than triple between 2023 and 2060 to reach 545 million (1).\nOlder adults contribute to society as family and community members, and many are volunteers and workers."}

While most have good health, many are at risk of developing mental health conditions such as depression and anxiety disorders. Many may also experience reduced mobility, chronic pain, frailty, dementia or other health problems, for which they require some form of long-term care. As people age, they are more likely to experience several conditions at the same time.\nPrevalence\nAround 14.1% of adults aged 70 and over live with a mental disorder (2). According to the\nGlobal Health Estimates (GHE)\n2021, these conditions account for 6.8% of the total years lived with disability among older adults aged 70 years or more. The most common mental health conditions for older adults are depression and anxiety."}

The most common mental health conditions for older adults are depression and anxiety. GHE 2021 shows that globally, around a sixth of deaths from suicide (16.6%) are among people aged 70 or over.\nMental health conditions among older people are often underrecognized and undertreated, and the stigma surrounding these conditions can make people reluctant to seek help.\nRisk factors\nAt older ages, mental health is shaped not only by physical and social environments but also by the cumulative impacts of earlier life experiences and specific stressors related to ageing. Exposure to adversity, significant loss in intrinsic capacity and a decline in functional ability can all result in psychological distress.\nOlder adults are more likely to experience adverse events such as bereavement, or a drop in income or reduced sense of purpose with retirement."}

Despite their many contributions to society, many older adults are subject to\nageism, which can seriously affect people’s mental health.\nSocial isolation and loneliness, which affect about a quarter of older people, are key risk factors for mental health conditions in later life (3). So too is\nabuse of older people, which includes any kind of physical, verbal, psychological, sexual or financial abuse, as well as neglect. One in six older adults experience abuse, often by their own carers\n(4)\n. Abuse of older adults has serious consequences and can lead to depression and anxiety.\nMany older people are carers of spouses with chronic health conditions, such as dementia. The responsibilities of such care can be overwhelming and can affect the carer’s mental health.\nSome older adults are at greater risk of depression and anxiety, because of dire living conditions, poor physical health or lack of access to quality support and services."}

This includes older adults living in humanitarian settings and those living with chronic illnesses (such as heart disease, cancer or stroke), neurological conditions (such as dementia), or substance use problems.\nPromotion and prevention\nMental health promotion and prevention strategies for older adults focus on supporting healthy ageing. That means creating physical and social environments that support well-being and enable people to do what is important to them, despite losses in capacity.\nKey mental health promotion and prevention strategies for healthy ageing include:\nmeasures to reduce financial insecurity and income inequality;\nprogrammes to ensure safe and accessible housing, public buildings and transport;\nsocial support for older adults and their carers;\nsupport for healthy behaviours, especially to eat a balanced diet, be physically active, refrain from tobacco and reduce alcohol use; and\nhealth and social programmes targeted at vulnerable groups such as those who live alone"}

At this stage of life, meaningful social activities can significantly improve positive mental health, life satisfaction and quality of life; they can also reduce depressive symptoms. Example interventions include befriending initiatives, community and support groups, social skills training, creative arts groups, leisure and education services and volunteering programmes (3).\nProtection from ageism and abuse is also critical.

This should follow standards for\nintegrated care for older people, which is community-based and focused on both the long-term care of older adults living with mental health conditions and declines in intrinsic capacity, as well as the education, training and support of carers.
