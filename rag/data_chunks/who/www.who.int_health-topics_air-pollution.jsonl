Pollutants of major public health concern include particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Outdoor and indoor air pollution cause respiratory and other diseases and are important sources of morbidity and mortality.\nWHO data show that almost all of the global population (99%) breathe air that exceeds\nWHO guideline limits\nand contains high levels of\npollutants\n, with low- and middle-income countries suffering from the highest exposures.\nAir quality is closely linked to the earth’s climate and ecosystems globally. Many of the drivers of air pollution (i.e. combustion of fossil fuels) are also sources of greenhouse gas emissions."}

Many of the drivers of air pollution (i.e. combustion of fossil fuels) are also sources of greenhouse gas emissions. Policies to reduce air pollution, therefore, offer a win-win strategy for both climate and health, lowering the burden of disease attributable to air pollution, as well as contributing to the near- and long-term mitigation of climate change.\nImpact\nFrom smog hanging over cities to smoke inside the home, air pollution poses a major\nthreat to health\nand climate.\nAmbient (outdoor) air pollution in both cities and rural areas is causing fine particulate matter which result in strokes, heart diseases, lung cancer, acute and chronic respiratory diseases.\nAdditionally, around 2.4 billion people are exposed to dangerous levels of household air pollution, while using polluting open fires or simple stoves for cooking fuelled by kerosene, biomass (wood, animal dung and crop waste) and coal.\nThe combined effects of ambient air pollution and household air pollution is associated with 7 million premature deaths annually.\nSources of air pollution are multiple and context specific."}
