It is preventable and curable. There are 5 parasite species that cause malaria in humans, and 2 of these species –\nPlasmodium falciparum\nand\nPlasmodium vivax\n– pose the greatest threat.\nIn 2023, nearly half of the world's population was at risk of malaria. While sub-Saharan Africa carries a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden, the WHO Regions of South-East Asia and Eastern Mediterranean, Western Pacific, and the Americas also report significant numbers of cases .\nThere were an estimated 263 million cases of malaria in 2023, and the estimated number of malaria deaths stood at 597 000. In 2023, the African Region was home to 94% and 95% of malaria cases and deaths, respectively.\nChildren under 5 years of age are most at risk of severe complications from malaria; in 2023, they accounted for nearly 76% of all malaria deaths in the WHO African Region.\nSymptoms\nMalaria is an acute febrile illness."}

In a non-immune individual, symptoms usually appear 10–15 days after the infective mosquito bite. The first symptoms – fever, headache and chills – may be mild and difficult to recognize as malaria. If not treated within 24 hours,\nPlasmodium falciparum\nmalaria can progress to severe illness, and lead to death.\nChildren with severe malaria frequently develop one or more of the following symptoms: severe anaemia, respiratory distress in relation to metabolic acidosis, or cerebral malaria. In adults, multi-organ failure is also frequent. In malaria endemic areas, people may develop partial immunity, allowing asymptomatic infections to occur.\nSome people are at considerably higher risk of contracting malaria and developing severe disease than others. These include infants, children under 5 years of age, pregnant women and patients with HIV and AIDS, as well as non-immune migrants, mobile populations and travellers."}

These include infants, children under 5 years of age, pregnant women and patients with HIV and AIDS, as well as non-immune migrants, mobile populations and travellers. National malaria control programmes need to take special measures to protect people at higher risk of malaria infection, taking into consideration their specific circumstances.\nTreatment\nMalaria is a preventable and treatable disease. Early diagnosis and treatment of malaria reduces disease and prevents deaths, and also contributes to reducing transmission. The best available treatment, particularly for\nPlasmodium falciparum\nmalaria, is artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT). Antimalarial medicines can also be used to prevent malaria.\nFor travellers, malaria can be prevented through chemoprophylaxis, which suppresses the blood stage of malaria infections, thereby preventing malaria disease."}
