Approximately half of those deaths, 2.4 million, occurred among newborns (in the first 28 days of life).\nWhile the global under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) fell to 37 deaths per 1000 live births in 2020, children in sub-Saharan continued to have the highest rates of mortality in the world at 74 deaths per 1000 live births- 14 times higher than the risk for children in Europe and North America.\nThe leading causes of death in children under 5 years are preterm birth complications, birth asphyxia/trauma, pneumonia, diarrhoea and malaria, all of which can be prevented or treated with access to affordable interventions in health and sanitation.\nSARS-CoV-2 infections among children and adolescents typically cause less severe illness and fewer deaths as compared to adults."}

The total number of under-5 deaths worldwide has declined from 12.6 million in 1990 to 5 million in 2020.
