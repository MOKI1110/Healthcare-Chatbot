Around 1 in 6 people who get this type of meningitis die and 1 in 5 have severe complications.\nEpidemics of meningitis are seen across the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.\nVaccines are the most effective way to deliver long-lasting protection.\nOverview\nMeningitis is the inflammation of the tissues surrounding the brain and spinal cord. It can be infectious or non-infectious in origin, can be associated with high risk of death and long-term complications, and requires urgent medical care.\nMeningitis remains a significant global health threat. It can be caused by several species of bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites. Injuries, cancers and drugs cause a small number of cases.\nBacterial meningitis is the most serious type of meningitis."}

Injuries, cancers and drugs cause a small number of cases.\nBacterial meningitis is the most serious type of meningitis.

There are four main causes of acute bacterial meningitis:\nNeisseria meningitidis\n(meningococcus)\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n(pneumococcus)\nHaemophilus influenzae\nStreptococcus agalactiae\n(group B streptococcus).\nThese bacteria are responsible for more than half of the deaths from meningitis globally and can cause other severe diseases like sepsis and pneumonia.\nAdditional important causes of meningitis worldwide include other bacteria species (e.g.\nMycobacterium tuberculosis\n, non-typhoidal\nSalmonella spp\n, Listeria monocytogenes), viruses (e.g. enteroviruses, herpesviruses an arboviruses), fungi (e.g.\nCyptococcus spp.),\nand parasites (e.g. some species of amoebae).\nWho is at risk?\nMeningitis can affect anyone anywhere, and at any age."}

The pathogens that cause it can vary, based on a person’s age and immune system, and level of exposure to risk, which can be influenced by their living conditions and geographical location.\nNewborn babies are most at risk from Group B streptococcus, whereas children and adolescents are at most risk of meningococcus, pneumococcus and\nHaemophilus influenzae\n. Pneumococcus and meningococcus also account for most cases of bacterial meningitis among adults.\nImmunocompromised and/or people living with HIV are at increased risk of different types of meningitis.\nGlobally, the highest burden of disease is seen in a region of sub-Saharan Africa, known as the African meningitis belt, which stretches from Senegal to Ethiopia, and is at high risk of recurrent epidemics of meningococcal meningitis.\nMeningococcal meningitis outbreaks occur more frequently under special risk conditions, such as crowded settings where people are in close proximity, mining areas, mass gatherings, such as religious or sp"}

Antibiotics for prevention (chemoprophylaxis)\nPost-exposure prophylaxis with antibiotics is given to close contacts of individuals with meningococcal disease to eradicate asymptomatic meningococcal carriage in the nose and decrease the risk of transmission.\nIdentifying mothers whose babies are at risk of getting Group B streptococcal (GBS) disease is recommended in many countries.
