It is estimated that by 2050 over 700 million people –\nor 1 in every 10 people – will have disabling hearing loss.\nDisabling hearing loss refers to hearing loss greater than 35 decibels (dB) in the better hearing ear. Nearly 80% of people with disabling hearing loss live in low- and middle-income countries."}

Nearly 80% of people with disabling hearing loss live in low- and middle-income countries. The prevalence of hearing loss increases\nwith age, among those older than 60 years, over 25% are affected by disabling hearing loss.\nHearing loss and deafness\nA person who is not able to hear as well as someone with normal hearing – hearing thresholds of 20 dB or better in both ears – is said to have hearing loss. Hearing loss may be mild, moderate, moderately severe, severe or profound. It can affect one ear or both ears and leads to difficulty in hearing conversational speech or loud sounds.\nHard of hearing refers to people with hearing loss ranging from mild to severe. People who are hard of hearing usually communicate through spoken language and can benefit from hearing aids, cochlear implants, and other assistive devices as well as captioning.\nDeaf people mostly have profound hearing loss, which implies very little or no hearing. They can benefit from cochlear implants."}
