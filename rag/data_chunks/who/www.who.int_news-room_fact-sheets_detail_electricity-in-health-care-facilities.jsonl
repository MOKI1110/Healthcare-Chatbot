Electricity is crucial for the availability and reliability of essential health services, as well as for bettering health, with outcomes such as safe childbirth, vaccination, diagnostic capacity and emergency response.\nIn low- and lower-middle-income countries of South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, approximately 12% and 15% of health-care facilities, respectively, have no access to electricity.\nIn sub-Saharan Africa, only half of hospitals have reliable electricity access.\nThe energy access challenge is higher for health-care facilities in remote and rural areas.\nOverview\nElectricity is needed to power the most basic services in health-care facilities, from lighting and communications to clean water supply."}

Reliable energy provision – particularly electricity – is a major enabler of universal health coverage. A number of clean and cost-effective energy solutions, such as based on solar photovoltaic systems, are available and rapidly deployable to electrify health-care facilities sustainably and increase their climate resiliency.\nYet, as highlighted in the\nreport\nEnergizing health: accelerating electricity access in health-care facilities\n, close to 1 billion people in low- and lower-middle-income countries are estimated to be served by health-care facilities without reliable electricity access or with no electricity access at all."}
