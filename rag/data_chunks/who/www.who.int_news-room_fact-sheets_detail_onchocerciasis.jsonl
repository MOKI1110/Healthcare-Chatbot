Aegler/The End Fund\nPeople affected by onchocerciasis (river blindness) develop eye lesions which can lead to visual impairment and permanent blindness.\n©\nCredits\nOnchocerciasis\n29 January 2025\nKey facts\nOnchocerciasis, commonly known as “river blindness”, is caused by the parasitic worm\nOnchocerca volvulus.\nThe parasite is spread and transmitted to humans by the repeated bites of infected blackflies that breed in rapidly flowing rivers.\nSymptoms include severe itching, disfiguring skin conditions, and visual impairment, including permanent blindness.\nThe disease primarily affects rural populations in sub-Saharan Africa, and Yemen, with smaller endemic areas foci found in parts of Latin America.\nPopulation-based treatment with ivermectin (also known as mass drug administration or MDA) is the current core strategy to eliminate onchocerciasis, with a minimum requirement of 80% therapeutic coverage. Ivermectin is donated by Merck under the brand name of Mectizan®.\nOverview\nOnchocerciasis is transmitted to humans through the bite of an infected blackfly of the genus\nSimulium\n, which breeds in fast-flowing rivers and streams."}

The blackfly vector ingests microfilariae (immature worms) when it bites an infected person. Inside the fly, the microfilariae develop into infective larvae that are then transmitted to another human during subsequent bites. Once inside the human host, the larvae mature into adult worms, forming nodules under the skin. As they continue to mate and produce microfilariae, communities must be treated for a minimum of 10 to15 years to eliminate transmission, corresponding to the lifespan of the adult\nO. volvulus.\nScope of the problem\nMore than 99% of infected people live in Africa and Yemen; the remaining 1% live on the border between Brazil and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of). In 2023 at least 249.5 million people required preventive treatment against onchocerciasis."}

The Global Burden of Disease Study estimated in 2017 that 14.6 million of the infected people already had skin disease and 1.15 million had vision loss.\nFive countries have been verified by WHO as free of onchocerciasis after successfully implementing elimination activities for decades: four in the region of the Americas: Colombia (2013), Ecuador (2014), Mexico (2015) and Guatemala (2016), and one in Africa: Niger (2025)\nIn 2022, Senegal has stopped treatment and is now under post-treatment surveillance."}

Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Mali, Nigeria, Sudan, Tanzania, Togo, Uganda, and Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of) have stopped MDA in at least one focus.\nGlobally, 1.8 million people live in areas that no longer require MDA for onchocerciasis.\nThese milestones provide proof of concept that progress against neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) is possible across the entire African continent.\nDetailed information on 2023 annual statistics can be accessed in the\nWeekly Epidemiological Record, 11 October 2024.\nClinical signs and symptoms\nOnchocerciasis is an eye and skin disease. Symptoms are caused by the microfilariae, which move around the human body in the subcutaneous tissue and induce intense inflammatory responses when they die. Infected people may show symptoms such as severe itching and various skin changes. Infected people may also develop eye lesions which can lead to visual impairment and permanent blindness. In most cases, nodules under the skin form around the adult worms."}

Infected people may also develop eye lesions which can lead to visual impairment and permanent blindness. In most cases, nodules under the skin form around the adult worms. Early exposure to\nO. volvulus\ninfection is associated with epilepsy in children.\nPrevention, control and elimination programmes\nBetween 1974 and 2002, onchocerciasis was brought under control in west Africa through the work of the Onchocerciasis Control Programme (OCP), using mainly the spraying of insecticides against blackfly larvae (vector control) by helicopters and airplanes. This was later supplemented by large-scale distribution of ivermectin since 1989.\nThe African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control (APOC) was launched in 1995 with the objective of controlling onchocerciasis in the remaining endemic countries in Africa and closed at the end of 2015 after beginning the transition to onchocerciasis elimination."}
