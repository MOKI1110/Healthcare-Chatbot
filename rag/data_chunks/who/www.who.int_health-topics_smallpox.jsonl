It was one of the most devastating diseases known to humanity and caused millions of deaths before it was eradicated. It is believed to have existed\nfor at least 3000 years.\nThe smallpox vaccine, created by Edward Jenner in 1796, was the first successful vaccine to be developed. He observed that milkmaids who previously had caught cowpox did not catch smallpox and showed that a similar inoculation could be used to prevent\nsmallpox in other people.\nThe World Health Organization launched an intensified plan to eradicate smallpox in 1967. Widespread immunization and surveillance were conducted around the world for several years. The last known natural case was in Somalia in 1977. In 1980 WHO declared\nsmallpox eradicated – the only infectious disease to achieve this distinction. This remains among the most notable and profound public health successes in history.\nSymptoms\nEarly symptoms of smallpox include high fever, fatigue and severe back pain, and less often, abdominal pain and vomiting."}

Two to 3 days later the virus produces a characteristic rash with bumps full of a clear liquid, which later fill with pus and finally\ndevelop a crust that dries and falls off. The rash begins on the face and hands, then spreads to the rest of the body. Lesions develop in the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth and ulcerate soon after formation.\nSmallpox is transmitted from person to person via infective droplets during close contact with infected people who have symptoms of the disease, or in some cases through contaminated clothing and bedding. It has an incubation period of 7–17 days\nafter exposure and only becomes infectious once a fever develops. People remain infectious until the last scabs fall off.\nSmallpox was fatal in up to 30% of cases.\nWHO smallpox recognition card\nWHO response\nThe period since eradication has been defined by a lengthy and complex debate focussed on the destruction of the last remaining stocks of live variola virus."}
