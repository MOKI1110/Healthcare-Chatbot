It covers all chemicals, natural and manufactured, and the full range of exposure situations from\nthe natural presence of chemicals in the environment to their extraction or synthesis, industrial production, transport use and disposal.\nChemical safety has many scientific and technical components. Among these are toxicology, ecotoxicology and the process of chemical risk assessment which requires a detailed knowledge of exposure and of biological effects.\nThrough the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS), WHO works to establish the scientific basis for the sound management of chemicals, and to strengthen national capabilities and capacities for chemical safety.\nPublic health concern\nChemicals are part of our daily life. All living and inanimate matter is made up of chemicals and virtually every manufactured product involves the use of chemicals. Many chemicals can, when properly used, significantly contribute to the improvement of\nour quality of life, health and well-being."}

Many chemicals can, when properly used, significantly contribute to the improvement of\nour quality of life, health and well-being. But other chemicals are highly hazardous and can negatively affect our health and environment when improperly managed.\nThe production and use of chemicals continues to grow worldwide, particularly in developing countries. This is likely to result in greater negative effect on health if sound chemicals management is not ensured. Multisectoral action is urgently needed\nto protect human health from the harmful effects of improperly managed chemicals.\nWHO summarized scientific evidence and provides risk management recommendations for the\n10 chemicals or groups of chemicals of major public health concern\n.\nChemicals Road Map\nThe Seventieth World Health Assembly approved the\nRoad map\nto enhance health sector engagement in the strategic approach to international chemicals management towards the 2020 goal and beyond."}
