There are sub-categories of preterm birth, based on gestational age:\nextremely preterm (less than 28 weeks)\nvery preterm (28 to less than 32 weeks)\nmoderate to late preterm (32 to 37 weeks).\nBabies may be born preterm because of spontaneous preterm labour or because there is a medical indication to plan an induction of labour or caesarean birth early.\nAn estimated 13.4 million babies were born too early in 2020. That is more than 1 in 10 babies. Approximately 900 000 children die in 2019 of complications of preterm birth\n(1)\n."}

That is more than 1 in 10 babies. Approximately 900 000 children die in 2019 of complications of preterm birth\n(1)\n. Many survivors face a lifetime of disability, including learning disabilities and visual and hearing problems.\nGlobally, prematurity is the leading cause of death in children under the age of 5 years. Inequalities in survival rates around the world are stark. In low-income settings, half of the babies born at or below 32 weeks (2 months early) die due to a lack of feasible, cost-effective care such as warmth, breastfeeding support and basic care for infections and breathing difficulties. In high-income countries, almost all these babies survive. Suboptimal use of technology in middle-income settings is causing an increased burden of disability among preterm babies who survive the neonatal period.\nWhy does preterm birth happen?\nPreterm birth occurs for a variety of reasons."}

Most preterm births happen spontaneously, but some are due to medical reasons such as infections, or other pregnancy complications that require early induction of labour or caesarean birth.\nMore research is needed to determine the causes and mechanisms of preterm birth. Causes include multiple pregnancies, infections and chronic conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure; however, often no cause is identified. There could also be a genetic influence.\nWhere and when does preterm birth happen?\nThe majority of preterm births occur in southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, but preterm birth is truly a global problem. There is a dramatic difference in survival of premature babies depending on where they are born."}

There is a dramatic difference in survival of premature babies depending on where they are born. For example, more than 90% of extremely preterm babies (less than 28 weeks) born in low-income countries die within the first few days of life, yet less than 10% of extremely preterm babies die in high-income settings.\nThe solution\nPreventing deaths and complications from preterm birth starts with a healthy pregnancy. WHO’s antenatal care guidelines include key interventions to help prevent preterm birth, such as counselling on healthy diet, optimal nutrition, and tobacco and substance use; fetal measurements including use of early ultrasound to help determine gestational age and detect multiple pregnancies; and a minimum of 8 contacts with health professionals throughout pregnancy – starting before 12 weeks – to identify and manage risk factors such as infections.\nIf a woman experiences preterm labour or is at risk of preterm childbirth, treatments are available to help protect the preterm baby from future neurological impairment as well as difficulties with breathing and infection."}

These reflect new evidence that simple interventions such as kangaroo mother care immediately after birth, early initiation of breastfeeding, use of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and medicines such as caffeine for breathing problems can substantially reduce mortality in preterm and low birthweight babies.\nWHO guidance stresses the need to ensure the mother and family take the pivotal role in their baby’s care.
