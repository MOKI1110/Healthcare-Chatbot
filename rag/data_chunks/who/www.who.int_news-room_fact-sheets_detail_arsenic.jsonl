Skin lesions and skin cancer are the most characteristic effects.\nSources of exposure\nDrinking-water and food\nThe greatest threat to public health from arsenic originates from contaminated groundwater. Inorganic arsenic is naturally present at high levels in the groundwater of a number of countries, including Argentina, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Chile, China, India, Mexico, Pakistan, the United States of America and Viet Nam."}

In seafood, arsenic is mainly found in its less toxic organic form.\nIndustrial processes\nArsenic is used industrially as an alloying agent, as well as in the processing of glass, pigments, textiles, paper, metal adhesives, wood preservatives and ammunition. Arsenic is also used in the hide tanning process and, to a limited extent, in pesticides, feed additives and pharmaceuticals.\nTobacco\nPeople who smoke tobacco can also be exposed to the natural inorganic arsenic content of tobacco because tobacco plants can take up arsenic naturally present in the soil."}

The potential for elevated arsenic exposure was much greater in the past when tobacco plants were treated with lead arsenate insecticide.\nHealth effects\nInorganic arsenic is a confirmed carcinogen and is the most significant chemical contaminant in drinking-water globally. Arsenic can also occur in an organic form. Inorganic arsenic compounds (such as those found in water) are highly toxic while organic arsenic compounds (such as those found in seafood) are less harmful to health.\nAcute effects\nThe immediate symptoms of acute arsenic poisoning include vomiting, abdominal pain and diarrhoea. These are followed by numbness and tingling of the extremities, muscle cramping and death, in extreme cases.\nLong-term effects\nThe first symptoms of long-term exposure to high levels of inorganic arsenic (for example, through drinking-water and food) are usually observed in the skin, and include pigmentation changes, skin lesions and hard patches on the palms and soles of the feet (hyperkeratosis)."}

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified arsenic and arsenic compounds as carcinogenic to humans and has also stated that arsenic in drinking-water is carcinogenic to humans.\nOther adverse health effects that may be associated with long-term ingestion of inorganic arsenic include developmental effects, diabetes, pulmonary disease and cardiovascular disease. Arsenic-induced myocardial infarction in particular can be a significant cause of excess mortality.\nArsenic is also associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes and infant mortality, with impacts on child health\n(1)\n, and exposure in utero and in early childhood has been linked to increases in mortality in young adults due to multiple cancers, lung disease, heart attacks and kidney failure\n(2)\n."}

An estimated 140 million people in at least 70 countries have been drinking water containing arsenic at levels above the WHO provisional guideline value of 10 μg/L\n(4, 5)\n. This is consistent with recent statistical modelling which suggests between 94 and 220 million people are at risk of exposure to elevated arsenic concentrations in groundwater\n(6)\n.\nThe symptoms and signs caused by long-term elevated exposure to inorganic arsenic differ between individuals, population groups and geographical areas.

This complicates the assessment of the burden on health of arsenic.\nSimilarly, there is no method to distinguish cases of cancer caused by arsenic from cancers induced by other factors. As a result, there is no reliable estimate of the magnitude of the problem worldwide.\nIn 2010, the Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) re-evaluated the effects of arsenic on human health, taking new data into account. JECFA concluded that for certain regions of the world where concentrations of inorganic arsenic in drinking-water exceed 50–100 μg/L, there is some evidence of adverse effects. In other areas, where arsenic concentrations in water are elevated (10–50 μg/L), JECFA concluded that while there is a possibility of adverse effects."}

There are a number of options to reduce levels of arsenic in drinking-water.\nSubstitute high-arsenic      sources, such as groundwater, with low-arsenic, microbiologically safe      sources such as rainwater and treated surface water. Low-arsenic water can      be used for drinking, cooking and irrigation purposes, whereas      high-arsenic water can be used for other purposes such as bathing and      washing clothes.\nDiscriminate between      high-arsenic and low-arsenic sources.

Technologies for arsenic removal include oxidation,      coagulation-precipitation, absorption, ion exchange and membrane      techniques. There is an increasing number of effective and low-cost      options for removing arsenic from small or household supplies, though      there is still limited evidence about the extent to which such systems are      used effectively over sustained periods of time.\nLong-term actions are also required to reduce occupational exposure from industrial processes.\nEducation and community engagement are key factors for ensuring successful interventions."}

There is a need for community members to understand the risks of high arsenic exposure and the sources of arsenic exposure, including the intake of arsenic by crops (e.g. rice) from irrigation water and the intake of arsenic into food from cooking water.\nHigh-risk populations should also be monitored for early signs of arsenic poisoning – usually skin problems.\nWHO response\nArsenic is one of WHO’s 10 chemicals of major public health concern. WHO’s work to reduce arsenic exposure includes setting guideline values, reviewing evidence and providing risk management recommendations. WHO publishes a guideline value for arsenic in its\nGuidelines for drinking-water quality\n. The Guidelines are intended for use as the basis for regulation and standard setting worldwide.\nThe current recommended limit of arsenic in drinking-water is 10 μg/L, although this guideline value is designated as provisional because of practical difficulties in removing arsenic from drinking-water."}

Every effort should therefore be made to keep concentrations as low as reasonably possible and below the guideline value when resources are available.\nHowever, millions of people around the world are exposed to arsenic at concentrations much higher than the guideline value (100 μg/L or greater), and therefore the public health priority should be to reduce exposure for these people. Where it is difficult to achieve the guideline value, Member States may set higher limits or interim values as part of an overall strategy to progressively reduce risks, while taking into account local circumstances, available resources, and risks from low arsenic sources that are contaminated microbiologically.\nThe WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply, Sanitation and Hygiene monitors progress towards global targets on drinking water."}
