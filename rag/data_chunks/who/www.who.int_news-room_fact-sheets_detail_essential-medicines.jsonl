The Model List has also included more treatments for chronic and noncommunicable diseases, reflecting the changing global disease burden and aging populations.\nWhile the cost of a medicine is a consideration in the selection process, a high absolute cost of a medicine does not necessarily prevent it from being added to the WHO Model List if it otherwise meets the required selection criteria. Since 2002, affordability has evolved from being a precondition of listing a medicine on the Model list to being a consequence. Listing a medicine on the Model List is one step in a series of actions that can lead to lower costs, better affordability and greater access.\nThe number of patented medicines on the Model List has increased over time from 17/319 (5%) in 2003 to 82/502 (16%) in 2023.\nIn 2017, in response to the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance, the WHO Model List introduced the AWaRe (Access, Watch, Reserve) classification of antibiotics."}
