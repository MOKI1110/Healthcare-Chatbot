Saeedi\nTwo young girls and a boy with scars on their faces, caused by Leishmaniasis\n©\nCredits\nLeishmaniasis\n12 January 2023\nKey facts\nThere are 3 main forms of leishmaniases: visceral (the most serious form because it is almost always fatal without treatment), cutaneous (the most common, usually causing skin ulcers), and mucocutaneous (affecting mouth, nose and throat).\nLeishmaniasis is caused by protozoan parasites which are transmitted by the bite of infected female phlebotomine sandflies.\nThe disease affects some of the world’s poorest people and is associated with malnutrition, population displacement, poor housing, a weak immune system and lack of financial resources.\nAn estimated 700 000 to 1 million new cases occur annually.\nOnly a small fraction of those infected by parasites causing leishmaniasis will eventually develop the disease.\nOverview\nLeishmaniasis is caused by a protozoa parasite from over 20\nLeishmania\nspecies. Over 90 sandfly species are known to transmit\nLeishmania\nparasites. There are 3 main forms of the disease:\nVisceral leishmaniasis\n(VL), also known as kala-azar, is fatal if left untreated in over 95% of cases."}

There are 3 main forms of the disease:\nVisceral leishmaniasis\n(VL), also known as kala-azar, is fatal if left untreated in over 95% of cases. It is characterized by irregular bouts of fever, weight loss, enlargement of the spleen and liver, and anaemia. Most cases occur in Brazil, east Africa and India. An estimated 50 000 to 90 000 new cases of VL occur worldwide annually, with only 25–45% reported to WHO. It has outbreak and mortality potential.\nCutaneous leishmaniasis\n(CL) is the most common form and causes skin lesions, mainly ulcers, on exposed parts of the body. These can leave life-long scars and cause serious disability or stigma. About 95% of CL cases occur in the Americas, the Mediterranean basin, the Middle East and central Asia. It is estimated that 600 000 to 1 million new cases occur worldwide annually but only around 200 000 are reported to WHO.\nMucocutaneous leishmaniasis\nleads to partial or total destruction of mucous membranes of the nose, mouth and throat."}

Some 70 animal species, including humans, can be the source of\nLeishmania\nparasites.\nWHO regional specificities\nWHO African Region\nCutaneous Leishmaniasis is highly endemic in Algeria whereas in west Africa the epidemiological information is scarce. In east Africa all forms are endemic with outbreaks of visceral leishmaniasis occurring frequently.\nWHO Region of the Americas\nCutaneous leishmaniasis is the main form and the epidemiology is complex, with several animals being the source of the parasite, and numerous types of sandflies and multiple\nLeishmania\nspecies in the same geographical area."}

Imported cases are common, coming mainly from Africa and the Americas.\nWHO South-East Asia Region\nVisceral leishmaniasis is the main form of the disease, which is also endemic for cutaneous leishmaniasis.\nPost-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL)\nPost-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is usually a sequel of visceral leishmaniasis that appears as macular, papular or nodular rash usually on face, upper arms and trunk. It occurs in east Africa (mainly in Sudan) and on the Indian subcontinent, where 5–10% of patients with kala-azar are reported to develop the condition."}

It usually appears 6 months to 1 or more years after kala-azar has apparently been cured but can occur earlier. People with PKDL are considered a potential source of\nLeishmania\ninfection.\nLeishmania\n-HIV co-infection\nPeople living with HIV and who are infected with leishmaniasis\nhave high chances of developing the full-blown disease,  high relapse and mortality rates. Antiretroviral treatment reduces the development of the disease, delays relapses and increases the survival. As of 2021,\nLeishmania\n-HIV coinfection has been reported from 45 countries. High  coinfection rates are reported from Brazil, Ethiopia and the state of Bihar ( India).

Poor housing and domestic sanitary conditions (lack of waste management or open sewerage) may increase sandfly breeding and resting sites, as well as their access to humans. Sandflies are attracted to crowded housing because it is easier to bite people and feed on their blood. Human behaviour, such as sleeping outside or on the ground, may increase risk.\nMalnutrition\nDiets lacking protein-energy, iron, vitamin A and zinc increase the risk that an infection will progress to a full-blown disease.\nPopulation mobility\nEpidemics of leishmaniasis often occur when many people who are not immune move into areas where the transmission is high.\nEnvironmental and climate changes\nThe incidence of leishmaniasis can be affected by changes in urbanization, deforestation or the human incursion into forested areas.\nClimate change is affecting the spread of leishmaniasis though changes in temperature and rainfall, which affect the size and geographic distribution of sandfly populations."}

Drought, famine and flood also cause migration of people into areas where the transmission of the parasite is high.\nDiagnosis and treatment\nPeople suspected of suffering from visceral leishmaniasis should seek medical care immediately. In visceral leishmaniasis, diagnosis is made by combining clinical signs with parasitological or serological tests (such as rapid diagnostic tests). In cutaneous and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis serological tests have limited value and clinical manifestation with parasitological tests confirms the diagnosis.\nThe treatment of leishmaniasis depends on several factors including type of disease, concomitant pathologies, parasite species and geographic location. Leishmaniasis is a treatable and curable disease, which requires an immunocompetent system because medicines will not get rid of the parasite from the body, thus the risk of relapse if immunosuppression occurs. All patients diagnosed with visceral leishmaniasis require prompt and complete treatment."}

Key strategies include:\nEarly diagnosis and effective prompt treatment\nreduce the prevalence of the disease and prevents disabilities and death. It helps to reduce transmission and to monitor the spread and burden of disease. There are highly effective and safe anti-leishmanial medicines particularly for visceral leishmaniasis, although they can be difficult to use.
