Chlamydial infection also increases the risk of HIV infection and has been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes.\nOverview\nChlamydia is a common sexually transmitted infection that can occur in both men and women. It is caused by a bacterium called\nChlamydia trachomatis\n. It is easily treated and cured with antibiotics.\nChlamydia is unlikely to lead to any long-term problems if treated early. However, without treatment, chlamydia can cause serious problems and may facilitate the transmission and acquisition of HIV and other STIs."}

However, without treatment, chlamydia can cause serious problems and may facilitate the transmission and acquisition of HIV and other STIs. If not treated, chlamydia can cause serious problems, including pelvic inflammatory disease and an increased risk of infertility and ectopic pregnancy. In pregnant women, it can cause the baby to be born early (prematurity) or with low birth weight.\nCorrect and consistent use of condoms during sex is the most effective way to prevent chlamydia.\nScope of the problem\nIn 2020, an estimated 128.5 million new infections with\nChlamydia trachomatis\noccurred worldwide among adults aged 15 to 49 years. The global prevalence among people aged 15–49 years was estimated to be 4.0% for women and 2.5% for men in 2020. Chlamydial infection is more common in young people. Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), caused by particular strains of\nChlamydia trachomatis,\nis relatively rare, but there has been a resurgence in some countries, especially among gay men and other men who have sex with men."}

If symptoms occur, they may not appear until up to three weeks after having sex with someone who has chlamydia.\nCommon symptoms in men include:\nburning when urinating\ndischarge from the penis\npain in the testicles.\nIn women, common symptoms include:\na change in vaginal discharge\nbleeding between menstrual periods or      after sex\npain or discomfort in the lower abdomen\nburning sensation when urinating.\nitch.\nAnal infection in women and men can cause anorectal:\npain\ndischarge\nbleeding.\nOral infection is most often without symptoms.\nInfants born to mothers with chlamydia may experience eye infections or pneumonia."}

Women may develop pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), can experience\nabdominal and pelvic pain, and in later stages develop infertility and ectopic\npregnancy (a pregnancy that occurs outside the womb).\nMen may develop a painful infection in their testicles (epididymitis,\nepididymo-orchitis)."}
