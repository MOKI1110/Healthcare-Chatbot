Infection occurs when filarial parasites are transmitted to humans through mosquitoes. Infection is usually acquired in childhood and causes hidden damage to the lymphatic system.\nThe painful and profoundly disfiguring visible manifestations of the disease – lymphoedema, elephantiasis and scrotal swelling – occur later in life and can lead to permanent disability."}

People affected by LF are not only physically disabled, but suffer mental, social and financial losses contributing to stigma and poverty.\nIn 2023, 657 million people in 39 countries were living in areas that require preventive chemotherapy to stop the spread of infection.\nThe global baseline estimate of people affected by lymphatic filariasis was 25 million men with hydrocele and over 15 million people with lymphoedema. At least 36 million people remain with these chronic disease manifestations. Eliminating lymphatic filariasis can prevent unnecessary suffering and contribute to the reduction of poverty.\nCause and transmission\nLymphatic filariasis is caused by infection with parasites classified as nematodes (roundworms) of the family Filariodidea."}

There are 3 types of these thread-like filarial worms:\nWuchereria bancrofti\n, which is responsible for 90% of the cases\nBrugia malayi\n, which causes most of the remainder of the cases\nBrugia timori\n, which also causes the disease.\nAdult worms nest in the lymphatic vessels and disrupt the normal function of the lymphatic system. The worms can live for approximately 6–8 years and, during their life time, produce millions of microfilariae (immature larvae) that circulate in the blood.\nMosquitoes are infected with microfilariae by ingesting blood when biting an infected host. Microfilariae mature into infective larvae within the mosquito. When infected mosquitoes bite people, mature parasite larvae are deposited on the skin, from where they can enter the body."}

Microfilariae mature into infective larvae within the mosquito. When infected mosquitoes bite people, mature parasite larvae are deposited on the skin, from where they can enter the body. The larvae then migrate to the lymphatic vessels where they develop into adult worms, thus continuing a cycle of transmission.\nLymphatic filariasis is transmitted by different types of mosquitoes, for example by the\nCulex\nmosquito, widespread across urban and semi-urban areas,\nAnopheles\n, mainly found in rural areas, and\nAedes\n, mainly in endemic islands in the Pacific.\nSymptoms\nLymphatic filariasis infection involves asymptomatic, acute and chronic conditions. The majority of infections are asymptomatic, showing no external signs of infection while contributing to the transmission of the parasite. These asymptomatic infections still cause damage to the lymphatic system and the kidneys and alter the body's immune system.\nWhen lymphatic filariasis develops into chronic conditions it leads to lymphoedema (tissue swelling) or elephantiasis (skin/tissue thickening) of limbs and hydrocele (scrotal swelling). Involvement of breasts and genital organs is common."}

Such body deformities often lead to social stigma and sub-optimal mental health, loss of income-earning opportunities and increased medical expenses for patients and their caretakers. The socioeconomic burdens of isolation and poverty are immense.\nAcute episodes of local inflammation involving skin, lymph nodes and lymphatic vessels often accompany chronic lymphoedema or elephantiasis. Some of these episodes are caused by the body's immune response to the parasite. Most are the result of secondary bacterial skin infection where normal defenses have been partially lost due to underlying lymphatic damage. These acute attacks are debilitating, may last for weeks and are the primary cause of lost wages among people suffering with lymphatic filariasis.\nTreatment\nElimination of lymphatic filariasis is possible by stopping the spread of the infection through preventive chemotherapy."}

The WHO recommended preventive chemotherapy strategy for lymphatic filariasis elimination is mass drug administration (MDA). MDA involves administering an annual dose of medicines to the entire at-risk population. The medicines used have a limited effect on adult parasites but effectively reduce the density of microfilariae in the bloodstream and prevent the spread of parasites to mosquitoes.\nThe MDA regimen recommended depends on the co-endemicity of lymphatic filariasis with other filarial diseases."}
