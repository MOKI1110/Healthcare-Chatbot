Fusco\n©\nCredits\nMercury\n24 October 2024\nKey facts\nMercury is a naturally occurring element that is found in air, water and soil.\nExposure to mercury – even small amounts – may cause serious health problems, and is a threat to the development of the child in utero and early in life.\nMercury may have toxic effects on the nervous, digestive and immune systems, and on lungs, kidneys, skin and eyes.\nMercury is considered by WHO as one of the top ten chemicals of major public health concern.\nPeople are mainly exposed to methylmercury, an organic compound, when they eat fish and shellfish that contain the compound.\nMethylmercury is very different to ethylmercury. Ethylmercury is contained in thiomersal as a preservative in some vaccines and does not pose a health risk.\nOverview\nMercury occurs naturally in the earth's crust. It is released into the environment from volcanic activity, weathering of rocks and as a result of human activity."}

It is released into the environment from volcanic activity, weathering of rocks and as a result of human activity. Human activity is the main cause of mercury releases, particularly coal-fired power stations, residential coal burning for heating and cooking, industrial processes, waste incinerators and as a result of mining for mercury, gold and other metals.\nOnce in the environment, mercury can be transformed by bacteria into methylmercury. Methylmercury then bioaccumulates (bioaccumulation occurs when an organism contains higher concentrations of the substance than do the surroundings) in fish and shellfish. For example, large predatory fish are more likely to have high levels of mercury as a result of eating many smaller fish.\nWho is at risk?\nMercury is toxic to human health, posing a particular threat to the development of the child in utero and early in life.\nAll humans are exposed to some level of mercury."}

Human exposure occurs mainly through inhalation of elemental mercury vapours during industrial processes and through consumption of contaminated fish and shellfish.\nIt has been estimated that among selected subsistence fishing populations, between 1.5/1000 and 17/1000 children showed cognitive impacts caused by the consumption of fish containing mercury\n(1)\n.\nSigns and symptoms\nMercury is toxic to human health, posing a particular threat to the development of the child in utero and early in life. Mercury exists in various forms: elemental (or metallic); inorganic (e.g. mercuric chloride); and organic (e.g. methyl- and ethylmercury), which all have different toxic effects, including on the nervous, digestive and immune systems, and on lungs, kidneys, skin and eyes.\nThe health impacts of mercury are numerous including kidney and nervous system damage and skin problems."}

Exposure of the fetus to methylmercury poses danger to the unborn child.\nThe inorganic salts of mercury are corrosive to the skin, eyes and gastrointestinal tract, and may induce kidney toxicity if ingested.\nNeurological and behavioural disorders may be observed after inhalation, ingestion or dermal exposure of different mercury compounds. Symptoms include tremors, insomnia, memory loss, neuromuscular effects, headaches and cognitive and motor dysfunction. Mild, subclinical signs of central nervous system toxicity can be seen in workers exposed to an elemental mercury level in the air of 20 μg/m3 or more for several years."}

Kidney effects have been reported, ranging from increased protein in the urine to kidney failure.\nPrevention and control\nInterventions to prevent environmental releases and human exposure include:\nEliminate mercury mining, and use of mercury in gold extraction and other industrial processes\nMercury is an element that cannot be destroyed; therefore, mercury already in use can be recycled for other essential uses, with no further need for mercury mining. Mercury use in artisanal and small-scale gold mining is particularly hazardous, and health effects on vulnerable populations are significant. Non-mercury (non-cyanide) gold-extraction techniques need to be promoted and implemented, and where mercury is still used safer work practices need to be employed to prevent exposure.\nPromote the use of clean energy sources that do not burn coal\nBurning coal for power and heat is a major source of mercury."}
