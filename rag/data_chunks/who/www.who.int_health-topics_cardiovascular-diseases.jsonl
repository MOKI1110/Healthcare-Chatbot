CVDs are a group\nof disorders of the heart and blood vessels and include coronary heart\ndisease, cerebrovascular disease, rheumatic heart disease and other conditions.\nMore than four out of five CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and\none third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of\nage.\nThe most important behavioural risk factors of heart disease and stroke are\nunhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol. Amongst\nenvironmental risk factors, air pollution is an important factor. The effects\nof behavioural risk factors may show up in individuals as raised blood\npressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids, and overweight and\nobesity."}

The effects\nof behavioural risk factors may show up in individuals as raised blood\npressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids, and overweight and\nobesity. These “intermediate risks factors” can be measured in primary care\nfacilities and indicate an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, heart\nfailure and other complications.\nCessation of tobacco use, reduction of salt in the diet, eating more fruit\nand vegetables, regular physical activity and avoiding harmful use of alcohol\nhave been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. Health policies\nthat create conducive environments for making healthy choices affordable and\navailable, as well as improving air quality and reducing pollution, are\nessential for motivating people to adopt and sustain healthy behaviours.\nIdentifying those at highest risk of CVDs and ensuring they receive\nappropriate treatment can prevent premature deaths."}

A heart attack or stroke may be the first sign of underlying disease. Symptoms of a heart attack include:\npain or discomfort in the centre of the chest; and/or\npain or discomfort in the arms, the left shoulder, elbows, jaw, or back.\nIn addition the person may experience difficulty in breathing or shortness of breath; nausea or vomiting; light-headedness or faintness; a cold sweat; and turning pale. Women are more likely than men to have shortness of breath, nausea, vomiting, and back or jaw pain.\nThe most common symptom of a stroke is sudden weakness of the face, arm, or leg, most often on one side of the body."}

Symptoms of rheumatic fever (which can cause rheumatic heart disease if not treated) include: fever, pain and swelling of the joints, nausea, stomach cramps and vomiting.\nTreatment\nWHO supports governments to prevent, manage and monitor CVDs by developing global strategies to reduce the incidence, morbidity and mortality of these diseases."}

These strategies include reducing risk factors, developing standards of care, enhancing health system capacity to care for patients with CVD, and monitoring disease patterns and trends to inform national and global actions.\nThe risk factors for CVD include behaviours such as tobacco use, an unhealthy diet, harmful use of alcohol and inadequate physical activity. They also include physiological factors, including high blood pressure (hypertension), high blood cholesterol and high blood sugar or glucose, which are linked to underlying social determinants and drivers such as ageing, income and urbanization.\nFact sheets\nCardiovascular diseases (CVDs)\nSodium reduction\nHypertension\nTechnical work\nNoncommunicable diseases, rehabilitation and disability\nNews\nAll →\n23 September 2025\nNews release\nUncontrolled high blood pressure puts over a billion people at risk\n19 May 2025\nNews release\nWHO recognizes four countries with life-saving trans fat elimination policies\n6 March 2025\nDepartmental updat"}
