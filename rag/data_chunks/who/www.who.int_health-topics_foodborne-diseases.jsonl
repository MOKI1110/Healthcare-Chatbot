This growing public health problem causes considerable socioeconomic impact though strains on health-care systems lost productivity, and harming tourism and trade. These diseases contribute\nsignificantly to the global burden of disease and mortality.\nFoodborne\ndiseases are caused by contamination of food and occur at any stage of the food production, delivery and consumption chain. They can result from several forms of environmental contamination including pollution in water, soil or air, as well as unsafe food storage and processing.\nFoodborne\ndiseases encompass a wide range of illnesses from diarrhoea to cancers.\nMost present as gastrointestinal issues, though they can also produce neurological, gynaecological and immunological symptoms."}

Diseases\ncausing diarrhoea are a major problem in all countries of the world,\nthough the burden is carried disproportionately by low- and\nmiddle-income countries and by children under 5 years of age.\nImpact\nEvery year, nearly one in 10\npeople around the world fall ill after eating contaminated food, leading to over 420 000 deaths. Children are disproportionately affected, with\n125 000 deaths every year in people under 5 years of age. The majority of these cases are caused by diarrhoeal diseases. Other serious consequences of foodborne diseases include kidney and liver failure,\nbrain and neural disorders, reactive arthritis, cancer, and death.\nFoodborne\ndiseases are closely linked to poverty in low- and middle-income\ncountries but are a growing public health issue around the world.\nIncreasing international trade and longer, more complex food chains increase the risk of food contamination and the transport of infected food products across national borders."}
