Infant and young child feeding is a key area to improve child survival and promote healthy growth and development. The first 2 years of a child’s life are particularly important, as optimal nutrition during this period lowers morbidity and mortality, reduces the risk of chronic disease, and fosters better development overall.\nOptimal breastfeeding is so critical that it could save the lives of over 820 000 children under the age of 5 years each year.\nWHO and UNICEF recommend:\nearly initiation of breastfeeding within 1 hour of birth;\nexclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life; and\nintroduction of nutritionally-adequate and safe complementary (solid) foods at 6 months together with continued breastfeeding"}

For example, only about 44% of infants aged 0–6 months worldwide were exclusively breastfed over the period of 2015-2020.\nRecommendations have been refined to also address the needs for infants born to HIV-infected mothers. Antiretroviral drugs now allow these children to exclusively breastfeed until they are 6 months old and continue breastfeeding until at least 12 months of age with a significantly reduced risk of HIV transmission.\nBreastfeeding\nExclusive breastfeeding for 6 months has many benefits for the infant and mother. Chief among these is protection against gastrointestinal infections which is observed not only in developing but also industrialized countries.

The risk of mortality due to diarrhoea and other infections can increase in infants who are either partially breastfed or not breastfed at all.\nBreast-milk is also an important source of energy and nutrients in children aged 6–23 months. It can provide half or more of a child’s energy needs between the ages of 6 and 12 months, and one third of energy needs between 12 and 24 months. Breast milk is also a critical source of energy and nutrients during illness, and reduces mortality among children who are malnourished.\nChildren and adolescents who were breastfed as babies are less likely to be overweight or obese.

This is a natural (though not fail-safe) method of birth control known as the Lactation Amenorrhoea Method.\nMothers and families need to be supported for their children to be optimally breastfed.

An infant of this age is also developmentally ready for other foods. If complementary foods are not introduced around the age of 6 months, or if they are given inappropriately, an infant’s growth may falter.
