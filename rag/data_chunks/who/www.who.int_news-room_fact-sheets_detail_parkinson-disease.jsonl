There is no cure, but therapies and medicines can reduce symptoms. Common symptoms include tremors, painful muscle contractions and difficulty speaking.\nParkinson disease results in high rates of disability and the need for care. Many people with PD also develop dementia.\nThe disease usually occurs in older people, but younger people can also be affected."}

Men are affected more often than women.\nThe cause of PD is unknown but people with a family history of the disease have a higher risk. Exposure to air pollution, pesticides and solvents may increase risk.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of Parkinson disease get worse over time. They can greatly reduce well-being and quality of life.\nPD causes motors symptoms including:\nslow movement\ntremor\ninvoluntary movement\nrigidity\ntrouble walking\nimbalance.\nNon-motor symptoms:\ncognitive impairment\nmental health disorders\ndementia\nsleep disorders\npain\nsensory disturbances.\nInvoluntary movements (dyskinesias) and painful muscle contractions (dystonias) can cause problems speaking and moving. These symptoms lead to high rates of disability and the need for care. Many people with PD also develop dementia during the course of their disease.\nWhile PD is the most common movement disorder, other movement disorders exist such as multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, chorea, ataxia and dystonia."}

Some movement disorders have similar symptoms to PD such as tremor, slow movement and rigidity. All movement disorders share the same challenges as PD regarding diagnostic and treatment gaps and access to medication, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMIC).\nAssessment and disease burden\nPD\nis a clinical diagnosis that not only can be made by neurologists but also by trained non-specialist healthcare workers. Assessment and management of PD by trained non-specialized healthcare workers in primary care is particularly important in areas where specialist neurological services are unavailable, such as in some LMIC.\nThe prevalence of PD has doubled in the past 25 years.

Doctors may use other medicines such as anticholinergics to reduce involuntary muscle movement.\nDeep brain stimulation and other therapies can help the tremors and reduce the need for medicines.\nRehabilitation including physiotherapy can offer relief for Parkinson disease and other degenerative neurologic disorders.
