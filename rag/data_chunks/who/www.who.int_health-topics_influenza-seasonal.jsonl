It represents a year-round disease burden. It causes illnesses that range in severity and sometimes lead to hospitalization and death.\nMost people recover from fever and other symptoms within a week without requiring medical attention. However, influenza can cause severe illness or death, particularly among high risk groups including the very young, the elderly, pregnant women, health workers and those with serious medical conditions.\nIn temperate climates, seasonal epidemics occur mainly during winter, while in tropical regions, influenza may occur throughout the year, causing outbreaks more irregularly.\nSymptoms\nSeasonal influenza is characterized by a sudden onset of fever, cough (usually dry), headache, muscle and joint pain, severe malaise (feeling unwell), sore throat and a runny nose. The cough can be severe and can last two or more weeks.\nTreatment\nFor patients that are not in a high risk group, treatment focuses on relieving symptoms of influenza such as fever."}
