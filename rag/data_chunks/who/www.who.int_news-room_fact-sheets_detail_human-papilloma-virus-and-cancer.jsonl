They do not cause concerns in most people, but infection with some high-risk types is common and can cause genital warts or cancer.\nIn 90% of people the body controls the infection by itself. Persistent HPV infection with high-risk HPV types is the cause of cervical cancer and is associated with cancers of the vulva, vagina, mouth/throat, penis and anus\n(1)\n.\nIn 2019, HPV caused an estimated 620 000 cancer cases in women and 70 000 cancer cases in men\n(1)\n.\nProphylactic vaccination against HPV can prevent these cancers. In addition, HPV-screening and treatment of pre-cancer lesions is an effective way to prevent cervical cancer.\nOverview\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection."}

In addition, HPV-screening and treatment of pre-cancer lesions is an effective way to prevent cervical cancer.\nOverview\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection. Almost all sexually active people will be infected at some point in their lives, usually without symptoms.\nHPV can affect the skin, genital area and throat.\nCondoms help prevent HPV but do not offer total protection because they do not cover all the genital skin.\nHPV usually goes away on its own without treatment. Some HPV infections cause genital warts. Others can cause abnormal cells to develop, which go on to become cancer.\nCancers from HPV can be prevented with vaccines.\nThe vaccine does not contain any live virus or DNA from the virus so it cannot cause cancer or other HPV-related illnesses. The HPV vaccine is not used to treat HPV infections or diseases caused by HPV, but instead to prevent the development of cancers.\nCurrently, cervical cancer is the only HPV-caused cancer for which screening tests are available. Screening tests are used to check for disease when there are no symptoms."}

Screening tests are used to check for disease when there are no symptoms. The goal of screening for cervical cancer is to find precancerous cell changes before they become cancer and when treatment can prevent cancer from developing. Screening for cervical cancer is an important part of routine health care for people who have a cervix. This includes women and transgender men who still have a cervix.\nCervical cancer is the most common type of cancer caused by HPV, other less common cancers affecting men and women, including anal, vulvar, vaginal, mouth/throat and penile cancers.\nScope of the problem\nThe highest prevalence of cervical HPV among women is in sub-Saharan Africa (24%), followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (16%), eastern Europe (14%), and South-East Asia (14%)\n(2)\n."}

Cervical cancer was the fourth leading cause of cancer and cancer deaths in women in 2022, with some 660 000 new cases and around 350 000 deaths worldwide\n(3)\n.

This reflects major inequities driven by lack of access to national HPV vaccination, cervical screening and treatment services, and social and economic determinants.\nSymptoms\nMost people will not have any symptoms from an HPV infection. The immune system usually clears HPV from the body within a year or two with no lasting effects.\nSome HPV infections cause small rough lumps (genital warts) that can appear on the vagina, penis or anus and rarely the throat. They may be painful, itchy or bleed or cause swollen glands.\nHPV infection that does not go away on its own can cause changes to cervical cells, which lead to precancers that may become cervical cancer if left untreated. It usually takes 15–20 years for cervical cancer to develop after HPV infection.\nThe early changes in cervical cells and precancers mostly do not cause symptoms. Symptoms of cervical cancer may include bleeding between periods or after sexual intercourse or a foul-smelling vaginal discharge."}

Screening can detect cervical precancers that can be treated before they develop into cancer.\nHPV vaccines should be given to all girls aged 9–14 years, before they become sexually active.\nThe vaccine may be given as 1 or 2 doses. People with reduced immune systems should receive 2 or 3 doses. Check with your healthcare provider to determine what is best for you.\nUsing condoms during sex is an important way to prevent HPV infection. Voluntary male circumcision also reduces the risk of infection. Being a non-smoker or stopping smoking reduces the chances of developing persistent HPV infection.\nTesting cells from a woman’s cervix for HPV is used to screen women for cervical cancer.
