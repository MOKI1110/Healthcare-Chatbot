Harm from gambling by others is also widespread.\nIndustry analysts estimate global gambling revenue will reach US$ 700 billion by 2028\n(1)\n. Smartphone use in low- and middle-income countries will drive much of this growth.\nPeople gambling at harmful levels generate around 60% of losses (gambling revenue)\n(2)\n.\nGambling can threaten health, leading to increased incidence of mental illness and suicide. It can drive poverty by diverting household spending from essential goods and services.\nGambling harms also include relationship breakdown, family violence, financial distress, stigma, income-generating crimes (theft, fraud), neglect of children, and erosion of civil institutions via corruption and corporate political activity. Gambling is also a common way to launder money obtained through illegal activities.\nThe rapid normalization of gambling is occurring through commercialization and digitization."}

Gambling is also a common way to launder money obtained through illegal activities.\nThe rapid normalization of gambling is occurring through commercialization and digitization. Sponsorship and marketing are also key factors in rapid global growth.\nOverview\nGambling is risking money (or another item of value) on an event of uncertain outcome, with the possibility of gaining an increased return. Betting, slot machines, casino games, lotteries and bingo are all forms of gambling. Electronic gambling machines (EGMs) and casino games are often associated with the most risk of harm. These are available both in physical venues and online. The legal status of gambling varies within and between countries, although many jurisdictions have now legalized gambling. As it is available online, it is accessible almost anywhere, at any time, even in places where gambling is prohibited.>\nGambling can lead to serious harms to health. These include financial stress, relationship breakdown, family violence, mental illness and suicide. The legacy of gambling harm can endure throughout one’s life and transmit intergenerationally."}

These include financial stress, relationship breakdown, family violence, mental illness and suicide. The legacy of gambling harm can endure throughout one’s life and transmit intergenerationally. Population-wide interventions can help prevent and reduce harm. These include ending advertising and promotions, providing centralized account registration to require those who gamble to set binding loss limits, and restrictions relating to access and availability (opening hours, density). Strict regulation and enforcement are also required to ensure compliance with existing laws.\nScope of the problem\nGambling is now legally available in many countries. It has been normalized through new commercial associations with sport and cultural activities that are now heavily promoted. Around 5.5% of women and 11.9% of men globally experience some level of harm from gambling\n(3)\n. A Swedish study estimated that those with a gambling disorder were 15 times more likely to die by suicide than the general population\n(4)\n."}

A Swedish study estimated that those with a gambling disorder were 15 times more likely to die by suicide than the general population\n(4)\n. In Victoria Australia, at least 4.2% of suicides were found to be gambling-related\n(5)\n.\nFor every person who gambles at high-risk levels, an average of six others (usually non-gamblers) are affected\n(6)\n. This number is likely much higher in kinship cultures, including among Indigenous peoples. Gambling may also divert normal consumption expenditure from other businesses.\nIndustry self-regulation is a common feature of gambling regulation. However, there are many examples of the failure of this approach. There is often little transparency about the way many gambling products function. EGMs can mislead users with design features that encourage extended use. Existing health promotion messages are often inadequate and can use so-called dark nudges, which encourage the consumption of harmful products (for example, by exploiting gamblers' cognitive biases) and may enhance normalization."}

Alongside strong regulation of gambling products and their availability, clear warning messages about harms associated with use are likely to be more effective than messages suggestions to simply stop when gambling is no longer fun, for instance.\nThere is no global agreement on the regulation of online gambling. Unlicensed providers regularly offer unregulated gambling products, and there is an urgent need for the regulation of online gambling.\nWho is at risk?\nPeople experiencing significant life events including separation, retirement, injury or the death of a loved one may be at increased risk. Social stressors such as poverty, discrimination or other disadvantage also increase risks."}

Heavy promotion of gambling online and through sport also poses risks of normalizing gambling for children and young people.\nSigns and symptoms\nGambling disorder is described alongside substance use disorders in both the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM 5), and the International Classification of Diseases, eleventh revision (ICD 11). The ICD-11 describes three diagnostic requirements:\n1) impaired control over gambling;\n2) increasing priority given to gambling, taking precedence over other life interests and daily activities; and\n3) continuation of gambling despite negative consequences.\nGambling harm also occurs well below clinical thresholds.

Opportunities to gamble are often disproportionately located in areas of higher disadvantage. High-intensity products including EGMs, high-speed wagering platforms, and casino games, including online versions, are readily accessible almost anywhere.\nThe commercialization of gambling in many countries – which also drives normalization – is increasing the incidence of gambling harm. Sponsorship or other association with popular sporting leagues, and the colocation of gambling products in social settings, are key mechanisms. Aggressive promotion of gambling in popular and social media also increases gambling activity.\nPrevention and control\nUniversal, population-wide public health approaches are required to prevent gambling harm."}

Some evidence supports internet-based therapies, although attrition is a significant issue.\nTreatment for gambling disorder has a low rate of uptake, with an estimated 0.14% of the population seeking formal and informal help for current problems. Stigma and shame often prevent people from seeking help. The preferred regulatory approach of the gambling industry – so-called responsible gambling – adds to this burden by effectively blaming those who experience harm. Responsible gambling interventions are typically ineffective, particularly where the uptake of measures is optional.\nThose seeking to better control or cease gambling should be provided with tools to support them. These include universal pre-commitment (requiring people to set binding limits of time and money spent gambling) and self-exclusion (allowing people to ban themselves from gambling providers). Universal (also known as mandatory) systems are most effective. Voluntary systems have poor uptake and are non-enforceable."}

Prevention is the most cost-effective strategy for minimizing gambling-related harm.\nChallenges\nIn countries where gambling has been legalized, governments typically receive substantial taxation revenues. This can create some dependence, creating disincentives to reduce harm. Perceived economic benefits of gambling markets may have precedence over poorly understood effects on health and well-being.\nGambling industry groups typically strongly oppose high-impact regulations and other measures that affect their commercial interests. Corporate political activity is widespread and effective in protecting the interests of these businesses. The research sector has also been influenced by industry using funding and other support. Limiting the capacity of vested interests to influence the research agenda and public policies are among the key public health objectives.\nGlobal impact\nGambling harm increases as gambling markets expand, challenging the health and well-being of populations."}
