There are two distinct clades of the virus: clade I (with subclades Ia and Ib) and clade II (with subclades IIa and IIb). In 2022–2023 a global outbreak of mpox was caused by the clade IIb strain.\nMpox continues to be a threat today, and an upsurge of cases in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and other countries caused by clades Ia and Ib has raised concern.\nThere are vaccines for mpox. Vaccination should be considered along with other public health interventions.\nCommon symptoms of mpox are a skin rash or mucosal lesions which can last 2–4 weeks accompanied by fever, headache, muscle aches, back pain, low energy and swollen lymph nodes.\nMpox can be transmitted through close contact with someone who has mpox, with contaminated materials, or with infected animals."}

Most people fully recover, but some get very sick.\nMpox is caused by the monkeypox virus (MPXV). It is an enveloped double-stranded DNA virus of the\nOrthopoxvirus\ngenus in the\nPoxviridae\nfamily, which includes variola, cowpox, vaccinia and other viruses. There are two distinct clades of the virus: clade I (with subclades Ia and Ib) and clade II (with subclades IIa and IIb).\nA global outbreak of clade IIb began in 2022 and continues to this day, including in some African countries."}

Mpox can be fatal in some cases.\nDiagnosis\nIdentifying mpox can be difficult because other infections and conditions can look similar. It is important to distinguish mpox from chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, herpes, syphilis, other sexually transmitted infections, and medication-associated allergies.

For these reasons, testing is key for people to get care as early as possible and prevent severe illness and further spread.\nThe preferred laboratory test for mpox is detection of viral DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The best diagnostic specimens are taken directly from the rash – skin, fluid or crusts – collected by vigorous swabbing. In the absence of skin lesions, testing can be done using swabs of the throat or anus. Testing blood is not recommended. Antibody detection methods may not be useful as they do not distinguish between different orthopoxviruses.\nHIV testing should be offered to adults with mpox, and children as appropriate. Diagnostic tests for other conditions should be considered where feasible, for example, varicella zoster virus (VZV), syphilis and herpes.\nTreatment and vaccination\nThe goal of treating mpox is to take care of the rash, manage pain and prevent complications."}

Covering lesions and wearing a well-fitting mask when in the presence of others may help prevent spread. Using condoms during sex will help reduce the risk of getting mpox but will not prevent spread from skin-to-skin or mouth-to-skin contact.
