Typhoid is usually spread through the ingestion of contaminated food or water.\nTyphoid occurs predominantly in association with poor sanitation and lack of clean drinking water, in both urban and rural settings. However, urbanization, with associated overcrowded populations and inadequate water and sanitation systems, as well as climate change have the potential to further increase the global burden of typhoid. In addition, increasing antibiotic resistance is making it easier for typhoid to spread and more difficult to be treated.\nAn estimated 9 million people get sick from typhoid and 110 000 people die from it worldwide every year (2019 figures). Children and populations lacking access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation are at highest risk.\nTravellers are at risk of developing typhoid fever in many typhoid endemic countries, particularly in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa."}

Elsewhere, travellers are usually at risk when exposed to low standards of personal hygiene or food hygiene and poor water quality.\nEven vaccinated travellers should take care to avoid consumption of potentially contaminated food and water as vaccination does not confer 100% protection.\nSymptoms and treatment\nSalmonella\nTyphi lives only in humans. In persons with typhoid fever the bacteria enter through the intestinal tract and eventually invade the bloodstream. The resulting illness is often clinically non-distinguishable from other febrile illnesses. Symptoms include:\nprolonged high fever\nfatigue\nheadache\nnausea\nabdominal pain\nconstipation or diarrhoea\nrash, in some cases.\nSevere cases may lead to serious complications or even death.\nTyphoid fever can be treated with antibiotics."}

However, increased resistance to antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones and newer antibiotics such as cephalosporins and azithromycin, as well as the emergence of extensively drug resistant strains of\nSalmonella\nTyphi leads to more complicated and expensive treatment options in the most affected regions.\nEven after symptoms pass, approximately 2–5% of cases become chronic carriers and inadvertently spread typhoid through ongoing faecal shedding of the bacteria and contamination."}
