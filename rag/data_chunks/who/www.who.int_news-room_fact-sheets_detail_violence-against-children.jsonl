It involves repeated physical, psychological or social harm, and often takes place in schools and other settings where children gather, and online.\nYouth violence is concentrated among children and young adults aged 10–29 years, occurs most often in community settings between acquaintances and strangers, includes bullying and physical assault with or without weapons (such as guns and knives), and may involve gang violence.\nIntimate partner violence (or domestic violence) involves physical, sexual and emotional violence by an intimate partner or ex-partner.

Although males can also be victims, intimate partner violence disproportionately affects females. It commonly occurs against girls within child marriages and early/forced marriages. Among romantically involved but unmarried adolescents it is sometimes called “dating violence”.\nSexual violence includes non-consensual completed or attempted sexual contact and acts of a sexual nature not involving contact (such as voyeurism or sexual harassment); acts of sexual trafficking committed against someone who is unable to consent or refuse; and online exploitation.\nEmotional or psychological violence includes restricting a child’s movements, denigration, ridicule, threats and intimidation, discrimination, rejection and other non-physical forms of hostile treatment.\nWhen directed against girls or boys because of their biological sex or gender identity, any of these types of violence can also constitute gender-based violence.\nImpact of violence\nViolence against children has lifelong impacts on health and well-being of children, families, communities, and nations."}
