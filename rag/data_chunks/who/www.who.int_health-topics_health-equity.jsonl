Health is a fundamental human right.\nHealth equity is achieved when everyone can attain their full potential for health and well-being.\nHealth and health equity are determined by the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, play and age, as well as biological determinants.  Structural determinants (political, legal, and economic) with social norms and institutional\nprocesses shape the distribution of power and resources\ndetermined by the conditions in which people are born, grow, live, work, play and\nage.\nPeople’s living conditions are often made worse by discrimination, stereotyping, and prejudice based on sex, gender, age, race, ethnicity, or disability, among other factors."}

Discriminatory practices are often embedded in institutional and systems\nprocesses, leading to groups being under-represented in decision-making at all levels or underserved.\nProgressively realizing the right to health means systematically identifying and eliminating inequities resulting from differences in health and in overall living conditions.\nData and evidence\nKnowledge, monitoring, and analysis make up the backbone of actions needed to achieve equity.\nMonitoring health inequality\nmust be central to a country’s health information system. This begins with the collection, analysis and reporting of data disaggregated by age, sex, education, income, disability and other factors. Qualitative data is also essential to understand the how and why of inequities. Data must also be linked with information on other determinants such as education to better understand cause-and-effect relationships i.e. how these other determinants contribute to health inequities."}
