SCI results in complete or incomplete loss of sensory and/or motor functions below injury level."}

SCI results in complete or incomplete loss of sensory and/or motor functions below injury level. In paraplegia arm functions are preserved; in tetraplegia they are affected. Autonomic nervous system dysfunction affecting diverse functions can occur at any level of injury.\nInappropriate management of SCI related impairments and secondary conditions often causes premature mortality.\nSCI can diminish the capacity to perform daily activities, including walking, using one’s hands, physiological emptying of bowel/bladder or washing and dressing oneself. Limitations are compounded by misconceptions, negative attitudes and physical barriers to basic mobility, restricting independence and full societal participation."}

Limitations are compounded by misconceptions, negative attitudes and physical barriers to basic mobility, restricting independence and full societal participation. SCI is a major cause of long-term disability, accounting for over 4.5 million years of life lived with disability (YLDs) in 2021.\nImportantly, many restrictions in performing activities and participating in meaningful life areas do not result from the condition itself, but from insufficient or inadequate medical care, rehabilitation and assistive technologies access, a high economic burden, and from barriers in the physical, social and policy environments. For example, globally, only 5–35% have wheelchair access.\nScope of the problem\nGlobal estimates suggest that in 2021, approximately 15.4 million people were living with SCI.\nMales are more commonly affected by SCI than females, with consistently higher prevalence and YLDs attributed to this demographic.\nLife expectancy in people with SCI strongly correlates with neurological impairment and preventable secondary conditions."}

People with SCI often die earlier because of health system factors such as insufficient access to or poor quality health services. For people with SCI, the in‑hospital mortality rate is nearly three times higher in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries.\nMisconceptions, negative attitudes and mobility barriers prevent many individuals from full societal participation. Children with SCI are less likely than their peers to start school, and once enrolled, less likely to advance. Adults with SCI face similar barriers to economic participation, with unemployment rates exceeding 60%.\nMany people with SCI, their carers and families face substantial social and economic consequences. While existing data limit global cost estimates of SCI, its economic burden is significant."}

Emergencies can also result in surges in SCI. Earthquakes, for example, can cause increases in SCI due to blunt trauma; conflicts may cause surges in penetrating injuries. Non-traumatic SCIs are also increasing, specifically in ageing populations, given increases in non-communicable diseases such as tumors, degenerative and vascular conditions that can cause spinal cord damage.\nEffective interventions are available to prevent many causes of traumatic SCI."}
