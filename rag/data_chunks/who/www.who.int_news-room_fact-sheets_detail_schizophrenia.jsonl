Some people with schizophrenia experience worsening and remission of symptoms periodically throughout their lives, others a gradual worsening of symptoms over\ntime.\nMagnitude and impact\nSchizophrenia affects approximately 23 million people or 1 in 345 people (0.29%) worldwide. The rate is 1 in 233 people (0.43%) among adults (2). It is not as common as many other mental disorders. Onset is most often during late adolescence and the\ntwenties, and onset tends to happen earlier among men than among women.\nSchizophrenia is frequently associated with significant distress and impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, and other important areas of life.\nPeople with schizophrenia die nine years earlier  than the general population (3). This is often due to physical illnesses, such as cardiovascular, metabolic, and infectious diseases.\nPeople with schizophrenia often experience human rights violations both inside mental health institutions and in community settings."}

Stigma against people with this condition is intense and widespread, causing social exclusion, and impacting their relationships\nwith others, including family and friends. This contributes to discrimination, which in turn can limit access to general health care, education, housing, and employment.\nDuring humanitarian and public health emergencies, extreme stress and fear, breakdown of social supports, isolation and disruption of health-care services and supply of medication can occur. These changes can have an impact on the lives of people with\nschizophrenia, such as exacerbation of existing symptoms. During emergencies, people with schizophrenia are more vulnerable than others to various human rights violations, including neglect, abandonment, homelessness, abuse and exclusion.\nCauses of schizophrenia\nResearch has not identified one single cause of schizophrenia.

Approximately 50% of people in mental hospitals have a schizophrenia diagnosis (4). Only 29% of people with psychosis receive specialist\nmental health care (5). Most resources for mental health services are inefficiently spent on care within mental hospitals.\nThere is clear evidence that mental hospitals are not effective in providing the care that people with mental health conditions need and, regularly, violate the basic human rights of persons with schizophrenia. Efforts to transfer care from mental health\ninstitutions to the community need to be expanded and accelerated. Such efforts start with the development of a range of quality community-based mental health services."}
