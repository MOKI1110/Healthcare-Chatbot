Infection is most probably acquired by traumatic inoculation of fungi or ‎bacteria into the subcutaneous tissue. So far more than 70 different bacteria\nand fungi have been indicated as causative agents.\nThe disease commonly affects young adults, mostly males aged between 15 and 30 years in developing countries. People of low socioeconomic status and manual workers such as agriculturalists, labourers and herdsmen are the most commonly affected.\nMycetoma has numerous adverse medical, health and socioeconomic impacts on patients, communities and health authorities. Accurate data on its incidence and prevalence are not available. However, early detection and treatment are important to reduce morbidity\nand improve treatment outcomes.\nMycetoma was first reported in the mid-19th century in Madurai, India, and hence was initially called Madura foot.\nCurrently, accurate data on its incidence and prevalence are not available."}

The number of cases reported differs per country, however at the moment most cases have been reported from Mexico and Sudan.\nTransmission\nTransmission, most probably occurs when the causative organism enters the body through minor trauma or a penetrating injury, commonly thorn pricks. There is a clear association between mycetoma and individuals who walk barefooted and are manual workers.\nClinical characteristics\nMycetoma is characterized by a combination of painless ‎subcutaneous mass, multiple sinuses and discharge ‎containing grains."}

Secondary bacterial infection is common,\nand that may cause increased pain, disability and fatal septicaemia (severe infections involving the entire human system), if untreated. Infection is not transmitted from human to human.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of mycetoma is based on clinical presentation and identification of the causative organisms which can be detected by directly examining the grains that are discharged by the sinuses."}

The samples can be obtained by Fine Needle Aspiration\n(FNA) or surgical biopsy. Although grains microscopy is helpful in detecting the causative organism, it is important to further identify these by culture but even then misclassification occurs. Identification by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is\nthe most reliable method but has high cost and lacks standardized techniques. There is no point-of-care rapid diagnostic test that can be used in the field. Imaging techniques including X-rays, ultrasound, magnetic resonance and computer tomography\ncan be used to assess the extent of lesions and planning the clinical management.\nTreatment\nThe treatment depends on the causative organism. For bacterial mycetoma, treatment consists of a combination of antibiotics whereas for fungal mycetoma treatment consists of a combination of antifungal drugs and surgery. The treatment is lengthy, has\nmany side effects, expensive not available in endemic areas and most importantly often unsatisfactory."}
