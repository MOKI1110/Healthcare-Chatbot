The second host differs according to species: for\nClonorchis\nand\nOpisthorchis\nit is a freshwater fish and for\nParagonimus\nit is a crustacean.

The final host is always a mammal (Table 1).\nPeople are infected when they ingest the infected second intermediate host, or in the case of fascioliasis, when they ingest aquatic vegetables to which the parasite larvae are attached.\nClonorchiasis and opisthorchiasis are confined largely to Asia, with many countries being endemic for these diseases. Some hyperendemic villages in Lao People’s Democratic Republic have had\nO. viverrini\nprevalences of more than 80% recorded.\nParagonimiasis can be found in Africa, Asia and Latin America and can be co-endemic with tuberculosis, often resulting in inaccurate diagnosis and treatment, and contributing to underreporting of the disease."}

Although cases of foodborne trematodes have been reported from more than 70 countries worldwide, data on actual prevalence and\nburden is scarce, with a significant gap in epidemiological data from African countries.\nWithin countries, transmission is often restricted to focal areas and reflects behavioural and ecological patterns. Inadequate sanitation and food hygiene, limited access to safe drinking water, and cultural food preferences are all associated with an\nincreased risk of infection. Cultural food sharing habits may also contribute to familial and community clusters of infection.\nThe true burden associated with these infections is unclear as public health awareness and availability of health facilities is often limited in affected populations."}

Individual case-management with\ntreatment of people with confirmed or suspected infection is appropriate where cases are less clustered and where health facilities are available.\nPreventive chemotherapy alone is insufficient to reduce prevalence.
