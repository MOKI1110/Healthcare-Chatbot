They are intense circular storms that originate over warm tropical oceans, and have maximum sustained wind speeds exceeding 119 kilometres per hour and heavy rains.\nHowever, the greatest damage to life and property is not from the wind, but from secondary events such as storm surges, flooding, landslides and tornadoes.\nTropical cyclones are referred to by different names depending on where they originate in the world.\nHurricanes occur in the Atlantic Ocean and the eastern north Pacific Ocean.\nTyphoons occur in the western Pacific Ocean.\nTropical cyclones occur in the south Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean.\nFrom 1998-2017, storms, including tropical cyclones and hurricanes, were second only to earthquakes in terms of fatalities, killing 233 000 people."}

During this time, storms also affected an estimated 726 million people worldwide, meaning they were injured, made homeless, displaced or evacuated during the emergency phase of the disaster.\nOver the past 30 years the proportion of the world’s population living on cyclone-exposed coastlines has increased 192 percent, thus raising the risk of mortality and morbidity in the event of a tropical cyclone.\nImpact\nThe health impacts of tropical cyclones depend on the number of people living in low-lying coastal areas in the storm’s direct path, the built environment including building design, and whether there is sufficient time for warning and evacuation.\nTropical cyclones, may directly and indirectly affect health in many ways, for example by:\nincreasing cases of drowning and other physical trauma;\nincreasing risks of water- and vector-borne infectious diseases;\nincreasing mental health effects associated with emergency situations;\ndisrupting health systems, facilities and services, leaving"}

Additionally, flood waters may contain sewage and chemicals, hide sharp objects made of metal or glass and electrical lines, or host dangerous snakes or reptiles, which can cause diseases, injuries, electrocution and bites.\nWHO Response\nWHO works with Member States to build resilient and proactive health systems that can anticipate the needs and challenges during emergencies so that they are more likely to reduce risks and respond effectively when needed.\nDuring disasters, such as tropical cyclones, WHO helps to restore primary care services so that facilities can deliver essential services, including immunization, basic treatment for common illnesses, acute malnutrition and maternal care while ensuring the ongoing suppl"}
