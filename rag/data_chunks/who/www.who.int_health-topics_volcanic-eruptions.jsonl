There are about 1500 potentially active volcanoes worldwide. When volcanoes erupt they can spew hot, dangerous gases, ash, lava and rock that can cause disastrous loss of life and property, especially in heavily populated areas. Volcanic activities and wildfires affected 6.2 million people and caused nearly 2400 deaths between 1998-2017.\nThere are different types of volcanic eruptive events, including:\npyroclastic explosions, with is fast-moving hot gas and volcanic matter\nhot ash releases\nlava flows\ngas emissions\nglowing avalanches, when gas and ashes release.\nVolcanic eruptions can also cause secondary events, such as floods, landslides and mudslides, if there are accompanying rain, snow or melting ice."}

Hot ashes can also start wildfires.\nVolcanic eruptions can impact climate change through emitting volcanic gases like sulfur dioxide, which causes global cooling, and volcanic carbon dioxide, which has the potential to promote global warming.\nImpact\nVolcanic eruptions can pose multiple health threats depending on the proximity of the volcano to the community and whether there was any warning.\nVolcanic eruptions can cause:\nsuffocation\ninfectious diseases, such as conjunctivitis\nacute and chronic respiratory diseases from falling ash and breathing gases and fumes\nburns and traumatic injuries, such as lacerations from falling rock\neye and skin irritations from acid rain.\nAsh and chemicals from the eruption can also generate risk of food and water contamination, and compromise basic services, like water, transportation, communications and health services."}
