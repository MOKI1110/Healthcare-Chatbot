The virus belongs to the virus family\nArenaviridae\n.\nLassa fever is a zoonotic disease, meaning that humans become infected from contact with infected animals. The animal reservoir, or host, of Lassa virus is a rodent of the genus\nMastomys\n, commonly known as the multimammate rat.\nMastomys\nrats infected with Lassa virus do not become ill, but they can shed the virus in their urine and faeces.\nAbout 80% of people who become infected with Lassa virus have no or mild symptoms. One in 5 infections result in severe disease, where the virus affects several organs such as the liver, spleen and kidneys.\nBecause the clinical course of the disease is very variable, detection of the disease in affected patients has been difficult."}

When presence of the disease is confirmed in a community, early detection and prompt isolation and care of patients, good infection prevention and control practices in healthcare settings, and promoting community hygiene and rodent prevention, can prevent further spread of the disease.\nTransmission\nHumans primarily become infected with Lassa virus either through exposure to food or household items that are contaminated with urine or faeces of infected\nMastomys\nrat, or directly via contact with infected rats.\nMastomys\nrats are ubiquitous to west Africa. They can be found living in and around homes, colonizing areas where food is stored and are able to live in fields or cleared forest."}

While\nMastomys\nrats serve as the main reservoir, Lassa virus has been also isolated from other rodent species, suggesting their potential role as additional source of infection.\nAlthough to a much less extent, Lassa virus may also spread between humans through direct contact with blood, urine, faeces or other bodily secretions of a person infected with Lassa fever. Person-to-person transmission may occur primarily in health-care settings, where the virus may also be spread by contaminated medical equipment, such as re-used needles.\nHealth workers are at risk if caring for Lassa fever patients in the absence of appropriate infection prevention and control practices.\nLassa virus may persist in the semen of some males who recovered from the disease for up to few months."}

However, to date no transmission via exposure to infected semen had ever been documented.\nThere is no epidemiological evidence supporting airborne spread between humans.\nSymptoms\nThe incubation period of Lassa fever ranges from 2–21 days.\nWhen it is symptomatic, the onset of the disease is usually gradual, starting with fever, general weakness headache and malaise. After a few days, sore throat, muscle pain, chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, cough and abdominal pain may follow. As the disease progresses, in severe cases facial swelling, fluid in the lung cavity, bleeding from the mouth, nose, vagina or gastrointestinal tract and low blood pressure may develop. Shock, seizures, tremor, disorientation, and coma may be seen in the later stages. Among hospitalized patients, approximately 15% die of Lassa fever disease."}

In the third trimester, fetal death and maternal death rates can exceed 80% and 30% respectively.\nRecovery can take a long time (prolonged convalescence) and sometimes leads to other conditions (sequelae). Sudden hearing loss has been reported with varying incidence and up to 25% of recovered patients, both during acute disease and after recovery. In most circumstances hearing loss is reported to be permanent. Other sequelae including neurological signs, visual impairment, joint pain, transient hair loss and psychological disorders have been reported to a lesser extent."}
