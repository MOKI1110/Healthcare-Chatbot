These infections affect the poorest and most deprived communities with poor access to clean water, sanitation and hygiene in tropical and subtropical areas, with the highest prevalence reported from sub-Saharan Africa, China, South America and Asia. They are transmitted by eggs present in human faeces, which in turn contaminate soil in areas where sanitation is poor. Over 260 million preschool-age children, 654 million school-age children,108 million adolescent girls and 138.8 million pregnant and lactating women live in areas where these parasites are intensively transmitted, and are in need of treatment and preventive interventions.\nGlobally over 600 million people are estimated to be infected by\nS."}

These STH species are normally addressed as a group because they need similar diagnostic procedures and respond to the same medicines.\nStrongyloides stercoralis\nis an intestinal helminth with peculiar characteristics: the parasite requires different diagnostic methods than other soil-transmitted helminthiases, and for this reason is frequently not identified."}

In addition, the parasite is not sensitive to albendazole or mebendazole and therefore not impacted by large-scale preventive treatment campaigns targeting other soil-transmitted helminthiases.\nTransmission\nSoil-transmitted helminths are transmitted by eggs that are passed in the faeces of infected people. Adult worms live in the intestine where they produce thousands of eggs each day. In areas that lack adequate sanitation, these eggs contaminate the soil. This can happen in several ways:\neggs that are attached to vegetables are ingested when the vegetables are not carefully cooked, washed or peeled;\neggs are ingested from contaminated water sources; and\neggs are ingested by children who play in the contaminated soil and then put their hands in their mouths without washing them.\nIn addition, hookworm eggs hatch in the soil, releasing larvae that mature into a form that can actively penetrate the skin."}

People with infections of light intensity (few worms) usually do not suffer from the infection. Heavier infections can cause a range of symptoms including intestinal manifestations (diarrhoea and abdominal pain), malnutrition, general malaise and weakness, and impaired growth and physical development.\nInfections of very high intensity can cause intestinal obstruction that should be treated surgically.\nS. stercoralis\nmay cause dermatological and gastro-intestinal morbidity and is also known to be associated with chronic malnutrition in children."}
