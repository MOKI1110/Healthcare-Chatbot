While many people migrate out of choice, others migrate out of necessity. Some may be forcibly displaced from their homes as they flee persecution, conflict, violence or disaster. Others facing adversity may also have little option but to move, for example to escape inhuman treatment, avoid economic hardship, access social rights or reunite with families.\nRefugees and migrants exposed to adversity have diverse mental health needs, shaped by experiences in their country of origin, their migration journey, their host country’s entry and integration policies, and living and working conditions. In some contexts, they may be at greater risk of experiencing mental health conditions than their host population. Refugees and migrants face significant barriers that hamper inclusion in society and limit the accessibility and acceptability of mental health services."}

Each stage of the migration journey presents unique stressors that can increase the risk of developing mental health conditions.\nPre-migration:\nlack of livelihoods and opportunities for education and development, exposure to armed conflict, violence, natural disasters, poverty and/or persecution.\nMigration travel and transit:\nexposure to challenging and life-threatening conditions including violence, detention and lack of access to services to cover basic needs.\nPost-migration:\nbarriers that hamper access to mental health care and other services, poor living conditions, separation from family members and support networks, potentially uncertain legal status, and in som"}

Language barriers, lack of awareness and confidentiality concerns often prevent refugees and migrants from accessing mental health care.\nPrevalence of mental health conditions\nMany refugees and migrants experience distress, such as feelings of anxiety, sadness, hopelessness, difficulty sleeping, fatigue, irritability, anger and physical pains.\nFor most people, these reactions improve over time. Others will go on to develop mental health conditions.\nStudies show that mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, PTSD and suicide are more prevalent among refugees and migrants than host populations."}

Avoid separating families and children.\nAddress social determinants.\nEnsure equal access to basic needs, such as food, housing, legal support, safety, education and employment.
