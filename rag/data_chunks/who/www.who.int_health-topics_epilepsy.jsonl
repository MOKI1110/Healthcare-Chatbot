More than 50\nmillion people worldwide have epilepsy; nearly 80% of them live in low- and\nmiddle-income countries.\nAn estimated 70% of people\nwith epilepsy could be seizure free if properly diagnosed and treated. However,\nabout three quarters of people with epilepsy in low-income countries do not get\nthe treatment they need, and this rises to 90% in some countries. In many such\ncountries, many health professionals do not have the training to recognize,\ndiagnose and treat epilepsy. In most resource-poor countries, antiseizure medicines\nare not available.\nPeople with epilepsy and\ntheir families frequently suffer from stigma and discrimination. In many parts\nof the world the true nature of epilepsy has also long been distorted by myths,\nfear and mistaken notions about the disorder.\nWHO is working with\nministries of health and partners to improve access to treatment for epilepsy.\nSymptoms and treatment\nEpilepsy is not contagious and is characterized by seizures, which occur because of temporary excessive electric activity in the brain."}

During seizures, people may lose consciousness or awareness, control of bowel or bladder function, they may not be able to hear or see properly, and their movements may become disturbed. The loss of movement control and sensation can cause injuries from falls.\nA diagnosis of epilepsy is made by a health professional if there is medical history of at least two seizures. Often this is further confirmed by electroencephalography (EEG), a painless technological method to record and study the electrical activity of the brain.\nTreatment for epilepsy can be very effective. With antiseizure medicines, up to 70% of people living with epilepsy could become seizure free. After 2 years of taking medicines without any seizures, a health professional may advise stopping the medicines. Where medicines are not helpful in relieving the condition, some types of surgery can be beneficial."}

Since people with epilepsy have higher occurrence of psychological conditions such as anxiety and depression, psychosocial help is also useful.\nWHO response\nPrevious WHO collaborative\nprogrammes on epilepsy have shown that integrating epilepsy care in primary\nhealth care can significantly reduce the epilepsy treatment gap. Based on the\nevidence-based methods of the WHO Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP),\nWHO supports the training of primary care, non-specialist health care providers\nto diagnose, treat and follow up people with epilepsy. The WHO Programme on\nReducing the Epilepsy Treatment Gap combined several innovative strategies to\nsupport access and care to services for people with epilepsy, thereby reducing\nthe epilepsy treatment gap."}
