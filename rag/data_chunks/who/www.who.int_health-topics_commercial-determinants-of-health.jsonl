Some parts of the private sector also use instrumental, structural and discursive power to undermine public health policies that threaten profits.\nCommercial activities, especially by transnational corporations, affect non-communicable disease, infectious diseases and pandemics, injuries and climate change. These impacts also worsen inequities between and within countries."}

These impacts also worsen inequities between and within countries. Profit shifting and the aggressive use of trade agreements by the unhealthy commodity industries are particularly detrimental to the global south.\nSimultaneously, the private sector is an indispensable partner for development by, for example, creating vaccines, medicines and assistive products, financing, building infrastructure and delivering health services towards Universal Health Coverage, or by ensuring food security. Member States should work to leverage these opportunities while protecting populations from harm.\nCommunities, civil society organizations, governments at all levels, philanthropists and, where aligned, the private sector, must work together to achieve health for all. This requires addressing CDoH through conflict of interest, regulative, legal, economic, whole-of-government and geopolitical reforms.\nImpact\nThe commercial determinants of health (CDoH) can negatively impact health, wellbeing, equity and health-systems."}

For example, half of all tobacco consumers will die from health issues related to these products, with annual deaths hitting 8 million. Many others are harmed by the actions of the alcohol, fast-food and sugar-sweetened beverage industries. Additionally, 20% of suicides are related to pesticide product self-poisoning. These especially affect disadvantaged population groups and low- and middle- income countries.\nCDoH also have health promoting and protective effects. Nearly 2 billion people will need assistive devices by 2050, greatly improving wellbeing. Installing and mandating the use of safety devices such as seatbelts, child restraints or helmets significantly reduces serious and fatal injuries. Pharmaceuticals and vaccines have significant effects, with the measles vaccines alone preventing 25.5 million deaths since 2000.\nThere are also broader existential and societal impacts.
