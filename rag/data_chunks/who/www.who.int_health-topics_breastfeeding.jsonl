However, contrary to WHO recommendations, fewer than half of infants under 6 months old are exclusively breastfed.\nBreastmilk is the ideal food for infants. It is safe, clean and contains antibodies which help protect against many common childhood illnesses. Breastmilk provides all the energy and nutrients that the infant needs for the first months of life, and it continues to provide up to half or more of a child’s nutritional needs during the second half of the first year, and up to one third during the second year of life.\nBreastfed children perform better on intelligence tests, are less likely to be overweight or obese and less prone to diabetes later in life."}
