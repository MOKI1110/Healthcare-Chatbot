Many of these chemicals have been banned from agricultural use in developed countries, but they are still used in many developing countries.\nPesticides play a significant role in food production. They protect or increase yields and may increase the number of times each year a crop can be grown on the same land. This is particularly important in countries that face food shortages.\nTo protect food consumers from the adverse effects of pesticides WHO reviews evidence and develops internationally-accepted maximum residue limits.\nPesticides are used to protect crops against insects, weeds, fungi and other pests.\nPesticides are potentially toxic to humans and can have both acute and chronic health effects, depending on the quantity and ways in which a person is exposed.\nPeople who face the greatest health risks from exposure to pesticides are those who come into contact with them at work, in their home or garden.\nOverview\nThere are more than 1000 pesticides used around the world to ensure food is\nnot damag"}

Each pesticide has different properties and\ntoxicological effects.\nMany of the older, less costly (off-patent) pesticides, such as\ndichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and lindane, can remain for years in soil\nand water. These chemicals have been banned by countries which signed the 2001\nStockholm Convention, an international treaty that aims to eliminate or\nrestrict the production and use of persistent organic pollutants.\nThe toxicity of a pesticide depends on its function and other factors. For\nexample, insecticides tend to be more toxic to humans than herbicides. The same\nchemical can have different effects at different doses, that is, the amount of chemical\nto which a person is exposed."}

When people come into contact with large quantities of pesticide, the\nresult may be acute poisoning or long-term health effects that may include\ncancer and adverse effects on reproduction.\nScope of the problem\nPesticides are among the leading causes of death by self-poisoning, particularly in low- and middle-income countries.\nSince pesticides are intrinsically toxic and deliberately spread in the environment, their production, distribution and use call for strict regulation and control."}

Regular monitoring of residues in food and the environment is also required.\nWHO has two objectives in relation to pesticides:\nto ban the      pesticides that are most toxic to humans, as well as pesticides that      remain for the longest time in the environment;\nto protect public health by setting maximum limits for pesticide residues in food      and water.\nWho is at risk?\nThe population most at risk are those who are directly exposed to\npesticides. This includes agricultural workers who apply pesticides and anyone\nelse in the immediate area during, and shortly after, pesticides are spread.\nThe general population – those not in the area where pesticides are used –\nis exposed to significantly lower levels of pesticide residues through food and\nwater.\nPrevention and control\nNobody should be exposed to unsafe amounts of pesticide.\nPeople spreading pesticide on crops, in homes or in gardens should be\nadequately protected."}
