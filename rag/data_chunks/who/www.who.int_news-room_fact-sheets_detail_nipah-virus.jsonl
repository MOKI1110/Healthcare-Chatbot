This rate can vary by outbreak depending on local capabilities for epidemiological surveillance and clinical management.\nNipah virus can be transmitted to humans from animals (such as bats or pigs), or contaminated foods and can also be transmitted directly from human-to-human.\nFruit bats of the Pteropodidae family are the natural host of Nipah virus.\nThere is no treatment or vaccine available for either people or animals. The primary treatment for humans is supportive care.\nThe 2018 annual review of the WHO R&D Blueprint list of priority diseases indicates that there is an urgent need for accelerated research and development for the Nipah virus.\nOverview\nNipah virus (NiV) is a zoonotic virus (it is transmitted from animals to humans) and can also be transmitted through contaminated food or directly between people."}

In infected people, it causes a range of illnesses from asymptomatic (subclinical) infection\nto acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis. The virus can also cause severe disease in animals such as pigs, resulting in significant economic losses for farmers.\nAlthough Nipah virus has caused only a few known outbreaks in Asia, it infects a wide range of animals and causes severe disease and death in people, making it a public health concern.\nPast Outbreaks\nNipah virus was first recognized in 1999 during an outbreak among pig farmers in, Malaysia. No new outbreaks have been reported in Malaysia since 1999.\nIt was also recognized in Bangladesh in 2001, and nearly annual outbreaks have occurred in that country since."}

Transmission is thought to have occurred via unprotected exposure to secretions\nfrom the pigs, or unprotected contact with the tissue of a sick animal.\nIn subsequent outbreaks in Bangladesh and India, consumption of fruits or fruit products (such as raw date palm juice) contaminated with urine or saliva from infected fruit bats was the most likely source of infection.\nThere are currently no studies on viral persistence in bodily fluids or the environment including fruits.\nHuman-to-human transmission of Nipah virus has also been reported among family and care givers of infected patients.\nDuring the later outbreaks in Bangladesh and India, Nipah virus spread directly from human-to-human through close contact with people's secretions and excretions.

This can be followed by dizziness, drowsiness, altered consciousness, and neurological signs that indicate acute encephalitis. Some\npeople can also experience atypical pneumonia and severe respiratory problems, including acute respiratory distress. Encephalitis and seizures occur in severe cases, progressing to coma within 24 to 48 hours.\nThe incubation period (interval from infection to the onset of symptoms) is believed to range from 4 to 14 days."}
