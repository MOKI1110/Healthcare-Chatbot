It primarily spreads by skin-to-skin contact. It is treatable but not curable.\nThere are two types of herpes simplex virus.\nType 1 (HSV-1) mostly spreads by oral contact and causes infections in or around the mouth (oral herpes or cold sores). It can also cause genital herpes."}

It can also cause genital herpes. Most adults are infected with HSV-1.\nType 2 (HSV-2) spreads by sexual contact and causes genital herpes.\nMost people have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. The infection can cause painful blisters or ulcers that can recur over time. Medicines can reduce symptoms but can’t cure the infection.\nRecurrent symptoms of both oral and genital herpes may be distressing. Genital herpes may also be stigmatizing and have an impact on sexual relationships.\nSymptoms\nMost people with herpes have no symptoms or only mild symptoms. Many people aren’t aware they have the infection and can pass along the virus to others without knowing.\nSymptoms can include painful, recurring blisters or ulcers. New infections may cause fever, body aches and swollen lymph nodes.\nSymptoms may be different during the first episode (or ‘outbreak’) of infection than during a recurrent episode."}

Most HSV-1 infections are acquired during childhood to cause oral herpes. Around 10% of these (376 million) were estimated to be genital infections occurring in 15–49-year-olds.\nGenital herpes caused by HSV-2 affects an estimated 520 million (13%) people aged 15–49 years worldwide (2020 data). HSV-2 infects women almost twice as often as men because sexual transmission is more efficient from men to women. Prevalence increases with age, though the highest number of new infections are in adolescents and young adults.\nAn estimated 205 million people aged 15–49 (5.3%) experienced at least one symptomatic episode of genital herpes in 2020. The majority of these people (92%) had symptoms related to HSV-2 infection. HSV-2 is much more likely than genital HSV-1 infection to cause recurrent symptoms.\nTransmission\nHSV-1 is mainly transmitted via contact with the virus in sores, saliva or skin surfaces in or around the mouth."}

Less commonly, HSV-1 can be transmitted to the genital area through oral-genital contact to cause genital herpes. It can be transmitted from oral or skin surfaces that appear normal; however, the greatest risk of transmission is when there are active sores. People who already have HSV-1 are not at risk of reinfection with HSV-1, but they are still at risk of acquiring HSV-2.\nHSV-2 is mainly transmitted during sex through contact with genital or anal surfaces, skin, sores or fluids of someone infected with the virus. HSV-2 can be transmitted even if the skin looks normal and is often transmitted in the absence of symptoms.\nIn rare circumstances, herpes (HSV-1 and HSV-2) can be transmitted from mother to child during delivery, causing neonatal herpes.\nPossible complications\nHSV-2 and HIV infection\nHSV-2 infection increases the risk of acquiring HIV infection by approximately three-fold.

HSV-2 infection is among the most common infections in people living with HIV.\nSevere disease\nIn immunocompromised people, including those with advanced HIV infection, herpes can have more severe symptoms and more frequent recurrences. Rare complications of HSV-2 include meningoencephalitis (brain infection) and disseminated infection. Rarely, HSV-1 infection can lead to more severe complications such as encephalitis (brain infection) or keratitis (eye infection).\nNeonatal herpes\nNeonatal herpes can occur when an infant is exposed to HSV during delivery. Neonatal herpes is rare, occurring in an estimated 10 out of every 100 000 births globally. However, it is a serious condition that can lead to lasting neurologic disability or death. The risk for neonatal herpes is greatest when a mother acquires HSV for the first time in late pregnancy.\nPrevention\nPeople with symptoms of oral herpes should avoid oral contact with others (including oral sex) and sharing objects that touched saliva."}

Condoms reduce the risk; however, HSV infection can still occur through contact with genital or anal areas not covered by the condom.
