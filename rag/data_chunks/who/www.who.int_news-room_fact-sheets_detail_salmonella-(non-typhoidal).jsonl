Doan\n©\nCredits\nSalmonella (non-typhoidal)\n20 February 2018\nKey facts\nSalmonella is 1 of 4 key global causes of diarrhoeal diseases.\nMost cases of salmonellosis are mild; however, sometimes it can be life-threatening. The severity of the disease depends on host factors and the serotype of Salmonella.\nAntimicrobial resistance is a global public health concern and Salmonella is one of the microorganisms in which some resistant serotypes have emerged, affecting the food chain.\nBasic food hygiene practices, such as \"cook thoroughly\", are recommended as a preventive measure against salmonellosis.\nThe burden of foodborne diseases is substantial: every year almost 1 in 10 people fall ill and 33 million of healthy life years are lost. Foodborne diseases can be severe, especially for young children. Diarrhoeal diseases are the most common illnesses resulting from unsafe food, 550 million people falling ill each year, including 220 million children under the age of 5 years. Salmonella is 1 of the 4 key global causes of diarrhoeal diseases.\nSalmonella\nis a gram negative rods genus belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family."}

Salmonella is 1 of the 4 key global causes of diarrhoeal diseases.\nSalmonella\nis a gram negative rods genus belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family. Within 2 species,\nSalmonella bongori\nand\nSalmonella enterica\n, over 2500 different serotypes or serovars have been identified to date.\nSalmonella\nis a ubiquitous and hardy bacteria that can survive several weeks in a dry environment and several months in water.\nWhile all serotypes can cause disease in humans, a few are host-specific and can reside in only one or a few animal species: for example,\nSalmonella enterica\nserotype Dublin in cattle and\nSalmonella enterica\nserotype Choleraesuis in pigs. When these particular serotypes cause disease in humans, it is often invasive and can be life-threatening. Most serotypes, however, are present in a wide range of hosts. Typically, such serotypes cause gastroenteritis, which is often uncomplicated and does not need treatment, but disease can be severe in the young, the elderly, and patients with weakened immunity."}

This is because antimicrobials may not completely eliminate the bacteria and may select for resistant strains, which subsequently can lead to the drug becoming ineffective. However, health risk groups such as infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients may need to receive antimicrobial therapy. Antimicrobials are also administered if the infection spreads from the intestine to other body parts."}
