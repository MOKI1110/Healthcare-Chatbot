The most severe damage occurs early in pregnancy, especially in the first trimester.\nEven though a safe and cost-effective vaccine is available, in 2022, there were an estimated 17 865 cases of rubella in 78 countries.\nOverview\nRubella is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus. It spreads easily when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Most children and adults who get rubella have a mild fever and rash.\nWhen a woman is infected with the rubella virus early in pregnancy, she has a 90% chance of passing the virus on to her fetus."}

The rash, which occurs in 50–80% of cases, lasts 1–3 days and usually starts on the face and neck before progressing down the body. Swollen lymph glands behind the ears and in the neck are the most characteristic clinical feature. Infected adults, more commonly women, may develop arthritis and painful joints that usually last from 3–10 days.\nOnce a person is infected, the virus spreads throughout the body in about 5–7 days. Symptoms usually appear 2 to 3 weeks after exposure. The most infectious period is usually 1–5 days after the appearance of the rash.\nWhen a woman is infected with the rubella virus early in pregnancy, she has a 90% chance of passing the virus on to her fetus.

They may include pain and redness at the injection site, low-grade fever, rash and muscle aches. Mass immunization campaigns in the Region of the Americas involving more than 250 million adolescents and adults did not identify any serious adverse reactions associated with the vaccine.\nWHO response\nWHO recommends that all countries that have not yet introduced rubella vaccine should consider doing so using existing, well-established measles immunization programmes. To-date, four WHO regions have established goals to eliminate this preventable cause of birth defects. In 2015, the WHO Region of the Americas became the first in the world to be declared free of endemic transmission of rubella.\nThe number of countries using rubella vaccines in their national programme continues to steadily increase. As of January 2024, 175 out of 194 countries had introduced rubella vaccines and global coverage was estimated at 69%.
