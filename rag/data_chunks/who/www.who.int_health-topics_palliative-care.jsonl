Relieving serious health-related suffering, be it physical, psychological, social, or spiritual, is a global ethical responsibility. Thus, whether the cause of suffering\nis cardiovascular disease, cancer, major organ failure, drug-resistant tuberculosis, severe burns, end-stage chronic illness, acute trauma, extreme birth prematurity or extreme frailty of old age, palliative care may be needed and has to be available\nat all levels of care.\nIt is estimated that globally only 14% of patients who need palliative care receive it; to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 3, working towards universal health coverage, countries have to strengthen palliative care services. WHO works with countries\nto include palliative care as a key part of their health systems. To improve equitable access to palliative care services, emphasis is given to a Primary Health Care approach. Assessment tools have been developed to measure progress made."}
