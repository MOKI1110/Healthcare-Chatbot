If the eggs are ingested by humans, they develop into larvae in several organs, mainly the liver and lungs.\nBoth cystic and alveolar echinococcosis are characterized by asymptomatic incubation periods that can last many years until the parasite larvae evolve and trigger clinical signs.\nBoth diseases can cause serious morbidity and death.\nSymptoms\nCystic echinococcosis is characterized\nby an asymptomatic incubation period that can last many years until the\nparasite cysts evolve and trigger clinical signs, depending on the location and\nsize of the cysts and the pressure exerted on the surrounding tissues."}

In cystic\nechinococcosis, the larval stages of the parasite develop as one or more cysts\nmainly in the liver and lungs, and less frequently in the bones, kidneys,\nspleen, muscles, central nervous system and eyes. Abdominal pain, nausea and\nvomiting commonly occur when cysts invade the liver. If the lung is affected,\nclinical signs include chronic cough, chest pain and shortness of breath.\nAlveolar echinococcosis is\ncharacterized by an asymptomatic incubation period of 5–15 years and the slow\ndevelopment of a primary tumour-like lesion which is usually located in the\nliver. Lesions may also involve other organs such as the spleen, lungs and\nbrain following dissemination of the parasite via the blood and lymphatic\nsystem. Clinical signs include weight loss, abdominal pain, general malaise and\nsigns of hepatic failure."}

Clinical signs include weight loss, abdominal pain, general malaise and\nsigns of hepatic failure. If left untreated, alveolar echinococcosis is\nprogressive and fatal.\nTreatment\nBoth cystic echinococcosis and alveolar echinococcosis can be expensive and complicated to treat, sometimes requiring extensive surgery and/or prolonged drug therapy. The treatment used should be decided based on results from ultrasound images of the cyst. Treatments can include percutaneous treatment of the hydatid cysts with the PAIR (Puncture, Aspiration, Injection, Re-aspiration) technique, surgery, anti-infective drug treatments or simply watching and waiting.\nHuman cystic echinococcosis is diagnosed with imaging tools such as ultrasound or computed tomography, and its laboratory confirmation relies on serological tests.\nDiagnosis of alveolar echinococcosis is based on clinical findings and epidemiological data, imaging techniques, histopathology and/or nucleic acid detection, and serology. Early diagnosis and radical (tumour-like) surgery followed by anti-infective prophylaxis remain the key elements."}
