Volkov\n©\nCredits\nSodium reduction\n7 February 2025\nKey facts\nAlmost all populations are consuming too much sodium.\nThe global mean intake of adults is 4310 mg/day sodium (equivalent to 10.78 g/day salt)\n(1)\n. This is more than double the World Health Organization recommendation for adults of less than 2000 mg/day sodium (equivalent to < 5 g/day salt, or approximately one teaspoon).\nThe primary health effect associated with diets high in sodium is raised blood pressure which increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, gastric cancer, obesity, osteoporosis, Meniere’s disease, and kidney disease.\nAn estimated 1.89 million deaths each year are associated with consuming too much sodium\n(2)\n.\nReducing sodium intake is one of the most cost-effective measures to improve health and reduce the burden of non-communicable diseases: for every US$ 1 invested in scaling up sodium reduction interventions, there will be a return of at least US$ 12.\nOverview\nThe\nburden of unhealthy diets\nconstitutes a major public health and development challenge worldwide."}

Urgent action is required to modify the over-production and over-consumption of foods and beverages that do not have a healthy nutritional profile, mainly industry manufactured food. Of greatest concern is excess consumption of sodium, sugars and unhealthy fats, particularly\ntrans\n-fatty acids (trans fats) and saturated fatty acids, and low consumption of whole grains, pulses, vegetables, and fruits\n.\nIn many high-income countries, and increasingly in low- and middle-income countries, a significant proportion of sodium in the diet comes from processed foods.\nAn estimated 1.89 million deaths each year are associated with consuming too much sodium, a well-established cause of raised blood pressure and increased risk of cardiovascular disease\n(2)\n.\nReducing sodium intake is one of the most cost-effective ways to improve health and reduce the burden of noncommunicable diseases, as it can avert many cardiovascular events and deaths at very low total programme costs."}
