Perugia\n©\nCredits\nCampylobacter\n1 May 2020\nKey facts\nCampylobacter is 1 of 4 key global causes of diarrhoeal diseases. It is considered to be the most common bacterial cause of human gastroenteritis in the world.\nCampylobacter infections are generally mild, but can be fatal among very young children, elderly, and immunosuppressed individuals.\nCampylobacter species can be killed by heat and thoroughly cooking food.\nTo prevent Campylobacter infections, make sure to follow basic food hygiene practices when preparing food.\nThe burden of foodborne diseases, including Campylobacteriosis, is substantial: every year almost 1 in 10 people fall ill and 33 million of healthy life years are lost. Foodborne diseases can be severe, especially for young children."}

Foodborne diseases can be severe, especially for young children. Diarrhoeal diseases are the most common illnesses resulting from unsafe food, with 550 million people falling ill yearly (including 220 million children under the age of 5 years).\nCampylobacter\nis 1 of the 4 key global causes of diarrhoeal diseases.\nThe high incidence of\nCampylobacter\ndiarrhoea, as well as its duration and possible complications, makes it highly important from a socio-economic perspective. In developing countries,\nCampylobacter\ninfections in children under the age of 2 years are especially frequent, sometimes resulting in death.\nCampylobacter\nare mainly spiral-shaped, “S”-shaped, or curved, rod-shaped bacteria. Currently, there are 17 species and 6 subspecies assigned to the genus\nCampylobacter\n, of which the most frequently reported in human diseases are\nC. jejuni\n(subspecies\njejuni\n) and\nC. coli\n.

Other species such as\nC. lari\nand\nC. upsaliensis\nhave also been isolated from patients with diarrhoeal disease, but are reported less frequently.\nThe disease\nCampylobacteriosis is the disease caused by the infection with\nCampylobacter\n:\nThe onset of disease symptoms usually occurs 2 to 5 days after infection with the bacteria, but can range from 1 to 10 days.\nThe most common clinical symptoms of\nCampylobacter\ninfections include diarrhoea (frequently bloody), abdominal pain, fever, headache, nausea, and/or vomiting. The symptoms typically last 3 to 6 days.\nDeath from campylobacteriosis is rare and is usually confined to very young children or elderly patients, or to those already suffering from another serious disease such as AIDS.\nComplications such as bacteraemia (presence of bacteria in the blood), hepatitis, pancreatitis (infections of liver and pancreas, respectively), and miscarriage have been reported with various degrees of frequency."}

Post-infection complications\nmay include reactive arthritis (painful inflammation of the joints which can last for several months) and neurological disorders such as Guillain-Barré syndrome, a polio-like form of paralysis that can result in respiratory and severe\nneurological dysfunction in a small number of cases.\nSources and transmission\nCampylobacter\nspecies are widely distributed in most warm-blooded animals. They are prevalent in food animals such as poultry, cattle, pigs, sheep and ostriches; and in pets, including cats and dogs. The bacteria have also been found in shellfish.\nThe main route of transmission is generally believed to be foodborne, via undercooked meat and meat products, as well as raw or contaminated milk. Contaminated water or ice is also a source of infection. A proportion of cases occur following contact with contaminated water during recreational activities.\nCampylobacteriosis is a zoonosis, a disease transmitted to humans from animals or animal products."}

Most often, carcasses or meat are contaminated by\nCampylobacter\nfrom faeces during slaughtering. In animals,\nCampylobacter\nseldom causes disease.\nThe relative contribution of each of the above sources to the overall burden of disease is unclear but consumption of undercooked contaminated poultry is believed to be a major contributor. Since common-source outbreaks account for a rather small proportion of cases, the vast majority of reports refer to sporadic cases, with no easily discernible pattern.\nEstimating the importance of all known sources is therefore extremely difficult. In addition, the wide occurrence of\nCampylobacter\nalso hinders the development of control strategies throughout the food chain. However, in countries where specific strategies have been put in place to reduce the prevalence of\nCampylobacter\nin live poultry, a similar reduction in human cases is observed.\nTreatment\nTreatment is not generally required, except electrolyte replacement and rehydration."}

Training in hygienic food handling for abattoir workers and\nraw meat producers is essential to keep contamination to a minimum.\nPrevention methods against infection in domestic kitchens are similar to those used against other foodborne bacterial diseases.\nBactericidal treatment, such as heating (for example, cooking or pasteurization) or irradiation, is the only effective method of eliminating\nCampylobacter\nfrom contaminated foods.\nWHO response\nIn partnership with other stakeholders, WHO is strongly advocating the importance of food safety as an essential element in ensuring access to safe and nutritious diets."}
