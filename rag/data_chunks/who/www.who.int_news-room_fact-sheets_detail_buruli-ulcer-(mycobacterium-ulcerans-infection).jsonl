The bacterium produces a toxin that causes the skin damage. Without early treatment, Buruli ulcer can  lead to long-term disability. The germ that causes Buruli ulcer belongs to the same family of those that cause tuberculosis and leprosy. It is still unclear how people get Buruli ulcer from the environment.\nScope of the problem\nBuruli ulcer has been reported in 33 countries in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Western Pacific."}

Out of the 33 countries, 14 regularly report data to WHO.\nThe annual number of cases can be found under\nGlobal Health Observatory\n.\nTransmission\nThe exact mode of transmission of\nM. ulcerans\nis still unknown.\nSigns and symptoms\nBuruli ulcer often starts as a painless swelling (nodule), a large painless area of induration (plaque) or a diffuse painless swelling of the legs, arms or face (oedema). The disease may progress with no pain and fever. Without treatment or sometimes during antibiotics treatment, the nodule, plaque or oedema will ulcerate within 4 weeks."}

Bone is occasionally affected, causing deformities.\nThe disease has been classified into three categories of severity: Category I, single small lesion (32%) less than 5 cm on diameter; Category II, non-ulcerative and ulcerative plaque and oedematous forms between 5-15 cm (35%); and Category III lesions more than 15 cm in diameter including, disseminated and mixed forms such as, osteomyelitis and joint involvement (33%).\nLesions frequently occur in the limbs: 35% on the upper limbs, 55% on the lower limbs, and 10% on the other parts of the body."}

Health workers should be careful in the diagnosis of Buruli ulcer in patients with lower leg lesions to avoid confusion with other causes of ulceration such as diabetes, arterial and venous insufficiency lesion.\nDiagnosis\nIn most cases, experienced health professionals in endemic areas can make a reliable clinical diagnosis, but training is essential.\nDifferential diagnoses of Buruli ulcer include tropical phagedenic ulcers, chronic lower leg ulcers due to arterial and venous insufficiency (often in elderly populations), diabetic ulcers, cutaneous leishmaniasis, extensive ulcerative yaws and ulcers caused by\nHaemophilus ducreyi\n.\nEarly nodular and papular lesions may be confused with insect bite, boils, lipomas, ganglions, lymph node tuberculosis, onchocerciasis nodules or deep fungal subcutaneous infections.\nCellulitis may look like oedema caused by\nM."}

WHO has published a\ntechnical guide\nto help clinicians in the management of co-infection.\nFour standard laboratory methods can be used to confirm Buruli ulcer: IS2404 polymerase chain reaction (PCR), direct microscopy, histopathology and culture. The bacterium\ngrows best at temperatures between 29–33 °C (\nMycobacterium tuberculosis\ngrows at 37 °C) and needs a low (2.5%) oxygen concentration.\nIn 2019, WHO established the Buruli ulcer Laboratory Network for Africa\n(1)\nto help strengthen PCR confirmation in 9 endemic countries in Africa."}
