The risks can depend on many things, including the health of the traveller, the type of travel, and the destination. Health risks can come from factors such as changes in temperature and humidity, air pollution, issues of safety and security, access to health and dental care services and products, exposure to infectious diseases, access to safe food and water, sanitation and hygiene standards, availability of facilities and equipment for disabled people, and local laws and customs.\nInternational travel can be stressful. Travellers may be away from family and friends and may need to adjust to foreign cultures and languages. Coping with high levels of stress may cause physical, social and psychological problems. Changes to the circadian rhythm (e.g. jet lag) and sleep deprivation can trigger seizures in people with epilepsy, provoke migraine attacks and cause more behavioural symptoms in people living with dementia.\nAll individuals planning travel should seek information or advice on potential health risks before they travel."}

It is important for travellers to understand how best to avoid or minimize these risks, take appropriate preventive measures, and exercise necessary precautions before, during and after travel.\nBefore travel\nTravellers should prepare themselves in several ways before departure. First, it is important to gather information about the potential health risks early in the planning stage. Travellers should also be aware of differences in local laws and customs, including those relating to substance use and sexual relationships.\nTravellers should visit a travel clinic, preferably 4–8 weeks before departure or earlier, but it’s useful even if it’s very close to the departure date."}

There may be additional considerations for certain groups of travellers, including infants and young children, pregnant and breastfeeding women, older people, people with disabilities, and those who have underlying health conditions, including\nmental, neurological and substance use conditions\n.\nTravellers are strongly advised to obtain comprehensive travel insurance as a matter of routine and to declare any underlying health conditions to their travel insurers.\nSufficient medical supplies, including prescribed medications, should be carried to cover the duration of the trip, including possible delays and change of plans. Toiletries should also be carried in sufficient quantity for the entire duration of the trip unless their availability at the travel destination is assured.\nDuring and after travel\nDuring travel\nWhen travelling, always have important health documents with you, such as health insurance certificates and vaccine or malaria prophylaxis records."}
