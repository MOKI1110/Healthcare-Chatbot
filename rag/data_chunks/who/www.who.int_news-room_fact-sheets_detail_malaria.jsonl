It is mostly found in tropical countries. It is preventable and curable.\nThe infection is caused by a parasite and does not spread from person to person.\nSymptoms can be mild or life-threatening. Mild symptoms are fever, chills and headache. Severe symptoms include fatigue, confusion, seizures, and difficulty breathing.\nInfants, children under 5 years, pregnant women and girls, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk of severe infection.\nMalaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and with medicines."}

Blood transfusion and contaminated needles may also transmit malaria. The first symptoms may be mild, similar to many febrile illnesses, and difficulty to recognize as malaria. Left untreated,\nP. falciparum\nmalaria can progress to severe illness and death within 24 hours.\nThere are 5\nPlasmodium\nparasite species that cause malaria in humans and 2 of these species –\nP. falciparum\nand\nP. vivax\n– pose the greatest threat.\nP. falciparum\nis the deadliest malaria parasite and the most prevalent on the African continent.\nP. vivax\nis the dominant malaria parasite in most countries outside of sub-Saharan Africa.

Because some malaria symptoms are not specific, getting tested early is important.\nSome types of malaria can cause severe illness and death. Infants, children under 5 years, pregnant women, travellers and people with HIV or AIDS are at higher risk.

The estimated number of malaria deaths stood at 597 000 in 2023 compared to 600 000 in 2022.\nThe WHO African Region continues to carry a disproportionately high share of the global malaria burden. In 2023 the Region was home to about 94% of all malaria cases and 95% of deaths. Children under 5 years of age accounted for about 76% of all malaria deaths in the Region.\nOver half of these deaths occurred in four countries: Nigeria (30.9%), the Democratic Republic of the Congo (11.3%), Niger (5.9%) and United Republic of Tanzania (4.3%).\nPrevention\nMalaria can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites and by taking medicines."}

It requires giving a full treatment course of an antimalarial medicine to vulnerable populations at designated time points during the period of greatest malarial risk, regardless of whether the recipients are infected with malaria.\nPreventive chemotherapy includes perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC), seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC), intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp) and school-aged children (IPTsc), post-discharge malaria chemoprevention (PDMC) and mass drug administration (MDA)."}

The vaccine has been shown to significantly reduce malaria, and deadly severe malaria, among young children.

WHO recommends that all suspected cases of malaria be confirmed using parasite-based\ndiagnostic testing\n(through either microscopy or a rapid diagnostic test).\nMalaria is a serious infection and always requires treatment with medicine.\nMultiple medicines are used to prevent and treat malaria. Doctors will choose one or more based on:\nthe type of malaria\nwhether a malaria parasite is resistant to a medicine\nthe weight or age of the person infected with malaria\nwhether the person is pregnant.\nThese are the most common medicines for malaria:\nArtemisinin-based combination therapy medicines are the most effective treatment for\nP."}

Some people may need to go to a health centre or hospital for injectable medicines.\nAntimalarial drug resistance\nSubsequent to the emergence of partial artemisinin resistance in the Greater Mekong subregion, WHO is very concerned about confirmed partial artemisinin resistance in Eritrea, Rwanda, Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania.

However, parasites with genetic mutations, that prevent the expression of these proteins, are not detected by these tests. This means that malaria patients may not be diagnosed, allowing these mutated parasites to spread. In 2023, these mutated parasites were reported in 41 malaria endemic countries, including in Burkina Faso, Chad, Togo, and Indonesia for the first time."}
