It is a viral, zoonotic, neglected tropical disease that causes tens of thousands of deaths annually, with 40% being children under 15.\nDog bites and scratches cause 99% of the human rabies cases, and can be prevented through dog vaccination and bite prevention.\nOnce the virus infects the central nervous system and clinical symptoms appear, rabies is fatal in 100% of cases.\nHowever, rabies deaths are preventable with prompt post exposure prophylaxis (PEP) by stopping the virus from reaching the central nervous system."}

PEP consists of thorough wound washing, administration of a course of human rabies vaccine and, when indicated, rabies immunoglobulins (RIG).\nIf a person is bitten or scratched by a potentially rabid animal, they should immediately and always seek PEP care.\nWHO and its global partners aim to end human deaths from dog-mediated rabies through a comprehensive One Health approach promoting mass dog vaccination, ensuring access to PEP, health worker training, improved surveillance, and bite prevention through community awareness.\nOverview\nDog-mediated rabies\nRabies is a vaccine-preventable, zoonotic, viral disease affecting the central nervous system. In up to 99% of the human rabies cases, dogs are responsible for virus transmission. Children between the age of 5 and 14 years are frequent victims.\nRabies infects mammals, including dogs, cats, livestock and wildlife.\nRabies spreads to people and animals via saliva, usually through\nbites\n, scratches, or direct contact with mucosa (e.g."}

Initial symptoms of rabies include generic signs like fever, pain and unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking, or burning sensations at the wound site."}

Clinical rabies in people can be managed but very rarely cured, and not without severe neurological deficits.\nThere are two forms of rabies:\nFurious rabies\nresults in hyperactivity, excitable behaviour, hallucinations, lack of coordination, hydrophobia (fear of water) and aerophobia (fear of drafts or of fresh air). Death occurs after a few days due to cardio-respiratory arrest.\nParalytic rabies\naccounts for about 20% of the total number of human cases.
