These blackflies breed along fast-flowing rivers and streams,\nclose to remote villages located near fertile land where people rely on\nagriculture.\nIn the human body, the adult worms produce embryonic larvae\n(microfilariae) that migrate to the skin, eyes and other organs. When a\nfemale blackfly bites an infected person during a blood meal, it also\ningests microfilariae which develop further in the blackfly and are then\ntransmitted to the next human host during subsequent bites.\nSymptoms\nOnchocerciasis is an eye and skin disease. Symptoms are caused by\nthe microfilariae, which move around the human body in the subcutaneous\ntissue and induce intense inflammatory responses when they die. Infected\npeople may show symptoms such as severe itching and various skin\nchanges. Some infected people develop eye lesions which can lead to\nvisual impairment and permanent blindness."}
