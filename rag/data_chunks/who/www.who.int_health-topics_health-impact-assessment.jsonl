Recommendations are produced for decision-makers and stakeholders, and a framework for monitoring and evaluating changes in health is offered as part of performance management and sustainable development.\nThe approach can be applied in diverse economic sectors and uses quantitative, qualitative and participatory techniques. Examples of how HIA has been used include clean energy options, master plans, planning for green spaces, transportation and urban growth projects, zoning for walkability, air pollution and noise reduction interventions, climate change mitigation and adaptation policies. HIA provides a way to engage with members of the public affected by a particular proposal."}

HIA provides a way to engage with members of the public affected by a particular proposal. It also helps decision-makers and Member States make choices about alternatives and improvements to prevent disease or injury and to actively promote health. It is based on the four interlinked values of democracy (promoting stakeholder participation), equity (considering the impact on the whole population), sustainable development and the ethical use of evidence.\nImpact\nHIA is a consolidated approach to estimate and anticipate the consequences\nof policies, plans, programmes and projects. It is a key resource for achieving\nforesight in societal decision-making, systematically deployed worldwide. Economic\nsectors such as transport, agriculture, energy, waste and housing have profound\nimpacts on health. For instance, transport is a major factor in traffic\ninjuries, air pollution and noise, and healthy transport policies can help\nreduce these risks, as well as promoting walking and cycling."}

In agriculture,\nfertilizers and pesticides may boost crop yields, but wise use is important to\nprotect farm workers and consumers from excessive chemical exposure. Health\nimpact assessment can be a valuable tool for helping to develop policy and\nassisting decision-makers in these and other areas.\nResources\nWHO is responding by building the capacity, providing tools and initiatives in health impact assessment to dynamically improve health and well-being across sectors.\nWHO supports the health sector to effectively engage in urban health, working across sectors to help cities to produce contextual, meaningful and actionable information on the health, economic and climate impacts of urban environments. WHO supports decision-makers to equip themselves to accept, reject or amend policy alternatives, in the knowledge that they have the best available health evidence before them.\nHealth risk assessment techniques have been applied in the air pollution field for many years."}
