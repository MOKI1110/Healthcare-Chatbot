The devastating impact of the COVID-19 pandemic revealed significant gaps and inequities in the world's ability to prevent and respond to health emergencies, prompting nations to take action. Launched in 2021, the negotiation process involved three years of intensive work by governments, in consultation with relevant stakeholders and experts. The aim of the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body established for this process was to draft and negotiate a WHO convention, agreement or other international instrument on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response, that would culminate in a legally binding international instrument designed to make the world safer and more equitable in the face of future pandemics.\nFollowing its adoption, the next crucial step is for an Intergovernmental Working Group (IGWG) on the Pandemic Agreement to negotiate the details of the Pathogen Access and Benefit-Sharing (PABS) system, which will form an annex to the Agreement."}

The Agreement also establishes a Coordinating Financial Mechanism to support strengthening and expanding pandemic prevention, preparedness and response capacities in countries. The Agreement strongly reaffirms that it does not give WHO authority to impose measures such as lockdowns or vaccine mandates on any country.\nImplementation\nImplementing the WHO Pandemic Agreement will be a collaborative of the State Parties to the instrument, involving coordinated action at national, regional and international levels. A Conference of the Parties will be established as the main governing body, meeting regularly to review progress, make decisions, and promote effective implementation. Each country is encouraged to consider ratification of the WHO Pandemic Agreement, in line with its domestic practices, and is responsible for integrating the Agreement's goals into its national plans and policies."}
