Research is strengthening surveillance, rapid diagnostics and development of vaccines and medicines.\nPublic-private partnerships and other innovative mechanisms for research are concentrating on neglected diseases in order to stimulate the development of vaccines, drugs and diagnostics where market forces alone are insufficient.\nResearch for health spans 5 generic areas of activity:\nmeasuring the magnitude and distribution of the health problem;\nunderstanding the diverse causes or the determinants of the problem, whether they are due to biological, behavioural, social or environmental factors;\ndeveloping solutions or interventions that will help to prevent or mitigate the problem;\nimpleme"}

One of the Organization’s core functions is to set international norms, standards and guidelines, including setting international standards for research.\nUnder the “WHO strategy on research for health”, the Organization works to identify research priorities, and promote and conduct research with the following 4 goals:\nCapacity\n- build capacity to strengthen health research systems within Member States.\nPriorities\n- support the setting of research priorities      that meet health needs particularly in low- and middle-income countries.\nStandards\n- develop an enabling environment for research      through the creation of norms and standards for good research practice.\nTranslation\n- ensure"}
