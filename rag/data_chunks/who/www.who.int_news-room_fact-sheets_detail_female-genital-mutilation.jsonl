The practice has no health benefits for girls and women and can result in severe bleeding and problems urinating, and later cysts, menstrual difficulties, infections, as well as complications in childbirth and increased risk of newborn deaths.\nThe practice of FGM is recognized internationally as a violation of the human rights of girls and women."}

It reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes and constitutes an extreme form of discrimination against girls and women. It is nearly always carried out on minors and is a violation of the rights of children. The practice also violates a person's right to health, security and physical integrity; the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment; and the right to life, in instances when the procedure results in death. In several settings, there is evidence suggesting greater involvement of health workers in performing FGM due to the belief that the procedure is safer when medicalized."}

WHO strongly urges health workers not to perform FGM and has developed a global strategy and specific materials to support the health sector and health workers themselves to end FGM medicalization.\nTypes of FGM\nFemale genital mutilation is classified into 4 major types:\nType 1:\nThis is the partial or total removal of the clitoral glans (the external and visible part of the clitoris, which is a sensitive part of the female genitals), and/or the prepuce/clitoral hood (the fold of skin surrounding the clitoral glans).\nType 2:\nThis is the partial or total removal of the clitoral glans and the labia minora (the inner folds of the vulva), with or without removal of the labia majora (the outer folds of skin of the vulva).\nType 3:\nAlso known as infibulation, this is the narrowing of the vaginal opening through the creation of a covering seal."}

It involves removing and damaging healthy and normal female genital tissue, and it interferes with the natural functions of girls' and women's bodies."}

According to available data from 31 countries where FGM is practiced in the western, eastern, and north-eastern regions of Africa, and some countries in the Middle East and Asia, more than 230 million girls and women alive today have been subjected to the practice with more than 4 million girls estimated to be at risk of FGM annually."}

FGM is therefore of global concern.\nCultural and social factors for performing FGM\nThe reasons why FGM is performed vary from one region to another as well as over time and include a mix of sociocultural factors within families and communities.\nWhere FGM is a social convention (social norm), the social pressure to conform to what others do and have been doing, as well as the need to be accepted socially and the fear of being rejected by the community, are strong motivations to perpetuate the practice.\nFGM is often considered a necessary part of raising a girl, and a way to prepare her for adulthood and marriage. This can include controlling her sexuality to promote premarital virginity and marital fidelity.\nSome people believe that the practice has religious support, although no religious scripts prescribe the practice."}

These include:\nthe belief that there is reduced risk of complications associated with medicalized FGM as compared to non-medicalized FGM;\nthe belief that medicalization of FGM could be a first step towards full abandonment of the practice;\nhealth care providers who perform FGM are themselves members of FGM- practicing communities and are subject to the same social norms; and\nthere may be a financial incentive to perform the practice.\nHowever, with WHO’s support and training, many health care providers are becoming advocates for FGM abandonment within the clinical setting and with their families and communities.\nWHO response\nIn 2008, the World Health Assembly passed resolution WHA61.16 on the elimination of FGM, emphasizing the need for concerted action in all sectors: health, education, finance,"}

WHO also generates evidence to improve the understanding of FGM and what works to end this harmful practice.\nSince then, WHO has developed a global strategy against FGM medicalization with partner organizations and continues to support countries in its implementation.\nRelated\nWHO's work on female genital mutilation\nCommentary: It's our job as health workers to \"do no harm\"\nGlobal strategy to stop health-care providers from performing female genital mutilation\nEliminating female genital mutilation."}
