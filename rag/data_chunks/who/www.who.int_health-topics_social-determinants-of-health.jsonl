These are the unfair and avoidable differences in health status seen within and between countries.\nAt all levels of income, health and illness follow a social gradient: the lower the socioeconomic position, the worse the health. People who have limited access to quality housing, education, social protection and job opportunities have a higher risk of illness and death. Research shows that these social determinants can outweigh genetic influences or healthcare access in terms of influencing health.\nAddressing the social determinants of health equity is fundamental for improving health and reducing longstanding inequities in health. It requires action by all parts of government, the private sector and civil society."}

It requires action by all parts of government, the private sector and civil society. WHO is committed to supporting countries in developing and implementing key policies that address the social determinants of health to reduce health inequities.\nIn practice\nThere are challenges to overcome in implementing action to address health inequities through the social determinants of health. The social determinants of health equity is a complex and multifaceted field. It involves a wide range of stakeholders within and beyond the health sector and all levels of government. In addition, social determinants of health data can be difficult to collect and share.\nWhile the evidence base on the social determinants of health has strengthened during the past decade, the evidence base on what works needs to be strengthened and good practices disseminated effectively.\nThree areas for critical action identified in the report of the\nGlobal Commission on Social Determinants of Health\nreflect their importance in tackling inequities in health."}

For example:\nThere is a difference of 18 years of life expectancy between high- and low- income countries;\nIn 2016, the majority of the 15 million premature deaths due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) occurred in low- and middle-income countries;\nRelative gaps within countries between poorer and richer subgroups for diseases like cancer have increased in all regions across the world;\nThe under-5 mortality rate is more than eight times higher in Africa than the European region. Within countries, improvements in child health between poorest and richest subgroups have been impaired by slower improvements for poorer subgroups.\nSuch trends within and between countries are unfair, unjust and avoidable."}
