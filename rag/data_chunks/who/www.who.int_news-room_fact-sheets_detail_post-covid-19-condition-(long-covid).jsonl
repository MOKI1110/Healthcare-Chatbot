However, the virus is still circulating widely, and every new infection is associated with a risk.\nFatigue, breathlessness, muscle or joint pain, and impaired sleep are common symptoms of post-COVID-19 condition.\nWHO is working to develop clinical practice guidelines for management of post COVID-19 condition.\nHealth-care providers can guide patients on self-management of symptoms and offer medication for symptom relief or referral for rehabilitation services as needed.\nOverview\nCOVID-19 can lead to serious long-term effects, known as post COVID-19 condition (PCC)."}

It is also commonly referred to as long COVID.\nPost COVID-19 condition is characterized by a range of symptoms which usually start within 3 months of the initial COVID-19 illness and last at least 2 months. PCC can affect a person’s ability to perform daily activities such as work or household chores and restrict social participation.\nScope of the problem\nMillions of people have been affected with post COVID-19 condition since the beginning of the pandemic\n(1)\n. Global estimates indicate that 6 in 100 people with COVID-19 develop post COVID-19 condition. Estimates largely come from people who suffered COVID-19 early in the pandemic (in the first two years), and there is a very large variation in estimates\n(2)\n.\nMore recent research shows the chances of developing post COVID-19 condition have reduced, but these data are limited and mostly from high-income countries\n(3)\n."}

Some people have higher risk. These include women, older adults, smokers, those who are overweight or obese or have pre-existing chronic health problems. Repeated infections and severe COVID-19 needing hospitalization or ICU admission also increase the risk\n(4)\n. We see higher numbers of post COVID-19 condition sufferers among people with disabilities, and where health disparity and access to health care is a problem\n(5)\n.\nResearch is ongoing to better understand what causes post COVID-19 condition.

Common symptoms include:\nfatigue\naches and pains in muscles or joints\nfeeling breathless\nheadaches\ndifficulty in thinking or concentrating\nalterations in taste.\nImpaired sleep, depression and anxiety also occur\n(5)\n.

Health-care providers can discuss with patients about self-management strategies to respond promptly to a flare-up or relapse, such as identifying possible triggers, temporarily reducing activity levels, monitoring symptoms over time, and not returning to usual activity levels until the flare-up has resolved.

To better understand this phenomenon, WHO met with patient advocates, researchers, health-care providers and public health professionals and by September 2020, established emergency international classification of disease (ICD) codes for post COVID-19 condition.\nSince then, WHO has developed a\nclinical case definition of post COVID-19 condition\nto recognize the condition and its impact on people’s lives."}
