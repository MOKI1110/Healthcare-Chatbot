Chronic HDV occurs only in people living with HBV.\nHDV affects globally nearly 5% (an estimated 12 million) of people who have a chronic infection with HBV.\nPopulations that are more likely to have HBV and HDV co-infection include indigenous populations, recipients of haemodialysis and people who inject drugs.\nChronic HDV infection is considered the most severe form of chronic viral hepatitis due to more rapid progression towards liver-related death and hepatocellular carcinoma.\nHDV has recently been classified as carcinogenic to humans, just like hepatitis B and C.\nHepatitis D infection can be prevented by hepatitis B immunization.\nNovel treatment options with better safety profiles and outcomes are emerging and have been approved in Europe.\nOverview\nHepatitis D is an inflammation of the liver caused by the hepatitis D virus (HDV), which requires hepatitis B virus (HBV) for its replication. Hepatitis D infection cannot occur in the absence of HBV."}

Vaccination against hepatitis B can prevent HDV infection. HDV has recently been classified as carcinogenic to humans (class I) by the IARC mongraph programme, just like hepatitis B and C.\nGeographical distribution\nIn a study published in the\nJournal of Hepatology\nin 2020\n(1\n), conducted in collaboration with WHO, it was estimated that hepatitis D virus (HDV) affects nearly 5% of people globally who have a chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and that HDV co-infection could explain about 1 in 5 cases of liver disease and liver cancer in people with HBV infection."}

The study has identified several geographical hotspots of high prevalence of HDV infection including Mongolia, the Republic of Moldova, and countries in western and central Africa.\nTransmission\nHDV is blood borne and transmitted in the same way as HBV. Transmission may occur through contact with infected human blood or other bodily fluids. It may also be transmitted through sexual intercourse, or rarely from a mother to her child before or around birth (vertical transmission). HDV can also spread within families in endemic areas.\nChronic HBV carriers are at risk of infection with HDV. People who are not immune to HBV (either by natural disease or immunization with the hepatitis B vaccine) are at risk of infection with HBV, which puts them at risk of HDV infection.\nThose who are more likely to have HBV and HDV co-infection include indigenous people, people who inject drugs and people with hepatitis C virus or HIV infection."}

The risk of HDV infection also appears to be potentially higher in recipients of haemodialysis, men who have sex with men and commercial sex workers.\nVaccination against HBV can prevent HDV coinfection and hence expansion of childhood HBV immunization programmes has resulted in a decline in hepatitis D incidence worldwide.\nSymptoms\nSimultaneous infection with HBV and HDV can lead to mild-to-severe hepatitis with signs and symptoms of indistinguishable from those of other types of acute viral hepatitis infections. These features typically appear 3–7 weeks after initial infection and include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, dark urine, pale-coloured stools, jaundice (yellow eyes) and even fulminant hepatitis. However, recovery is usually complete, development of fulminant hepatitis is infrequent, and progression to chronic hepatitis D is rare (less than 5% of acute hepatitis).\nIn a superinfection, HDV can infect a person already chronically infected with HBV."}

The superinfection of HDV on chronic hepatitis B accelerates progression to a more severe disease in all ages and in 70‒90% of persons. HDV superinfection markedly accelerates progression to cirrhosis when compared with HBV mono-infected persons. Patients with HDV induced cirrhosis are at an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, the mechanism in which HDV causes more severe hepatitis and a faster progression of fibrosis than HBV alone remains unclear.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosing chronic HDV requires serology to demonstrate exposure (past or current infection) and molecular methods to demonstrate the presence of HDV RNA and active infection.\nHowever, HDV diagnostics are not widely available – especially in low- and middle-income countries – and there is only little standardization for HDV RNA assays, which are essential to detect active, viremic infection and for monitoring response to antiviral therapy.\nTreatment\nUntil recently, pegylated interferon α (PEG-IFNα) had been"}

However, its use has been limited by poor treatment outcomes, side-effects and contraindications. Only about 20–30% of those treated with PEG-IFNα achieve complete virological response under treatment, and relapse is frequent.\nThe HDV treatment landscape is now rapidly evolving, with some novel agents showing favorable results. In 2023, Bulevirtide, an entry inhibitor that is given once daily through subcutaneous injection, received approval for treatment of chronic HDV by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) among adults with compensated liver disease."}
