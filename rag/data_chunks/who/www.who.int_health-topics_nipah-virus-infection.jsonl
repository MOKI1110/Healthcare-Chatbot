In\ninfected people, it causes a range of illnesses from asymptomatic (subclinical)\ninfection to acute respiratory illness and fatal encephalitis. The virus can\nalso cause severe disease in animals such as pigs, resulting in significant\neconomic losses for farmers.\nAlthough Nipah virus has\ncaused only a few known outbreaks in Asia, it infects a wide range of animals\nand causes severe disease and death in people.\nDuring the first\nrecognized outbreak in Malaysia, which also affected Singapore, most human\ninfections resulted from direct contact with sick pigs or their contaminated\ntissues."}

Transmission is thought to have occurred via unprotected exposure to\nsecretions from the pigs, or unprotected contact with the tissue of a sick\nanimal.\nIn subsequent outbreaks in Bangladesh and India, consumption of fruits or fruit\nproducts (such as raw date palm juice) contaminated with urine or saliva from\ninfected fruit bats was the most likely source of infection.\nHuman-to-human\ntransmission of Nipah virus has also been reported among family and care givers\nof infected patients.\nSymptoms\nHuman infections range from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory infection, seizures and fatal encephalitis. Infected people initially develop symptoms that include fever, headaches, myalgia, vomiting and sore throat. This can be followed by dizziness, drowsiness, altered consciousness, and neurological signs that indicate acute encephalitis. Some people can also experience atypical pneumonia and severe respiratory problems, including acute respiratory distress."}

Some people can also experience atypical pneumonia and severe respiratory problems, including acute respiratory distress. Encephalitis and seizures occur in severe cases, progressing to coma within 24 to 48 hours.\nThe incubation period is from 4 to 14 days but an incubation period as long  as 45 days has been reported.\nMost people make a full recovery, although some are left with residual neurological conditions after acute encephalitis. Some cases of relapse have been reported.\nThe case fatality rate of Nipah virus infection is estimated at 40–75% but can vary by outbreak depending on surveillance and clinical management in affected areas.\nTreatment\nThere are currently no drugs or vaccines that specifically target Nipah virus infection."}
