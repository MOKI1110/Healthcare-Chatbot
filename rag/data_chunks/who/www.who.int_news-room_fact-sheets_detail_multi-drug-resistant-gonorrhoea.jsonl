WHO estimates that in 2020, there were 82.4 million\n[47.7 million-130.4 million] new cases infected among adolescents and adults\naged 15–49 years worldwide, with a global incident rate of 19 (11–29) per 1000\nwomen and 23 (10–43) per 1000 men. Most cases were in the WHO African Region and\nthe Western Pacific Region.\nAntimicrobial resistance (AMR) in\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae\n(\nN.\ngonorrhoeae\n) appeared soon after the antimicrobial medicines started to be\nused."}

In many countries,\nciprofloxacin resistance is exceedingly high, azithromycin resistance is\nincreasing and resistance or decreased susceptibility to cefixime and\nceftriaxone continue to emerge.\nThe extensively drug-resistant gonorrhoea with high-level resistance to the current recommended treatment for gonorrhoea (ceftriaxone) but also including resistance to penicillin, sulphonamides, tetracycline, fluoroquinolones and macrolides (including azithromycin) are called gonorrhoea superbugs or super gonorrhoea.\nHistory\nThe first reported treatment failure with cefixime was in Japan."}

The majority of infections in the pharynx are asymptomatic. Antimicrobial drugs don’t penetrate the tissue well in that area, and the pharynx is also home to naturally occurring related bacteria of the\nNeisseria\nspecies that can contribute to drug resistance. Most data on this issue come from higher income countries; however, the majority of cases of gonorrhoea are in less resourced countries and areas.\nThis suggests that reports of treatment failures and drug resistance in wealthier areas are only the tip of the global health burden. Surveillance data on antibiotic resistance and treatment failures from poorer countries are exceedingly scarce and need to be improved. Gonococcal resistance to ceftriaxone, the last remaining option for empiric first-line gonorrhoea treatment, is a major public health concern.
