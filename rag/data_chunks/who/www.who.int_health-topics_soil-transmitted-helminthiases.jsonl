They are transmitted by eggs present in human faeces which\nin turn contaminate soil in areas where sanitation is poor.\nThe main species that infect people are the roundworm (\nAscaris lumbricoides\n), the whipworm (\nTrichuris trichiura\n) and the hookworms (\nNecator americanus\nand\nAncylostoma duodenale\n).\nIntestinal worms produce a wide range of symptoms including\nintestinal manifestations (diarrhoea, abdominal pain), general malaise\nand weakness. Hookworms cause chronic intestinal blood loss that result\nin anaemia.\nSoil-transmitted helminths are transmitted by eggs that are passed in\nthe faeces of infected people. Adult worms live in the intestine where\nthey produce thousands of eggs each day. In areas that lack adequate\nsanitation, these eggs contaminate the\nsoil."}

Adult worms live in the intestine where\nthey produce thousands of eggs each day. In areas that lack adequate\nsanitation, these eggs contaminate the\nsoil. This can happen in several ways:\neggs that are attached to vegetables are ingested when the vegetables are not carefully cooked, washed or peeled;\neggs are ingested from contaminated water sources;\neggs are ingested by children who play in the contaminated soil and then put their hands in their mouths without washing them.\nSymptoms\nMorbidity is related to the number of worms harboured. People with\ninfections of light intensity (few worms) usually do not suffer from the\ninfection. Heavier infections can cause a range of symptoms including\nintestinal manifestations (diarrhoea\nand abdominal pain), malnutrition, general malaise and weakness,\nand impaired growth and physical development.\nInfections of very high intensity can cause intestinal obstruction that should be treated surgically.\nS. stercoralis\nmay cause dermatological and gastro-intestinal morbidity and is also\nknown to be associated with chronic malnutrition in children."}

In case of\nreduced host immunity, the parasite can cause the\nhyperinfection/dissemination syndrome\nthat is invariably fatal if not promptly and properly cured and\nis often fatal despite the treatment.\nIn 2001, delegates at the World Health Assembly unanimously endorsed a\nresolution (WHA54.19) urging endemic countries to start seriously\ntackling worms, specifically schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted\nhelminths.\nThe strategy for control of soil-transmitted helminth\ninfections is to control morbidity through the periodic treatment of\nat-risk people living in endemic areas.
