It causes disfigurement and disability, and in rare cases skin cancer.\nChromoblastomycosis is diagnosed with laboratory tools such as microscopy and culture. More accurate molecular diagnostic methods are in development.\nSafe and effective antifungal medicines are available for treatment.\nOverview\nChromoblastomycosis is a sporadically occurring infection seen in tropical and subtropical climates caused by a number of different pigmented fungi, the most common of which are\nFonsecaea pedrosoi\n,\nFonsecaea monophora\nand\nCladophialophora carrionii\n."}

Other fungi can also cause chromoblastomycosis.\nChromoblastomycosis can cause disability due to limb enlargement, which may lead to inability to work and considerable social stigma. Rarely, the fungi that cause chromoblastomycosis can infect other organs, such as the brain, or lead to skin cancer.\nWho is at risk?\nChromoblastomycosis affects normal healthy people and is mainly seen in adults. Agricultural workers are the most common occupational group to be infected.\nSigns and symptoms\nChromoblastomycosis presents with wart-like lesions on exposed areas of the skin such as the legs or forearms. These can exceed 10 centimetres in diameter.\nPatches of skin may also appear flattened (plaque-like) and show central scarring or atrophy, but they are not itchy or painful. Pain and itching can appear in moderate or severe disease."}

Pain and itching can appear in moderate or severe disease. Small dark spots can be seen on the surface of lesions and represent clusters of the pigmented fungal cells – an important diagnostic clue.\nLarge lesions cause severe limb swelling and discomfort, limiting movement. In longstanding cases, secondary bacterial infections are common and the smell from affected limbs may be unpleasant, which may also lead to social exclusion. There is a risk of development of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin in longstanding untreated lesions.\nAlthough the infection usually remains in one body region, local spread through the lymphatics, and very rarely blood stream dissemination to the central nervous system, can occur.\nTransmission\nThis infection occurs when fungi from the natural environment invade deeper parts of an individual’s skin after their skin is damaged by a superficial abrasion or a penetrating injury. An infected person cannot directly transmit the infection to other people."}

An infected person cannot directly transmit the infection to other people. Intermediate vectors, such as mosquitoes, do not transmit chromoblastomycosis.\nTreatment\nChromoblastomycosis can be treated with oral itraconazole or terbinafine. Voriconazole, intravenous amphotericin B and oral flucytosine have also been used.\nOther methods of treatment include local application of heat, cryotherapy and photodynamic therapy\n.\nSurgical reductions have been used but should be given following initial chemotherapy to avoid local recurrence.\nEarly treatment is key, providing the best results after about 3–6 months. Patients with large or extensive chromoblastomycosis and limb swelling often require over a year of treatment and there may be residual lymphoedema in such cases.\nThere is no evidence that different fungal species respond differently to the antifungal medicines recommended for treatment.\nChallenges\nThe earliest lesions of chromoblastomycosis are small, raised lumps or nodules on the skin surface with no specific visible diagnostic features."}

Therefore, diagnosis depends on demonstrating the characteristic thick-walled, single or multicellular clusters of pigmented fungal cells, known as muriform or sclerotic bodies, either in scrapings from lesions or in histopathology of biopsy material.\nClusters of these cells can be found in the dark spots seen on the surface of the skin lesions and these provide the best sites for taking a skin scraping with a scalpel blade or for a biopsy.\nCulture or molecular diagnosis is helpful in confirming the diagnosis but decisions on treatment can be made without identification of the organism."}

Skin NTD programmes are expected to provide more data on incidence of the infection.\nThe 2021−2030 roadmap promotes early identification of affected individuals. This can be achieved through training of health care workers aimed at improving awareness and disease recognition. Capacity strengthening on skin NTDs is key."}
