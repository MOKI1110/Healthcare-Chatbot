Among the forcibly displaced, 35 million are children and 1 million were born into refugee life (2).\nThe number of people on the move is expected to grow due to poverty, lack of security, lack of access to basic services, conflict, environmental degradation and disasters.\nMigration could both improve or diminish an individual’s health status."}

They undertake long, exhausting journeys with inadequate access to food and water, sanitation and other basic services, which increases their risk of communicable diseases, particularly measles, and food- and waterborne diseases."}

They can also face high user fees, low levels of health literacy, poor cultural competency among health providers, stigma and inadequate interpreting services.\nBarriers are even greater for people with disabilities. Women and girls may find difficulty in accessing sexual and gender-based violence protection and response services. Refugee and migrant children, especially unaccompanied minors, are more likely to experience traumatic events and stressful situations, such as exploitation and abuse, and may struggle to access health care.\nThe ability to access health services in humanitarian settings is usually compromised and complicated by shortages of medicines and lack of healthcare facilities.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has brought an increased risk of infection and death for refugees and migrants."}
