It can lead to heart, lung or nervous system problems.\nCommon symptoms include chronic pain, stiffness, tenderness, heat and swelling in the joints. RA can make it hard to move and perform daily activities.\nThe causes of rheumatoid arthritis are unknown. Risk factors include smoking, obesity and exposure to air pollution."}

RA can make it hard to move and perform daily activities.\nThe causes of rheumatoid arthritis are unknown. Risk factors include smoking, obesity and exposure to air pollution. Women and older people have a higher risk of developing RA.\nIf diagnosed timely, symptoms and disease progression can be controlled with pharmacological treatment, and optimal functioning can be maintained through rehabilitation (including the use of assistive products). In cases with severe joint damage, surgical procedures, including joint replacement, may help to restore movement or manage pain, and maintain physical function.\nScope of the problem\nThe typical onset of the disease occurs in adults in their sixties. Women are two-to-three times more often affected than men. The prevalence of rheumatoid arthritis is higher in industrialized countries, which may be explained by demographics (higher average age), exposures to environmental toxins and lifestyle risk factors, and under-diagnosis in low-and-middle-income countries.\nSigns and symptoms\nRheumatoid arthritis causes inflammation and pain in one or more joints."}

It can happen in most joints, but it’s most common in the small joints of the hands, wrists and feet.\nRA is chronic and may worsen over time without treatment. It can lead to severe damage to the joint and surrounding tissue. It can also affect the heart, lung and nervous systems.\nEarly signs and symptoms:\npain\nstiffness\ntenderness\nswelling or redness in one or more joints, usually in a symmetrical pattern (e.g., both hands or both feet).\nThe symptoms can worsen over time and spread to more joints including the knees, elbows or shoulders. RA can make it hard to perform daily activities like writing, holding objects with the hands, walking and climbing stairs.\nPeople with RA often feel fatigue and general malaise (e.g., fever, poor sleep quality, loss of appetite) and may experience depressive symptoms.\nPain and difficulty moving can lead to problems with sexual function and intimate relationships."}

Trouble moving easily can cause lower physical fitness and lead to loss of independence, inability to work, reduced well-being and mental health problems.\nCauses and risk factors\nThe specific causes for the disease are still unknown, but several modifiable lifestyle-associated (smoking, obesity) and non-modifiable (genetics, female gender, age) risk factors have been identified.\nPrevention and control\nSeveral key prevention strategies have been proposed to prevent rheumatoid arthritis and control the disease progression. In particular, reducing exposure to inhaled silica, dusts and occupational risks, and lifestyle related behaviours (e.g., prevention of/stop smoking, healthy nutrition, physical activity, maintaining a normal body weight, maintaining good dental hygiene) play an important role.

Management of rheumatoid arthritis often involves different health workers, who contribute to a rehabilitative strategy tailored to a person’s needs and preferences.\nEarly diagnosis and management can reduce symptoms, slow the disease and prevent disability. In some cases, the disease can go into remission.\nTherapeutic approaches help to improve and maintain joint mobility and muscle strength, to reduce and cope with pain, and to increase exercise capacity and the ability to perform daily activities.\nAssistive technologies (e.g., orthosis, assistive products for self-care) help people to protect their joints and to perform meaningful activities independently.\nMedicines to reduce inflammation, pain and swelling may include:\nnon-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nglucocorticoids\ndisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)\nbiological agents.\nIn severe cases, orthopaedic surgery can reduce pain and restore movement."}
