Clinically, it\nhas two forms:\nFurious rabies – characterized by hyperactivity and hallucinations.\nParalytic rabies – characterized by paralysis and coma.\nAlthough fatal once clinical signs appear,\nrabies is entirely avoidable; vaccines, medicines and technologies have long\nbeen available to prevent death from rabies. Nevertheless, rabies still kills\ntens of thousands of people each year. Of these cases, approximately 99% are\nacquired from the bite of an infected dog.\nDog-mediated human rabies can be eliminated by\ntackling the disease at its source: infected dogs. Making people aware of how\nto avoid the bites of rabid dogs, to seek treatment when bitten and to\nvaccinate animals can successfully disrupt the rabies transmission cycle.\nRabies is estimated to cause 59 000 human\ndeaths annually in over 150 countries, with 95% of cases occurring in Africa\nand Asia. Due to underreporting and uncertain estimates, this number is likely\na gross underestimate."}

Due to underreporting and uncertain estimates, this number is likely\na gross underestimate. The burden of disease is disproportionally borne by\nrural poor populations, with approximately half of cases attributable to\nchildren under 15 years of age.\nSymptoms\nEarly symptoms of a rabies infection can\ninclude a fever with pain and unusual or unexplained tingling, pricking or\nburning sensation (paraesthesia) at the wound site. In later states, the virus\nspreads to the central nervous system, causing fatal inflammation of the brain\nand spinal cord. The incubation period of the disease can vary from 1 week to 1\nyear, though it is typically 2–3 months.\nThe two types of rabies show different\nsymptoms. Furious rabies causes signs of hyperactivity, excitable behaviour,\nhydrophobia (fear of water) and sometimes aerophobia (fear of drafts or of\nfresh air). Death occurs after a few days due to cardio-respiratory arrest.\nParalytic rabies, which accounts for about\n20% of the total number of human cases, runs a less dramatic and usually longer\ncourse than the furious form."}

The paralytic form of rabies is often misdiagnosed, contributing to the\nunder-reporting of the disease.\nTreatment\nVaccinating dogs is the most cost-effective strategy for preventing rabies in people, and human rabies vaccines exist for pre-exposure immunization.\nIf you are bitten or scratched by an animal, particularly a dog:\nWash the wound immediately with soap or detergent.\nFlush the wound thoroughly for about 15 minutes with copious amounts of water.\nApply an iodine-containing or anti-viral medication to the wound 15 minutes after it has been washed and flushed.\nAvoid applying irritants to the wounds such as chili powder, plant juices, acids and alkalis.\nAvoid covering the wound with dressings or bandages.\nSeek transportation to a health care facility for further assessment and treatment by a healthcare professional.\nIf possible, safely confine the bit"}
