La Alianza, Municipio de El Tambo, Cauca, Colombia\n©\nCredits\nTungiasis\n28 April 2023\nKey facts\nTungiasis is caused by adult female sand fleas, which burrow into the skin mostly of the feet.\nTungiasis is commonly known as pulga de areia, niguá, pique, bicho do pé, bichodo porco or jatecuba, jigger, sand flea or chigoe.\nIt causes immense pain and itching, difficulty walking, sleeping and concentrating on school or work.\nTungiasis can be associated with abscesses caused by secondary bacterial infections.\nIt occurs in marginalized, resource-poor populations in the tropics of the Caribbean, South America and sub-Saharan Africa.\nBoth animals and humans are susceptible to infection.\nOverview\nTungiasis is caused by the adult female sand flea,\nTunga penetrans\n. The larvae and pupae develop in dry shaded soils, mostly inside the sleeping rooms of houses with an unsealed earthen floor where most transmission occurs. The embedded flea causes inflammation, pain and itching, difficulty walking, sleeping and concentrating on school or work."}

Tungiasis is a zoonosis that affects humans and animals alike.\nThe only product shown to have high efficacy and safety for treatment is NYDA\n®\n, a combination of dimeticone oils. Control will require a One Health approach, treating the patients as well as spraying floors with insecticide or sealing them, daily foot washing with soap, and treating any infected animals owned by affected families.\nScope of the problem\nT. penetrans\nis found in tropical and subtropical regions of the Caribbean, South America and sub-Saharan Africa. Over 1 billion people live in areas suitable for transmission of tungiasis but no country conducts routine surveillance so the actual disease burden is not known. However, within endemic communities, surveys have reported prevalence from 7% to 63%, i.e., distribution is heterogeneous.\nWho is at risk?\nElderly people and children aged 5–14 years, particularly boys, are at highest risk."}

People with disabilities are also highly vulnerable to infection.\nTungiasis thrives where living conditions are precarious, such as villages located in remote beaches, communities in the rural hinterland and shanty towns of big cities. In these settings, the poorest of the poor carry the highest burden of the disease.\nSigns and symptoms\nTungiasis is diagnosed by visual inspection, the live fleas appearing as a whitish disc varying in size with a dark point in the middle that darkens with time until dead and entirely black. In areas where the disease is endemic, affected individuals, even children, typically know whether they have tungiasis. Most affected individuals attempt to extract the fleas, leaving a typical circular lesion, often with the blackened remains of the dead flea."}

Most affected individuals attempt to extract the fleas, leaving a typical circular lesion, often with the blackened remains of the dead flea. This is a clear indication of recent infection.\nThe acute and chronic morbidity associated with tungiasis results from an inflammatory reaction around embedded female sand fleas, exacerbated by bacterial superinfection. During the acute phase, erythema, oedema, desquamation, pain and itching are constant. Itching induces scratching of the lesion, which in turn facilitates bacterial superinfection. Abscesses, sometimes large, are common.\nThe feet are the most common infection point but infestation can occur in all parts of the body. Bullous-type lesions have also been reported. Fissures, ulcers, lymphangitis, lymphoedema, ascending neuritis, deformation and loss of nails, and tissue necrosis are chronic complications."}

Bullous-type lesions have also been reported. Fissures, ulcers, lymphangitis, lymphoedema, ascending neuritis, deformation and loss of nails, and tissue necrosis are chronic complications. These result in pain, disability, disfigurement and mutilation of the feet, causing characteristic changes in the way people with tungiasis walk.\nTransmission\nThe main transmission site is inside the sleeping rooms of houses with an unsealed earthen floor where the larvae and pupae develop after the eggs are dropped there. The adult female sand flea burrows into the skin and grows 2000 times in size as eggs develop. The female flea typically lives for 4–6 weeks, during which the eggs are expelled and fall to the ground. The toes, sole, lateral rim of the foot and heel are common sites of infection, and 99% of all lesions occur on the feet.\nIn some areas, several mammalian species have been found to act as reservoirs for human infection. In rural areas, these are predominantly pigs and bovines; in resource-poor urban communities, they are found in dogs, cats and rats."}

In rural areas, these are predominantly pigs and bovines; in resource-poor urban communities, they are found in dogs, cats and rats. In some areas, infection can be transmitted without an animal reservoir when skin comes into contact with soil or a floor where adult sand fleas have developed.\nImpact\nThe embedded flea induces inflammation associated with immense pain and itching. This disturbs sleep and concentration on school or work. Patients with large numbers of embedded fleas have difficulty walking, often with loss of nails and disfigured and mutilated feet. People with tungiasis experience stigma and social exclusion and a low quality of life. Children with tungiasis have cognitive impairment and lower school exam scores. Impaired physical fitness of adult household members could have a negative impact on household economics. Bacterial superinfection may cause life-threatening complications, such as septicaemia, tetanus or gangrene.\nTreatment\nIn endemic areas, mechanical extraction of burrowed sand fleas is common as an act of despair. This is usually done by the patients themselves or a caregiver."}

This is usually done by the patients themselves or a caregiver. Embedded parasites are removed under non-sterile conditions using instruments such as sticks, hair pins, thorns, safety pins, sewing needles or scissors. The procedure is painful and traumatizes children. Removing the fleas can cause local inflammation if the parasite ruptures and introduces pathogenic bacteria, leading to further superinfection of the sore. The instrument is often subsequently used on several people, which risks transmission of diseases such as hepatitis B virus (HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) or even HIV.\nMechanical extraction should only be performed with surgical instruments by an experienced nurse under sterile conditions."}

This includes living in a house with an unsealed earthen floor not washing feet regularly and not using soap when washing."}

When the repellent is applied twice daily on the feet, tungiasis-associated morbidity rapidly decreases and approaches zero after 8–10 weeks. Even if applied intermittently, the reduction of morbidity is significant.\nChallenges\nThe key challenge is the lack of funding and attention on the disease by governments and funding agencies.
