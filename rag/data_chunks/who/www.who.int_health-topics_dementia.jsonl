Although age is the strongest known risk factor for dementia, it is not a normal part of ageing.\nWHO is working very closely with Member States and other relevant stakeholders to improve the lives of people with dementia and their carers, while decreasing the impact of dementia on communities and countries.\nPrevalence\nIn 2021, 57 million people worldwide lived with dementia, with over 60% in low- and middle-income countries.\nEvery year, there are nearly 10 million new cases.\nDementia is one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people worldwide. It can be overwhelming, not only for people who have dementia, but also for their carers and families, who globally provide the majority of care and support.\nThere is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatization and barriers to diagnosis and care."}

In May 2017, the World Health Assembly endorsed the\nGlobal action plan on the public health response to dementia 2017-2025\n. The global action plan aims to improve the lives of people with dementia, their families and carers, while decreasing the impact of dementia on communities and countries.\nIt provides a comprehensive blueprint for action across seven areas: (1) making dementia a public health priority, (2) increasing dementia awareness, inclusion and friendliness; (3) reducing the risk of dementia; (4) improving diagnosis, treatment and care; (5) supporting dementia carers, (6) enhancing health information systems for dementia and (7) fostering research and innovation.\nFact sheets\nDementia\nQuestions and answers\nInformation for caregivers\nDatabases and tools\nGlobal Dementia Observatory\nResolutions and de"}
