WNV is commonly found in Africa, Europe, the Middle East, North America and West Asia. WNV is maintained in nature in a cycle involving transmission between birds and mosquitoes. Humans, horses and other mammals can be infected.\nWest Nile Virus (WNV) is a member of the\nflavivirus\ngenus and belongs to the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex of the family\nFlaviviridae\n.\nOutbreaks\nWest Nile Virus (WNV) was first isolated in a woman in the West Nile district of Uganda in 1937. It was identified in birds (crows and columbiformes) in Nile delta region in 1953."}

It was identified in birds (crows and columbiformes) in Nile delta region in 1953. Before 1997 WNV was not considered pathogenic for birds, but at that time in Israel a more virulent strain caused the death of different bird species presenting signs of encephalitis and paralysis. Human infections attributable to WNV have been reported in many countries in the World for over 50 years.\nIn 1999 a WNV circulating in Israel and Tunisia was imported in New York producing a large and dramatic outbreak that spread throughout the continental United States of America (USA) in the following years. The WNV outbreak in USA (1999-2010) highlighted that importation and establishment of vector-borne pathogens outside their current habitat represent a serious danger to the world.\nThe largest outbreaks occurred in Greece, Israel, Romania, Russia and USA. Outbreak sites are on major birds migratory routes. In its original range, WNV was prevalent throughout Africa, parts of Europe, Middle East, West Asia, and Australia."}

Since its introduction in 1999 into USA, the virus has spread and is now widely established from Canada to Venezuela.\nTransmission\nHuman infection is most often the result of bites from infected mosquitoes. Mosquitoes become infected when they feed on infected birds, which circulate the virus in their blood for a few days. The virus eventually gets into the mosquito's salivary glands. During later blood meals (when mosquitoes bite), the virus may be injected into humans and animals, where it can multiply and possibly cause illness.\nThe virus may also be transmitted through contact with other infected animals, their blood, or other tissues.\nA very small proportion of human infections have occurred through organ transplant, blood transfusions and breast milk."}

No vaccine is available for humans.\nVector and animal hosts\nWN virus is maintained in nature in a mosquito-bird-mosquito transmission cycle. Mosquitoes of the genus\nCulex\nare generally considered the principal vectors of WNV, in particular\nCx. Pipiens\n. WNV is maintained in mosquito populations through vertical transmission (adults to eggs).\nBirds are the reservoir hosts of WNV. In Europe, Africa, Middle East and Asia, mortality in birds associated with WNV infection is rare. In striking contrast, the virus is highly pathogenic for birds in the Americas. Members of the crow family (\nCorvidae\n) are particularly susceptible, but virus has been detected in dead and dying birds of more than 250 species."}

Symptomatic infections in horses are also rare and generally mild, but can cause neurologic disease, including fatal encephalomyelitis.\nPrevention\nPreventing transmission in horses\nSince WNV outbreaks in animals precede human cases, the establishment of an active animal health surveillance system to detect new cases in birds and horses is essential in providing early warning for veterinary and human public health authorities. In the Americas, it is important to help the community by reporting dead birds to local authorities.\nVaccines have been developed for horses."}

Efforts to prevent transmission should first focus on personal and community protection against mosquito bites through the use of mosquito nets, personal insect repellent, by wearing light coloured clothing (long-sleeved shirts and trousers) and by avoiding outdoor activity at peak biting times. In addition community programmes should encourage communities to destroy mosquito breeding sites in residential areas.\nReducing the risk of animal-to-human transmission."}
