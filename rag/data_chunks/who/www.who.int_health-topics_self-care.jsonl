WHO recommends self-care interventions for every country and economic setting, as a critical path to reach universal health coverage, promote\nhealth, keep the world safe, and serve the vulnerable.\nSelf-care recognises individuals as active agents in managing their own health care, in areas including health promotion; disease prevention and control; self-medication; providing care to dependent persons, and rehabilitation, including palliative\ncare.\nSelf-care interventions are evidence-based,\nquality tools\nthat support self-care. They include medicines, counselling, diagnostics and/or digital technologies which can be accessed fully or partially outside of formal health services."}

Self-care interventions can improve the efficiency of health service delivery, access and coverage.\nThis requires supportive laws and policies, health financing, regulated quality products and interventions, and education which promotes the participation of individuals, as well as privacy and confidentiality.\nHuman rights considerations help to reduce violence, coercion, stigma and discrimination by improving each person’s exercise of their right to health, information, and independent decision-making.\nEmergency context\nPandemics and humanitarian crises\nIn situations where existing health systems are stretched, there is often an unprecedented demand on individuals and communities to manage their health.\nInnovative st"}
