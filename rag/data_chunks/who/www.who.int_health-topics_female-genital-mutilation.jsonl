In addition, every year more than 4 million girls are estimated to be at risk of undergoing female genital mutilation, the majority of whom are cut before they turn 15 years old.\nFGM has no health benefits. It can lead to immediate health risks, as well as long-term complications to women’s physical, mental and sexual health and well-being.\nThe practice is recognized internationally as a violation of human rights of girls and women and as an extreme form of gender discrimination, reflecting deep-rooted inequality between the sexes. As it is practiced on young girls without consent, it is a violation of the rights of children."}

As it is practiced on young girls without consent, it is a violation of the rights of children. FGM also violates a person's rights to health, security and physical integrity, the right to be free from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, and the right to life when the procedure results in death.\nAs part of the Sustainable Development Goals, the global community has set a target to abandon the practice of female genital mutilation by the year 2030. While some countries are on track to achieve this target, progress needs to be greatly accelerated in many countries to achieve abandonment goals.\nPrevalence\nWhile the exact number of girls and women worldwide who have undergone female genital mutilation remains unknown, at least 230 million girls and women alive today have been subjected to the practice, according to data from the 31 countries where population level data exist."}

The practice is mainly concentrated in western, eastern, and north-eastern regions of Africa, as well as in some countries in the Middle East and Asia.\nWith growing migration, there has been an increase in the number of girls and women in Europe, Australia and North America who have either undergone female genital mutilation or who may be at risk of being subjected to the practice. FGM is therefore a global concern.\nWhile there has been an overall decline in the prevalence of FGM over the last three decades in the younger age groups, not all countries have made progress and the pace of decline has been uneven. Current progress is insufficient to keep up with increasing population growth."}

If trends continue, the number of girls and women undergoing FGM will rise significantly in the next 15 years.\nIn addition, some health workers themselves are performing FGM, impeding progress in the road to FGM abandonment\nWHO response\nWHO is strongly opposed to health professionals performing FGM and urges all health workers to uphold the medical code of ethics to “do no harm”. Medicalization of FGM normalizes and condones the practice and hinders long term efforts for abandoning this grave violation of the human rights of women and girls.\nWHO recognizes the important role that health care personnel play in supporting and improving the health and well-being of girls and women living with FGM. Moreover, WHO acknowledges the unique position that midwives and nurses may have to influence and change attitudes towards FGM amongst their patients because of their close contact with practicing communities and since they provide the majority of health care in primary health care settings."}
