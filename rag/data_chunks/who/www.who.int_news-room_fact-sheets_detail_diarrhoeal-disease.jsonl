It is both preventable and treatable.\nEach year diarrhoea kills around 443 832 children under 5 and an additional 50 851 children aged 5 to 9 years.\nA significant proportion of diarrhoeal disease can be prevented through safe drinking-water and adequate sanitation and hygiene.\nGlobally, there are nearly 1.7 billion cases of childhood diarrhoeal disease every year.\nDiarrhoea is a leading cause of malnutrition in children under 5 years old.\nOverview\nDiarrhoeal disease is the third leading cause of death in children under 5 years old and is responsible for killing around 443 832 children every year. Diarrhoea can last several days and can leave the body without the water and salts that are necessary for survival. In the past, for most people, severe dehydration and fluid loss were the main causes of diarrhoea-associated deaths. Now, other causes such as septic bacterial infections are likely to account for an increasing proportion of all diarrhoea-associated deaths."}

Now, other causes such as septic bacterial infections are likely to account for an increasing proportion of all diarrhoea-associated deaths. Children who are malnourished or have impaired immunity, as well as people living with HIV, are most at risk of life-threatening diarrhoea.\nDiarrhoea is defined as the passage of 3 or more loose or liquid stools per day (or more frequent passage than is normal for the individual). Frequent passing of formed stools is not diarrhoea, nor is the passing of loose, pasty stools by breastfed babies.\nDiarrhoea is usually a symptom of an infection in the intestinal tract, which can be caused by a variety of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms. Infection is spread through contaminated food or drinking-water, or from person-to-person as a result of poor hygiene.\nInterventions to prevent diarrhoea, including safe drinking-water, use of improved sanitation and hand washing with soap, can reduce disease risk. Diarrhoea should be treated with oral rehydration solution (ORS), a solution of clean water, sugar and salt."}

In addition, a 10–14 day supplemental treatment course of dispersible zinc tablets shortens diarrhoea duration and improves outcomes.\nThere are 3 clinical types of diarrhoea:\nacute watery diarrhoea – lasts several hours or days and includes cholera\nacute bloody diarrhoea – also called dysentery\npersistent diarrhoea – lasts 14 days or longer.\nScope of diarrhoeal disease\nDiarrhoeal disease is a leading cause of child mortality and morbidity in the world, and mostly results from contaminated food and water sources. Worldwide, 780 million individuals lack access to improved drinking-water and 2.5 billion lack improved sanitation. Diarrhoea due to infection is widespread throughout developing countries.\nIn low-income countries, children under 3 years old experience on average three episodes of diarrhoea every year. Each episode deprives the child of the nutrition necessary for growth."}

Each episode deprives the child of the nutrition necessary for growth. As a result, diarrhoea is a major cause of malnutrition, and malnourished children are more likely to fall ill from diarrhoea.\nDehydration\nThe most severe threat posed by diarrhoea is dehydration. During a diarrhoeal episode, water and electrolytes (sodium, chloride, potassium and bicarbonate) are lost through liquid stools, vomit, sweat, urine and breathing. Dehydration occurs when these losses are not replaced.\nThe degree of dehydration is rated on a scale of 3.\nsevere dehydration (at least two of the following signs):\nlethargy/unconsciousness\nsunken eyes\nunable to drink or drink poorly\nskin pinch goes back very slowly ( ≥2 seconds)\nsome dehydration (two or more of the following signs):\nrestlessness, irritability\nsunken eyes\ndrinks eagerly, thirsty\nno dehydration (not enough signs to classify as some or severe dehydration).\nCauses\nInfection:\nDiarrhoea is a symptom of infections caused by a host of bacterial, viral and parasitic organisms, most of which are spread by faeces-contaminat"}

Among children under 5 years of age, the most common viral pathogens are rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus and astrovirus.
