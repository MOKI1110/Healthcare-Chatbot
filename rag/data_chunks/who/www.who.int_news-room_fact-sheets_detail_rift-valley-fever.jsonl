Infection can cause severe disease in both animals and humans. The disease results in significant economic losses due to death and abortion among RVF-infected livestock.\nRVF virus is a member of the\nPhlebovirus\ngenus. The virus was first identified in 1931 during an investigation into an epidemic among sheep in the Rift Valley of Kenya.\nSince then, outbreaks have been reported in sub-Saharan Africa."}

The virus was first identified in 1931 during an investigation into an epidemic among sheep in the Rift Valley of Kenya.\nSince then, outbreaks have been reported in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1977 an explosive outbreak was reported in Egypt, where the RVF virus was introduced via infected livestock trade along the Nile irrigation system. In 1997–98, a major outbreak occurred in Kenya, Somalia and Tanzania following El Niño event and extensive flooding. Following infected livestock trade from the horn of Africa, RVF spread in September 2000 to Saudi Arabia and Yemen, marking the first reported occurrence of the disease outside the African continent and raising concerns that it could extend to other parts of Asia and Europe.\nVectors and host animals\nEcology and mosquito vectors\nSeveral species of mosquito are able to act as vectors for transmission of the RVF virus."}

The dominant vector species varies between different regions, and different species can play different roles in sustaining the transmission of the virus.\nAmong animals, the RVF virus is spread primarily by the bite of infected mosquitoes, mainly the\nAedes\nspecies, which can acquire the virus from feeding on infected animals. The female mosquito is also capable of transmitting the virus directly to her offspring via eggs leading to new generations of infected mosquitoes hatching from eggs.\nRVF virus in host animals\nRVF virus is able to infect many species of animals causing severe disease in domesticated animals including cattle, sheep, camels and goats. Sheep and goats appear to be more susceptible than cattle or camels."}

Sheep and goats appear to be more susceptible than cattle or camels. An outbreak of RVF in animals frequently manifests itself as a wave of unexplained abortions among livestock and may signal the start of an epidemic.\nThe analysis of major RVF outbreaks show two ecologically distinct situations :\nPrimary foci areas.\nRVF virus persists through transmission between vectors and hosts and maintains through vertical transmission in\nAedes\nmosquitoes.\nSpread to secondary foci.\nDuring major outbreak at primary foci, the disease can spread through livestock movement or passive mosquitoes dispersal. The transmission can then amplify in naïve ruminants via local competent mosquitoes like\nCulex\n,\nMansonia\nand\nAnopheles\nthat act as mechanical vectors. Irrigation schemes, where populations of mosquitoes are abundant during long periods of the year, are highly favourable places for secondary disease transmission.\nTransmission in humans\nMost human infections result from direct or indirect contact with the blood or organs of infected animals."}

The virus can be transmitted to humans through the handling of animal tissue during slaughtering or butchering, assisting with animal births, conducting veterinary procedures, or from the disposal of carcasses or fetuses. Certain occupational groups such as herders, farmers, slaughterhouse workers and veterinarians are therefore at higher risk of infection. There is some evidence that humans may become infected with RVF by ingesting the unpasteurized or uncooked milk of infected animals.\nHuman infections have also resulted from the bites of infected mosquitoes, most commonly the\nAedes\nand\nCulex\nmosquitoes. The transmission of RVF virus by blood-feeding flies is also possible.\nTo date, no human-to-human transmission of RVF has been documented, and no transmission of RVF to health care workers has been reported when standard infection control precautions have been implemented."}

Some patients develop neck stiffness, sensitivity to light, loss of appetite and vomiting. In these patients the disease, in its early stages, may be mistaken for meningitis.\nThe symptoms of RVF usually last from 4 to 7 days, after which time the immune response becomes detectable with the appearance of antibodies and the virus disappears from the blood.\nA small percentage of patients develop a much more severe form of the disease.
