They can be found in soil, water, vegetation and the faeces of some animals and can contaminate foods.\nListeriosis is an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes.\nFoodborne listeriosis is one of the most serious and severe foodborne diseases. It is caused by the bacteria\nListeria monocytogenes\n. It is a relatively rare disease with 0.1 to 10 cases per 1 million people per year depending on the countries and regions of the world."}

Although the number of cases of listeriosis is small, the high rate of death associated with this infection makes it a significant public health concern.\nUnlike many other common foodborne diseases causing bacteria,\nL. monocytogenes\ncan survive and multiply at low temperatures usually found in refrigerators. Eating contaminated food with high numbers of\nL. monocytogenes\nis the main route of infection. Infection can also be transmitted between humans, notably from pregnant women to unborn babies.\nL. monocytogenes\nare ubiquitous in nature and found in soil, water and animal digestive tracts. Vegetables may be contaminated through soil or the use of manure as fertilizer.

There are two main types of listeriosis: a non-invasive form and an invasive form.\nNoninvasive listeriosis (febrile listerial gastroenteritis) is a mild form of the disease affecting mainly otherwise healthy people.

These include pregnant women, patients undergoing treatment for cancer, HIV and organ transplants, elderly people and infants. This form of disease is characterized by severe symptoms and a high mortality rate (20–30%). The symptoms include fever, myalgia (muscle pain), septicemia, meningitis. The incubation period is usually one to two weeks but can vary between a few days and up to 90 days.\nThe initial diagnosis of listeriosis is made based on clinical symptoms and detection of the bacteria in a smear from blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), meconium of newborns (or the fetus in abortion cases), as well as from faeces, vomitus, foods or animal feed."}

It can result in miscarriage or stillbirth. Newborn may also have low birth weight, septicaemia and meningitis.
