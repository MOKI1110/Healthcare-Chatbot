LBP is more prevalent in women (2).\nNon-specific LBP is the most common presentation of LBP (about 90% of cases).\nOverview\nLow back pain (LBP) describes pain between the lower edge of the ribs and the buttock. It can last for a short time (acute), a little longer (sub-acute) or a long time (chronic). It can affect anyone.\nLBP makes it hard to move and can affect quality of life and mental well-being. It can limit work activities and engagement with family and friends.\nLBP can be specific or non-specific."}

It can limit work activities and engagement with family and friends.\nLBP can be specific or non-specific. Specific LBP is pain that is caused by a certain disease or structural problem in the spine, or when the pain radiates from another part of the body.\nNon-specific LBP is when it isn’t possible to identify a specific disease or structural reason to explain the pain. LBP is non-specific in about 90% of cases.\nIn all types and at all stages of LBP, rehabilitation is essential to reassure people and help them make sense of their pain, help them return to activities they enjoy and identify strategies to support recovery and improve function. Specialized care pathways may be needed for specific LBP.\nAn estimated 619 million people live with LBP and it is the leading cause of disability worldwide. LBP is a major public health issue."}

Specialized care pathways may be needed for specific LBP.\nAn estimated 619 million people live with LBP and it is the leading cause of disability worldwide. LBP is a major public health issue. LBP is often associated with loss of work productivity and thus produces huge economic burden on individuals and on societies.\nScope of the problem\nLow back pain (LBP) has the highest prevalence globally among musculoskeletal conditions and is the leading cause of disability worldwide. It is the condition where the greatest number of people may benefit from rehabilitation.\nPeople at any age can experience LBP, including children and adolescents. Most people experience LBP at some point in their lives. The peak in the number of cases occurs at 50–55 years, and women experience LBP more frequently than men. The prevalence and disability impact of LBP are greatest among older people aged 80–85 years. Recurrent LBP episodes are more common with ageing.\nChronic LBP is a major cause of work loss and participation restriction and reduced quality of life around the world. Considering the high prevalence, LBP contributes to a huge economic burden on societies."}

Considering the high prevalence, LBP contributes to a huge economic burden on societies. It should be considered a global public health problem that requires an appropriate response.\nSigns and symptoms\nLow back pain can be a dull ache or sharp pain. It can also cause pain to radiate into other areas of the body, especially the legs.\nLBP can restrict a person’s movement, which can affect their work, school and community engagement. It can also cause problems with sleep, low mood and distress.\nLPB can be acute (lasting under 6 weeks), sub-acute (6–12 weeks) or chronic (over 12 weeks).\nIn most cases of acute LBP, symptoms go away on their own and most people will recover well. However, for some people the symptoms will continue and turn into chronic pain.\nPeople with LBP may also experience spine-related leg pain (sometimes called sciatica or radicular pain). This is often described as a dull sensation or a sharp, electric shock feeling."}

This is often described as a dull sensation or a sharp, electric shock feeling. Numbness or tingling and weakness in some muscles may be experienced with the leg pain.\nWhen associated with LBP, radicular signs and symptoms are often due to involvement of a spinal nerve root. Some people may experience radicular symptoms without LBP, when a nerve is compressed or injured distal to the spinal column.\nAll these experiences affect well-being and quality of life and often lead to loss of work and retirement wealth, particularly in those who experience chronic symptoms.\nCause and risk factors\nLBP may be classified as specific or non-specific. Non-specific means that the experience of pain cannot be confidently accounted for by another diagnosis such as an underlying disease, pathology or tissue damage. It is non-specific in about 90% of cases."}

Painkillers should not be the first-line treatment for LBP. Older people and those with other medical conditions should speak to a healthcare provider before using medicines.\nWith the onset of any LBP, a comprehensive clinical assessment comprising a careful physical examination and a psychosocial assessment is essential to tailor care while considering a person’s values, preferences and care priorities.\nThe longer a person experiences LBP, the more likely that limitations in functioning will manifest. In these contexts, adopting a biopsychosocial approach to assessment and care planning becomes increasingly important. Rehabilitation includes sets of interventions that aim to achieve and maintain independence in daily living and optimal participation in meaningful activities, such as work and community life and to achieve well-being."}
