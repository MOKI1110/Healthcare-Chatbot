Access to clean, sustainable and affordable energy, outlined in the seventh Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 7), plays a crucial role in advancing health (SDG 3). Energy is also critical for achieving almost all other global goals that include eradication of poverty (SDG 1), opportunities for quality education (SDG 4), achievement of gender equality (SDG 5), access to clean water (SDG 6), jobs security and economic growth (SDG 8) and combat of climate change (SDG 13).\nThe links between energy and health are particularly evident in homes and health-care facilities. Access to clean and sustainable energy in homes is essential to protect people’s health from household air pollution due to the use of polluting stoves and fuels such as coal and biomass. Access to clean and reliable energy in health-care facilities is important to ensure the delivery of essential health care services for disease prevention and treatment.\nImpact\nGlobally, 2.4 billion people lack access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking."}

Household air pollution, emitted from the use of polluting stoves and fuels, is a cause of some 3.2 million deaths annually. Women and children in particular are at greater health and livelihood risks since they are often tasked with cooking and collecting fuelwood. Health burdens are even greater when the use of polluting energy for other purposes (e.g., space heating, lighting) are included.\nRecent statistics show population growth currently outpaces increases in energy access in some regions, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. It remains the only region in which the number of people without access to clean fuels and technologies is rising. Only about 1 in 5 people in sub-Saharan Africa (17%) has access to clean cooking."}

It remains the only region in which the number of people without access to clean fuels and technologies is rising. Only about 1 in 5 people in sub-Saharan Africa (17%) has access to clean cooking. Overall, more people without access to clean fuels and technologies reside in sub-Saharan Africa than in any other region, with around 83% of the population (about 900 million people) in the region lacking access to clean cooking.\nAccess to energy also plays a critical role in the functionality of health-care facilities and the quality, accessibility and reliability of health services delivered to all.\nYet, an estimated 1 billion people globally are served by health facilities without electricity. Around 25% of health-care facilities in 11 sub-Saharan African countries are estimated to have no access to electricity."}
