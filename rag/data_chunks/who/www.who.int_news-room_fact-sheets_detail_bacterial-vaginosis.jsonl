While many “good” bacteria are normally found in the healthy vagina, BV results from an imbalance between “good” and “harmful” bacteria micro-organisms."}

While many “good” bacteria are normally found in the healthy vagina, BV results from an imbalance between “good” and “harmful” bacteria micro-organisms. More specifically, an overgrowth of pathogens such as\nGardnerella spp.\n,\nPrevotella spp., Mobilincus spp., Megaspahera spp., Sneathea spp.\nand mixed vaginal anaerobes species would eventually replace the “beneficial”\nlactobacilli\nthat helps maintain a healthy vaginal environment. The exact cause of this imbalance is not known but has been attributed to douching and having unprotected sex with a new or several sex partners.\nSigns and symptoms\nSome women with BV may not notice any symptoms whereas others might express:\nunusual discharge from the vagina\na strong fishy or musty odour from the vagina\nitching or irritation around the vagina\nburning during urination.\nBV is a very common condition and does not usually cause serious complications."}

The most commonly used diagnostic test for BV is wet mount microscopy or Gram stain of vaginal fluid smear, possibly combined with vaginal pH measurement and sniff test in the Amsel criteria.\nClinical and laboratory assessments for bacterial vaginosis can be affected by factors such as recent sexual activity, menstrual cycle, douching, intravaginal practice (insertion of herbs or other products) and use of antimicrobial agents.\nIn settings where laboratory diagnosis is not possible, a\nsyndromic approach for case management\nto diagnose and treat vaginal discharge is recommended.\nTreatment\nBV is treatable and curable.\nIt is best treated with the antibiotic metronidazole but efficacy of treatments for BV is low if not combined with lifestyle/risk reduction advice."}
