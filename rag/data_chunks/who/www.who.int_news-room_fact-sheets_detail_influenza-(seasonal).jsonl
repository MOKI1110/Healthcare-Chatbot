It is common in all parts of the world. Most people recover without treatment.\nInfluenza spreads easily between people when they cough or sneeze. Vaccination is the best way to prevent the disease.\nSymptoms of influenza include acute onset of fever, cough, sore throat, body aches and fatigue.\nTreatment should aim to relieve symptoms. People with the flu should rest and drink plenty of liquids. Most people will recover on their own within a week."}

Medical care may be needed in severe cases and for people with risk factors.\nThere are 4 types of influenza viruses, types A, B, C and D. Influenza A and B viruses circulate and cause\nseasonal epidemics\nof disease.\nInfluenza A viruses\nare further classified into subtypes according to the combinations of the proteins on the surface of the virus. Currently circulating in humans are subtype A(H1N1) and A(H3N2) influenza viruses. The A(H1N1) is also written as A(H1N1)pdm09 as it caused the pandemic in 2009 and replaced the previous A(H1N1) virus which had circulated prior to 2009. Only influenza type A viruses are known to have caused pandemics.\nInfluenza B viruses\nare not classified into subtypes but can be broken down into lineages."}

Vaccination can protect health workers and the people around them.\nEpidemics can result in high levels of worker/school absenteeism and productivity losses. Clinics and hospitals can be overwhelmed during peak illness periods.\nTransmission\nSeasonal influenza spreads easily, with rapid transmission in crowded areas including schools and nursing homes. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, droplets containing viruses (infectious droplets) are dispersed into the air and can infect persons in close proximity. The virus can also be spread by hands contaminated with influenza viruses."}

To prevent transmission, people should cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing and wash their hands regularly.\nIn temperate climates, seasonal epidemics occur mainly during winter, while in tropical regions, influenza may occur throughout the year, causing outbreaks more irregularly.\nThe time from infection to illness, known as the incubation period, is about 2 days, but ranges from 1–4 days.\nDiagnosis\nMost cases of human influenza are clinically diagnosed. However, during periods of low influenza activity or outside of epidemics situations, the infection of other respiratory viruses (e.g. SARS-CoV-2, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza and adenovirus) can also present as influenza-like illness (ILI), which makes the clinical differentiation of influenza from other pathogens difficult.\nCollection of appropriate respiratory samples and the application of a laboratory diagnostic test is required to establish a definitive diagnosis."}
