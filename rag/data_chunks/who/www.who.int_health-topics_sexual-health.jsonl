Sexual health, when viewed affirmatively, requires a positive and respectful\napproach to sexuality and sexual relationships, as well as the possibility of having pleasurable and safe sexual experiences, free of coercion, discrimination and violence. The ability of men and women to achieve sexual health and well-being depends\non their:\naccess to comprehensive, good-quality information about sex and sexuality;\nknowledge about the risks they may face and their vulnerability to adverse consequences of unprotected sexual activity;\nability to access sexual health care;\nliving in an environment that affirms and promotes sexual health.\nSexual health-related issues are wide-ranging, and encompass sexual orientation and gender identity, sexual expression, relationships, and pleasure."}
