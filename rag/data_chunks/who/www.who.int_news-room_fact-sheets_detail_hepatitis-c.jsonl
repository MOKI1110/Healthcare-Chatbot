It can cause both acute (short term) and chronic (long term) illness. It can be life-threatening.\nHepatitis C is spread through contact with infected blood. This can happen through unsafe inections and procedures in health care, unscreened blood transfusions, sharing of needles and syringes among people who inject drugs and sexual practices that lead to exposure to blood.\nSymptoms can include fever, fatigue, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dark urine and yellowing of the skin or eyes (jaundice).\nThere is no vaccine for hepatitis C, but it can be treated and cured with antiviral medications.\nEarly detection and treatment can prevent serious liver damage and improve long-term health.\nAcute HCV infections are usually asymptomatic and most do not lead to a life-threatening disease."}

Of those with chronic HCV infection, the risk of cirrhosis ranges from 15% to 30% within 20 years.\nGeographical distribution\nHepatitis C virus infection occurs in all WHO regions. The highest burden of disease is in the Eastern Mediterranean Region with 12 million people chronically infected. In the South-East Asia Region (9 million), European Region (9 million) and the Western Pacific Region (7 million) people are chronically infected. Eight million people are chronically infected in the African Region and 5 million the Region of the Americas.\nAbout 2.3 million people of the estimated 39 million living with HIV globally have serological evidence of past or present HCV infection."}

It is most commonly transmitted through:\nthe reuse or inadequate sterilization of medical equipment, especially syringes and needles in healthcare settings;\nthe transfusion of unscreened blood and blood products; and\ninjecting drug use through the sharing of injection equipment.\nHCV can be passed from an infected mother to her baby and via sexual practices that lead to exposure to blood (for example, people with multiple sexual partners and among men who have sex with men); however, these modes of transmission are less common.\nHepatitis C is not spread through breast milk, food, water or casual contact such as hugging, kissing and sharing food or drinks with an infected person.\nSymptoms\nSymptomatic acute HCV infection is uncommon; if is occurs, most people do not have symptoms in the first weeks after infection."}

Although no longer infected, they will still test positive for anti-HCV antibodies. This nucleic acid for HCV RNA can either be done in a lab or using a simple point-of-care machine in the clinic.\nAfter a person has been diagnosed with chronic HCV infection, an assessment should be conducted to determine the degree of liver damage (fibrosis and cirrhosis). This can be done by liver biopsy or through a variety of non-invasive blood tests. The degree of liver damage is used to guide treatment decisions and management of the disease.\nEarly diagnosis can prevent health problems that may result from infection and prevent transmission of the virus."}

This marked an impressive and truly unique milestone in modern medicine and public health, as it became possible to cure a severe, life-threatening chronic infectious disease within 8–12 weeks of therapy in nearly all patients.\nWHO recommends therapy with pan-genotypic direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for all adults, adolescents and children down to 3 years of age with chronic hepatitis C infection. The short-course oral, curative DAA treatment regimens has few if any side-effects. DAAs can cure most persons with HCV infection, and treatment duration is short (usually 12 to 24 weeks), depending on the absence or presence of cirrhosis.

In many low- and middle-income countries the standard curative treatment course is available for less than US$ 50.\nAccess to HCV treatment is improving but remains limited. Of the 50 million people living with HCV infection globally in 2022, an estimated 36% people knew their diagnosis, and of those diagnosed with chronic HCV infection, around 20% (12.5 million) people had been treated with DAAs by the end of 2022.\nPeople with hepatitis C may also benefit from lifestyle changes, such as avoiding alcohol and maintaining a healthy weight."}

With the short-course oral, curative pangenotypic HCV DAA treatment regimens with few if any side-effects, minimal expertise and monitoring are now required.
