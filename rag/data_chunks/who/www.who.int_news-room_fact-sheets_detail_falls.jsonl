Fall-related injuries may be fatal or non-fatal\n(1)\nthough most are non-fatal. For example, of children in the People's Republic of China, for every death due to a fall, there are 4 cases of permanent disability, 13 cases requiring hospitalization for more than 10 days, 24 cases requiring hospitalization for 1–9 days and 690 cases seeking medical care or missing work/school.\nThe problem\nGlobally, falls are a major public health problem."}

An estimated 684 000 fatal falls occur each year, making it the second leading cause of unintentional injury death, after road traffic injuries. Over 80% of fall-related fatalities occur in low- and middle-income countries, with regions of the Western Pacific and South East Asia accounting for 60% of these deaths. In all regions of the world, death rates are highest among adults over the age of 60 years.\nThough not fatal, approximately 37.3 million falls severe enough to require medical attention occur each year. Globally, falls are responsible for over 38 million DALYs (disability-adjusted life years) lost each year\n(2),\nand result in more years lived with disability than transport injury, drowning, burns and poisoning combined.\nWhile nearly 40% of the total DALYs lost due to falls worldwide occurs in children, this measurement may not accurately reflect the impact of fall-related disabilities for older individuals who have fewer life years to lose."}

In addition, those individuals who fall and suffer a disability, particularly older people, are at a major risk for subsequent long-term care and institutionalization.\nThe financial costs from fall-related injuries are substantial. For people aged 65 years or older, the average health system cost per fall injury in the Republic of Finland and Australia are US$ 3611 and US$ 1049 respectively. Evidence from Canada suggests the implementation of effective prevention strategies with a subsequent 20% reduction in the incidence of falls among children under 10 years of age could create a net savings of over US$ 120 million each year.\nWho is at risk?\nWhile all people who fall are at risk of injury, the age, gender and health of the individual can affect the type and severity of injury.\nAge\nAge is one of the key risk factors for falls. Older people have the highest risk of death or serious injury arising from a fall and the risk increases with age."}

Older people have the highest risk of death or serious injury arising from a fall and the risk increases with age. For example, in the United States of America, 20–30% of older people who fall suffer moderate to severe injuries such as bruises, hip fractures, or head trauma. This risk level may be in part due to physical, sensory, and cognitive changes associated with ageing, in combination with environments that are not adapted for an ageing population.\nAnother high risk group is children. Childhood falls occur largely as a result of their evolving developmental stages, innate curiosity in their surroundings, and increasing levels of independence that coincide with more challenging behaviours commonly referred to as ‘risk taking’. While inadequate adult supervision is a commonly cited risk factor, the circumstances are often complex, interacting with poverty, sole parenthood, and particularly hazardous environments.\nGender\nAcross all age groups and regions, both genders are at risk of falls."}

In some countries, it has been noted that males are more likely to die from a fall, while females suffer more non-fatal falls. Older women and younger children are especially prone to falls and increased injury severity. Worldwide, males consistently sustain higher death rates and DALYs lost. Possible explanations of the greater burden seen among males may include higher levels of risk-taking behaviours and hazards within occupations.\nOther risk factors include:\noccupations at elevated heights or other hazardous working conditions;\nalcohol or substance use;\nsocioeconomic factors including poverty, overcrowded housing, sole parenthood, young maternal age;\nunderlying medical conditions, such as neurological, cardiac or other disabling conditions;\nside effects of medication, physical inactivity and loss of balance, particularly among older people;\npoor mobility, cognition, and vision, particularly among those living in an institution, such as a nursing home or chronic care facility;\nunsaf"}
