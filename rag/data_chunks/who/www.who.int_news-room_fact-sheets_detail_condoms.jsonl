Most of these of these could be prevented with the correct use of condoms.\nCondoms have had a significant impact on the global HIV epidemic: model simulations have estimated that increased condom use since 1990 has averted approximately 117 million new HIV infections\n(1)\n.\nNinety-eight percent of women whose male partners use male condoms correctly in every sex act over one year will be protected from unplanned pregnancy; when female condoms are used, 95% of them will be protected against unplanned pregnancy.\nAccording to a\nmulti-party study in Europe\n, almost a third of adolescents (30%) reported using neither a condom nor the contraceptive pill at last intercourse, a figure that has barely changed since 2018.\nNon-judgmental, person-centred information should be provided to support condom use.\nGender inequities, especially in intimate relationships is a major barrier for condom use.\nResearch from WHO, HRP and partners indicates that interventions that use a"}

Condoms are safe, inexpensive and widely available.\nThere are both external (also known as male) condoms and internal (also known as female) condoms , which are effective when used correctly.\nWhen using a condom\n, lubricants (also known as lube) make it less likely that the condom will break, slip or fall off and can enhance pleasure during sex. This is especially important during anal sex as the rectum, unlike the vagina, does not have natural lubrication. Use of a water- or silicone-based lube is recommended, as other types may cause the condom to break, such as kitchen oil, butter and hand lotion."}

Lube may also be helpful for individuals who experience vaginal dryness associated with menopause or other skin conditions in the genital area.\nEffectiveness\nCondoms are highly efficacious in preventing pregnancy, STIs and HIV. However, the effectiveness of condoms in practice depends on their correct use. The risk of pregnancy or STIs, including HIV, is greatest when condoms are not used correctly with every act of sex. Very few pregnancies or infections occur due to slips or breaks. Condoms significantly reduce the risk of most STIs when used consistently and correctly during vaginal, oral and anal sex."}
