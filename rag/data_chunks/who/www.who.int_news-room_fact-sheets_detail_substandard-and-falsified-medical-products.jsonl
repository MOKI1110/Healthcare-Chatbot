Falsified medical products deliberately misrepresent their identity, composition or source. These products are often created and distributed with the intent to deceive consumers for financial gain.\nSubstandard and falsified medical products pose significant threats to public health globally. They can be ineffective at treating the illness, as they may contain incorrect ingredients or incorrect dosages."}

They can be ineffective at treating the illness, as they may contain incorrect ingredients or incorrect dosages. They can even be directly harmful to patients if they contain contaminants or toxic substances. They may be indirectly harmful through increased risk of antimicrobial resistance.\nBoth substandard and falsified medical products put patients’ health at risk, undermine the effectiveness of health systems, and erode trust in health and care providers. Sometimes, certain problems with health affect some countries more than others. These problems can happen in places where everyone does not have access to healthcare. When that happens, people might buy medical products from places that are not permitted to sell them. Even in wealthy countries, the global trade and transportation of medicines pose significant risks. These risks stem from how medicines are manufactured and distributed across the world."}

Even in wealthy countries, the global trade and transportation of medicines pose significant risks. These risks stem from how medicines are manufactured and distributed across the world. To mitigate this, coordinated efforts are needed; governments, healthcare professionals and manufacturers must collaborate to enforce regulations and educate the public on safety measures.\nScope of the problem\nSubstandard and falsified medical products are a significant global health problem, impacting millions of people and compromising health systems worldwide. These products can be found in all countries, impacting all types of medical products, including life-saving treatments like vaccines, antibiotics and cancer therapies. In 2017, the World Health Organization estimated that 1 in 10 medicines in low- and middle-income countries failed quality control tests, suggesting the product is substandard or falsified. This can lead to serious health risks, treatment failures and even death.\nThe economic burden is also substantial, with billions of dollars lost annually due to ineffective treatments, increased healthcare costs and loss of productivity."}

For patients, the consequences are dire: relying on ineffective or harmful products can exacerbate illnesses, lead to prolonged suffering and contribute to drug resistance, making diseases harder to treat.\nThe issue of substandard and falsified medical products is pervasive and challenging to address due to sophisticated falsification techniques that are difficult to detect and insufficient national resources to respond effectively. This problem significantly undermines health systems, erodes trust in healthcare, and results in financial losses for both patients and legitimate industries.\nIncreasingly sophisticated networks manufacture these products, exploiting the demand for affordable medical treatments. The rise in online sales through unauthorized sites has further exacerbated the issue, allowing falsified products to reach consumers more easily."}

Patients may unknowingly consume medications that contain toxic substances or incorrect dosages, resulting in poisoning, treatment failure, and exacerbation of diseases. These products can accelerate the spread of drug-resistant infections, making once-treatable conditions deadly. The economic toll may also be serious as families deplete their savings on ineffective treatments, and health systems waste precious resources. Trust in healthcare providers and systems erodes, leaving communities vulnerable and fearful. The global reach of this issue means no region is spared, with both developed and developing countries grappling with the devastating impacts.\nChallenges\nAddressing substandard and falsified medical products is challenging due to limited resources and infrastructure in many regions, especially in low- and middle-income countries.
