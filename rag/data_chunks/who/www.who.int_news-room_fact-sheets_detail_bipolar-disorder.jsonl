The condition is primarily observed among working-age people, but also in youth. While the prevalence of bipolar disorder among men and women is approximately equal, available data indicate that women are more often diagnosed.\nWorldwide, the treatment coverage for people with bipolar disorder is low."}

Both men and women are often misdiagnosed. Many lack access to services and recommended interventions, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).\nStigma and discrimination against people with bipolar disorder are widespread, both in communities and health services. This can undermine access to health care. It also fuels social exclusion and can limit opportunities for education, employment and housing.\nBipolar disorder is one of the leading causes of disability globally as it can affect many areas of life. People with bipolar disorder may experience strained relationships, problems at school or work, and difficulties in carrying out daily activities. Having bipolar disorder also increases the risk of suicide and of developing anxiety and substance use disorders.\nPeople with bipolar disorder are more likely to smoke, use alcohol, have a physical health condition (e.g. cardiovascular or respiratory disease), and experience difficulties in accessing health care."}

On average, people with bipolar disorder die on average 13 years earlier than the general population\n(2)\n.\nSymptoms and patterns\nBipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by mood swings from one extreme to another.\nDuring a manic episode, a person experiences an extremely high mood with lots of energy (feeling very happy, excited, overactive). They may have a sense of euphoria, sudden shifts in mood or an excess of emotion (uncontrollable laughing or feeling much more irritable, agitated or restless than usual).\nIn manic episodes, the changes in mood and activities are accompanied by other characteristic symptoms, which may include:\nhighly inflated sense of self-worth or self-esteem;\ntalking quickly and rapidly shifting from one idea to the next;\nhaving trouble concentrating and being easily distracted;\ndecreased need for sleep;\nreckless or risk-taking behaviour, for example overspending, risky sexual activity, drinking, or harming oneself or others; and\nfixed and mis"}

They may feel a loss of interest or pleasure in activities that they had previously enjoyed.\nOther symptoms are also present, which may include:\npoor concentration\nfeelings of excessive guilt or low self-worth\nhopelessness about the future\nthoughts about dying or suicide\ndisrupted sleep\nchanges in appetite or weight\nfeeling very tired or low in energy.\nA depressive episode is different from mood fluctuations commonly experienced by most people, in that the symptoms last most of the day, nearly every day, for at least two weeks.\nBoth manic and depressive episodes can cause significant difficulties in all aspects of life, including at home, work and school."}

They may require specialized care to prevent the person from doing harm to themselves or others.\nSome people with bipolar disorder may experience what are called hypomanic episodes. Hypomanic episodes involve similar symptoms to manic episodes, but the symptoms are less intense and do not typically disrupt the person’s ability to function to the same extent.\nThere are two main types of bipolar disorder, depending on patterns of manic or hypomanic and depressive episodes.\nPeople with\nbipolar type I disorder\nexperience one or more manic episodes interspaced with episodes of depression which usually become more common over time (compared with manic episodes).\nPeople with\nbipolar type II disorder\nhave had one or more hypomanic episodes and at least one depressive episode, but no history of manic episodes.\nRisks and protective factors\nThe exact cause of bipolar disorder is unknown.

Several factors – including biological (e.g. genetic), psychological, social and structural factors – may contribute to its onset, trajectory and outcomes.\nAdverse circumstances or life-altering events can trigger or exacerbate the symptoms of bipolar disorder. These may include bereavement, violence or the breakdown of a relationship. The use of alcohol or drugs can also influence the onset and trajectory of bipolar disorder.\nAlthough employment can be a source of stress for people living with bipolar disorder, it can also be protective.
