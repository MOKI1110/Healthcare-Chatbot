It covers the full continuum of\nessential health services, from health promotion to prevention, treatment,\nrehabilitation and palliative care.\nTo deliver on this promise, countries need to have strong, efficient\nand equitable health systems that are rooted in the communities they serve.\nPrimary health care (PHC) is the most effective and cost-efficient way to get\nthere."}

Every country has a different path to achieving UHC and to decide what\nto cover based on the needs of their populations and the resources at hand.\nInvesting in PHC ensures that all those needs are identified, prioritized and\naddressed in an integrated way; that there is a robust and equipped health and\ncare workforce; and that all sectors of society contribute to confronting the\nenvironmental and socio-economic factors that affect health and well-being,\nincluding preparing for, responding to and recovering from emergencies.\nWHO response\nAs a foundation for UHC, WHO recommends reorienting health\nsystems using a primary health care (PHC) approach. Achieving UHC is a WHO\nstrategic priority, with the goal of 1 billion more people benefitting from\nuniversal health coverage by 2025.\nIn countries with fragile health systems, we focus on technical\nassistance to build national institutions and service delivery to fill critical\ngaps in emergencies."}
