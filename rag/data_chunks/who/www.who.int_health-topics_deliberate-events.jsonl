Traditionally, DEs involve the use of hazardous substances such as chemicals, biological agents, toxins or radio-nuclear materials (CBRN) while emerging threats include disinformation, misuse of digital, cyber means and other new technologies.\nDEs can cause harm in several ways, for example through the intentional release of a harmful material or a dangerous pathogen directly targeting humans and/or animals, or indirectly through contaminating food or water, destroying crops or damaging the environment.\nAddressing DEs involves both health and security dimensions. The health sector’s role is to protect and manage the health and well-being of those at risk of or affected by DEs. The security sector and law enforcement’s role is to identify and control the source of the DE and prevent the situation from worsening (see\nStrengthening the global health-security interface\n).\nPreparing for DEs is an integral part of developing and updating national emergency preparedness and response plans."}

WHO advises Member States to 1) strengthen public health surveillance and preparedness activities and to 2) link public health and security authorities to prepare for possible DEs, with an emphasis on:\nevaluating and identifying gaps in national preparedness and readiness, as well as national capacities to manage risks posed by deliberate exposure to hazardous materials, disinformation or cyberattacks. This could be done by using the section dedicated to DE\n(1)\nof the National Self-Assessment toolkit (NSAT), which provides a baseline measurement of national capacity and capabilities related to DEs."}
