Adult worms live in the blood vessels where the females release eggs. Some of the eggs are passed out of the body in the faeces or urine to continue the parasite’s lifecycle."}

It is estimated that at least 90% of those requiring treatment for schistosomiasis live in Africa.\nThere are 2 major forms of schistosomiasis – intestinal and urogenital – caused by 5 main species of blood fluke.\nTable: Parasite species and geographical distribution of schistosomiasis\nSpecies\nGeographical distribution\nIntestinal schistosomiasis\nSchistosoma mansoni\nAfrica, the Middle East, the Caribbean, Brazil, Venezuela and Suriname\nSchistosoma japonicum\nChina, Indonesia, the Philippines\nSchistosoma mekongi\nSeveral districts of Cambodia and the Lao People’s Democratic Republic\nSchistosoma guineensis\nand related\nS."}

Liver enlargement is common in advanced cases and is frequently associated with an accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity and hypertension of the abdominal\nblood vessels. In such cases there may also be enlargement of the spleen.\nThe classic sign of urogenital schistosomiasis is haematuria (blood in urine).
