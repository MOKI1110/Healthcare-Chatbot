Changes in these relationships can increase the risk of new human and animal diseases developing and spreading.\nThe close links between human, animal and environmental health demand close collaboration, communication and coordination between the relevant sectors.\nOne Health is an approach to optimize the health of humans, animals and ecosystems by integrating these fields, rather than keeping them separate.\nSome 60% of emerging infectious diseases that are reported globally come from animals, both wild and domestic."}

Over 30 new human pathogens have been detected in the last 3 decades, 75% of which have originated in animals.\nHuman activities and stressed ecosystems have created new opportunities for diseases to emerge and spread.\nThese stressors include animal trade, agriculture, livestock farming, urbanization, extractive industries, climate change, habitat fragmentation and encroachment into wild areas.\nOverview\nOne Health is an integrated, unifying approach to balance and optimize the health of people, animals and ecosystems. It uses the close, interdependent links among these fields to create new surveillance and disease control methods.\nFor example, the way land is used can impact the number of malaria cases. Weather patterns and human-built water controls can affect diseases like dengue."}

Gaps in One Health knowledge, prevention and integrated approaches were seen as key drivers of the pandemic. By\naddressing the linkages between human, animal and environmental health, One Health is seen as a transformative approach to improved global health.\nOne Health applies to a range of issues, include:\nantimicrobial resistance (AMR), which happens when germs like bacteria and parasites develop the ability to defeat the drugs designed to kill them and continue growing and spreading;\nzoonotic diseases, which are infectious diseases that are caused by germs that spread between animals and people, such as Ebola, avian influenza, rabies, etc.;\nvector-borne diseases, which affect people who get bitten by a vector (mosquito"}
