It is estimated that bacterial AMR was directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019 and contributed to 4.95 million deaths\n(1)\n.\nThe misuse and overuse of antimicrobials in humans, animals and plants are the main drivers in the development of drug-resistant pathogens.\nAMR affects countries in all regions and at all income levels. Its drivers and consequences are exacerbated by poverty and inequality, and low- and middle-income countries are most affected.\nAMR puts many of the gains of modern medicine at risk. It makes infections harder to treat and makes other medical procedures and treatments – such as surgery, caesarean sections and cancer chemotherapy – much riskier.\nThe world faces an antibiotics pipeline and access crisis."}
