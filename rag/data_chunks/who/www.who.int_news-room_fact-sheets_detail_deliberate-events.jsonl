The scope includes traditional chemical, biological and radio-nuclear agents and emerging threats such as cyber-attacks and dis-information campaigns.\nDEs may be announced or occur covertly with uncertainty or ambiguity as to the cause or whether the cause was deliberate.\nThe scale of consequence of DEs could vary widely – from DEs aimed at individuals or small groups of people with minor or major impacts to DEs that cause mass casualties and cascading consequences of potentially public health emergencies of international concern.\nAddressing DEs involves both health and security dimensions."}

When a DE is suspected, response efforts will have to balance medical, public health, epidemiological and humanitarian response efforts with criminal and forensic investigations involving national and/or international authorities across multiple agencies, requiring coordination across a range of actors, resources and capacities.\nThe\nBiological Weapons Convention (BWC)\nprohibits the development, production, acquisition, transfer, stockpiling and use of biological and toxin weapons.\nOverview\nDeliberate events (DEs) are malicious acts with the intention to cause harm to the target. Traditionally, DEs involve the release or use of hazardous substances such as chemicals, biological agents, toxins or radio-nuclear materials (CBRN), while emerging threats include disinformation, misuse of digital, cyber means (for example, cyber-attacks disrupting critical health infrastructures) and other new technologies."}

DEs can occur on a small scale, for example poisoning an individual, or a large scale, such as the release of CBRN material to kill, make sick, or injure large populations, initiate larger scale epidemics, or severely damage the environment. A disinformation campaign may accompany DEs to create fear, panic, distrust, discrimination and psychological trauma.\nRisks and impacts\nDEs involve both health and security dimensions. In conflict or war, key health infrastructure or CBRN facilities can be deliberately damaged, contaminated or destroyed with widespread consequences. Geopolitical shifts and conflicts create new circumstances for DEs. In addition to these traditional agents, emerging threats include disinformation and the misuse of cyber and technology means, with direct or indirect consequences on human health (fear, mistrust, major psychological impacts, delay in access to care, etc.)."}

Scientific advances and access to technological and digital tools have increased the potential risks of high-consequence DEs. Atomic science is known as a typical example of a so-called double-edged sword; something that has or can have both favourable and unfavourable consequences. For example, nuclear power can be used for sustainable and large-scale energy production or nuclear weapons of mass destruction. This is also true for health and life science research, which is sometimes known as dual-use research of concern (DURC). For example, while understanding key characteristics of microorganisms will help prevention and control of infectious diseases, application of gene editing and reconstruction science can lead to a new and disastrous pathogen. The public health, economic and national security consequences from DEs have made it necessary for governments to seek to prevent such use, to have the means of detecting such events and to prepare for and be ready to respond to them."}
