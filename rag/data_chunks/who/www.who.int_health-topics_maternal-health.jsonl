This number is unacceptably high.\nThe most common direct causes of maternal injury and death are excessive blood loss, infection, high blood pressure, unsafe abortion, and obstructed labour, as well as indirect causes such as anemia, malaria, and heart disease.\nMost maternal deaths are preventable with timely management by a skilled health professional working in a supportive environment.\nEnding preventable maternal death must remain at the top of the global agenda. At the same time, simply surviving pregnancy and childbirth can never be the marker of successful maternal health care. It is critical to expand efforts reducing maternal injury and disability to promote health and well-being.\nEvery pregnancy and birth is unique."}

It is critical to expand efforts reducing maternal injury and disability to promote health and well-being.\nEvery pregnancy and birth is unique. Addressing inequalities that affect health outcomes, especially sexual and reproductive health and rights and gender, is fundamental to ensuring all women have access to respectful and high-quality maternity care.\nImpact\nAbout 140 million births take place every year and the proportion attended by skilled health personnel has increased: from 58% in 1990 to 81% in 2019. This is mostly due to larger numbers of births taking place at a health facility.\nDeaths from complications during pregnancy, childbirth, and the postnatal period have declined by 38% in the last two decades, but at an average reduction of just under 3% per year, this pace of progress is far too slow.\nIt also hides vast inequalities within and across countries.\nMore than half of maternal deaths occur in fragile and humanitarian settings."}

Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia share the greatest burden of maternal deaths, 86% of the global total in 2017.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) offers an opportunity for the international community to work together and accelerate progress to improve maternal health for all women, in all countries, under all circumstances.\nSDG targets for maternal health include 3.1, aiming for an average global ratio of less than 70 deaths per 100 000 births by 2030, and 3.8, calling for the achievement of universal health coverage. These cannot be achieved without reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health coverage for all.\nWHO Response\nImproving maternal health is one of WHO’s key priorities, grounded in a human rights approach and linked to efforts on universal health coverage.\nWHO advocates for health planning where women’s values and preferences are at the centre of their own care."}

Meaningful engagement and empowerment of women, families, communities, and providers is essential for quality improvement initiatives.\nPromoting health along the whole continuum of pregnancy, childbirth and postnatal care is also crucial. This includes good nutrition, detecting and preventing diseases, ensuring access to sexual and reproductive health and supporting women who may be experiencing intimate partner violence.\nIt is WHO’s responsibility to monitor progress towards the global goal for reducing maternal death (SDG target 3.1). WHO generates data, research, clinical guidelines and programmatic tools to support achievement of global targets and evidence-based strategies for ending preventable maternal mortality (EPMM) and improving maternal health and well-being.\nWHO supports Member States as they implement plans to promote access to quality health services for all."}
