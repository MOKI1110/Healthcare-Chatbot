Social determinants of health matter because addressing them not only helps prevents illness but also promotes healthy lives and equity.\nHealth follows a social gradient whereby the more deprived the area in which people live, the lower their income, the fewer their years of education, the worse their health and the fewer healthy years they can expect to live.\nGovernance processes need to ensure that policies and systems are developed and implemented to ensure everyone can realize the conditions needed for a healthy and decent life.\nNon-medical aspects of health\nSocial injustice continues to kill on a grand scale, in both high- and low-income countries, as the world fails to tackle the non-medical root causes of ill health. Social determinants of health equity outweigh genetic influences or health-care access in influencing health outcomes.\nWithin countries, life expectancy varies by decades, depending on which area you live in and the social group to which you belong."}
