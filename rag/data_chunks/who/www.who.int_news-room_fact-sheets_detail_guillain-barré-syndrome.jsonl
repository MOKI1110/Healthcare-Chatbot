People with Guillain-Barré syndrome should be treated and monitored as quickly as possible; some may need intensive care. Treatment includes supportive care and some immunological therapies.\nOverview\nIn Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), the body's immune system attacks part of the peripheral nervous system. The syndrome can affect the nerves that control muscle movement as well as those that transmit pain, temperature and touch sensations."}

The syndrome can affect the nerves that control muscle movement as well as those that transmit pain, temperature and touch sensations. This can result in muscle weakness, loss of sensation in the legs and/or arms, and problems swallowing or breathing.\nIt is a rare condition, and while it is more common in adults and in males, people of all ages can be affected.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms typically last a few weeks, with most individuals recovering without long-term, severe neurological complications.\nThe first symptoms of GBS include weakness or tingling sensations. They usually start in the legs and can spread to the arms and face.\nFor some people, these symptoms can lead to paralysis of the legs, arms, or muscles in the face. In approximately one third of people, the chest muscles are affected, making it hard to breathe.\nThe ability to speak and swallow may become affected in severe cases of GBS."}

In approximately one third of people, the chest muscles are affected, making it hard to breathe.\nThe ability to speak and swallow may become affected in severe cases of GBS. These cases are considered life-threatening, and affected individuals should be treated in intensive-care units.\nMost people recover fully from even the most severe cases of GBS, although some continue to experience weakness.\nEven in the best of settings, a small number of GBS patients die from complications, which can include paralysis of the muscles that control breathing, blood infection, lung clots, or cardiac arrest.\nCauses\nGBS is rare. The cause of it is not fully understood, but most cases follow an infection with a virus or bacteria. This leads the immune system to attack the body itself. Infection with the bacteria\nCampylobacter jejuni\n, which causes gastroenteritis (including symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), is one of the most common risk factors for GBS."}

Infection with the bacteria\nCampylobacter jejuni\n, which causes gastroenteritis (including symptoms of nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea), is one of the most common risk factors for GBS. People can also develop GBS after having the flu or other viral infections including cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and the Zika virus.\nIn rare instances, vaccinations may increase the risk of people getting GBS, but the chance of this occurring is extremely low. Studies show that people are much more likely to get GBS from infections such as the flu than from the vaccine given to prevent the infection, in this case the flu vaccine. Occasionally, surgery can trigger GBS.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is based on symptoms and findings on neurological examination including diminished or loss of deep-tendon reflexes. A lumbar puncture or electromyography (EMG) may be done for supportive information, though should not delay treatment. Other tests, such as blood tests, to identify the underlying trigger are not required to make the diagnosis of GBS and should not delay treatment."}

People with GBS should be hospitalized so that they can be monitored closely.\nSupportive care includes monitoring of breathing, heartbeat and blood pressure. In cases where a person's ability to breathe is impaired, he or she is usually put on a ventilator."}
