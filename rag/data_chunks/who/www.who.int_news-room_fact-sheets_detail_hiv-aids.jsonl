Transmission is ongoing in all countries globally.\nThere were an estimated 40.8 million people living with HIV at the end of 2024, 65% of whom are in the WHO African Region.\nIn 2024, an estimated 630 000 people died from HIV-related causes and an estimated 1.3 million people acquired HIV.\nThere is no cure for HIV infection. However, with access to effective HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care, including for opportunistic infections, HIV infection has become a manageable chronic health condition, enabling people living with HIV to lead long and healthy lives.\nWHO, the Global Fund and UNAIDS all have global HIV strategies that are aligned with the SDG target 3.3 of ending the HIV epidemic by 2030.\nBy 2025, 95% of all people living with HIV should have a diagnosis, 95% of whom should be taking lifesaving antiretroviral treatment, and 95% of people living with HIV on treatment should achieve a suppressed viral load for the benefit of the person’s health and for reducing onward HIV transmission."}

Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) occurs at the most advanced stage of infection.\nHIV targets the body’s white blood cells, weakening the immune system. This makes it easier to get sick with diseases like tuberculosis, infections and some cancers.\nHIV is spread from the body fluids of an infected person, including blood, breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids. It is not spread by kisses, hugs or sharing food. It can also spread from a mother to her baby.\nHIV can be prevented and treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART)."}

It is not spread by kisses, hugs or sharing food. It can also spread from a mother to her baby.\nHIV can be prevented and treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART). Untreated HIV can progress to AIDS, often after many years.\nWHO now defines Advanced HIV Disease (AHD) as CD4 cell count less than 200 cells/mm3 or WHO stage 3 or 4 event in adults and adolescents. All children younger than 5 years of age living with HIV are considered to have advanced HIV disease, regardless of clinical or immunological status.\nSigns and symptoms\nThe signs and symptoms of HIV vary depending on the stage of infection.\nHIV spreads more easily in the first few months after a person is infected, but many are unaware of their status until the later stages. In the first few weeks after being infected people may not experience symptoms. Others may have an influenza-like illness including:\nfever\nheadache\nrash\nsore throat.\nThe infection progressively weakens the immune system."}

HIV can also be transmitted to a child during pregnancy and delivery.  People cannot become infected with HIV through ordinary day-to-day contact such as kissing, hugging, shaking hands, or sharing personal objects, food or water.\nPeople living with HIV who are taking ART and have an undetectable viral load will not transmit HIV to their sexual partners."}

Early access to ART and support to remain on treatment is therefore critical not only to improve the health of people living with HIV but also to prevent HIV transmission.\nRisk factors\nBehaviours and conditions that put people at greater risk of contracting HIV include:\nhaving anal or vaginal sex without a condom;\nhaving another sexually transmitted infection (STI) such as syphilis, herpes, chlamydia, gonorrhoea and bacterial vaginosis;\nharmful use of alcohol or drugs in the context of sexual behaviour;\nsharing contaminated needles, syringes and other injecting equipment, or drug solutions when injecting drugs;\nreceiving unsafe injections, blood transfusions, or tissue transplantation; and\nmedical procedures that involve unsterile cutting or piercing; or accidental needle stick injuries, including among health workers.\nDiagnosis\nHIV can be diagnosed\nthrough rapid diagnostic tests that provide same-day results."}

This greatly facilitates early diagnosis and linkage with treatment and prevention. People can also use HIV self-tests to test themselves. However, no single test can provide a full HIV positive diagnosis; confirmatory testing is required, conducted by a qualified and trained health worker or community worker. HIV infection can be detected with great accuracy using WHO prequalified tests within a nationally approved testing strategy and algorithm.\nMost widely used HIV diagnostic tests detect antibodies produced by a person as part of their immune response to fight HIV. In most cases, people develop antibodies to HIV within 28 days of infection. During this time, people are in the so-called “window period” when they have low levels of antibodies which cannot be detected by many rapid tests, but they may still transmit HIV to others."}

People who have had a recent high-risk exposure and test negative can have a further test after 28 days.\nFollowing a positive diagnosis, people should be retested before they are enrolled in treatment and care to rule out any potential testing or reporting error. While testing for adolescents and adults has been made simple and efficient, this is not the case for babies born to HIV-positive mothers. For children less than 18 months of age, rapid antibody testing is not sufficient to identify HIV infection – virological testing must be provided as early as birth or at 6 weeks of age. New technologies are now available to perform this test at the point of care and enable same-day results, which will accelerate appropriate linkage with treatment and care.\nPrevention\nHIV is a preventable disease."}

It is an antiretroviral medication used by HIV-negative people to reduce the risk of HIV acquisition. WHO recommends the following PrEP methods :\noral tenofovir (TDF)-based PrEP\ndapivirine vaginal ring\nlong-acting injectable cabotegravir\nlong-acting injectable lenacapavir.\nARVs can also be used to prevent mothers from passing HIV to their children.\nPeople taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) and who have no evidence of virus in the blood will not pass HIV to their sexual partners."}

People can use PrEP or PEP when the risk of contracting HIV is high; people should seek advice from a clinician when thinking about using PrEP or PEP.\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for HIV infection. It is treated with antiretroviral drugs, which stop the virus from replicating in the body.\nCurrent antiretroviral therapy (ART) does not cure HIV infection but allows a person’s immune system to get stronger.
