Globally, it is estimated to affect more than 200 million people at any time and more than 400 million people every year.\nScabies is caused by infestation of the skin with a microscopic mite (\nSarcoptes scabiei\nvar.\nhominis\n) characterized by itch and a skin eruption. Scabies is frequently complicated by bacterial skin infection (impetigo). In turn, impetigo may result in abscesses, sepsis and invasive infections with bacteria, most frequently\nStaphylococcus aureus\nand\nStreptococcus pyogenes\n, the latter of which may result in kidney disease and rheumatic heart disease."}

Scabies also impacts quality of life: itch and visible rash often lead to poor sleep, stigmatization and social exclusion, interrupting school and work attendance.\nScabies affects the world’s most disadvantaged populations,\nespecially people living in crowded and impoverished conditions, from island communities in the Pacific to favelas of Latin America, remote and rural communities across Africa and Australia, and displaced populations living in camps. In resource-poor settings, scabies and its complications impose a major cost on health care systems. In high-income countries, cases are sporadic, yet outbreaks in health institutions and vulnerable communities contribute to significant economic costs for national health services.\nSymptoms\nScabies mites burrow under the upper layer of the skin to lay their eggs, resulting in intense itching."}

Characteristics of scabies are papules or burrows in typical locations, including the web spaces of the fingers and toes, wrists, buttocks, breasts in females, and genitals. In young children and the elderly, scabies lesions may also be present on the palms, soles and scalp. The itching and rash cause poor sleep, stigmatization and social exclusion, as well as absenteeism from education and employment, resulting in reduced learning potential for children and economic impacts for families and communities. Presence of redness, pus or crusts may indicate a secondary bacterial infection. This should be differentiated from crusted scabies, a severe form of scabies, that is characterized by thick, scaly, plaques over the skin and, in severe cases, deep fissures.\nTreatment\nPrimary management of affected individuals involves application of a topical scabicide such as 5% permethrin, 0.5% malathion in aqueous base, 10–25% benzyl benzoate emulsion or 5–10% sulfur ointment."}

Oral ivermectin is also highly effective and is approved in several countries. The safety of ivermectin in pregnant women or children below\n15 kg body weight has not been established, so ivermectin should not be used in these groups until more safety data are available. Itch commonly intensifies with effective treatment for 1–2 weeks and treated individuals should be informed accordingly.\nBecause people in the early stage of new infestation may be asymptomatic, it is critical to treat the whole household at the same time as the diagnosed case."}
