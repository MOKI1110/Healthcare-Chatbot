Despite the availability of magnesium sulfate, its use is still limited in many low-resource settings.\nPre-eclampsia and eclampsia contribute significantly to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality.\nOverview\nPre-eclampsia is a high blood pressure disorder that typically develops after 20 weeks into pregnancy. It can present serious risks to both mother and baby. Early detection and management are crucial to prevent progression to eclampsia, which involves seizures."}

It can present serious risks to both mother and baby. Early detection and management are crucial to prevent progression to eclampsia, which involves seizures. Both conditions can be life-threatening.\nDiagnosis\nPre-eclampsia is diagnosed based on the onset of hypertension (blood pressure ≥140/90 mm Hg) and proteinuria (≥0.3 g/24 hours) after 20 weeks of gestation. Severe pre-eclampsia may include symptoms such as severe headaches, visual disturbances and upper abdominal pain.\nRisk factors\nSeveral factors can increase the risk of developing pre-eclampsia during pregnancy. Understanding these risk factors is essential for proactive monitoring and management. Having a risk factor doesn't always mean pre-eclampsia will occur, but closer medical supervision beyond routine screening is recommended.\nSeveral factors can increase the risk of developing pre-eclampsia, including:\nfirst-time pregnancies\nmultiple pregnancies (twins, triplets, etc.)\nobesity\npre-existing conditions such as hypertension, diabetes or kidney disease\nfamily history of pre-eclampsia.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of pre-eclampsia can vary significantly among individuals."}

It is important to be aware of potential indicators and seek medical attention if any concerns arise during pregnancy or after childbirth.\nCommon symptoms of pre-eclampsia include:\npersistent high blood pressure\nproteinuria\nsevere headaches\nvisual disturbances (e.g., blurred vision, seeing spots)\nupper abdominal pain\nnausea and vomiting (after the first trimester)\nswelling in the hands and face.\nComplications\nPre-eclampsia, if left untreated, can lead to serious complications for both mother and baby.
