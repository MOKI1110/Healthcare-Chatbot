It can affect both humans and animals. The infection is caused by fungi, known as dermatophytes, that thrive on the skin, hair, and nails. Symptoms of ringworm include itching, redness, and a characteristic ring-shaped rash. While not life threatening, ringworm can be uncomfortable. embarrassing and easily spread. It is typically treated with antifungal medications applied directly to the skin, but oral medications may be necessary for severe or widespread infections."}

There is a spreading outbreak of extensive and drug-resistant ringworm in many countries\nScope of the problem\nTinea is one of the commonest dermatological conditions, accounting for a substantial proportion of skin disease in developing countries. Globally, fungal skin infections are estimated to affect more than 650 million people at any time and of these, ringworm accounts for over half the cases\n(1)\n.\nRingworm is found in every country but some forms are common in resource-poor tropical settings. Prevalence of scalp infection among children in these areas may reach more than 25 % of school children under 10\n(2)\n. Cases are sporadic in some high-income countries but may lead to outbreaks in schools. Tinea pedis infections are often endemic in heavy industries and can result in loss of work and complications due to secondary infection.\nThere is a growing worldwide problem of ringworm or tinea extensively affecting the body, tinea corporis."}

Many of these cases are resistant to the common antifungal medications, posing an increasing public health problem.\nSymptoms\nRingworm can affect various parts of the body, and the symptoms may vary depending on the location of the infection.\nTinea capitis (scalp ringworm) affects the scalp and can cause itching, redness and hair loss. It is mainly seen in children.\nTinea corporis (body ringworm) appears on the skin as a ring-shaped rash with raised borders. It can be itchy and may spread to other parts of the body. It may also be very widespread covering large areas of the body.\nTinea cruris (groin ringworm or jock itch) affects the groin and upper thighs."}
