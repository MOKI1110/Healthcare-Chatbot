Unhealthy diet is one of the\nleading risks for the global burden of disease, mainly for noncommunicable\ndiseases such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and cancer.\nEvidence shows the health benefits of a diet high in whole grains, vegetables,\nfruit, legumes and nuts, and low in salt, free sugars and fats, particularly\nsaturated and trans fats. A healthy diet starts early in life with adequate breastfeeding.\nThe benefits of a healthy diet are reflected in higher educational outcomes,\nproductivity and lifelong health.\nA healthy diet is also more environmentally sustainable, as it is associated\nto lower greenhouse gas emissions, lower use freshwater and land mass.\nHowever, healthy diets can be inaccessible, particularly in low- and\nmiddle-income countries, and also in places and situations with high rates of\nfood insecurity. Around the world, an estimated 3 billion people cannot access safe,\nnutritious and sufficient food."}
