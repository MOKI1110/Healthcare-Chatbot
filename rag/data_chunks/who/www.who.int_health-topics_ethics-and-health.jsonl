Scholars and health care professionals have debated ethical questions related to health and health care since the earliest days of medicine. Recent formal efforts to articulate international standards of ethics applicable to health and health care can\nbe traced to the Nuremberg trials of 1947, during which the horrors of Nazi medical experiments came to light.\nThe principles that emerged from those trials, known as the Nuremberg Code, are broadly applicable to many types of health-related research involving\nhuman participants, including clinical trials. The growing breadth and complexity of contemporary health challenges have produced a range of difficult questions that cannot always be adequately addressed by relying exclusively on existing policies,\nguidelines or codes of conduct."}

Debates over access to new and expensive pharmaceuticals and medical technologies, as well as increasing awareness of the gross health disparities that exist both within and between countries, have called attention to the\nneed for an ethics of health policy and practice.\nResearch\nResearch ethics govern the standards of conduct for scientific researchers. It is important to adhere to ethical principles in order to protect the dignity, rights and welfare of research participants.\nThe WHO Manual (Section XV.2) defines research with human subjects as 'any social science, biomedical, behavioural, or epidemiological activity that entails systematic collection or analysis of data with the intent to generate new knowledge, in which human beings:\nare exposed to manipulation, intervention, observation, or other interaction with investigators either directly or through alteration of their environment; or\nbecome individually identifiable through investigator's collection, preparation, or use of bi"}
