The primary purpose of assistive products is to maintain or improve an individual’s functioning and independence, thereby promoting their well-being. They enable people to live healthy, productive, independent and dignified lives, and to participate in education, the labour market and civic life.\nExamples of assistive products include hearing aids, wheelchairs, spectacles, prostheses and devices that support memory, among many others. While supporting independence and well-being, these products can also help to prevent or reduce the effects of secondary health conditions, such as lower limb amputation in people with diabetes. They can also reduce the need and impact on carers and mitigate the need for formal health and support services."}

They can also reduce the need and impact on carers and mitigate the need for formal health and support services. Moreover, access to appropriate assistive products can have a tremendous impact on community development and economic growth.\nDespite the global need and recognized benefits of assistive products, access to assistive products remains limited. Addressing this unmet need is essential to progress towards the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals and realizing the Convention of the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.\nChallenges\nDespite the growing number of people in need of assistive products in every country, many do not have the access they require. This is particularly the case in low- and middle-income countries, where access to these life-changing products has been found to be as low as 3%. These gaps exist for several reasons, including high cost and a lack of financing, availability, awareness and trained personnel.\nChallenges exist both in low- and high-income countries."}

These gaps exist for several reasons, including high cost and a lack of financing, availability, awareness and trained personnel.\nChallenges exist both in low- and high-income countries. Very few countries globally have developed a national assistive technology policy or programme and so provide assistive products through the private sector. Even in high-income countries, assistive products are often rationed or not included within health and welfare schemes, leading to high out-of-pocket payments by users and their families. People may be left to rely on erratic donations or charity services, which often means the products are of low quality or inappropriate for the person’s needs. Those who can afford them often purchase items from pharmacies, private clinics, or workshops. In these scenarios, people often are not taught how to use the product safely and lack access to follow-up appointments, which are essential to ensure that the product meets the person’s needs and that it is in good working order.\nWHO response\nWHO’s vision is that everyone, everywhere, has the right to the highest attainable standard of health."}
