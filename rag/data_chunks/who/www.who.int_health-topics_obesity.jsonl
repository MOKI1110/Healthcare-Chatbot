A body mass index (BMI) over 25 is\nconsidered overweight, and over 30 is obese. In 2019, an estimated 5\nmillion noncommunicable disease (NCD) deaths were caused by higher-than-optimal\nBMI.\nRates of overweight and obesity continue to grow in adults and\nchildren. From 1990 to 2022, the percentage of children and adolescents aged 5–19\nyears living with obesity increased four-fold from 2% to 8% globally, while the\npercentage of adults 18 years of age and older living with obesity more than\ndoubled from 7% to 16%.\nObesity is one side of the double burden of\nmalnutrition\n, and today more people are obese than underweight in every region except the South-East Asia Region. Once considered a problem only in high-income countries, today some middle-income countries have among the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity worldwide.\nComplications\nOverweight and obesity are major risk factors for a number of chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases such as heart disease and stroke, which are the leading causes of death worldwide."}

Being overweight can also lead to diabetes and its associated conditions, including blindness, limb amputations, and the need for dialysis. Rates of diabetes have quadrupled since around the world since 1980. Carrying excess weight can lead to musculoskeletal disorders including osteoarthritis. Obesity is also associated with some cancers, including endometrial, breast, ovarian, prostate, liver, gallbladder, kidney and colon. The risk of these noncommunicable diseases increases even when a person is only slightly overweight and grows more serious as the body mass index (BMI) climbs.\nObesity in childhood is associated with a wide range of serious health complications and an increased risk of premature onset of related illnesses. Studies have found that without intervention, children and adolescents with obesity will likely continue to be obese into adulthood.\nPrevention and Control\nMany of the causes of overweight and obesity are preventable and reversable."}

Although other factors are involved, the fundamental cause of obesity is an imbalance of calories consumed and calories expended. As global diets have changed in recent decades, there has been an increase in the consumption of energy-dense foods high in fat and free sugars. There has also been a decrease in physical activity due to the changing nature of many types of work, more access to transportation and increased urbanization.\nLowering the risk of overweight and obesity includes reducing the number of calories consumed from fats and sugars, increasing the portion of daily intake of fruit, vegetables, legumes, whole grains and nuts, and engaging in regular physical activity (60 minutes per day for children and 150 minutes per week for adults)."}
