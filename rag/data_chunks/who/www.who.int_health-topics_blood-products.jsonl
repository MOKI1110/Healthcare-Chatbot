Safe, effective and quality-assured blood products contribute to improving and saving millions of lives every year, as they:\naddress child mortality and maternal health;\ndramatically improve the life expectancy and quality of life of patients suffering from life-threatening inherited disorders, such as haemophilia, thalassaemia and immune deficiency, and acquired conditions such as cancer and traumatic haemorrhage; and\nsupport complex medical and surgical procedures, including transplantation.\nAn insufficient or unsafe blood supply for transfusion has a negative impact on the effectiveness of key health services and programmes to provide appropriate patient care in numerous acute and chronic conditions."}
