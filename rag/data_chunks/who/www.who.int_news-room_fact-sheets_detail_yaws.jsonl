Humans are currently believed to be the only reservoir. Transmission is from person to person.\nYaws is cured with a single oral dose of an inexpensive antibiotic called azithromycin.\nThere are 15 countries currently known to be endemic for yaws.\nOverview\nYaws forms part of a group of chronic bacterial infections commonly known as the endemic treponematoses. These diseases are caused by spiral bacteria of the genus\nTreponema\n, which also includes endemic syphilis (bejel) and pinta. Yaws is the most common of these 3 infections.\nThe organism that causes yaws,\nTreponema pallidum\nsubspecies\npertenue\n, is closely related genetically to\nT. pallidum\nsubspecies\npallidum\n, which causes syphilis, bejel and pinta.\nThe disease is found primarily in poor communities in warm, humid and tropical forest areas of Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Pacific. Most affected populations live in rural areas far from health services."}

Most affected populations live in rural areas far from health services. Poverty, low socio-economic conditions and poor personal hygiene facilitate the spread of yaws.\nScope of the problem\nAbout 75–80% of people affected by yaws are children under 15 years of age. Peak incidence occurs in children aged 6–10 years, and males and females are equally affected. Transmission is through person-to-person contact of minor injuries. The initial lesion of yaws is teemed with the bacteria. Most lesions occur on the limbs. The incubation period is 9–90 days, with an average of 21 days. Without treatment, infection can lead to chronic disfigurement and disability.\nWHO classifies countries into three epidemiological groups.\nGroup A: countries with currently known endemic status\nGroup B: previously endemic countries, with unknown current status\nGroup C: are countries with no history of yaws.\nIn 2013, 13 countries were known to be endemic with yaws."}

Since then, and through intense surveillance activities, 2 additional countries reported confirmed cases (Liberia and Philippines)\n(1)\nand 3 countries reported suspected yaws cases (Colombia, Ecuador and Haiti).\nIn 2021, a single case of yaws was reported in a 5-year-old child from Malaysia, one of the countries listed by WHO as previously endemic but current status unknown (\n2\n). Further investigations are warranted.\nOut of the countries and territories known to have been endemic in the 1950s, at least 76 fall into group B and need to be assessed to determine if the disease is still present. This can be done through integrated surveillance with other diseases, especially skin-related neglected tropical diseases.\nIn 2020, 87 877 suspected yaws cases were reported to WHO from 11 countries, but only 346 cases were confirmed in 7 countries, with the majority of cases coming from the Western Pacific Region (Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Vanuatu)."}

Over 80% of the cases were reported from the West Pacific Region, particularly Papua New Guinea, but most of the cases from this region are not laboratory confirmed.\nSigns and symptoms\nYaws initially presents as a papilloma (a wart-like tumour) teemed with bacteria, which makes clinical diagnosis straightforward. Without treatment, the papilloma will ulcerate. The diagnosis of the ulcerative form is more challenging and requires serological confirmation. Papilloma and ulcers are very infectious and in the absence of treatment can quickly spread to others."}

Papilloma and ulcers are very infectious and in the absence of treatment can quickly spread to others. Other clinical forms of yaws exist but they are not as infectious.\nSecondary yaws occurs weeks to months after the primary infection and typically presents with multiple raised yellow lesions or pain and swelling of long bones and fingers (dactylitis).\nDiagnosis\nTraditionally, laboratory-based serological tests such as\nTreponema pallidum\nparticle agglutination (TPPA) and rapid plasma reagin (RPR) are widely used to diagnose treponemal infections (for example, syphilis and yaws). These tests cannot distinguish yaws from syphilis, however, and the interpretation of results from these tests in adults who live in yaws endemic areas therefore needs careful clinical assessment. About 40% of ulcers clinically misidentified as yaws are caused by the unrelated\nH. ducreyi\nbacterium.\nTreponemal rapid tests are widely available and cheap; however, they cannot distinguish between past and current infection and therefore have limited use in monitoring interruption of transmission."}

Dual Path Platform Syphilis Screen and Confirm assay (Chembio Diagnostics, USA) can detect both past and present infection. Because of the high cost of the DPP test, initial screening of suspected yaws cases can be done by the treponemal tests and positives confirmed by the DPP. However, countries may choose to use only DPP if affordability is not a problem.\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) technology is used to definitively confirm yaws by detecting the DNA in the skin lesions. It can also be used to monitor azithromycin resistance."}

Complete clinical healing will be observed in over 95% of cases. Any individual with presumed treatment failure requires macrolide resistance testing and treatment with benzathine penicillin.\nPrevention and control\nThere is no vaccine for yaws.
