It launched a series of actions among international organizations, national governments and local communities to achieve the goal of \"Health For All\" by the year 2000 and beyond. The basic strategies for health promotion identified in the Ottawa Charter were: advocate (to boost the factors which encourage health), enable (allowing all people to achieve health equity) and mediate (through collaboration across all sectors).\nSince then, the WHO Global Health Promotion Conferences have established and developed the global principles and action areas for health promotion."}

Most recently, the 9th global conference (Shanghai 2016), titled ‘Promoting health in the Sustainable Development Goals: Health for all and all for health’, highlighted the critical links between promoting health and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Whilst calling for bold political interventions to accelerate country action on the SDGs, the Shanghai Declaration provides a framework through which governments can utilize the transformational potential of health promotion.\nStrategy\nPromoting Healthier Populations\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) provides a bold and ambitious agenda for the future.
