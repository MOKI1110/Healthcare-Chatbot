Treatment can be more complex when infections are caused by drug-resistant species.\nCandida auris is a fungal species that can be multi-drug resistant, cause invasive disease and lead to hospital outbreaks.\nOverview\nCandidiasis, also known as a yeast infection, is a fungal infection primarily caused by Candida yeasts."}

Many of these yeasts are normally present in the human body as part of the natural microbiome, or in the surrounding environment, often without causing any problems. However, when conditions allow, such as a weakened immune system or changes in the body's natural environment (e.g., due to hormonal changes, antibiotic use or other reasons), Candida can overgrow and cause an infection. Candidiasis can affect various parts of the body, leading to a range of symptoms.\nCommon types of candidiasis include vulvovaginal candidiasis (vaginal yeast infection), which affects the vagina; oral candidiasis (thrush), which affects the mouth and throat; and invasive candidiasis, which is a serious systemic infection that can affect any organ in the body. Invasive candidiasis is a significant concern in critically ill and immunocompromised patients.\nWhile generally\ntreatable\nwith antifungal medications, some types can be hard to treat."}

Invasive candidiasis is a significant concern in critically ill and immunocompromised patients.\nWhile generally\ntreatable\nwith antifungal medications, some types can be hard to treat. For example, Candida auris is a multi-drug-resistant fungal species that has been responsible for outbreaks in hospitals and long-term care facilities. Prevention and proper management are crucial to reduce the risk and spread of these infections.\nVaginal yeast infections (vulvovaginal candidiasis)\nVulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), commonly known as a vaginal yeast infection, is an infection of the vagina and vulva caused by an overgrowth of Candida yeast.\nCauses\nSeveral factors can contribute to the overgrowth of Candida in the vagina. Changes in the vagina's normal acidity, natural microbiome or hormonal balance can create an environment that encourages yeast overgrowth. Antibiotics can kill healthy bacteria in the vagina, which help maintain balance and keep yeast in check. Fluctuations in hormone levels, such as those during pregnancy, the menstrual cycle or the use of birth control pills, can increase the risk of yeast infections."}

Fluctuations in hormone levels, such as those during pregnancy, the menstrual cycle or the use of birth control pills, can increase the risk of yeast infections. Uncontrolled diabetes, leading to persistently high blood sugar levels, can also promote yeast growth. Additionally, a weakened immune system due to conditions or medications can make one more susceptible to yeast infections.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms of a vaginal yeast infection can be uncomfortable. Intense itching in the vagina and around the vulva is a common complaint. Redness and soreness of the vulva might also be experienced, accompanied by a thick, white, curd-like vaginal discharge. Painful urination and discomfort or pain during sexual intercourse can also occur. Yeast infections primarily affect the vagina and vulva and are not a typical cause of urinary tract infections.\nTreatment\nTreatment\nfor vaginal yeast infections typically involves antifungal medications. Topical treatments, such as creams, ointments or suppositories containing antifungal medications like clotrimazole, are commonly used. Prescription oral antifungal drugs, such as fluconazole, are also available."}

However, resistance to some antifungal medications is spreading and treatment does not always work.\nHome remedies should be used with caution and discussed with a health-care provider before use.\nPrevention\nWhile not officially classified as a sexually transmitted infection, sexual activity can contribute to the development of VVC. Treating male partners is generally not recommended unless they exhibit symptoms themselves.\nOral Thrush\nOral thrush is a candidiasis that occurs in the mouth and throat.\nCauses\nSeveral factors can lead to the development of oral thrush. People with compromised or immature immune systems, such as infants, older people and individuals living with HIV, are more prone to oral thrush. Antibiotics can disrupt the normal balance of microorganisms in the mouth, allowing Candida to overgrow. Steroid inhalers for asthma can also increase the risk of oral thrush."}

Additionally, ill-fitting dentures or poor oral hygiene can create an environment conducive to yeast overgrowth.\nSymptoms\nOral thrush is characterized by creamy, white lesions on the tongue, inner cheeks and gums, or hard white plaques that cannot be scraped off. Individuals may experience pain or soreness in the mouth, making it difficult to eat or swallow. Cracking and redness at the corners of the mouth, red, shiny patches on the palate or tongue, as well as altered or lost sense of taste, can also occur.\nTreatment\nTreatment for oral thrush typically involves antifungal medications. Topical treatments, such as antifungal mouthwashes or lozenges, are commonly used. Oral antifungal drugs may also be prescribed. Maintaining good oral hygiene through regular brushing and flossing can help prevent yeast overgrowth.\nThrush in babies\nThrush is a common condition in babies, especially newborns, often appearing as white patches on the tongue or inner cheeks."}

These infections are serious and require urgent intravenous antifungal therapy.\nTests and treatments also need to improve and be more widely available, especially in low- and middle-income countries.\nCandida and diet\nThere is extensive discussion about the connection between diet and candidiasis, including whether high sugar intake can cause yeast infections."}
