As a result, the medicines become\nineffective and infections persist in the body, increasing the risk of spread\nto others.\nAntimicrobials -\nincluding antibiotics, antivirals, antifungals and antiparasitics - are\nmedicines used to prevent and treat infections in humans, animals and plants.\nMicroorganisms that develop antimicrobial resistance are sometimes referred to\nas “superbugs”.\nFact sheets\nAntimicrobial resistance\nQuestions and Answers\nAntibiotic course\nOne Health\nDatabases and tool\nGlobal Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance and Use System (GLASS)\nTripartite AMR Country Self-Assessment Survey\nInitiatives and groups\nCivil Society Task Force on Antimicrobial Resistance\nGlobal Framework for Development and Stewardship to Combat Antimicrobial Resistan"}
