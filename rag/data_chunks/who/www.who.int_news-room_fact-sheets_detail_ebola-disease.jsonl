Mackenzie\nA member of the ring vaccination team vaccinates a man in Bosolo village.\n©\nCredits\nEbola disease\n24 April 2025\nKey facts\nEbola disease is a severe, often fatal illness in humans.\nThree different viruses are known to cause large Ebola disease outbreaks: Ebola virus, Sudan virus and Bundibugyo virus.\nThe average Ebola disease case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 25–90% in past outbreaks.\nEarly intensive supportive care with rehydration and the treatment of symptoms improves survival.\nApproved vaccines and treatments are only available for one of the viruses (Ebola virus) and are under development for the others.\nOutbreak control relies on a package of interventions including intensive supportive care of patients, infection prevention and control, disease surveillance and contact tracing, laboratory services, safe and dignified burials, vaccination if relevant, and social mobilization.\nOverview\nEbola disease (EBOD) is a rare but severe illness in humans\n(1)\n. It is often fatal.\nEbola disease is caused by viruses that belong to the\nOrthoebolavirus\ngenus of the\nfiloviridae\nfamily\n(2)\n."}

Six species of Orthoebolaviruses have been identified to date, with three known to cause large outbreaks:\nEbola virus (EBOV) causing Ebola virus disease (EVD)\nSudan virus (SUDV) causing Sudan virus disease (SVD)\nBundibugyo virus (BDBV) causing Bundibugyo virus disease (BVD).\nEbola disease first occurred in 1976 in two simultaneous outbreaks: one outbreak was of Sudan virus disease in Nzara in what is now South Sudan, and the other outbreak was of Ebola virus disease in Yambuku, in what is now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The latter occurred in a village near the Ebola River, from which the disease takes its name.\nWhile there are licensed vaccines and therapeutics for Ebola virus disease, there is no approved vaccine or treatment for other Ebola diseases, such as SVD or BVD. Candidate products are in development.\nEarly intensive supportive care including rehydration and treatment of specific symptoms, can improve survival."}

The virus can get into the human population when people have close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected animals such as fruit bats, chimpanzees, gorillas, monkeys, forest antelope or porcupines found ill or dead or in the rainforest.\nPeople can get infected with the virus from another person by direct contact (through broken skin or mucous membranes) with:\nthe blood or body fluids of a person who is sick with or has died from Ebola disease; and\nobjects or surfaces that have been contaminated with body fluids (like blood, feces, vomit) from a person sick with the disease or who has died from the disease.\nPeople cannot transmit the disease before they have symptoms, and they remain infectious as long as their blood contains the virus.\nHealth and care workers have frequently been infected while treati"}

This occurs through close contact with patients when infection control precautions are not strictly practiced.\nBurial ceremonies that involve direct contact with the body of a person who has died can also contribute to the transmission of Ebola disease.\nSymptoms\nThe incubation period or interval from infection to onset of symptoms varies from 2 to 21 days.\nThe symptoms of Ebola disease can be sudden and include fever, fatigue, malaise, muscle pain, headache and sore throat. These are followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain rash, and symptoms of impaired kidney and liver functions. It is important for health and care workers to be on the lookout for these symptoms.\nDespite a perception that bleeding is a common symptom, this is less frequent and can occur later in the disease. Some patients may develop internal and external bleeding, including blood in vomit and faeces, bleeding from the nose, gums and vagina."}

Risk reduction messaging should focus on several factors:\nReduce the risk of wildlife-to-human transmission from contact with infected fruit bats or monkeys/apes and the consumption of their raw meat.\nReduce the risk of human-to-human transmission arising from direct or close contact with infected people, particularly with their body fluids.
