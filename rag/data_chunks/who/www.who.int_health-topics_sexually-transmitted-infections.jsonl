Some STIs can also be transmitted during pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding and through infected blood or blood products.\nSTIs have a profound impact on health. If untreated, they can lead to serious consequences including neurological and cardiovascular disease, infertility, ectopic pregnancy, stillbirths, and increased risk of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV). They are\nalso associated with stigma, domestic violence, and affects quality of life.\nThe majority of STIs have no symptoms. When they are present common symptoms of STIs are vaginal or urethral discharge, genital ulcer and lower abdominal pain.\nThe most common and curable STIs are trichomonas, chlamydia, gonorrhoea and syphilis. Rapidly increasing antimicrobial resistance is a growing threat for untreatable gonorrhoea.\nViral STIs including HIV, genital herpes simplex virus (HSV), viral hepatitis B, human papillomavirus (HPV) and human T-lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) lack or have limited treatment options."}

Vaccines are available for hepatitis B to prevent\ninfection that can lead to liver cancer and for HPV to prevent cervical cancer. HIV, HSV and HTLV-1 are lifelong infections: for HIV and HSV there are treatments that can suppress the virus, but currently there are no cures for any of these viral STIs.\nCondoms used correctly and consistently are effective methods to protect against STIs and HIV. Screening with early diagnosis of people with STIs and their sexual partners offers the best opportunity for effective treatment and for preventing complications\nand further transmission.\nSymptoms\nA person can have an STI without having obvious symptoms of disease."}

When present, common symptoms of STIs include: abnormal vaginal discharge, urethral discharge, genital ulcers and lumps, and lower abdominal pain.\nSymptoms of specific STIs are:\nGonorrhoea and chlamydial infection\nThese STIs cause cervicitis in women, urethritis in men and extra-genital infections, including rectal and oropharyngeal manifestations. Common symptoms include vaginal or penile discharge and burning with urination. Infants of infected mothers can\ncontract neonatal conjunctivitis (red eyes) due to exposure to the STIs during vaginal delivery. Rectal and pharyngeal infections can be asymptomatic.\nSyphilis\nSyphilis is often asymptomatic, when symptoms occur, primary syphilis presents as a solitary, painless ulcer. Secondary syphilis may manifest as generalized lesions affecting skin, mucous membranes and lymph-node including a classic rash on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet."}

Results from the current Gonococcal AMR Surveillance Programme (GASP) show trends of high rates of quinolone resistance, increasing azithromycin resistance and emerging resistance of extended-spectrum cephalosporins.\nThe emergence of decreased susceptibility of gonorrhoea to extended-spectrum cephalosporins, together with established high-levels of resistance to penicillins, sulphonamides, tetracyclines, quinolones and macrolides make gonorrhoea a multidrug-resistant organism."}
