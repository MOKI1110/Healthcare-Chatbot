Most people recover on their own, but the disease can cause severe symptoms in some patients.\nOROV is a segmented single-stranded RNA virus belonging to the family\nPeribunyaviridae,\ngenus\nOrthobunyavirus\n, which was first identified in 1955 in Vega de Oropouche, Trinidad and Tobago\n(1)\n.\nThe virus is transmitted to people through the bite of an infected insect, usually biting midges but also possibly by mosquitoes. It is thus referred to as an arthropod-borne virus (arbovirus)."}

Prior to late 2023, reported cases of Oropouche virus disease were limited to South America, mostly near the Amazon rainforest, and the Caribbean. However, since December 2023, cases have been detected in other areas and have become more severe. In 2024, outbreaks have been documented outbreaks in nonendemic areas, two fatal cases with confirmed infection, and the possibility of mothers transmitting the disease to their babies while pregnant.\nDistribution and outbreaks\nOropouche virus disease was the second most common arboviral disease in South America (after dengue) before the emergence of chikungunya and Zika viruses in 2013 and 2015.\nPrior to late 2023, Oropouche virus disease was reported in Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Haiti, Panama, Peru, Trinidad and Tobago, French Guiana and Venezuela; most cases were reported near the Amazon rainforest area."}

The virus is believed to circulate in both a sylvatic cycle in forested areas, and in an urban epidemic cycle between insects and people. In the sylvatic cycle, non-human primates, sloths and perhaps birds serve as vertebrate hosts, although a definitive arthropod vector has not been identified.\nFurther studies are underway to better understand the insect vectors and transmission cycles in the current outbreaks.\nPreviously, there had been no confirmed reports of human-to-human transmission. However, there were reports in Brazil in 2024 of possible fetal infection with Oropouche virus, transmitted from mothers infected during pregnancy.\nSymptoms\nThe incubation period (the time from the bite of an infected insect to first symptoms) of the Oropouche virus is typically 3 to 10 days. Symptoms of disease include fever, headache, joint pain (arthralgia), muscle pain (myalgia), chills, nausea, vomiting and rash.\nMost cases recover completely within 7 days after the onset of symptoms. However, recovery can take weeks in some patients, and severe complications like aseptic meningitis may occasionally occur."}

Though deaths from OROV infection were not previously described, in 2024 there were two reports of deaths in previously healthy young adults with Oropouche virus infection.\nDiagnosis\nGiven the similar clinical presentation to other arboviruses like dengue and chikungunya, Oropouche virus disease is often unrecognized or misdiagnosed.\nDiagnosis of Oropouche virus disease is made by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time RT-PCR\n(9)\n. Serologic assays can be used to aid diagnosis; however, they should be conducted by highly trained personnel and in laboratories equipped with appropriate containment facilities.
