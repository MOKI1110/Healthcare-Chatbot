It also produces a toxin that damages the heart and the nerves.\nDiphtheria is a vaccine preventable disease, but multiple doses and booster doses are needed to produce and sustain immunity.\nThose who are not immunized or under immunized are at risk of the disease.\nFor unvaccinated individuals, without proper treatment, diphtheria can be fatal in around 30% of cases, with young children at higher risk of dying\n(1)\n.\nRecent diphtheria outbreaks stress the importance of sustaining high levels of vaccination coverage in communities across the life course.\nIn 2023, an estimated 84% of children worldwide received the recommended 3 doses of diphtheria-containing vaccine during infancy, leaving 16% with no or incomplete coverage. There is wide coverage variation between and within countries.\nOverview\nDiphtheria is a contagious disease that is caused by toxin producing bacteria."}

There is wide coverage variation between and within countries.\nOverview\nDiphtheria is a contagious disease that is caused by toxin producing bacteria. It can spread from person to person when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Some people may not develop disease manifestations but can still transmit the bacteria to others. Others will develop mild disease, although severe disease, complications and death can also occur.\nDiphtheria can affect anyone but was most common in unvaccinated children.\nThe diphtheria toxin causes damage to the respiratory tract and can spread throughout the body.  Common symptoms include fever, sore throat and swelling of the neck glands.\nBeing vaccinated is the best way to prevent getting sick with diphtheria or spreading it to other people."}

These setbacks have left many children susceptible to vaccine preventable diseases such as diphtheria.\nNo WHO region is completely free from diphtheria, and areas with low immunization coverage with the diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine allow the bacteria to circulate, increasing the likelihood of outbreaks and putting all unvaccinated and under vaccinated individuals at risk.\nImmunization and surveillance programs should be strengthened within primary healthcare, and efforts should be made to reach all children with 3 diphtheria toxoid-containing vaccine doses during infancy, childhood and adolescence. Countries should also implement robust surveillance systems to identify and confirm cases and close immunity gaps rapidly.\nSigns and symptoms\nSymptoms of diphtheria usually begin 2–5 days after exposure to the bacteria. Typical symptoms of the infection include a sore throat, fever, swollen neck glands and weakness."}

Typical symptoms of the infection include a sore throat, fever, swollen neck glands and weakness. Within 2–3 from infection, the dead tissue in the respiratory tract forms a thick, grey coating that can cover tissues in the nose, tonsils and throat, making it hard to breathe and swallow.\nMost severe disease and deaths from diphtheria occur as a result of the diphtheria toxin and its effects.  Complications can include inflammation of the heart and nerves. For unvaccinated individuals without adequate treatment, diphtheria can be fatal in around 30% of cases, which children younger than 5 years of age at greater risk of dying.\nWho is at risk?\nAny non-immune person (not vaccinated or under vaccinated) can become infected.\nDiphtheria has seen resurgences any time immunization coverage becomes low. Damaged health infrastructure and health services in countries experiencing or recovering from a natural disaster or conflict interrupt routine immunization."}

Damaged health infrastructure and health services in countries experiencing or recovering from a natural disaster or conflict interrupt routine immunization. Overcrowding in residential camps increases the risk of infection.\nTreatment\nThe risk of complications or death decrease considerably if appropriate treatment is provided early in the course of illness. For this reason, if diphtheria is suspected, testing to confirm the disease should be done promptly and treatment should be started as soon as possible.\nCases of diphtheria are usually treated with diphtheria antitoxin as well as antibiotics. Diphtheria specific antitoxin neutralizes circulation toxin in the blood. Detailed instructions for giving antitoxin can be found in the WHO treatment guidelines. Antibiotics stop bacterial replication and thereby toxin production, speed up getting rid of the bacteria and prevents transmission to others. However, many current strains of diphtheria have exhibited resistance to some commonly used antimicrobial drugs."}

Anyone that has had diphtheria should also receive vaccine after the acute phase of the illness is over.\nIndividuals who have been in contact with cases of diphtheria should be treated with antibiotics prophylactically to prevent illness. Their immunization status of all contacts should also be checked. If they are not fully vaccinated, they should also be offered vaccine.\nPrevention\nDiphtheria can be prevented by vaccines that are often given in combination with tetanus and pertussis and other diseases. WHO recommends a total of 6 diphtheria-containing vaccine doses be given starting at 6 weeks of age through adolescence to provide long term protection.\nCommunity-wide vaccination with high coverage as a part of routine immunization services embedded in primary health care is the most effective way to prevent diphtheria. All children should be vaccinated against diphtheria with a full primary series and 3 additional booster doses for long term protection."}
