This is the fundamental premise of primary health care (PHC).\nPrimary health care is a whole-of-society approach to effectively organize and strengthen national health systems to bring services for health and wellbeing closer to communities. It has 3 components:\nintegrated health services to meet people’s health needs throughout their lives\naddressing the broader determinants of health through multisectoral policy and action\nempowering individuals, families and communities to take charge of their own health.\nPrimary health care enables health systems to support a person’s health needs – from health promotion to disease prevention, treatment, rehabilitation, palliative care and more. This strategy also ensures that health care is delivered in a way that is centred on people’s needs and respects their preferences.\nPrimary health care is widely regarded as the most inclusive, equitable and cost-effective way to achieve universal health coverage."}

It is also key to strengthening the resilience of health systems to prepare for, respond to and recover from shocks and crises.\nImpact\nUniversal health coverage will only be possible when everyone, everywhere can access the health services they need. Communities should be empowered to identify their health priorities and contribute to finding responsive solutions. Heath care and other sectors need to work together to ensure all decisions affecting health are addressed in an integrated way."}

Heath care and other sectors need to work together to ensure all decisions affecting health are addressed in an integrated way. This includes promoting policies to protect and improve people’s health and well-being; providing information, services and infrastructure for improved water and sanitation and other environmental determinants of health; prevention of noncommunicable diseases; preparing for and responding to health emergencies; providing services for pregnant women, routine vaccination for children and sexual and reproductive health services; mental health support; platforms for community consultation and many others. Primary health care brings these factors together to ensure the highest possible level of health and well-being and their equitable distribution.\nThe impact is seen in health systems that focus on people’s needs and are as close as feasible to their everyday environment. Primary health care-oriented health systems consistently produce better outcomes, enhanced equity and improved efficiency."}

Primary health care-oriented health systems consistently produce better outcomes, enhanced equity and improved efficiency. Scaling up primary health care interventions across low- and middle-income countries could save 60 million lives and increase average life expectancy by 3.7 years by 2030.\nWHO response\nWHO supports Member States in taking a primary health care approach to accelerate progress in achieving universal health coverage. Countries are demonstrating how this strategy has been effective in strengthening their health systems to address people’s needs, both in times of crisis as in normal times.\nThe principles of primary health care were first outlined in the\nDeclaration of Alma-Ata\nin 1978, a seminal milestone in global health. Forty years later, global leaders ratified the\nDeclaration of Astana\nat the\nGlobal Conference on Primary Health Care\nwhich took place in Astana, Kazakhstan in October 2018."}
