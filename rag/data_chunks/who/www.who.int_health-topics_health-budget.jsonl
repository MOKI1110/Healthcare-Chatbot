No country has made significant progress toward UHC without increasing reliance on public revenues. Therefore, domestic tax systems that are essential to support country’s fiscal space expansion are central to the UHC agenda.\nWhile the level of revenues matter, the allocation and use of these revenues are two crucial elements in supporting effective progress toward UHC. Public Financial Management (PFM) systems are key enabling factors to support appropriate formulation, execution and accounting of government expenditure.\nIn health, countries face challenges at all stages of the PFM cycle."}

The development of multi-year plans and budgets is likely to improve predictability in the sector’s resources. If the health budget is formulated according to sector goals or outputs and the execution rules align with this logic, it will make budgets more responsive to sector needs than if the formulation follows an input-based approach.
