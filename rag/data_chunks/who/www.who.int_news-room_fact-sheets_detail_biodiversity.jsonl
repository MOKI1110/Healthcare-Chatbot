This includes diversity within species, between species and across ecosystems, representing the genetic makeup of plants, animals, microorganisms and the complexity of ecosystems.\nHealthy communities are sustained by well-functioning ecosystems, which provide critical services such as clean air, fresh water, natural medicines and food security. These ecosystems also regulate diseases and help stabilize the climate. For example, forests absorb over 2.6 billion tonnes of CO2 annually, contributing to climate regulation and reducing the incidence of diseases linked to pollution."}

However, biodiversity loss is accelerating at an unprecedented rate, with approximately 1 million species at risk of extinction, threatening these vital services and exacerbating public health risks globally.\nImpact\nPeople depend on biodiversity in many ways. Human health relies on ecosystem resources, products and services (such as fresh water, food and fuel sources; the regulation of crop pests and diseases; and the regulation of air, water and soil quality) which are needed for good health and productive livelihoods. Biodiversity loss can have significant direct health impacts if ecosystem services no longer meet societal needs.

It is estimated that the global economic impact of biodiversity loss amounts to US$ 10 trillion annually, including healthcare costs from increased disease transmission and agricultural losses from pollinator declines. For example, the decline in bee populations, which are responsible for pollinating crops worth over US$ 235 billion annually, threatens global food security and nutrition.\nThreats to biodiversity and health\nBiodiversity loss is occurring at an alarming rate, with recent estimates showing that species extinctions are currently 10 to 100 times higher than the natural baseline."}

This is largely due to human activities like deforestation, habitat fragmentation, and climate change. This loss threatens essential ecosystem services, including pollination, soil fertility, and water purification, with direct consequences for human health. For example, the degradation of wetlands, which filter freshwater, has led to a 35% decline in global wetland coverage since 1970, increasing waterborne diseases and reducing water availability for over 2 billion people.\nBiodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation are becoming major health concerns. When ecosystems are disrupted, services like clean air, water, and food can be affected.

Access to enough nutritious and varied food is a fundamental determinant of health.\nNutrition and biodiversity are interconnected at various levels, from ecosystems that provide food to the genetic diversity within species. This diversity affects the nutritional composition of food, including micronutrient availability. Healthy diets with adequate nutrient intake depend on high biodiversity.\nBiodiversity offers a genetic pool for developing resilient and sustainable food crops, livestock and marine species. It plays a crucial role in breeding varieties resistant to pests, diseases and climate extremes.
