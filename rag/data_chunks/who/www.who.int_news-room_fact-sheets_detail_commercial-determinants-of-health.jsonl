Certain countries and regions, such as Small Island Developing States and low- and middle-income countries, face greater pressure from transnational actors.\nThere are effective public health actions to respond to these determinants, which are key to building back better after COVID-19.\nOverview\nThe social determinants of health are the conditions in which people are born, grow, work, live, and age, the systems put in place to deal with illness, and the wider set of forces and systems shaping the conditions of daily life. These forces and systems include economic policies and systems, development agendas, social norms, social policies and political systems. Social determinants of health matter because addressing them not only helps prevents illness, but also promotes healthy lives and societal equity.\nCommercial determinants of health are a key social determinant, and refer to the conditions, actions and omissions by commercial actors that affect health."}

They can have beneficial or detrimental impacts on health.\nCompanies shape our physical and social environments\nCommercial activities shape the physical and social environments in which people are born, grow, work, live and age – both positively and negatively.\nFor example:\nCompany choices in the production, price-setting and targeted marketing of products, such as breast-milk substitutes, ultra-processed foods, tobacco, sugar-sweetened beverages and alcohol lead to diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes and certain cancers, as well as hypertension and obesity.\nYoung people are especially at risk of being influenced by advertisements and celebrity promotion of material."}

The emergence of non-State actors in the geopolitical arena, together with a shift in global governance, are fundamental to understanding the development of commercial determinants of health. Various authors have catalogued pathways of private sector health strategies and impact, including influencing the political environment, the knowledge environment and preference shaping.\nThere are multiple pathways that commercial actors influence health policy.
