The disease starts as a sore throat and/or skin infections caused by a bacterium called\nStreptococcus pyogenes\n(group A streptococcus) which can pass easily from person to person in the same way as other upper respiratory tract infections. Strep infections are most common in childhood.\nIn some people, this streptococcal infection causes the immune system to react against the tissues of the body including inflaming and scarring the heart valves. This is referred to as rheumatic fever. Rheumatic heart disease results from the inflammation and scarring of heart valves caused by rheumatic fever.\nRisk factors\nRheumatic fever mostly affects children and adolescents in low- and middle-income countries and in marginalized communities, including Indigenous populations, especially where poverty is widespread and access to health services is limited."}

Medications which thin the blood to reduce the risk of blood clots may also be needed. In the case of serious disease surgery may be required to repair or replace the heart valves.
