Most E.coli strains are harmless, but some can cause serious food poisoning.\nShiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) is a bacterium that can cause severe foodborne disease.\nPrimary sources of STEC outbreaks are raw or undercooked ground meat products, raw milk, and faecal contamination of vegetables.\nIn most cases, the illness is self-limiting, but it may lead to a life-threatening disease including haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS), especially in young children and the elderly.\nSTEC is heat-sensitive. In preparing food at home, be sure to follow basic food hygiene practices such as \"cook thoroughly\".\nFollowing the WHO “Five keys to safer food” is a key measure to prevent infections with foodborne pathogens such as STEC.\nOverview\nEscherichia coli\n(\nE. coli\n) is a bacterium that is commonly found in the gut of humans and warm-blooded animals. Most strains of\nE. coli\nare harmless. Some strains however, such as Shiga toxin-producing\nE. coli\n(STEC), can cause severe foodborne disease."}

It is transmitted to humans primarily through consumption of contaminated foods, such as raw or undercooked ground meat products, raw milk, and contaminated raw vegetables and sprouts.\nSTEC produces toxins, known as Shiga-toxins because of their similarity to the toxins produced by Shigella dysenteriae. STEC can grow in temperatures ranging from 7 °C to 50 °C, with an optimum temperature of 37 °C. Some STEC can grow in acidic foods, down to a pH of 4.4, and in foods with a minimum water activity (a\nW\n) of 0.95.\nSTEC is destroyed by thorough cooking of foods until all parts reach a temperature of 70 °C or higher.\nE. coli\nO157:H7 is the most important STEC serotype in relation to public health; however, other serotypes have frequently been involved in sporadic cases and outbreaks.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of the diseases caused by STEC include abdominal cramps and diarrhoea that may in some cases progress to bloody diarrhoea (haemorrhagic colitis). Fever and vomiting may also occur."}

Fever and vomiting may also occur. The incubation period can range from 3 to 8 days, with a median of 3 to 4 days. Most patients recover within 10 days, but in a small proportion of patients (particularly young children and the elderly), the infection may lead to a life-threatening disease, such as haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). HUS is characterized by acute renal failure, haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia (low blood platelets).\nIt is estimated that up to 10% of patients with STEC infection may develop HUS, with a case-fatality rate ranging from 3 to 5%. Overall, HUS is the most common cause of acute renal failure in young children. It can cause neurological complications (such as seizure, stroke and coma) in 25% of HUS patients and chronic renal sequelae, usually mild, in around 50% of survivors.\nPersons who experience bloody diarrhoea or severe abdominal cramps should seek medical care."}

Antibiotics are not part of the treatment of patients with STEC disease and may possibly increase the risk of subsequent HUS.\nSources and transmission\nMost available information on STEC relates to serotype O157:H7, since it is easily differentiated biochemically from other\nE. coli\nstrains. The reservoir of this pathogen appears to be mainly cattle. In addition, other ruminants such as sheep, goats, deer are considered significant reservoirs, while other mammals (such as pigs, horses, rabbits, dogs, and cats) and birds (such as chickens and turkeys) have been found infected.\nE. coli\nO157:H7 is transmitted to humans primarily through consumption of contaminated foods, such as raw or undercooked ground meat products and raw milk.

Examples of foods implicated in outbreaks of\nE. coli\nO157:H7 include undercooked hamburgers, dried cured salami, unpasteurized fresh-pressed apple cider, yogurt, and cheese made from raw milk.\nAn increasing number of outbreaks are associated with the consumption of fruits and vegetables (including sprouts, spinach, lettuce, coleslaw, and salad) whereby contamination may be due to contact with faeces from domestic or wild animals at some stage during cultivation or handling. STEC has also been isolated from bodies of water (such as ponds and streams), wells and water troughs, and has been found to survive for months in manure and water-trough sediments. Waterborne transmission has been reported, both from contaminated drinking-water and from recreational waters.\nPerson-to-person contact is an important mode of transmission through the oral-faecal route.
