The natural host of the virus has been identified as being\nfruit bats of the\nPteropodidae\nFamily,\nPteropus\ngenus.\nHeV was identified during the first recorded outbreak of the disease in the Brisbane suburb of Hendra, Australia, in 1994. The outbreak involved 21 stabled racehorses and two human cases. As of July 2016, 53 disease incidents involving over 70 horses have been reported. These incidents were all confined to the north-eastern coast of Australia. A total of seven humans have contracted Hendra virus\nfrom infected horses, particularly through close contact during care or necropsy of ill or dead horses\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of Hendra virus infection in humans range from mild influenza-like illness to fatal respiratory or neurological disease.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for human cases of Hendra virus."}
