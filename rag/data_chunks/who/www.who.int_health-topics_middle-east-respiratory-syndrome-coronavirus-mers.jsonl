It is a zoonotic virus, meaning it is transmitted between\nanimals and people, and it is contractable through direct or indirect contact\nwith infected animals. MERS-CoV has been identified in dromedaries in several\ncountries in the Middle East, Africa and South Asia. In total, 27 countries\nhave reported cases since 2012, leading to 858 known deaths due to the\ninfection and related complications.\nThe origins of the\nvirus are not fully understood but according to the analysis of different virus\ngenomes it is believed that it may have originated in bats and later transmitted\nto camels at some point in the distant past.\nHuman-to-human\ntransmission is possible, but only a few such transmissions have been found\namong family members living in the same household."}

In health care settings,\nhowever, human-to-human transmission appears to be more frequent.\nSymptoms\nMERS-CoV infections\nrange from showing no symptoms (asymptomatic) or mild respiratory symptoms to\nsevere acute respiratory disease and death.\nA typical\npresentation of MERS-CoV disease is fever, cough and shortness of breath.\nPneumonia is a common finding, but not always present. Gastrointestinal\nsymptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Severe illness can\ncause respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation and support in\nan intensive care unit. The virus appears to cause more severe disease in older\npeople, people with weakened immune systems and those with chronic diseases\nsuch as renal disease, cancer, chronic lung disease, and diabetes.\nApproximately 35% of\npatients with MERS-CoV have died, but this may be an overestimate of the true\nmortality rate, as mild cases of MERS may be missed by existing surveillance\nsystems."}

These people should avoid contact with camels,\ndrinking raw camel milk or camel urine, or eating meat that has not been\nproperly cooked.\nTreatment\nNo vaccine or specific treatment is currently available, although several MERS-CoV specific vaccines and treatments are in development."}

Animal products that are processed appropriately through cooking or pasteurization are safe for consumption\nbut should also be handled with care to avoid cross contamination with uncooked foods."}
