They are characterized by some degree of difficulty with social interaction and communication. Other characteristics are atypical patterns of activities and behaviours, such as difficulty\nwith transition from one activity to another, a focus on details and unusual reactions to sensations.\nThe abilities and needs of autistic people vary and can evolve over time. While some people with autism can live independently, others have severe disabilities and require life-long care and support. Autism often has an impact on education and employment\nopportunities. In addition, the demands on families providing care and support can be significant. Societal attitudes and the level of support provided by local and national authorities are important factors determining the quality of life of\npeople with autism.\nCharacteristics of autism may be detected in early childhood, but autism is often not diagnosed until much later.\nPeople with autism often have co-occurring conditions, including epilepsy, depression, anxiety and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder."}

The level of intellectual\nfunctioning among autistic people varies widely, extending from profound impairment to superior levels.\nEpidemiology\nIt is estimated that worldwide in 2021 about 1 in 127 persons had autism\n(1)\n. This estimate represents an average figure, and reported prevalence varies substantially across studies. Some well-controlled studies have, however, reported figures that are substantially\nhigher. The prevalence of autism in many low- and middle-income countries is unknown.\nCauses\nAvailable scientific evidence suggests that there are probably many factors that make a child more likely to have autism, including environmental and genetic factors. Scientific studies show that exposure to certain environmental factors appear to occur more frequently in children with autism, or their parents."}

Scientific studies show that exposure to certain environmental factors appear to occur more frequently in children with autism, or their parents. These include advanced parental age, maternal diabetes during pregnancy, prenatal exposure to air pollutants or certain heavy metals, prematurity, severe birth complications and low birth weight.\nIn addition, research studies have looked into possible association between use of various medicine during pregnancy and increased risk for autism. For example, prenatal exposure to valproate and carbamazepine, which are used for seizures, appear to occur more frequently in children with autism.\nMore research is needed to better understand the role of each of the factors that appear to be associated with a higher risk for autism, and how they interact with genetic variations.\nExtensive research using a variety of different methods and conducted over many years has demonstrated that the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine does not cause autism (2,3).

Extensive research into the preservative thiomersal and the additive aluminium that are contained in some vaccines strongly concluded that these constituents in childhood vaccines do not increase the risk of autism.\nAssessment and care\nA broad range of interventions, from early childhood and across the life span, can optimize the development, health, well-being and quality of life of autistic people.
