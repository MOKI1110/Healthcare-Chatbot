Mosquito nets (and/or insecticide-treated nets) will also provide additional protection to people sleeping during the day, or protect against other mosquitoes which can bite at night (such as malaria). Household insecticides aerosols, mosquito coils or other insecticide vaporizers maybe also reduce biting activity.\n©\nCredits\nVector-borne diseases\n26 September 2024\nKey facts\nVector-borne diseases account for more than 17% of all infectious diseases, causing more than 700 000 deaths annually. They can be caused by either parasites, bacteria or viruses.\nMalaria is a parasitic infection transmitted by\nAnopheline\nmosquitoes. It causes an estimated 249 million cases globally, and results in more than 608 000 deaths every year. Most of the deaths occur in children under the age of 5 years.\nDengue is the most prevalent viral infection transmitted by\nAedes\nmosquitoes."}

Most of the deaths occur in children under the age of 5 years.\nDengue is the most prevalent viral infection transmitted by\nAedes\nmosquitoes. More than 3.9 billion people in over 132 countries are at risk of contracting dengue, with an estimated 96 million symptomatic cases and an estimated 40 000 deaths every year.\nOther viral diseases transmitted by vectors include chikungunya fever, Zika virus fever, yellow fever, West Nile fever, Japanese encephalitis (all transmitted by mosquitoes), tick-borne encephalitis (transmitted by ticks) and Oropouche fever (transmitted by Culicoides flies)\nMany of vector-borne diseases are preventable through protective measures and community mobilization.\nOverview\nVectors are living organisms that can transmit infectious pathogens between humans, or from animals to humans. Many of these vectors are bloodsucking insects which ingest disease-producing microorganisms during a blood meal from an infected host (human or animal) and later transmit it into a new host, after the pathogen has replicated."}

Often, once a vector becomes infectious, they are capable of transmitting the pathogen for the rest of their life during each subsequent bite/blood meal.\nVector-borne diseases\nVector-borne diseases are human illnesses caused by parasites, viruses and bacteria that are transmitted by vectors. Every year there are more than 700 000 deaths from diseases such as malaria, dengue, schistosomiasis, human African trypanosomiasis, leishmaniasis, Chagas disease, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis and onchocerciasis.\nThe burden of these diseases is highest in tropical and subtropical areas, and they disproportionately affect the poorest populations. Since 2014, major outbreaks of dengue, malaria, chikungunya, yellow fever and Zika have afflicted populations, claimed lives, and overwhelmed health systems in many countries."}

Other diseases such as chikungunya, leishmaniasis and lymphatic filariasis cause chronic suffering, life-long morbidity, disability and occasional stigmatization.\nDistribution of vector-borne diseases is determined by a complex set of demographic, environmental and social factors. Global travel and trade, unplanned urbanization, climate change and silent spread and adaptation of the vectors have all contributed to the spread of vector-borne diseases.\nClimate change substantially affects pathogens (parasites, viruses and bacteria), vectors, and reservoir hosts, with implications for the transmission of many vector-borne diseases. Several vectors have expanded their latitude and altitude ranges, and the length of the season during which they are active is increasing."}
