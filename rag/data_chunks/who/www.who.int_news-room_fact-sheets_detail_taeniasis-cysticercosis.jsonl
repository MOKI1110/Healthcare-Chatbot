Three parasite species cause taeniasis in humans, Taenia solium, Taenia saginata and Taenia asiatica. Only T. solium causes major health problems.\nT. solium taeniasis is acquired by humans through the ingestion of the parasite's larval cysts (cysticerci) in undercooked and infected pork.\nHuman tapeworm carriers excrete tapeworm eggs in their faeces and contaminate the environment when they defecate in open areas.\nHumans can also become infected with T. solium eggs due to poor hygiene (via the fecal-oral route) or ingesting contaminated food or water.\nIngested T. solium eggs develop to larvae (called cysticerci) in various organs of the human body. When they enter the central nervous system, they can cause neurological symptoms (neurocysticercosis), including epileptic seizures.\nT. solium is the cause of 30% of epilepsy cases in many endemic areas where people and roaming pigs live in close proximity."}

The larvae (cysticerci) may develop in the muscles, skin, eyes and the central nervous system. When cysts develop in the brain, the condition is referred to as neurocysticercosis\n(NCC). Symptoms include severe headache, blindness, convulsions and epileptic seizures and can be fatal.\nNeurocysticercosis is the most frequent preventable cause of epilepsy worldwide and is estimated to cause 30% of all epilepsy cases in countries where the parasite is endemic.
