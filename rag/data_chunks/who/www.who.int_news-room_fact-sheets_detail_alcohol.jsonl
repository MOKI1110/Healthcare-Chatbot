Of these, 1.6 million deaths were from noncommunicable diseases, 700 000 deaths from injuries and 300 000 deaths from communicable diseases.\nThe alcohol-attributable mortality was heaviest among men, accounting for 2 million deaths compared to 600 000 deaths among women, in 2019.\nAn estimated 400 million people, or 7% of the world’s population aged 15 years and older, lived with alcohol use disorders."}

Alcohol has been widely used in many cultures for centuries, but it is associated with significant health risks and harms.\nWorldwide, 2.6 million deaths were attributable to alcohol consumption in 2019, of which 2 million were among men and 0.6 million among women."}
