In at least 1 billion of these, vision impairment could have been prevented or is yet to be addressed.\nThe leading causes of vision impairment and blindness at a global level are refractive errors and cataracts.\nIt is estimated that globally only 36% of people with a distance vision impairment due to refractive error and only 17% of people with vision impairment due to cataract have received access to an appropriate intervention.\nVision impairment poses an enormous global financial burden, with the annual global cost of productivity estimated to be US$ 411 billion.\nVision loss can affect people of all ages; however, most people with vision impairment and blindness are over the age of 50 years.\nOverview\nVision, the most dominant of our senses, plays a critical role in every facet and stage of our lives."}

We take vision for granted, but without vision, we struggle to learn, to walk, to read, to participate in school and to work.\nVision impairment occurs when an eye condition affects the visual system and its vision functions. Everyone, if they live long enough, will experience at least one eye condition in their lifetime that will require appropriate care.\nVision impairment has serious consequences for the individual across the life course. Many of these consequences can be mitigated by timely access to quality eye care. Eye conditions that can cause vision impairment and blindness – such as cataract or refractive error – are, for good reasons, the main focus of eye care strategies; nevertheless, the importance of eye conditions that do not typically cause vision impairment – such as dry eye or conjunctivitis – must not be overlooked."}

In at least 1 billion – or almost half – of these cases, vision impairment could have been prevented or has yet to be addressed.\nAmong this 1 billion people, the main conditions causing distance vision impairment or blindness are cataract (94 million), refractive error (88.4 million), age-related macular degeneration (8 million), glaucoma (7.7 million), diabetic retinopathy (3.9 million)\n(1)\n."}

With regards to near vision, rates of unaddressed near vision impairment are estimated to be greater than 80% in western, eastern and central sub-Saharan Africa, while comparative rates in high-income regions of North America, Australasia, western Europe, and of Asia-Pacific are reported to be lower than 10%\n(2)\n.\nPopulation growth and ageing are expected to increase the risk that more people acquire vision impairment.\nImpact of vision impairment\nPersonal impact\nYoung children with early onset irreversible severe vision impairment can experience delayed motor, language, emotional, social and cognitive development, with lifelong consequences."}

While many vision loss cases can be prevented (such as those due to infections, trauma, unsafe traditional medicines, perinatal diseases, nutrition-related diseases, unsafe use or self-administration of topical treatment), this is not possible for all. For many eye conditions, e.g. diabetic retinopathy, early detection and timely treatment are crucial to avoid irreversible vision loss. Spectacle correction for refractive error and surgery for cataract are among the most cost-effective of all health-care interventions."}
