The disease causes red blood cells to become rigid and sickle-shaped, leading to blockages in blood flow and subsequent pain and organ damage. SCD is most common in individuals of African, Mediterranean, Middle Eastern, and Indian descent. The disease manifests in various forms, with sickle-cell anaemia being the most severe. Early diagnosis is crucial for managing the disease and preventing complications. Treatment focuses on alleviating symptoms and preventing crises, with advanced therapies like gene therapy offering hope for a cure.\nCauses and risk factors\nSCD is caused by a mutation in the HBB gene, which provides instructions for making haemoglobin. This mutation leads to the production of abnormal haemoglobin known as haemoglobin S."}

This mutation leads to the production of abnormal haemoglobin known as haemoglobin S. When a person inherits two copies of the haemoglobin S gene (one from each parent), they develop SCD. Individuals with one normal haemoglobin gene and one haemoglobin S gene have sickle-cell trait (SCT) and usually do not exhibit symptoms but can pass the gene to their offspring.\nSymptoms\nPain episodes (crises): sudden, severe pain due to blocked blood flow. These episodes can last for hours to days and can be severe enough to require hospitalization.\nAnaemia: caused by the rapid breakdown of sickle-cells, leading to fatigue, weakness, and shortness of breath.\nSwelling: particularly in the hands and feet, known as dactylitis, which is often the first symptom in babies.\nFrequent infections: due to spleen damage, which makes patients more susceptible to infections such as pneumonia.\nDelayed growth: in children and adolescents, due to chronic anaemia and other complications.\nVision problems: caused by blocked blood vessels in the eyes, which can lead to damage to the retina.\nDiagnosis\nSic"}

These tests look for the abnormal hemoglobin (HbS) that characterizes the disease. Additional tests, such as haemoglobin electrophoresis, can confirm the diagnosis and determine the specific type of SCD. Early diagnosis, such as through newborn screening, is essential for managing the disease and preventing severe complications.\nTreatment\nWhile there is no universal cure for SCD, various treatments can help manage symptoms and reduce complications:\nPreventive care:\nroutine vaccinations (pneumococcal, Haemophilus influenzae, hepatitis B)\nfolic acid supplements.\nDisease-modifying therapy:\nhydroxyurea: a medication that reduces the frequency of pain crises and the need for blood transfusions by increasing the production of fetal haemoglobin, which prevents the sickling of red blood cells;\npain management: using medications like acetaminophen, ibuprofen, and opioids to relieve pain during crises; and\nblood transfusions: to treat"}
