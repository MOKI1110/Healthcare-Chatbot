Since then there have been incredible advances in drugs for a wide range of health concerns including disease, mental health and other conditions. Today there are thousands of drugs\non the market able to prevent, treat and lessen the impact of ailments that would have been fatal just a few generations ago. At the same time, antimicrobial resistance is challenging the effectiveness of many commonly used medicines in one of the\nmost concerning threats to global health today.\nAccess to appropriate medications is shown to have substantial impacts on community health and the related economic indicators. Quality-assured, safe and effective medicines, vaccines and medical\ndevices are fundamental to a functioning health system. However, globalized trade can undermine regulation, and in resource-limited settings especially, incidence of substandard or falsified medicines is growing."}

The first is regulatory issues, which can\naffect how medicines are bought to market, create lag times and cause the\nsupply of medicines in some areas of the globe to be delayed long after they\nare available elsewhere. High prices, misuse of drugs and poor or unreliable\ndrug quality contribute to this issue. Price has long been a barrier in poor\ncountries, but because of sharp increases in recent years, this issue is\nspreading to some wealthy countries as well.\nThe price of medicine remains the largest impediment to\naccess and the economic impact of pharmaceuticals is substantial."}
