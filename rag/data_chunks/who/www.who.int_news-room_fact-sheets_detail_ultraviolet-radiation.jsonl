Sun protection is recommended when the ultraviolet index is 3 and above.\nOverview\nUltraviolet radiation (UVR) can neither be seen nor felt. While some people are exposed to artificial UVR sources (e.g. in medicine, industry and for disinfection and cosmetic purposes), everyone is exposed to solar UVR. Solar UVR levels are influenced by several factors:\nSun elevation: the higher the sun in the sky, the higher the UVR level."}

Solar UVR levels are influenced by several factors:\nSun elevation: the higher the sun in the sky, the higher the UVR level. UVR levels vary with time of day and time of year.\nLatitude: the closer to the equator, the higher the UVR levels.\nAltitude: UVR levels increase with altitude as the air is thinner and less UVR is absorbed.\nCloud cover: UVR levels are highest under cloudless skies but can be high even with cloud cover.\nOzone: ozone absorbs part of the UVR from the sun. Less ozone means more UVR reaches the Earth's surface.\nReflection: reflective surfaces, such as water, sand and fresh snow, increase the UVR level.\nClimate change, including through variations in ozone and cloud cover, is expected to impact UVR levels at the Earth’s surface.\nHealth effects\nSmall amounts of UVR are beneficial to health and play an essential role in the production of vitamin D."}

However, excessive exposure to UVR is associated with negative health consequences as UVR is carcinogenic to humans.\nEffects on the skin\nAcute effects of UVR include DNA damage, sunburn, phototoxic and photoallergic reactions, and suppression of the immune system. Immunosuppression can be considered as a risk factor for cancer and can cause reactivation of viruses (e.g. cold sores in the lip).\nChronic effects on skin and lips from UVR exposure include:\ncutaneous melanoma: a life-threatening malignant skin cancer;\nsquamous cell carcinoma (SCC): a malignant cancer, which generally spreads less than melanoma and is less likely to cause death;\nbasal cell carcinoma (BCC): a slow-growing skin cancer appearing predominantly in older people; and\npremature skin aging: a loss of skin elasticity at a young age with decreased wound healing.\nExcessive exposure to UVR caused around 1.2 million new cases of non-melanoma skin cancers (SCC and BCC) and 325 000 melanomas of the skin, and 64 000 prematur"}

These effects are reversible, easily prevented by protective eyewear and are not usually associated with any long-term damage but are painful and might require therapeutic intervention.\nChronic effects of UVR include:\ncataract (an eye disease where the lens becomes increasingly opaque, resulting in impaired vision and eventual blindness);\npterygium (growth of fleshy tissue which can cover part of the cornea); and\ncancer in and around the eye (basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and melanoma).\nUV exposure may also be involved in the development of age-related macular degeneration (AMD).\nWorldwide, it is estimated that 15 million people are blind due to cataracts; of these, some 10% may be due to exposure to UVR.\nVitamin D production\nUVR in small amounts i"}

Vitamin D strengthens the bone and musculoskeletal system. People who have very low sun exposure – such as those in institutional care or housebound, people with deeply pigmented skin living in high latitudes or those who, for religious or cultural reasons cover their entire body surface when they are outdoors – should consider oral vitamin D supplementation.\nPeople at particular risk\nChildren and adolescents are particularly vulnerable to the harmful effects of UVR due to their skin and eye structure. Sunburns in childhood lead to a higher risk of skin cancer in later life. Also, a larger amount of UVR can reach and damage their retina.\nFair-skinned people suffer more from sunburn and have a higher risk of skin cancer than dark-skinned people; however, darker-skinned people also develop skin cancers."}

WHO recommends the following measures to protect against excessive exposure to UVR.\nLimit time in the midday sun.\nSeek shade.\nWear protective clothing.\nWear a broad brimmed hat to protect the eyes, face, ears and neck.\nWear wraparound-style sunglasses that provide 99 to 100% UV-A and UV-B protection.\nUse broad-spectrum sunscreen on skin areas that cannot be covered by clothes. Sun protection is best achieved by seeking shade and wearing clothes rather than applying sunscreens. Sunscreens should not be used for extending time spent in the sun.\nAvoid use of artificial tanning devices."}
