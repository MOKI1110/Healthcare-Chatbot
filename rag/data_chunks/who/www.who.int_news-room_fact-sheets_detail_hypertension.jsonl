It is common but can be serious if not treated.\nPeople with high blood pressure may not feel symptoms."}

In addition, there are environmental risk factors for hypertension and associated diseases, where air pollution is the most significant.\nNon-modifiable risk factors include a family history of hypertension, age over 65 years and co-existing diseases such as diabetes or kidney disease.\nSymptoms\nMost people with hypertension don’t feel any symptoms."}

The publication provides evidence-based recommendations for the initiation of treatment of hypertension, and recommended intervals for follow-up. The document also includes target blood pressure to be achieved for control, and information on who, in the health-care system, can initiate treatment.\nTo support governments in strengthening the prevention and control of cardiovascular disease, WHO and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (U.S. CDC) launched the\nGlobal Hearts Initiative\nin September 2016, which includes the HEARTS technical package."}
