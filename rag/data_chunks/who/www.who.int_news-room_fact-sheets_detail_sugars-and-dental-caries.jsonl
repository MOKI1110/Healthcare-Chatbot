It is prevalent throughout the life course and affects both permanent teeth and deciduous (first) teeth It is estimated that there are 2 billion people with permanent teeth with caries and 510 million children with deciduous teeth with caries.\nConsumption of free sugars is a major risk factor for overweight, obesity and dental caries. Dental caries can be prevented by avoiding dietary free sugars. Simple and cost-effective interventions are available to help people reduce their sugars consumption, and prevent dental caries. Simple, minimally invasive treatment for caries can be provided in primary health-care settings, without the need of a dental chair or specialist equipment.\nSevere dental caries can lead to tooth loss and impair quality of life."}

The consequences of untreated dental caries include:\nphysical symptoms such pain, discomfort or chronic systemic infection;\nfunctional limitations such as challenges eating, speaking, breathing or sleeping; and\ndetrimental impacts on emotional, mental and social well-being.\nDental caries affects all age groups, and can start  with the eruption of the first teeth (deciduous teeth). The condition increases in prevalence in adulthood. In children, dental caries often leads to  absence from school. For adults, dental caries is associated with absence from work, and may negatively affect employment opportunities and reduce productivity.\nIn low-income settings, the majority of dental caries goes untreated. Teeth affected by caries are often extracted (pulled out) when they cause pain or infection. Prevention and treatment for dental caries is usually not part of national health benefit packages."}

Improving integration of oral health care services in primary health care and health benefit packages would improve access to prevention and management of oral diseases that better respond to the needs of populations.\nThe total direct expenditure for oral diseases among WHO’s 194 Member States amounted to US$ 387 billion or a global average of about US$ 50 per capita in 2019. This represents about 4.8% of global direct health expenditures.

Dental caries results when plaque forms on the surface of a tooth and converts the free sugars (all sugars added to foods and beverages by the manufacturer, cook or consumer, plus sugars naturally present in honey, syrups and fruit juices) contained in foods and beverages into acids that destroy the tooth over time. A continued high intake of free sugars, inadequate exposure to fluoride and a lack of removal of plaque by toothbrushing with fluoride toothpaste containing 1000-1500 ppm concentration can lead to dental caries.\nThe burden of dental caries is also influenced by social determinants of health, which comprise the social, economic and political conditions that influence oral diseases, including access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene. There is a strong and consistent association between socioeconomic status and the prevalence and severity of dental caries."}
