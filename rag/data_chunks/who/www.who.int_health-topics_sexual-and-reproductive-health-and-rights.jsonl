In everyday life, this means that people are able to have satisfying and safe sex lives, to have healthy pregnancies and births, and decide if, when and how often to have children.\nAccess to sexual and reproductive health services is a human right and should be available to all people throughout their lives, as part of ensuring universal health coverage. This not only contributes to improved health outcomes, but also to gender equality and wider development.\nImpact\nEnsuring access to comprehensive sexual and reproductive health services upholds the dignity, rights and well-being of people worldwide."}

When people have control over their sexuality and reproduction, they can fully participate in social, economic and political spheres.\nInvesting in a package of sexual and reproductive health services (including family planning, maternal and newborn care, and treatment for curable sexually transmitted infections) that fully meets the needs of all people has been shown to provide multiple health, social and economic benefits including significant decreases in unintended pregnancies, unsafe abortions and maternal deaths.\nWhen sexual and reproductive health services are absent, there are serious negative impacts. Stopping evidence-supported and time-tested public health programmes destabilizes the health, economics and security of communities.\nWHO response\nAdvancing comprehensive sexual and reproductive health coverage requires political commitment and well-defined, coherent strategies for ensuring progress."}
