All antiretroviral drugs, including those from newer drug classes, are at risk of becoming partially or fully inactive due to the emergence of drug-resistant virus. If not prevented, HIV drug resistance can jeopardize the efficacy of medicines used to treat HIV\n(1)\n, resulting in increased numbers of HIV infections and HIV-associated morbidity and mortality\n(2)\n.\nScope of the problem\nSurveillance of HIV drug resistance provides countries with evidence that can be used to optimize patient- and population-level treatment outcomes."}
