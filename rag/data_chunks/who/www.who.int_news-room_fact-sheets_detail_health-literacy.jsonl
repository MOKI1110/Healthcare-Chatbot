It includes the ability to think critically about, as well as the ability to interact and express personal and societal needs for promoting health.\nWHO defines\nhealth literacy as “representing the personal knowledge and competencies that accumulate through daily activities, social interactions and across generations. Personal knowledge and competencies are mediated by the organizational structures and availability of resources that enable people to access, understand, appraise, and use information and services in ways that promote and maintain good health and well-being for themselves and those around them.”\nWhy is it important to improve health literacy?\nHealth literacy requires inclusive and equitable access to quality education and life-long learning."}

Health literacy is shaped by a wide range of societal factors and is, therefore, not the sole responsibility of individuals to develop and maintain. All information providers, including government, civil society and health services should enable access to trustworthy information in a form that is understandable and actionable for all people. These social resources for health literacy include regulation of the information environment and media (oral, print, broadcast and digital) in which people obtain access to and use health information.\nBy improving people’s access to understandable and trustworthy health information and their capacity to use it effectively, health literacy is critical to both empowering people to make decisions about personal health, and in enabling their engagement in collective health promotion action to address the determinants of health.\nSocial benefits to high health literacy rates\nImproving health literacy in populations provides the foundation on which citize"}

These differences, fuelled by disparities, can impact whether people can easily develop and use health literacy, and whether they have access to quality and trustworthy information and services. It is important to consider these disparities when developing health policies and allocating resources. Even people who read well and are comfortable using numbers can face health literacy issues when:\nthey aren’t familiar with medical terms or how their bodies work;\nthey must interpret statistics and evaluate risks and benefits that affect their health and safety;\nthey are diagnosed with a serious illness and are scared and confused;\nthey are under stress and have to make important health decisions;\nthey have health conditions that require complicated self-care; or\nthey are voting on an issue affecting the community’s health and relying on unfamiliar technical information, which can further exacerbate gender and health equity issues.\nThis makes health literacy an important determinant of healt"}

Reporting systems enable the creation of population data, and this evidence can be used to inform decisions at all levels, including for individuals, populations, capacity building of professionals, and systems.
