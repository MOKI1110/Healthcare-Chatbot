An\nestimated 144 million children under age 5 are stunted, 47 million are wasted\nand 38.3 million have overweight or obesity. Around 45% of deaths among\nchildren under 5 years of age are linked to undernutrition.\nMeasuring the growth of infants and children is an important part of child\nhealth surveillance. Inadequate infant growth due to poor nutrition leads to\nunder-nutrition in children in many low- and middle-income countries, which, if\nfollowed later in life by an increased intake of calories, can result in\noverweight or obesity.\nThe WHO\nChild Growth\nStandards are a diagnostic\ntool used to monitor and assess the nutritional status of infants and young\nchildren worldwide. By tracking children’s height and body weight, the\nstandards detect children or populations not growing properly, or who are underweight\nor at risk of overweight, and who may require specific health services or\npublic health responses.\nThe WHO Child Growth Standards have charts for boys and girls separated,\ncovering age birth to 5 years."}

Stunting is a contributing\nrisk factor to child mortality and is also a marker of inequalities in human\ndevelopment. Child overweight refers to a child who is too heavy for his or her\nheight. This form of malnutrition usually results from expending too few calories\nfor the amount of food consumed or from endocrine disbalances, and it increases\nthe risk of noncommunicable diseases later in life. Child wasting refers to a\nchild who is too thin for his or her height and is the result of recent rapid\nweight loss or the failure to gain weight."}

A child who is moderately or\nseverely wasted has an increased risk of death, but treatment is possible.\nChildhood wasting and overweight are both forms of malnutrition and can\ncoexist in a population.
