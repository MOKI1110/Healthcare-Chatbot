It has intrinsic and instrumental value and is integral to our well-being.\nAt any one time, a diverse set of individual, family, community and structural factors may combine to protect or undermine mental health. Although most people are resilient, people who are exposed to adverse circumstances – including poverty, violence, disability and inequality – are at higher risk of developing a mental health condition.\nMany mental health conditions can be effectively treated at relatively low cost, yet health systems remain significantly under-resourced and treatment gaps are wide all over the world. Mental health care is often poor in quality when delivered."}

They can result from or lead to problems at school and at work.\nGlobally, mental disorders account for 1 in 6 years lived with disability.
