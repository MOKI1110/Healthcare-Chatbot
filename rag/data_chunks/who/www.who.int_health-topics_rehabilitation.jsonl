Rehabilitation expands the focus of health beyond\npreventative and curative care to ensure people with a health condition can\nremain as independent as possible and participate in education, work and\nmeaningful life roles. Anyone may need rehabilitation at some point in their\nlives, whether they have experienced an injury, disease, illness, or because\ntheir functioning has declined with age.\nGlobally, 1 in 3 people today are estimated to be living\nwith a health condition that would benefit from rehabilitation. This need is\npredicted to increase in the coming years due to changes in the health and characteristics\nof the population. For example, people are living longer but with more chronic\ndisease and disability. Emergencies, including conflicts, disasters and\noutbreaks can all create surges in rehabilitation needs."}

Globally, many people\nare living with mid- and long-term consequences of COVID-19 and may be in need\nof rehabilitation to support their recovery from the disease.\nImpact\nAlthough the need for rehabilitation is increasing\nglobally, many countries are unequipped to respond to existing needs. In some\nlow- and middle-income countries, more than 50% of people do not receive the\nrehabilitation services they require. Rehabilitation services are often under\nfunded and under valued, particularly in countries without strong health\nsystems.\nRehabilitation helps to reduce the impacts of disease and\ninjury on individuals, while also complimenting other health interventions. This\nmeans it can be seen as an investment in health care costs because it can lower\nlong term reliance on health systems through reducing hospitalization, shortening\nhospital stays and preventing readmissions."}

The investment pays off further by enabling\npeople to return to work, education and other pursuits more quickly following the\nhealth issue.\nRehabilitation is a neglected but essential part of emergency\nresponse and long-term recovery. Emergencies disproportionately effect weaker\nhealth systems and the most vulnerable, but early and ongoing access to\nrehabilitation reduces complications, optimizes functioning and reduces\ndisability in those affected, supporting individuals, families and communities\nin their recovery.\nWHO response\nWHO views rehabilitation as an essential part of achieving both\nuniversal health coverage and goal 3 of the\nSustainable Development Goals\n."}

To\nthis end, WHO works to make rehabilitation part of health care at all levels\nthrough efforts to strengthen health systems as a whole.\nIn 2017 WHO launched the\nRehabilitation 2030\ninitiative\n, which emphasizes the need for concerted and coordinated action\nby all stakeholders to strengthen the health system to provide quality and\ntimely rehabilitation. This occurs through actions such as improving leadership\nand governance; developing a strong multidisciplinary rehabilitation workforce;\nexpanding financing for rehabilitation; and improving data collection and\nresearch on rehabilitation. In emergencies, we are developing tools to help\nstrengthen rehabilitation preparedness, while also working to better integrate\nrehabilitation into responses.\nWHO continues to support countries to implement these\nactions through providing technical support, developing guidance and practical\ntools, and increasing the development of robust evidence for rehabilitation."}
