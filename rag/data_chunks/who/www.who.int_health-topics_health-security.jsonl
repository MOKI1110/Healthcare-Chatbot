New diseases, like COVID-19, are emerging at unprecedented rates disrupting people’s health\nand causing social and economic impacts. Billions of passengers travel on airplanes each year, increasing the opportunities for the rapid international spread of infectious agents and their vectors.\nDependence on chemicals has increased, as has awareness of the potential hazards for health and the environment, like climate change and air pollution. As the globalization of food production increases, so does the risk of tainted ingredients and\nrisk of foodborne diseases."}
