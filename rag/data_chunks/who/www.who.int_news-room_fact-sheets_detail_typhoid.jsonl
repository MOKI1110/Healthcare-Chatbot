It is usually spread through contaminated food or water. Once\nSalmonella\nTyphi bacteria are ingested, they multiply and spread into the bloodstream.\nUrbanization and climate change have the potential to increase the global burden of typhoid. In addition, increasing resistance to antibiotic treatment is making it easier for typhoid to spread in communities that lack access to safe drinking water or adequate sanitation.\nSymptoms\nSalmonella\nTyphi lives only in humans. Persons with typhoid fever carry the bacteria in their bloodstream and intestinal tract. Symptoms include prolonged high fever, fatigue, headache, nausea, abdominal pain, and constipation or diarrhoea. Some patients may have a rash. Severe cases may lead to serious complications or even death. Typhoid fever can be confirmed through blood testing.\nEpidemiology, risk factors and disease burden\nImproved living conditions and the introduction of antibiotics resulted in a drastic reduction of typhoid fever morbidity and mortality in industrialized countries."}

Antimicrobial resistance is common with likelihood of more complicated and expensive treatment options required in the most affected regions.\nEven when the symptoms go away, people may still be carrying typhoid bacteria, meaning they can spread it to others, through shedding of bacteria in their faeces.\nIt is important for people being treated for typhoid fever to do the following:\nTake prescribed antibiotics for as long as the doctor has prescribed.\nWash their hands with soap and water after using the bathroom and avoid preparing or serving food for other people. This will lower the chance of passing the infection on to someone else.\nHave their doctor test to ensure that no\nSalmonella\nTyphi bacteria remain in their body.\nPrevention\nTyphoid fever is common in places with poor sanitation and a lack of safe drinking water."}
