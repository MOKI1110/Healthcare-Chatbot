Paediatric cases are of particular concern related to animal bite injuries, with over half of the victims being children.\nWhile numerous animal species have the potential to bite humans, incidents involving domestic animals are significantly more prevalent than those involving wildlife, and subsequent infections from wounds can lead to severe illness or even death."}

In the United States of America for example, approximately 4.5 million people are bitten by dogs every year. Low- and middle-income country data are more fragmented, however some studies reveal that dogs account for 76–94% of animal bite injuries.\nDog bite fatality rates are higher in low- and middle-income countries than in high-income countries because dog-mediated\nrabies\nviral infection, and there may be a lack of post-exposure treatment and appropriate access to health care.

While rabies is vaccine preventable and post-exposure prophylaxis can be administered soon after exposure to save lives, once signs of rabies appear, there is no treatment and the consequences are fatal.\nWho is most at risk?\nChildren are the largest percentage of people bitten by dogs, with the majority in their mid-to-late childhood. The risk of injury to the head and neck is greater in children than in adults, adding to increased severity, necessity for medical treatment and death rates.\nIn some countries, males have a higher frequency of dog bites than females. Dog bites account for over 50% of animal-related injuries in travellers. Provoked bites are often due to attempts to feed or handle animals, whereas unprovoked bites often are associated with infectious stages of rabies.\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the location of the bite, the overall health condition of the bitten person and whether the dog is vaccinated against rabies."}

In Italy, the incidence of cat-related injuries is 18 per 100 000 population; while in the United States cat bites result in 66 000 emergency departments visits yearly. Cat bites are associated with rabies viral infections and several bacterial infections related to bartonella, brucella, leptospira, and campylobacter species. The likelihood of a cat bite becoming infected is double of that of a dog bite.\nMonkey bites:\nMonkey bites account for 2–21% of animal bite injuries.

Monkey bites are associated with rabies, simian retroviruses, herpes B virus, and\nmpox\ninfections, as well as bacterial infections related to salmonella and campylobacter species.\nBat bites:\nBats are a reservoir for rabies virus worldwide and their bites might not leave recognizable marks making it challenging to determine the risk of exposure. While there are no worldwide estimates on bat bites, bats are the leading cause of rabies deaths in the United States. In Latin America, the risk of bites from hematophagous bats poses the risk of rabies for humans.\nRodent and other wildlife bites:\nRats, mice, squirrels, chipmunks and ferrets are commonly associated with bite injuries. Rabies is relatively rare in domestic rodents; however, the bite injuries may lead to bacterial infections of leptospira, salmonella species and hantavirus infections.\nBites by raccoons, skunks, and foxes are often associated with rabies exposure in the United States."}

However, similar to dog bites, cat bites are particularly more serious in children with injuries to the face, neck and head.\nMonkey bites:\nMonkey bites are an important risk among travellers, after dog bites. Occupational and recreational exposures to monkey bites are related to animal control, veterinary, zoologist, wildlife professions, and hunting or trapping animals.\nBat bites:\nPeople are often exposed to bat bites because of occupational or recreational activities that involve regular handling of bats such as animal control and wildlife workers, veterinary staff and zoologists."}
