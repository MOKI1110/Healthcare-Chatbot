Most paediatric RSV deaths (97%) occur in low- and middle-income countries where there is limited access to supportive medical care.\nThere are two licensed immunization products for prevention of RSV disease in young infants: a long-acting monoclonal antibody administered to infants soon after birth and a maternal vaccine given to pregnant women and persons in the latter part of pregnancy.\nThree vaccines are licensed to prevent severe RSV disease in elderly persons and adults with certain underlying illnesses, like lung and heart disease.\nOverview\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an RNA virus that belongs to the\nPneumoviridae\nfamily along with the human metapneumovirus and consists in two genotypes (A and B)\n(1)\n."}

RSV is specific and pathogenic for humans and infects cells along the human respiratory tract, from the nose to the lungs. RSV causes a wide spectrum of respiratory disease, from mild upper respiratory tract infections (in most cases) to life threatening lower respiratory tract infections (\n2\n). Infants, especially those under six months of age, are at highest risk of severe RSV disease and death. RSV can also cause severe disease among elderly people and those with underlying illnesses. Until recently, there was no vaccine available to protect infants and elderly people from RSV disease. In the last few years, several vaccines and a long-acting monoclonal antibody have been licensed and are starting to be used to prevent severe RSV disease in these high-risk populations.\nScope of the problem\nEach year, RSV causes an estimated 3.6 million RSV-associated hospitalizations and approximatively 100 000 RSV-attributable deaths in children under 5 years of age worldwide\n(3)\n."}

Most paediatric RSV deaths (97%) occur in low- and middle-income countries where there is limited access to supportive medical care\n(3)\n. The global estimates of adult RSV disease are not known; in the United States of America, it has been estimated that RSV results in up to 160 000 hospitalizations and 10 000 deaths among adults over 65 years of age. The hospitalization rate for adults infected with RSV is higher among individuals with underlying conditions like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or congestive heart failure\n(4)\n.\nMost countries demonstrate RSV seasonality, with most annual RSV infections occurring over a several month period\n(5)\n. In temperate climates, RSV causes seasonal epidemics, tending to occur in late fall and winter, with an average duration of elevated viral circulation of five months."}

The virus is also thought to be transmitted by direct contact with infected persons or through support contaminated with the virus. Almost all babies are infected by RSV by their second birthday.

Management of severe RSV disease involves supportive care, such as nasal suction of secretions, intravenous fluids for hydration, and most importantly supplemental oxygen to help breathing\n(2)\n.\nSeveral immunization products are currently available to prevent severe RSV disease in infants and elderly adults\n(7)\n.
