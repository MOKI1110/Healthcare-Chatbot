The potential for international spread to unaffected regions remains a global health security concern.\nA safe, affordable vaccine provides lifelong protection with a single dose.\nAn estimated 67 000–173 000 severe infections and 31 000–82 000 deaths occur each year in Africa and the Americas, with most of the burden being in Africa\n(1,2)\n.\nOverview\nYellow fever is an epidemic-prone, vaccine-preventable disease caused by a virus transmitted by infected\nAedes s.p.\n,\nHaemagogus s.p.\nand\nSabethes s.p.\nmosquitoes. These mosquitoes breed in domestic, forest (sylvatic), and semi-domestic environments.\nDue to its high-impact and potential for international spread, yellow fever poses a significant threat to global health security.\nSymptoms\nThe initial symptoms of yellow fever are fever, headache, general body aches, nausea, vomiting and weakness."}

These symptoms typically disappear within 3–4 days.\nAbout 15% of people infected with yellow fever will have severe infection. Symptoms are the recurrence of high fever, jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes), vomiting, bleeding (of the mouth, nose, eyes and stomach), organ failure and shock. About 50% of patients in this phase die within 7–10 days.\nThe incubation period for yellow fever is 3–6 days.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific anti-viral treatment. Clinical care remains mostly supportive, with the 2025 clinical management guidelines providing a protocolized approach. The two anti-virals that can be given , sofosbuvir and monoclonal antibody TY014, are recommended exclusively in research settings(3).\nSupportive care includes rest and hydration; management of liver and kidney failure, and fever; and antibiotics for secondary bacterial infections. Patients may be managed at home, hospitalized, or referred for emergency care depending on severity."}

Patients may be managed at home, hospitalized, or referred for emergency care depending on severity. Jaundice is an indication of severe disease, justifying hospitalization, often in an intensive care unit.\nDiagnosis\nDiagnosis is challenging, especially early on when clinical manifestations are nonspecific. Severe cases may resemble malaria, leptospirosis, viral hepatitis, other haemorrhagic fevers such as dengue, and poisoning.\nDiagnosis is carried out as follows:\nin the early stage: by Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing of blood; and\nin the later stage: by antibody detection via ELISA or plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) testing of blood.\nPrevention\nVaccination\nVaccination is the most effective preventive measure. A single dose provides lifelong immunity and no booster is needed. Immunity develops in for 80–100% of people within 10 days, and in over 99% within 30 days.\nSide-effects are rare."}

In outbreaks, WHO estimates that actual cases may be 10 to 250 times higher than reported. High-risk countries should maintain at least one national laboratory for yellow fever testing. Any confirmed case must be investigated and followed by emergency and long-term immunization measures. During outbreaks, there is a risk of yellow fever exportation to countries with lower transmission risk."}
