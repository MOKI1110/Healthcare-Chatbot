Becker\n©\nCredits\nChild maltreatment\n5 November 2024\nKey facts\nSix in 10 children – or 400 million children – under 5 years of age regularly suffer physical punishment and/or psychological violence at the hands of parents and caregivers\n(1)\n.\nOne in 5 women and 1 in 7 men report having been sexually abused as a child\n(2)\n.\nConsequences of child maltreatment include impaired lifelong physical and mental health, and the social and occupational outcomes can ultimately slow a country's economic and social development.\nChild maltreatment is often hidden. Only a fraction of child victims of maltreatment ever get support from health professionals.\nA child who is abused is more likely to abuse others as an adult, so that violence is passed down from one generation to the next.\nPreventing child maltreatment before it starts is possible. Effective prevention approaches include supporting parents, teaching positive parenting skills and enhancing laws to prohibit violent punishment.\nOverview\nChild maltreatment is the abuse and neglect that occurs to children under 18 years of age."}

It includes all types of physical and/or emotional ill-treatment, sexual abuse, neglect, negligence and commercial or other exploitation, which results in actual or potential harm to the child’s health, survival, development or dignity in the context of a relationship of responsibility, trust or power.\nScope of the problem\nChild maltreatment is a global problem with serious life-long consequences. In spite of recent national surveys in several low- and middle-income countries, data from many countries are still lacking.\nChild maltreatment is complex and difficult to study. Current estimates vary widely depending on the country and the method of research used."}

This number almost certainly underestimates the true extent of the problem, since a significant proportion of deaths due to child maltreatment are incorrectly attributed to falls, burns, drowning and other causes.\nIn armed conflict and refugee settings, girls are particularly vulnerable to sexual violence, exploitation and abuse by combatants, security forces, members of their communities, aid workers and others.\nConsequences of maltreatment\nChild maltreatment has often severe short- and long-term physical, sexual and mental health consequences. These include injuries, including head injuries and severe disability (in particular in young children), post-traumatic stress, anxiety, depression, and sexually transmitted infections (STIs) including HIV. Adolescent girls may face additional health issues, including gynaecological disorders and unwanted pregnancy."}
