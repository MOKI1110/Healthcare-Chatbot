The name chikungunya derives from a word in the Kimakonde language of southern Tanzania, meaning “that which bends up” and describes the contorted posture of infected people with severe joint pain.\nDistribution and outbreaks\nCHIKV was first identified in the United Republic of Tanzania in 1952 and subsequently in other countries Africa and Asia\n(1)\n. Urban outbreaks were first recorded in Thailand in 1967 and in India in the 1970s\n(2)\n. Since 2004, outbreaks of CHIKV have become more frequent and widespread, caused partly due to viral adaptations allowing the virus to be spread more easily by\nAedes albopictus\nmosquitoes and because CHIKV has been introduced into immunologically naïve populations. CHIKV has now been identified in >110 countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas."}

These mosquitoes bite primarily during daylight hours and\nAedes aegypti\nfeeds both indoors and outdoors. They lay eggs in containers with standing water.

The virus then replicates in the mosquito over several days, enters its salivary glands, and can be transmitted into a new human host when the mosquito bites them. The virus again begins to replicate in this newly infected person and reaches high concentrations in their blood, at which point they can further infect other mosquitoes and perpetuate the transmission cycle.\nSymptoms\nIn symptomatic patients, CHIKV disease onset is typically 4–8 days (range 2–12 days) after the bite of an infected mosquito. It is characterized by an abrupt onset of fever, frequently accompanied by severe joint pain. The joint pain is often debilitating and usually lasts for a few days but may be prolonged, lasting for weeks, months or even years. Other common signs and symptoms include joint swelling, muscle pain, headache, nausea, fatigue and rash. Since these symptoms overlap with other infections, including those with dengue and Zika viruses, cases can be misdiagnosed."}

Patients suspected of having CHIKV infection should avoid getting mosquito bites during the first week of illness to prevent further transmission to mosquitoes, that may in turn infect other people.\nThe main method to reduce transmission of CHIKV is through control of the mosquito vectors and reduction of mosquito breeding sites. This requires mobilization of communities, who are critical in reducing mosquito breeding sites through emptying and cleaning containers that contain water on a weekly basis, disposing of waste, and supporting local mosquito control programmes.\nDuring outbreaks, insecticides may be sprayed to kill flying adult mosquitoes, applied to surfaces in and around containers where the mosquitoes land, and used to treat water in containers to kill the immature mosquito larvae."}
