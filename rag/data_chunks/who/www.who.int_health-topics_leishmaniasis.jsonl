These parasites are transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected female phlebotomine sandfly, a tiny – 2–3 mm long – insect vector.\nThere are three main forms of the disease: cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL), visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala-azar, and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL). CL is the most common form, VL is the most severe form and MCL is the most disabling form of the disease.\nMost people who become infected with the parasite do not develop any symptoms during their lifetime. Therefore, the term\nleishmaniasis\nrefers to the condition of becoming sick due to a\nLeishmania\ninfection, not to being infected with the parasite.\nToday, more than 1 billion people live in areas endemic for leishmaniasis and are at risk of infection. An estimated 30 000 new cases of VL and more than 1 million new cases of CL occur annually.\nSymptoms\nCL usually produces ulcers on the exposed parts of the body, such as the face, arms and legs. There may be many lesions – sometimes up to 200 – which can cause serious disability."}

There may be many lesions – sometimes up to 200 – which can cause serious disability. When the ulcers heal, they invariably leave permanent scars, which can lead to stigmatization, especially for women and girls.\nVL is characterized by irregular bouts of fever, substantial weight loss, swelling of the spleen and liver and serious anaemia. If the disease is not treated, the fatality rate can be as high as 100% within 2 years.\nMCL produces lesions that can partially or totally destroy the mucous membranes of the nose, mouth and throat cavities and surrounding tissues. This disabling form can also lead to social exclusion.\nPKDL (post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis), a complication of VL, is mainly seen in East Africa and South-East Asia. It is characterized by a discoloured (hypopigmented) flat skin (macular) rash, combined with some slightly elevated (maculopapular) or elevated (nodular) rash, usually in patients who have recovered from VL."}

PKDL usually appears 6 months to 1 or more years after apparent cure of VL, but it may occur earlier or even concurrently with VL, especially in Sudan. PKDL heals spontaneously in most cases in Africa but rarely in patients in India.\nTreatment\nAntileishmanial treatment depends on the causative species and the condition of the patient (e.g. pregnancy, immunosuppression).\nRegardless of the causative\nLeishmania\nspecies, antileishmanial treatment cannot provide a sterile cure, and the parasite remains in the human body and can cause a relapse when there is immunosuppression.\nTreatment is complex and should be administered by highly experienced health personnel."}
