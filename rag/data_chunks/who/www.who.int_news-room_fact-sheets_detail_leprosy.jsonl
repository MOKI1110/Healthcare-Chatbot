Left untreated, the disease may cause progressive and permanent disabilities.\nThe bacteria are transmitted via droplets from the nose and mouth during close and frequent contact with untreated cases.\nLeprosy is curable with multidrug therapy (MDT).\nLeprosy is reported from all the six WHO regions; the majority of annual new case detections are from South-East Asia Region.\nOverview\nLeprosy, also known as Hansen disease, is a chronic infectious disease caused mainly by a type of bacteria called\nMycobacterium leprae\n. The disease affects the skin, the peripheral nerves, the mucosa of the upper respiratory tract and the eyes. Apart from the physical deformity, persons affected by leprosy also face stigmatization and discrimination."}

Apart from the physical deformity, persons affected by leprosy also face stigmatization and discrimination. However, leprosy is curable and treatment in the early stages can prevent disability.\nScope of the problem\nLeprosy is a neglected tropical disease (NTD) which still occurs in more than 120 countries, with around 200 000 new cases reported every year. Elimination of leprosy as a public health problem (defined as prevalence of less than 1 per 10 000 population as per World Health Assembly resolution 44.9) was achieved globally in the year 2000 and in most countries by the year 2010.\nThe reduction in the number of new cases has been gradual. As per data of 2023, Brazil, India and Indonesia continue to report more than 10 000 new cases, while 12 other countries (Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Madagascar, Mozambique, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, Philippines, Somalia, Sri Lanka and the United Republic of Tanzania) each reported 1000–10 000 new cases."}

The disease does not spread through casual contact (like shaking hands or hugging, sharing meals or sitting next to each other). The patient stops transmitting the disease upon initiation of treatment.\nDiagnosis\nThe diagnosis of leprosy is done clinically. Laboratory-based services may be required in cases that are difficult to diagnose.\nThe disease manifests commonly through skin lesion and peripheral nerve involvement."}

Laboratory-based services may be required in cases that are difficult to diagnose.\nThe disease manifests commonly through skin lesion and peripheral nerve involvement. Leprosy is diagnosed by finding at least one of the following cardinal signs: (i) definite loss of sensation in a pale (hypopigmented) or reddish skin patch; (ii) thickened or enlarged peripheral nerve, with loss of sensation and/or weakness of the muscles supplied by that nerve; (iii) microscopic detection of bacilli in a slit-skin smear.\nBased on the above, cases of leprosy are classified into two types for treatment purposes: a paucibacillary (PB) case and multibacillary (MB) case.\nPB case: a case of leprosy with 1–5 skin lesions, without demonstrated presence of bacilli in a skin smear.\nMB case: a case of leprosy with more than five skin lesions; or with nerve involvement (pure neuritis, or any number of skin lesions and neuritis); or with the demonstrated presence of bacilli in a slit-skin smear, irrespective of the number of skin lesions.\nTreatment\nLeprosy is a curable disease."}

The currently recommended treatment regimen consists of three medicines (dapsone, rifampicin and clofazimine) and is referred to as multi-drug therapy (MDT). The same regimen with a duration of 6 months for PB and 12 months for MB cases has been recommended by WHO. MDT kills the pathogen and cures the patient. Early diagnosis and prompt treatment can help to prevent disabilities. WHO has been providing MDT free of cost. Free MDT was initially funded by The Nippon Foundation (TNF) and has been donated by Novartis since 2000.\nPrevention\nCase detection and treatment with MDT alone have proven insufficient to interrupt transmission. WHO recommends contact tracing (household, neighbourhood, and social contacts), accompanied by the administration of a single dose of rifampicin as post-exposure prophylaxis (SDR-PEP).\nWHO response\nWHO provides technical support to countries and territories on leprosy prevention and control."}

The Strategy envisions zero leprosy: zero infection and disease, zero disability, zero stigma and discrimination. The four strategic pillars of the Strategy include: implementing integrated, country-owned zero leprosy roadmaps in all endemic countries; scaling up leprosy prevention alongside integrated active case detection; managing leprosy and its complications and prevent new disability; and combatting stigma and ensuring human rights are respected."}
