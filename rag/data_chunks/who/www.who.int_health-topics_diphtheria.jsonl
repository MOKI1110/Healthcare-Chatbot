The toxin attaches itself most commonly to tissues in the respiratory system and causes disease by killing healthy tissue.\nTypical symptoms of the infection include a sore throat, fever, swollen neck glands and weakness. Within 2–3 days from infection, the dead tissue forms a thick, grey coating that can cover tissues in the nose, tonsils and throat, making it hard to breathe and swallow. More rarely, the toxin gets into the blood stream and causes damage to the heart, kidneys and nerves.\nDiphtheria bacteria spread from person to person, usually through respiratory droplets, like from coughing or sneezing. People can also get sick from touching infected open sores or ulcers. Those at increased risk of getting sick include household contacts, those exposed to secretions from the patient and those with frequent and close contact with the infected person.\nPrevention\nDiphtheria is a vaccine-preventable disease and is included in all countries' essential immunization programme. Diphtheria vaccine is a bacterial toxoid, i.e."}

Diphtheria vaccine is a bacterial toxoid, i.e. a toxin whose toxicity has been inactivated. Currently available diphtheria vaccines are very effective in preventing this disease.\nWHO recommends a 3-dose primary vaccination series with diphtheria- containing vaccine, followed by 3 booster doses. The primary series should begin as early as 6 weeks of age with subsequent doses given with a minimum interval of 4 weeks between doses. The 3 booster doses should preferably be given during the second year of life (12–23 months), at 4–7 years and at 9–15 years of age. Ideally, there should be at least 4 years between booster doses to achieve long term protection.\nThe vaccine can be given in combination with other vaccines such as tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B,\nHemophilus influenzae\nb and polio.\nPeople who get a diphtheria vaccine may experience mild side effects. Serious side effects are rare.\nTreatments\nTreatment for diphtheria includes antibiotics to get rid of the bacteria."}

Serious side effects are rare.\nTreatments\nTreatment for diphtheria includes antibiotics to get rid of the bacteria. For serious illnesses, diphtheria antitoxin is used to stop the bacterial toxin from causing damage to the respiratory system and other parts of the body. Anyone who has had diphtheria should also receive the vaccine after the acute phase of the illness is over.\nClose contacts of a person with diphtheria may also be treated with antibiotics.  This prevents further spread of the bacteria. The specific antibiotics used will depend on local known antibiotic resistance patterns.\nThe risk of complications or death decrease considerably if appropriate treatment is provided early in the course of illness."}
