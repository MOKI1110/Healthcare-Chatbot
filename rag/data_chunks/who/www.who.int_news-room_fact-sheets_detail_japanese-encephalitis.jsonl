WHO recommends that JE vaccination be integrated into national immunization schedules in all areas where JE disease is recognized as a public health issue.\nOverview\nJapanese encephalitis virus (JEV) is an important cause of viral encephalitis in Asia. It is a mosquito-borne flavivirus and belongs to the same genus as dengue, Zika, yellow fever and West Nile viruses. The first case of Japanese encephalitis viral disease (JE) was documented in 1871 in Japan. The annual incidence of clinical disease varies both across and within endemic countries, ranging from 10 per 100 000 population or higher during outbreaks. A literature review and modelling study estimates about 100 000 clinical cases (95% CI: 61 720–157 522) of JE globally each year, with approximately 25 000 deaths (95% CI: 14 550–46 031)."}

JE primarily affects children. Most adults in endemic countries have natural immunity after childhood infection, but individuals of any age may be affected.\nSigns and symptoms\nMost JEV infections are mild (fever and headache) or without apparent symptoms, but approximately 1 in 250 infections results in severe clinical illness. The incubation period is 4–14 days. In children, gastrointestinal pain and vomiting may be the dominant initial symptoms. Severe disease is characterized by rapid onset of high fever, headache, neck stiffness, disorientation, coma, seizures, spastic paralysis and ultimately death. The case fatality rate can be as high as 30% among those with disease symptoms."}

Of those who survive, 20–30% suffer permanent cognitive, behavioural or neurological sequelae such as seizures,  hearing or vision loss, speech, language, memory, and communication problems or weakness of the limbs.\nTransmission\nTwenty-four countries in the WHO South-East Asia and Western Pacific Regions have JEV transmission risk, which includes more than 3 billion people. JEV is transmitted to humans through bites from infected mosquitoes of the\nCulex\nspecies (mainly\nCulex tritaeniorhynchus\n). Humans, once infected, do not develop sufficient viraemia to infect feeding mosquitoes. The virus exists in a transmission cycle between mosquitoes, pigs and/or water birds (enzootic cycle). The disease is predominantly found in rural and periurban settings, where humans live in closer proximity to these vertebrate hosts, in particular domestic pigs. In most temperate areas of Asia, JEV is transmitted mainly during the warm season, when large epidemics can occur."}

In most temperate areas of Asia, JEV is transmitted mainly during the warm season, when large epidemics can occur. In the tropics and subtropics, transmission can occur year-round but often intensifies during the rainy season and pre-harvest period in rice-cultivating regions.\nDiagnosis\nIndividuals who live in or have travelled to a JE-endemic area and experience encephalitis are considered a suspected JE case. Initial diagnosis of JE can be made by clinical examination followed by a lumbar puncture. A laboratory test is required to confirm JEV infection and to rule out other causes of encephalitis. WHO recommends testing for JEV-specific IgM antibody in a single sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or serum, using an IgM-capture ELISA. If tested negative, a convalescent sample may be tested. Testing of CSF sample is preferred to reduce false-positivity rates from previous infection or vaccination.\nSurveillance of the disease is mostly syndromic for acute encephalitis syndrome."}

Confirmatory laboratory testing is often conducted in dedicated sentinel sites, and efforts are undertaken to expand laboratory-based surveillance. Case-based surveillance is established in countries that effectively control JE through vaccination.\nTreatment\nEncephalitis is a medical emergency and requires urgent medical attention. There is no antiviral treatment for patients with JE. Treatment is supportive and includes stabilization and relief of  symptoms.\nThose who have lived through encephalitis\noften have health-care needs requiring long-term treatment and care including rehabilitation. The ongoing psychosocial impacts of disability from encephalitis can have medical, educational, social and human rights-based implications. Despite the high burden of sequelae on people with encephalitis, their families and the community, access to both services and support for these conditions is often insufficient, especially in low- and middle-income countries."}

A decline in incidence of the disease has been reported in recent years, which is likely due in part to vaccination.

WHO recommends having strong JE prevention and control activities, including JE immunization in all regions where the disease is a recognized public health priority, along with strengthening surveillance and reporting mechanisms. Even if the number of JE-confirmed cases is low, vaccination should be considered where there is a suitable environment for JE virus transmission. Introduction of the vaccine should be done in conjunction with a one-time catch-up campaign.\nThere are three main types of JE vaccines currently in use: several inactivated Vero cell-derived vaccines, a live attenuated vaccine, and a live recombinant (chimeric) vaccine. One inactivated vaccine and the two live vaccines are WHO prequalified.\nThe risk to travellers to Japanese encephalitis-endemic areas is normally low, but travellers should take precautions to avoid mosquito bites. Personal preventive measures include the use of mosquito repellents, long-sleeved clothes, coils and vaporizers."}
