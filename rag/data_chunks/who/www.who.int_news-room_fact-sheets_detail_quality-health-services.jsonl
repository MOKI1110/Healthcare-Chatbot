Patients’ trust in health system goes hand-in-hand with high quality health care and is closely linked to personal experience of health care\n(3)\n.\nInadequate quality of care imposes costs of US$ 1.4–1.6 trillion each year in lost productivity in LMICs\n(1)\n.\nIn high-income countries, 1 in 10 patients is harmed while receiving hospital care, and 7 in every 100 hospitalized patients can expect to acquire a health care-associated infection."}
