Endometriosis can also affect transgender men and non-binary individuals who menstruate."}

In women with endometriosis, endometrium-like tissue (usually found only in the lining of the uterus) grows outside the uterus, causing inflammation and scar tissue formation.\nThere is currently no known cure, but endometriosis symptoms can be treated with medicines or, in some women, surgery.\nEndometriosis is diagnosed using imaging techniques such as ultrasound. Invasive procedures like surgery may also be necessary to confirm the diagnosis. Long delays in diagnosis are common, and symptoms often persist or recur after treatment is initiated.\nCauses\nThe causes of endometriosis are unknown.\nEmerging research suggests that endometriosis is associated with immune system dysregulation."}

A clinical diagnosis of endometriosis may also be made on the basis of women’s symptoms and imaging tests such as ultrasound or MRI, and surgery is not necessarily required before initiating treatment.\nNew and emerging diagnostic tests aimed at identifying endometriosis earlier include simple symptom checklists, blood tests, and increasingly self-tests using saliva or menstrual blood.\nTreatment\nThere are no existing treatments that definitively cure the disease."}
