Infection is most probably acquired by traumatic inoculation\nof certain fungi or ‎bacteria into the subcutaneous tissue. Mycetoma was\ndescribed in the modern literature in 1694 but was first reported in\nthe mid-19th century in the Indian town of Madura, and hence was\ninitially called Madura foot.\nMycetoma commonly affects young adults, particularly males\naged between 20 and 40 years, mostly in  developing countries."}

People of\nlow socioeconomic status and manual workers such as agriculturalists,\nlabourers and herdsmen are the worst affected.\nMycetoma has numerous adverse medical, health and socioeconomic impacts on patients, communities and health authorities.\nAs mycetoma is a badly neglected disease, accurate data on its incidence and prevalence are not available.\nSymptoms\nMycetoma\nis characterized by a triad of painless\n‎subcutaneous mass, multiple sinuses and discharge ‎containing grains.\nIt usually ‎spreads to involve the skin, deep structures and bone\nresulting in ‎destruction, ‎deformity and loss of function, which may be fatal. ‎Mycetoma commonly ‎involves the extremities, back and\ngluteal region.‎\nGiven its slow progression, painless nature, massive lack of\nhealth education and scarcity of medical and health facilities in\nendemic areas, many patients present late with advanced infection where\namputation may be the only available treatment."}

Infection is not transmitted from human to human.\nTreatment\nThe treatment depends on the causative organisms for the\nbacterial causes; it is a long term antibiotics combination whereas for\nthe fungal type,  treatment requires combined antifungals drugs and\nsurgery.
