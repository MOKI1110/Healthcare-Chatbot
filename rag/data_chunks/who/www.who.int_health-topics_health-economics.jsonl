The following tools facilitate the above mentioned work: WHO-CHOICE and the One Health Tool for costing and cost-effectiveness analysis, Accesmod for geographic modelling and EPIC for estimating economic consequences of disease and injury.\nOur work\nThe following are the key areas of our work:\nHealth technology assessment and Benefit Package Design -\nOne of the key objectives for policymakers is to use existing and additional resources efficiently. This calls for prioritizing between and amongst interventions. There are several initiatives related to health technology assessment (HTA) and health benefit package design."}

Strategies for improving health and expanding access to health care services need to be examined from a resource perspective in order to ensure that they are feasible, efficient, affordable and sustainable.\nHealth and the economy –\nWhile measurements of morbidity and mortality are key considerations for estimating the burden of disease in populations, they provide an incomplete picture of the adverse impact of ill health on human welfare."}

In particular, the economic consequences of poor health can be substantial. Analysis of the economic impact of ill-health addresses a number of policy questions concerning the consequences of disease or injury. Some of these questions relate to the microeconomic level of households, firms or government – such as the impact of ill-health on a household’s income or a firm’s profits – while others relate to the macroeconomic level, including the aggregate impact of a disease on a country’s current and future gross domestic product (GDP). WHO proposes a defined conceptual framework within which the economic impact of diseases and injuries can be considered and appropriately estimated.\nTools used\nAccessMod\n– This is a toolbox that has been\ndeveloped by WHO in order to assist countries to examine the geographic aspects\nof their health system."}

EPIC estimates how changes in health status\naffect the size of the effective labour force and the accumulation of physical\ncapital and ultimately national income.
