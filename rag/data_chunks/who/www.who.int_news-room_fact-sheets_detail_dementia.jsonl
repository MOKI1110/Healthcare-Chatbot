Every year, there are nearly 10 million new cases.\nDementia results from a variety of diseases and injuries that affect the brain. Alzheimer disease is the most common form of dementia and may contribute to 60–70% of cases.\nDementia is currently the seventh leading cause of death and one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people globally.\nIn 2019, dementia cost economies globally US$ 1.3 trillion, approximately 50% of these costs are attributable to care provided by informal carers (e.g. family members and close friends), who provide on average 5 hours of care and supervision per day.\nWomen are disproportionately affected by dementia, both directly and indirectly."}

Women experience higher disability-adjusted life years and mortality due to dementia, but also provide 70% of care hours for people living with dementia.\nOverview\nDementia is a term for several diseases that affect memory, thinking, and the ability to perform daily activities.\nThe illness gets worse over time. It mainly affects older people but not all people will get it as they age.\nThings that increase the risk of developing dementia include:\nage (more common in those 65 or older)\nhigh blood pressure (hypertension)\nhigh blood sugar (diabetes)\nbeing overweight or obese\nsmoking\ndrinking too much alcohol\nbeing physically inactive\nbeing socially isolated\ndepression.\nDementia is a syndrome that can be caused by a number of diseases which over time destroy nerve cells and damage the brain, typically leading to deterioration in cognitive function (i.e. the ability to process thought) beyond what might be expected from the usual consequences of biological ageing."}

While consciousness is not affected, the impairment in cognitive function is commonly accompanied, and occasionally preceded, by changes in mood, emotional control, behaviour, or motivation.\nDementia has physical, psychological, social and economic impacts, not only for people living with dementia, but also for their carers, families and society at large. There is often a lack of awareness and understanding of dementia, resulting in stigmatization and barriers to diagnosis and care.\nSigns and symptoms\nChanges in mood and behaviour sometimes happen even before memory problems occur. Symptoms get worse over time."}

As the disease progresses, the need for help with personal care increases. People with dementia may not be able to recognize family members or friends, develop difficulties moving around, lose control over their bladder and bowels, have trouble eating and drinking and experience behaviour changes such as aggression that are distressing to the person with dementia as well as those around them.\nCommon forms of dementia\nDementia is caused by many different diseases or injuries that directly and indirectly damage the brain. Alzheimer disease is the most common form and may contribute to 60–70% of cases. Other forms include vascular dementia, dementia with Lewy bodies (abnormal deposits of protein inside nerve cells), and a group of diseases that contribute to frontotemporal dementia (degeneration of the frontal lobe of the brain)."}

Dementia may also develop after a stroke or in the context of certain infections such as HIV, as a result of harmful use of alcohol, repetitive physical injuries to the brain (known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy) or nutritional deficiencies. The boundaries between different forms of dementia are indistinct and mixed forms often co-exist.\nTreatment and care\nThere is no cure for dementia, but a lot can be done to support both people living with the illness and those who care for them.\nPeople with dementia can take steps to maintain their quality of life and promote their well-being by:\nbeing physically active\ntaking part in activities and social interactions that stimulate the brain and maintain daily function.\nIn addition, some medications can help manage dementia symptoms:\nCholinesterase inhibitors like donepezil are used to treat Alzheimer disease.\nNMDA receptor antagonists like memantine are used for severe Alzheimer disease and vascular dementia.\nMedicines to control blood pre"}

Further, dementia does not exclusively affect older people – young onset dementia (defined as the onset of symptoms before the age of 65 years) accounts for up to 9% of cases. Studies show that people can reduce their risk of cognitive decline and dementia by\nbeing physically active\n, not smoking,\navoiding harmful use of alcohol\n, controlling their weight, eating a healthy diet, and maintaining healthy blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels.
