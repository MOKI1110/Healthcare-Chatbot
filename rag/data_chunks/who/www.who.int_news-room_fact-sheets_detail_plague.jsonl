Bubonic plague is the most common form and is characterized by painful swollen lymph nodes or 'buboes'.\nPlague is transmitted between animals and humans by the bite of infected fleas, direct contact with infected tissues, and inhalation of infected respiratory droplets.\nPlague can be a very severe disease in people, with a case-fatality ratio of 30% to 60% for the bubonic type, and is always fatal for the pneumonic kind when left untreated.\nAntibiotic treatment is effective against plague bacteria, so early diagnosis and early treatment can save lives.\nCurrently, the three most endemic countries are the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Madagascar, and Peru.\nPlague is an infectious disease caused by the bacteria Yersinia pestis, a zoonotic bacteria, usually found in small mammals and their fleas."}

It is transmitted between animals through fleas. Humans can be infected through:\nthe bite of infected vector fleas\nunprotected contact with infectious bodily fluids or contaminated materials\nthe inhalation of respiratory droplets/small particles from a patient with pneumonic plague.\nPlague is a very severe disease in people, particularly in its septicaemic (systemic infection caused by circulating bacteria in bloodstream) and pneumonic forms, with a case-fatality ratio of 30% to 100% if left untreated. The pneumonic form is invariably fatal unless treated early. It is especially contagious and can trigger severe epidemics through person-to-person contact via droplets in the air.\nHistorically, plague was responsible for widespread pandemics with high mortality. It was known as the \"Black Death\" during the fourteenth century, causing more than 50 million deaths in Europe."}

It was known as the \"Black Death\" during the fourteenth century, causing more than 50 million deaths in Europe. Nowadays, plague is easily treated with antibiotics and the use of standard precautions to prevent acquiring infection.\nSigns and symptoms\nPeople infected with plague usually develop acute febrile disease with other non-specific systemic symptoms after an incubation period of one to seven days, such as sudden onset of fever, chills, head and body aches, and weakness, vomiting and nausea.\nThere are two main forms of plague infection, depending on the route of infection: bubonic and pneumonic.\nBubonic\nplague is the most common form of plague and is caused by the bite of an infected flea. Plague bacillus,\nY. pestis\n, enters at the bite and travels through the lymphatic system to the nearest lymph node where it replicates itself. The lymph node then becomes inflamed, tense and painful, and is called a ‘bubo’. At advanced stages of the infection the inflamed lymph nodes can turn into open sores filled with pus. Human to human transmission of bubonic plague is rare."}

Bubonic plague can advance and spread to the lungs, which is the more severe type of plague called pneumonic plague.\nPneumonic\nplague, or lung-based plague, is the most virulent form of plague. Incubation can be as short as 24 hours. Any person with pneumonic plague may transmit the disease via droplets to other humans. Untreated pneumonic plague, if not diagnosed and treated early, can be fatal. However, recovery rates are high if detected and treated in time (within 24 hours of onset of symptoms).\nWhere is plague found?\nAs an animal disease, plague is found in all continents, except Oceania. There is a risk of human plague wherever the presence of plague natural foci (the bacteria, an animal reservoir and a vector) and human population co-exist.\nGlobal distribution of natural plague foci as of March 2016\nPlague epidemics have occurred in Africa, Asia, and South America; but since the 1990s, most human cases have occurred in Africa."}

The three most endemic countries are the Democratic Republic of Congo, Madagascar, and Peru. In Madagascar cases of bubonic plague are reported nearly every year, during the epidemic season (between September and April).\nDiagnosing plague\nConfirmation of plague requires lab testing. The best practice is to identify Y. pestis from a sample of pus from a bubo, blood or sputum. A specific Y. pestis antigen can be detected by different techniques. One of them is a laboratory validated rapid dipstick test now widely used in Africa and South America, with the support of WHO.\nTreatment\nUntreated pneumonic plague can be rapidly fatal, so early diagnosis and treatment is essential for survival and reduction of complications. Antibiotics and supportive therapy are effective against plague if patients are diagnosed in time."}
