Mahoudeau\n©\nCredits\nTrypanosomiasis, human African (sleeping sickness)\n2 May 2023\nKey facts\nHuman African trypanosomiasis (HAT) is caused by protozoan parasites transmitted by infected tsetse flies. It is endemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Without treatment, HAT is generally fatal.\nMost exposed people live in rural areas and depend on agriculture, fishing, animal husbandry or hunting.\nHAT takes 2 forms, depending on the subspecies of the infecting parasite: Trypanosoma brucei gambiense (92% of reported cases) and Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense (8%).\nSustained control efforts have reduced the number of new cases by 97% in the last 20 years.\nDiagnosis and treatment are complex and require specific skills.\nOverview\nHuman African trypanosomiasis, also known as sleeping sickness, is a vector-borne parasitic disease. It is caused by protozoans of the genus\nTrypanosoma\n, transmitted to humans by bites of tsetse flies (glossina) which have acquired the parasites from infected humans or animals.\nTsetse flies inhabit sub-Saharan Africa and only certain species transmit the disease."}

Rural populations which depend on agriculture, fishing, animal husbandry or hunting are the most exposed. In many regions where tsetse flies are found, HAT is not. The disease has a focal distribution ranging from single villages to entire regions, and the incidence can vary from one village to the next.\nForms of human African trypanosomiasis\nHAT takes 2 forms, depending on the parasite subspecies:\nTrypanosoma brucei gambiense,\nfound in 24 countries of west and central Africa, currently accounts for 92% of reported cases and causes a chronic illness. A person can be infected for months or even years without major signs or symptoms. When evident symptoms emerge, often the disease is advanced with the central nervous system already affected.\nTrypanosoma brucei rhodesiense\n, found in 13 countries of eastern and southern Africa accounts for 8% of reported cases and causes an acute disease. First signs and symptoms emerge a few weeks or months after infection."}

It is caused by a different\nTrypanosoma\nsubgenus, transmitted by another vector and the disease characteristics are very different from HAT.\nAnimal trypanosomiasis\nOther trypanosomes cause disease in wild and domestic animals. In African cattle, it is called\nNagana\n. Trypanosomiasis in domestic animals is a major obstacle to rural economic development.\nDomestic and wild animals are the main reservoir of human-pathogenic\nT. b. rhodesiense\n. Animals can also be infected with\nT. b. gambiense\nand possibly act as a reservoir to a lesser extent not precisely known.\nDisease burden and distribution\nHAT threatens mainly populations of remote rural areas with limited health services, which complicates its diagnosis and treatment."}

By the mid-1960s HAT was under control with below 5000 annual cases continent-wide. As surveillance relaxed, a resurgence ensued, reaching epidemic proportions in several regions by 1970. In 1998 almost 40 000 cases were reported, amidst an estimated 300 000 undetected and untreated cases. The prevalence reached 50% in several villages in Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and South Sudan."}

Other possible transmission ways are:\nmother-to-child: trypanosomes can cross the placenta and infect the fetus;\nmechanical transmission by other blood-sucking insects is possible, although its epidemiological impact is likely marginal;\naccidental infection in laboratories via pricks with contaminated needles; and\ntransmission through sexual contact has been reported once.\nInitially the trypanosomes multiply in subcutaneous tissue, blood and lymph. This is called haemo-lymphatic or first stage, which entails bouts of fever, headache, enlarged lymph nodes, joint pains and itching.\nLater the parasites cross the blood-brain barrier into the central nervous system causing the meningo-encephalitic or second stage. Generally this is when more obvious signs and symptoms of HAT appear: behaviour changes, confusion, sensory disturbances and poor coordination. Sleep cycle disturbance, which gives the disease its name, is a prominent feature."}

Exhaustive screening requires a major investment in human and material resources. In Africa such resources are often scarce, particularly in remote areas."}

Hence, some infected individuals may die before they can ever be diagnosed and treated.\nTreatment\nThe treatment choice depends on the disease form and the disease stage. The earlier the disease is treated, the better the prospect of cure. The assessment of treatment outcome requires follow up for up to 24 months with clinical assessment and laboratory exams including sometimes of cerebrospinal fluid, because parasites may remain viable and reproduce the disease many months after treatment.\nTreatment in the second stage requires drugs that cross the blood–brain barrier.\nAll anti-trypanosomals are donated to WHO by the manufacturers and distributed for free to endemic countries. New\nWHO treatment guidelines\nfor gambiense-HAT were issued in 2019.
