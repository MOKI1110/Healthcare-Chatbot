Gupta-Smith\n©\nCredits\nNatural toxins in food\n10 March 2023\nKey facts\nSome natural toxins can be formed in food as defense mechanisms of plants, through their infestation with toxin-producing mould, or through ingestion by animals of toxin-producing microorganisms.\nNatural toxins can cause a variety of adverse health effects and pose a serious health threat to both humans and livestock. Some of these toxins are extremely potent.\nAdverse health effects can be acute poisoning ranging from allergic reactions to severe stomachache and diarrhoea, and even death.\nLong-term health consequences include effects on the immune, reproductive or nervous systems, and also cancer.\nA scientific expert committee jointly convened by WHO and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) – called JECFA – is the international body responsible for evaluating the health risk from natural toxins in food.\nInternational standards and codes of practice to limit exposure to natural toxins from certain foods are established by the Codex Alimentarius Commission based on JECFA assessments.\nWhat are natural toxins?\nNatural toxins are toxic comp"}

These toxins are not harmful to the organisms themselves but they may be toxic to other creatures, including humans, when eaten. These chemical compounds have diverse\nstructures and differ in biological function and toxicity.\nSome toxins are produced by plants as a natural defense mechanism against predators, insects or microorganisms, or as consequence of infestation with microorganisms, such as mould, in response to climate stress (such as drought or extreme humidity).\nOther sources of natural toxins are microscopic algae and plankton in oceans or sometimes in lakes that produce chemical compounds that are toxic to humans but not to fish or shellfish that eat these toxin-producing organisms."}

When people eat fish or\nshellfish that contain these toxins, illness can rapidly follow.\nSome of the most commonly found natural toxins that can pose a risk to our health are described below.\nAquatic biotoxins\nToxins formed by algae in the ocean and fresh water are called algal toxins. Algal toxins are generated during blooms of particular naturally occurring algal species. Shellfish such as mussels, scallops and oysters are more likely to contain these toxins\nthan fish. Algal toxins can cause diarrhea, vomiting, tingling, paralysis and other effects in humans, other mammals or fish. The algal toxins can be retained in shellfish and fish or contaminate drinking water. They have no taste or smell, and are\nnot eliminated by cooking or freezing.\nAnother example is ciguatera fish poisoning (CFP) which is caused by consuming fish contaminated with dinoflagellates\nthat produce ciguatoxins."}

Some fish known to harbour ciguatoxins include barracuda, black grouper, dog\nsnapper, and king mackerel. Symptoms of ciguatera poisoning include nausea, vomiting, and neurologic symptoms, such as tingling sensation on fingers and toes. There is currently no specific treatment for ciguatera poisoning.\nCyanogenic glycosides\nCyanogenic glycosides are phytotoxins (toxic chemicals produced by plants) which occur in at least 2000 plant species, of which a number of species are used as food in some areas of the world. Cassava, sorghum, stone fruits, bamboo roots and almonds are\nespecially important foods containing cyanogenic glycosides. The potential toxicity of a cyanogenic plant depends primarily on the potential that its consumption will produce a concentration of cyanide that is toxic to exposed humans."}

The potential toxicity of a cyanogenic plant depends primarily on the potential that its consumption will produce a concentration of cyanide that is toxic to exposed humans.  In humans,\nthe clinical signs of acute cyanide intoxication can include: rapid respiration, drop in blood pressure, dizziness, headache, stomach pains, vomiting, diarrhoea, mental confusion, cyanosis with twitching and convulsions followed by terminal coma.\nDeath due to cyanide poisoning can occur when the cyanide level exceeds the limit an individual is able to detoxify.\nFurocoumarins\nThese toxins are present in many plants such as parsnips (closely related to carrots and parsley), celery roots, citrus plants (lemon, lime, grapefruit, bergamot) and some medicinal plants. Furocoumarins are stress toxins and are released in response\nto stress, such as physical damage to the plant. Some of these toxins can cause gastrointestinal problems in susceptible people. Furocoumarins are phototoxic, they can cause severe skin reactions under sunlight (UVA exposure)."}

While mainly occurring\nafter dermal exposure, such reactions have also been reported after consumption of large quantities of certain vegetables containing high levels of furocoumarins.\nLectins\nMany types of beans contain toxins called lectins, and kidney beans have the highest concentrations – especially red kidney beans. As few as 4 or 5 raw beans can cause severe stomachache, vomiting and diarrhoea. Lectins are destroyed when the dried\nbeans are soaked for at least 12 hours and then boiled vigorously for at least 10 minutes in water. Tinned kidney beans have already had this process applied and so can be used without further treatment.\nMycotoxins\nMycotoxins are naturally occurring toxic compounds produced by certain types of moulds. Moulds that can produce mycotoxins grow on numerous foodstuffs such as cereals, dried fruits, nuts and spices."}

Mould growth can occur before harvest or after harvest,\nduring storage, on/in the food itself often under warm, damp and humid conditions.\nMost mycotoxins are chemically stable and survive food processing. The effects of food-borne mycotoxins can be acute with symptoms of severe illness and even death appearing quickly after consumption of highly contaminated food products. Long term effects\non health of chronic mycotoxin exposure include the induction of cancers and immune deficiency.\nFact sheet on Mycotoxins\nSolanines and chaconine\nAll solanacea plants, which include tomatoes, potatoes, and eggplants, contain natural toxins called solanines and chaconine (which are glycoalkaloids). While levels are generally low, higher concentrations are found in potato sprouts and bitter-tasting\npeel and green parts, as well as in green tomatoes. The plants produce the toxins in response to stresses like bruising, UV light, microorganisms and attacks from insect pests and herbivores."}

The plants produce the toxins in response to stresses like bruising, UV light, microorganisms and attacks from insect pests and herbivores. To reduce the production of solanines and chaconine it\nis important to store potatoes in a dark, cool and dry place, and not to eat green or sprouting parts.\nPoisonous mushrooms\nWild mushrooms may contain several toxins, such as muscimol and muscarine, which can cause vomiting, diarrhoea, confusion, visual disturbances, salivation, and hallucinations. Onset of symptoms occurs 6–24 hours or more after ingestion of mushrooms.\nFatal poisoning is usually associated with delayed onset of symptoms which are very severe, with toxic effect on the liver, kidney and nervous systems. Cooking or peeling does not inactivate the toxins. It is recommended to avoid any wild mushrooms,\nunless definitively identified as non-poisonous.\nPyrrolizidine alkaloids\nPyrrolizidine Alkaloids (PAs) are toxins produced by an estimated 600 plant species. The main plant sources are the families\nBoraginaceae\n,\nAsteraceae\nand\nFabaceae\n. Many of these are weeds that can grow in fields and contaminate\nfood crops."}

Human exposure is estimated to be low, however. Due to the complexity of the subject and\nthe large number of related compounds, the overall health risk has not been fully evaluated yet.
