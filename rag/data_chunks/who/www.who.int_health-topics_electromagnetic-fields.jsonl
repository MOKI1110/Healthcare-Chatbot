All populations are now exposed to varying degrees of EMF, and the levels will continue to increase as technology advances. Electromagnetic radiation has been around since the birth of the universe; light is its most familiar form. Electric and magnetic fields are part of the spectrum of electromagnetic radiation which extends from static electric and magnetic fields, through radiofrequency and infrared radiation, to X-rays.\nWHO Response\nAs part of its charter to protect public health and in response to public concern over health effects of EMF exposure, the WHO established the\nInternational EMF Project\nin 1996 to assess the scientific evidence of possible health effects of EMF in the frequency range from 0 to 300 GHz."}
