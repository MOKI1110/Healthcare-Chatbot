However, an individual’s risk of fragility fracture can be predicted, and these fractures are preventable using effective interventions.\nOverview\nBone fractures are partial or complete breaks in a bone, which may spontaneously occur (due to diseases such as osteoporosis and associated chronic conditions) or result from a fall or a trauma (due to road traffic accidents, sports, etc.). Fractures are a global public health concern and are associated with significant morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs.\nDue to worldwide population growth and ageing, the number of people sustaining a fracture each year has been increasing. Currently, there are no global estimates on fragility fractures, and available data include all fractures combined."}

Therefore, preventing fragility fractures through early assessment of risk factors and treatment of osteoporosis is essential for good health and well-being for all adults, and particularly so for older people.\nTypes of fragility fractures\nFragility fractures result from low-energy trauma (a mechanical force that would not ordinarily cause a fracture), such as a fall from standing height or less. These fractures are the main clinical consequence of osteoporosis, although they may occur in postmenopausal women even in the absence of osteoporosis.\nThe most common sites of fragility fractures are the:\nspine\nhip\ndistal forearm (wrist)\nproximal humerus (upper arm).\nOther fragility fracture sites include the pelvis, ribs, and proximal tibia."}

Modifiable risk factors can be changed by modifying one’s lifestyle or environment, so that the probability of occurrence of a disease or a health condition may be reduced.\nModifiable risk factors for fragility fractures include:\nsmoking\nalcohol consumption\nsedentary behaviour/physical inactivity\nlow body weight\nnutrient-poor diet\nvitamin D and calcium deficiency\neating disorders (for example anorexia nervosa and bulimia)\nmalabsorption\nmedications (including glucocorticoids, antidepressants, anticonvulsants, androgen deprivation therapy, etc.)\nfalls.\nNon-modifiable risk factors include:\nolder age\nsex (women have a higher risk)\nethnicit"}

These tools are used to calculate the individuals’ risk of fracture over a certain number of years (for example, five or ten years), which supports the clinical decision-making process."}

In fact, although they are common in postmenopausal women and older men, most vertebral fractures are undiagnosed.\nManagement of clinical fragility fractures and of complications secondary to fractures is also key. Treatment of fragility fractures can be surgical or non-surgical, with orthopaedic surgeons playing a central role.\nPrevention of refracture (usually called secondary fracture prevention) is also essential, and counts as tertiary prevention strategies, which include effective rehabilitation and improvement of quality of life.\nTimely rehabilitation provided by a skilled rehabilitation workforce following treatment is crucial to support people to recover from the fracture and related functioning loss. Ensuring access to assistive products (e.g. walking aids, orthoses) and providing associated training is a crucial component of rehabilitation.\nComorbidities\nComorbidities are diseases or conditions that coexist with a specific disease or condition of interest."}
