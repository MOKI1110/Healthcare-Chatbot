It can also be contracted through contact with viraemic animal tissues (animal tissue where the virus has entered the bloodstream) during and immediately post-slaughter\nof animals. CCHF outbreaks constitute a threat to public health services as the virus can lead to epidemics, has a high case fatality ratio (10–40%), potentially results in hospital and health facility outbreaks, and is difficult to prevent and treat.\nCCHF is endemic in all of Africa, the Balkans, the Middle East and in Asia.\nThe disease was first described in the Crimean Peninsula in 1944 and given the name Crimean haemorrhagic fever. In 1969 it was recognized that the pathogen causing Crimean haemorrhagic fever was the same as that responsible for an illness identified in 1956 in the\nCongo Basin. The linkage of the two place names resulted in the current name for the disease and the virus.\nSymptoms\nFollowing infection by a tick bite, the incubation period of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is usually 1–3 days, with a maximum of 9 days."}

Following contact with infected blood or tissues, the incubation period is usually 5–6 days, with a maximum of 13 days.\nOnset of symptoms is sudden and can include fever, muscle ache, dizziness, neck pain, backache, headache, sore eyes and photophobia (sensitivity to light). There may be nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea,\nabdominal pain and sore throat early on, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. After 2–4 days the agitation may be replaced by sleepiness, depression and lassitude, and the abdominal pain may localize to the upper right quadrant, with\ndetectable hepatomegaly (liver enlargement).\nOther clinical signs include tachycardia (fast heart rate), lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes), and a petechial rash (a rash caused by bleeding into the skin) on internal mucosal surfaces, such as in the mouth and throat, and\non the skin. The petechiae may give way to larger rashes called ecchymoses, and other haemorrhagic phenomena."}

There is usually evidence of hepatitis, and severely ill patients may experience rapid kidney deterioration, sudden liver failure or pulmonary\nfailure after the fifth day of illness.\nTreatment\nEarly intensive supportive care including fluid management and treatment of specific symptoms, can improve survival chance. There is currently no specific treatment approved for Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever.\nThe mortality rate from CCHF is approximately 30%, with death occurring in the second week of illness. In patients who recover, improvement generally begins on the ninth or tenth day after the onset of illness.\nIt is difficult to prevent or control CCHF infection in animals and ticks as the tick-animal-tick cycle usually goes unnoticed and the infection in domestic animals is usually not apparent."}

In the absence of a vaccine, the only way to reduce infection in people is by raising awareness of the risk factors and educating people about the measures they can take to reduce exposure\nto the virus.\nFact sheets\nCrimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever\nDatabases and tools\nCrimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever outbreak toolbox\nDisease outbreak news\nLatest Disease Outbreak News\nCrimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever - Iraq\nWeekly epidemiological record (WER)\nTraining\nCrimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever: Introduction\nTechnical work\nDisease outbreaks\nNews\nAll →\n19 March 2025\nDepartmental update\nCrimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever in Iraq: a risk communication and community engagement success story\nPublications\nAll→\n17 May 2024\nInfection prevention an"}
