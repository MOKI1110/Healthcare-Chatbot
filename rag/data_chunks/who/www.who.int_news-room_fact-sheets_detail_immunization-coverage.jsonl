At least 30 countries in Africa plan to introduce malaria vaccines into their childhood immunization programmes.\nMeasles\nis a highly contagious disease caused by a virus, which usually results in a high fever and rash, and can lead to blindness, encephalitis or death. By the end of 2024, 84% of children had received 1 dose of measles-containing vaccine by their second birthday, and 76% of children received 2 doses of measles vaccine.
