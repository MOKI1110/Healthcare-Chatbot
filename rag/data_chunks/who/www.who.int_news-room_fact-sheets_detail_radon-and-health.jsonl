Radon is produced from the natural radioactive decay of uranium, which is found in all rocks and soils. Radon can also be found in water.\nRadon escapes from the ground into the air, where it decays and produces further radioactive particles."}

Radon can also be found in water.\nRadon escapes from the ground into the air, where it decays and produces further radioactive particles. As we breathe, these particles are deposited on the cells lining the airways, where they can damage DNA and potentially cause lung cancer.\nOutdoors, radon quickly dilutes to very low concentrations and is generally not a problem. The average outdoor radon level\n(1)\nvaries from 5 Bq/m\n3\nto 15 Bq/m\n3\n. However, radon concentrations are higher indoors and in areas with minimal ventilation, with highest levels found in places like mines, caves and water treatment facilities. In buildings such as homes, schools, offices, radon levels can vary substantially from 10 Bq/m\n3\nto more than 10 000 Bq/m\n3\n. Given the properties of radon, occupants of such buildings could unknowingly be living or working in very high radon levels.\nHealth effects of radon\nRadon is a major cause of lung cancer."}

It is estimated that radon causes between 3% to 14% of all lung cancers in a country, depending on the national average radon level and the smoking prevalence.\nAn increased rate of lung cancer was first seen in uranium miners exposed to very high concentrations of radon. In addition, studies in Europe, North America and China have confirmed that even low concentrations of radon – such as those commonly found in residential settings – also pose health risks and contribute to the occurrence of lung cancers worldwide.\nThe risk of lung cancer increases by about 16% per 100 Bq/m\n3\nincrease in long time average radon concentration. The dose-response relation is assumed to be linear – i.e. the risk of lung cancer increases proportionally with increasing radon exposure.\nRadon is much more likely to cause lung cancer in people who smoke. In fact, smokers are estimated to be 25 times more at risk from radon than non-smokers."}

The concentration of radon in buildings depends on:\nthe local geology, for example the uranium content and permeability of the underlying rocks and soils;\nthe routes available for the passage of radon from the soil into the building;\nthe radon exhalation from building materials; and\nthe rate of exchange between indoor and outdoor air, which depends on the construction of the building, the ventilation habits of the occupants, and the air-tightness of the building.\nRadon enters buildings through cracks in the floors or at floor-wall junctions, gaps around pipes or cables, small pores in hollow-block walls, cavity walls, or sum"}

Radon levels are usually higher in basements, cellars and living spaces in contact with the ground.  However, considerable radon concentration can also be found above the ground floor.\nRadon concentrations vary considerably between adjacent buildings, as well as within a building from day to day and from hour to hour. Because of these fluctuations, it is preferable to estimate the annual mean concentration of radon in indoor air by measurements for at least 3 months. Residential radon levels can be measured in an inexpensive and simple manner by means of small passive detectors. Measurements need to be based on national protocols to ensure consistency as well as reliability for decision-making."}
