It is achieved through use of contraceptive methods and the treatment of infertility.\nContraceptive information and services are fundamental to the health and human rights of all individuals.\nThe prevention of unintended pregnancies helps to lower maternal ill-health and the number of pregnancy-related deaths. Delaying pregnancies in young girls who are at increased risk of health problems from early childbearing, and preventing pregnancies among older women who also face increased risks, are important health benefits of family planning.\nBy reducing rates of unintended pregnancies, contraception also reduces the need for unsafe abortion and reduces HIV transmissions from mothers to newborns. This can also benefit the education of girls and create opportunities for women to participate more fully in society, including paid employment.\nAn estimated 164 million women of reproductive age have an unmet need for contraception."}

Reasons for this include:\nlimited access to contraception\na limited choice of methods\na fear or experience of side-effects\ncultural or religious opposition\npoor quality of available services\ngender-based barriers.\nSatisfying demand\nIt is important that family planning is widely available and easily accessible through trained health workers to anyone who is sexually active, including adolescents.\nThere are many cadres of health care workers who are trained to provide (where authorised) locally available and culturally acceptable contraceptive methods including doctors and midwives. Other trained health workers, for example community health workers,\nalso provide counselling and some family planning methods, for example pills and condoms. For methods such as sterilization, women and men need to be referred to a clinician.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals set for 2030 will need to ensure that sexual and reproductive health services are widely available and used."}
