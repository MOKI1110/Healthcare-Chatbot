Despite its very high MMR in 2023, sub-Saharan Africa also achieved a substantial reduction in MMR of 40% between 2000 and 2023.\nThe greatest reduction in lifetime risk of maternal death during this period occurred in the region of central and southern Asia, with an 83% fall in risk from 1 in 71 in 2000 to 1 in 410 in 2023."}

In five regions, the lifetime risk of maternal mortality reduced by more than half: sub-Saharan Africa, northern Africa and western Asia, Australia and New Zealand, eastern and south-eastern Asia, and Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand).\nWhere do maternal deaths occur?\nThe high number of maternal deaths in some areas of the world reflects inequalities in access to quality health services and highlights the gap between rich and poor. The MMR in low-income countries in 2023 was 346 per 100 000 live births versus 10 per 100 000 live births in high income countries.\nIn 2023, 37 countries were classified as being in conflict or institutional/social fragility\n(1)\n, accounting for 61% of global maternal deaths despite representing only 25% of global live births."}

The MMR is significantly higher in conflict-affected areas (504 deaths per 100 000 live births) compared to fragile settings (368) and non-conflict nor fragile settings (99).\nWomen in low-income countries have a higher lifetime risk of death of maternal death. A woman’s lifetime risk of maternal death is the probability that a 15-year-old woman will eventually die from a maternal cause. In high income countries, this is 1 in 7933, versus 1 in 66 in low-income countries.\nWhy do women die?\nWomen die as a result of complications during and following pregnancy and childbirth. Most of these complications develop during pregnancy and most are preventable or treatable. Other complications may exist before pregnancy but are worsened during pregnancy, especially if not managed as part of the woman’s care."}

All women, including adolescents, need access to contraception, safe abortion services to the full extent of the law, and quality post-abortion care.\nMost maternal deaths are preventable, as the health-care solutions to prevent or manage complications are well known. All women need access to high quality care in pregnancy, and during and after childbirth. Maternal health and newborn health are closely linked."}

It is particularly important that all births are attended by skilled health professionals, as timely management and treatment can make the difference between life and death for the women as well as for the newborns.\nSevere bleeding after birth can kill a healthy woman within hours if she is unattended. Injecting oxytocics immediately after childbirth effectively reduces the risk of bleeding.\nInfection after childbirth can be eliminated if good hygiene is practised and if early signs of infection are recognized and treated in a timely manner.\nPre-eclampsia\nshould be detected and appropriately managed before the onset of convulsions (eclampsia) and other life-threatening complications."}

It is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic contributed to this via two mechanisms: (i) indirect obstetric deaths – where the woman had SARS-CoV-2 infection and died as a result of the interaction between COVID-19 and her pregnant state; and/or (ii) direct obstetric deaths – where disruptions to health services hindered access to and/or quality of care resulting in pregnancy complications that ended in mortality, when they may otherwise have been prevented or managed successfully (\n4)\n. The data show that this interruption to the downward trajectory of global MMR was short-lived."}

In 2022, the global MMR and number of maternal deaths were lower than they had been in the three years immediately prior to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe Sustainable Development Goals and maternal mortality\nIn the context of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), countries have united behind the target to accelerate the decline of maternal mortality by 2030. SDG 3 includes an ambitious target: “reducing the global MMR to less than 70 per 100 000 births, with no country having a maternal mortality rate of more than twice the global average”.\nThe global MMR in 2023 was 197 per 100 000 live births; achieving a global MMR below 70 by the year 2030 will require an annual rate of reduction of almost 15%, a rate that has rarely been achieved at the national level.
