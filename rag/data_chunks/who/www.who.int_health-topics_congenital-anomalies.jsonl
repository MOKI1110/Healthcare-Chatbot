Also called birth defects, congenital anomalies\nor congenital malformations, these conditions develop prenatally and may be\nidentified before or at birth, or later in life. An estimated 6% of babies\nworldwide are born with a congenital disorder, resulting in hundreds of\nthousands of associated deaths. However, the true number of cases may be much\nhigher because statistics do not often consider terminated pregnancies and\nstillbirths.\nSome congenital disorders can be treated with surgical and non-surgical\noptions, such as cleft lip and palate, clubfoot and hernias."}

Others, including\nheart defects, neural tube defects, and down syndrome, can cause lifelong\nimpacts.\nCongenital disorders are one of the main causes of the global burden of\ndisease, and low- and middle-income countries are disproportionately affected.\nThese areas are also less likely to have facilities to treat reversible conditions\nsuch as clubfoot, leading to more pronounced and long-lasting effects.\nCauses\nApproximately 50% of\ncongenital disorders cannot be linked to a specific cause. However, known\ncauses include single gene defects, chromosomal disorders, multifactorial\ninheritance, environmental teratogens and micronutrient deficiencies. Genetic\ncauses can be traced to inherited genes or from mutations. Consanguinity – when\nparents are related by blood – increases the risk of congenital anomalies and\nnearly doubles the risk of neonatal and early childhood death, intellectual\ndisability and other health conditions."}

Advanced maternal age also increases\nthe risk of chromosomal abnormalities, including Down syndrome. Some diseases\nare known to cause increases in rates of congenital disorders including Zika\nvirus, syphilis and rubella. Other anomalies, such as cystic fibrosis and\nhaemophilia C, are more prevalent in specific ethnic communities.\nThe vast majority\n(94%) of congenital disorders occur in low- and middle-income countries.\nPossible causes include lack of screening and prenatal care, insufficient\naccess to nutritious foods for pregnant women, use or contact with alcohol or\ntobacco, and increased exposure to infection or environmental\ncontaminants.\nSome congenital disorders\ncan be prevented through screening, vaccination, fortification of staple foods\nwith nutrients such as folic acid and iodine, and adequate antenatal care,\namong other methods.\nImpact\nAround the world each year, an estimated 295 000 newborns die before\nreaching 4 weeks of age due to congenital disorders and associated\ncompl"}

Over 50% of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) lost each year\ndue to congenital disorders could be prevented with prompt surgery or other treatment.\nFor example, 100 000 babies are born each year with clubfoot, which can be\neasily corrected. Left untreated, however, this condition can cause severe and\npermanent disability.\nMany congenital disorders result in social stigma and discrimination, which\ncan lead to embarrassment, isolation and other reductions in community\ninteraction. These conditions also have a high economic cost; long-term\ndisability creates significant impact on individuals, families, health care\nsystems and societies."}
