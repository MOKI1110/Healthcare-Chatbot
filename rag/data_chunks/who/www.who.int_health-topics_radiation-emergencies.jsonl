Radiological emergencies are situations involving a radiation exposure from a radioactive source. When referring to an emergency situation regardless of its type, “radiation emergency” term is often used.\nRadiation emergencies may result from misuse of radioactive sources during industrial, medical or research applications, accidental exposure to uncontrolled (abandoned, lost or stolen) radiation sources, accidents during transport of radioactive materials, but also can be combined with conventional emergencies (a fire or a release of chemical substances), natural disasters, military conflicts, or malicious acts involving radiation sources.\nImpact\nRadiation emergencies can greatly impact human health and  the en"}

The impact will vary considerably, depending on the scenario, scale of the emergency, type of radiation and exposure duration, the pathway of the exposure (external, internal, or combined), availability and timeliness of countermeasures, as well as individual characteristics of the exposed person (age, gender, underlying state of health).\nAs a result, people may be exposed to radiation levels ranging from very low doses not resulting in any clinical manifestations of such exposure, to higher doses which may cause radiation injuries (a.k.a. “tissue reactions”) or even be fatal. The risk of health effects increases with the radiation dose."}

The risk of health effects increases with the radiation dose. Workers at nuclear installations, first responders and fire-fighters are at higher risk of being over-exposed to radiation and receiving radiation injures, whereas, for the majority of people affected by the consequences of a nuclear emergency, it will be unlikely to suffer the direct impact of radiation.\nIn addition, urgent protective actions implemented in response to a radiation emergency, such as sheltering, evacuation, or resettling from contaminated areas, restrictions on locally produced foodstuffs etc. may also lead to negative socio-economic impact on the human lives and the society as a whole."}
