Due to the broad-based benefits of these goods, related externalities, and often multisectoral nature, targeted action and investments are necessary by both governments and the global community.\nCommon goods for health generally fall into five categories:\nPolicy and Coordination (ex. disease control policies and strategies)\nTaxes and Subsidies (ex. taxes on products with impact on health to create market signals leading to behaviour change)\nRegulations and Legislation (ex. environmental regulations and guidelines)\nInformation, analysis & communication* (ex. surveillance systems)\nPopulation Services* (ex."}

These must be inclusive of all groups and will need to be monitored and formally linked with national budgetary processes.\nRegulation and legislation\nRefers to use of a government’s coercive power to impose constraints on organizations and individuals."}

Well-functioning health systems rely on strong governance, clear regulations and standards, population-based services and coordinated policies, all of which are common goods for health. Common goods for heath provide the economic rationale for why it is necessary for governments to invest in\nInternational Health Regulation 2005\ncapacities for health security and critical functions to ensure progress towards universal health coverage.\nThe common goods for health agenda must be integrated into annual and multiyear budget dialogues as well as health financing and national budget reform dialogues. Financing these cross-cutting functions requires pooled resources, as well as coordination across relevant sectors. Medium-term expenditure frameworks can aid in this coordination and can make sure common goods for health are prioritized over time and across levels of government, even in the face of fiscal and political constraints."}
