Estimates suggest that approximately one in every six people of reproductive age worldwide experience infertility in their lifetime.\nIn the male reproductive system, infertility is\nmost commonly caused\nby problems in the ejection of semen, absence or low levels of sperm, or abnormal shape (morphology) and movement (motility) of the sperm.\nIn the female reproductive system, infertility may be caused by a range of abnormalities of the ovaries, uterus, fallopian tubes, and the endocrine system, among others.\nInfertility can be primary or secondary. Primary infertility is when a pregnancy has never been achieved by a person, and secondary infertility is when at least one prior pregnancy has been achieved.\nFertility care encompasses the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infertility. Equal and equitable access to fertility care remains a challenge in most countries; particularly in low and middle-income countries."}

Fertility care is rarely prioritized in national universal health coverage benefit packages.\nOverview\nInfertility is a disease of the male or female reproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months or more of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. Infertility may occur due to male, female or unexplained factors. Some causes of infertility are preventable. Treatment of infertility often involves in-vitro fertilization (IVF) and other types of medically assisted reproduction.\nWhat causes infertility?\nInfertility may be caused by a number of different factors, in either the male or female reproductive systems."}

However, it is sometimes not possible to explain the causes of infertility.\nIn the female reproductive system, infertility may be caused by:\ntubal disorders such as blocked fallopian tubes, which are in turn caused by untreated sexually transmitted infections (STIs) or complications of unsafe abortion, postpartum sepsis or abdominal/pelvic surgery;\nuterine disorders which could be inflammatory in nature (such as such endometriosis), congenital in nature (such as septate uterus), or benign in nature (such as fibroids);\ndisorders of the ovaries, such as polycystic ovarian syndrome and other follicular disorders;\ndisorders of the endocrine system causing imbalances of reproductive hormones.

Examples of common disorders affecting this system include pituitary cancers and hypopituitarism.\nThe\nrelative importance of these causes\nof female infertility may differ from country to country, for example due to differences in the background prevalence of STIs, or differing ages of populations studied.\nIn the male reproductive system, infertility may be caused by:\nobstruction of the reproductive tract causing dysfunctionalities in the ejection of semen. This blockage can occur in the tubes that carry semen (such as ejaculatory ducts and seminal vesicles). Blockages are commonly due to injuries or infections of the genital tract;\nhormonal disorders leading to abnormalities in hormones produced by the pituitary gland, hypothalamus and testicles – hormones such as testosterone regulate sperm production."}

In addition, exposure to environmental pollutants and toxins can be directly toxic to gametes (eggs and sperm), resulting in their decreased numbers and poor quality\n(1,2)\n.\nWhy addressing infertility is important?\nEvery human being has a right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health."}

Inequities and disparities in access to fertility care services adversely affect the poor, unmarried, uneducated, unemployed and other marginalized populations.\nAddressing infertility can also mitigate gender inequality. Although both women and men can experience infertility, women in a relationship with a man are often perceived to suffer from infertility, regardless of whether they are infertile or not."}

Infertility has significant negative social impacts on the lives of infertile couples and particularly women, who frequently experience violence, divorce, social stigma, emotional stress, depression, anxiety and low self-esteem.\nIn some settings, fear of infertility can deter women and men from using contraception if they feel socially pressured to prove their fertility at an early age because of a high social value of childbearing.  In such situations, education and awareness-raising interventions to address understanding of the prevalence and determinants of fertility and infertility is essential.\nAddressing challenges\nAvailability, access, and quality of interventions to address infertility remain a challenge in most countries. Diagnosis and treatment of infertility is often not prioritized in national population and development policies and reproductive health strategies and are rarely covered through public health financing."}

Moreover, a lack of trained personnel and the necessary equipment and infrastructure, and the currently high costs of treatment medicines, are major barriers even for countries that are actively addressing the needs of people with infertility.\nWhile assisted reproduction technologies (ART) have been available for more than three decades, with  millions of children born worldwide from ART interventions such as in vitro fertilization (IVF), these technologies are still largely unavailable, inaccessible and unaffordable in many parts of the world, particularly in low and middle-income countries (LMIC).\nGovernment policies could mitigate the many inequities in access to safe and effective fertility care.
