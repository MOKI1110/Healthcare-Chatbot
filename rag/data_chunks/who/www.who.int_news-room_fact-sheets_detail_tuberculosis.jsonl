Globally, TB is the world’s leading cause of death from a single infectious agent and among the top 10 causes of death.\nTB was also both the leading killer of people with HIV in 2024 and a major cause of deaths related to antimicrobial resistance.\nIn 2024, an estimated 10.7 million people fell ill with TB worldwide, including 5.8 million men, 3.7 million women and 1.2 million children. TB is present in all countries and age groups.\nMultidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB) remains a public health crisis and a health security threat."}

Only about 2 in 5 people with drug-resistant TB accessed treatment in 2024.\nGlobal efforts to combat TB have saved an estimated 83 million lives since the year 2000.\nTB is preventable and curable.\nOverview\nTuberculosis (TB) is an infectious disease caused by bacteria that most often affects the lungs. It spreads through the air when people with TB cough, sneeze or spit.\nTuberculosis is preventable and curable.\nAbout a quarter of the global population is estimated to have been infected with TB bacteria. In general, people with TB infection don’t feel sick and are not contagious. About 5–10% of people infected with TB will eventually get symptoms and develop TB disease. Babies and children are at higher risk of developing the disease if they are infected.\nTB disease is usually treated with antibiotics and can be fatal without treatment.\nIn certain countries, the Bacille Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine is given to babies or small children to prevent TB."}

The vaccine prevents deaths from TB and protects children from serious forms of TB.\nCertain conditions can increase a person’s risk for TB disease:\ndiabetes (high blood sugar);\nweakened immune system (for example, from HIV);\nundernutrition;\ntobacco use; and\nharmful use of alcohol.\nSymptoms\nIn general, people with TB infection don’t feel sick and are not contagious. Only a small proportion of people who get infected with TB will get TB disease and develop symptoms. Babies and children are at higher risk of developing the disease if they are infected.\nTB disease occurs when bacteria multiply in the body and affect different organs. TB symptoms may be mild for many months, so it is easy to spread TB to others without knowing it. Symptoms depend on which part of the body is affected."}

While TB usually affects the lungs, it can also involve the kidneys, brain, spine and skin.\nPrevention\nFollow these steps to help prevent tuberculosis infection and spread:\nSeek medical attention if you have symptoms like prolonged cough, fever and unexplained weight loss as early treatment for TB can help stop the spread of disease and improve your chances of recovery.\nGet screened for TB if you are at increased risk, such as if you have HIV or are in contact with people who have TB in your household or workplace.\nTB preventive treatment (or TPT) prevents infection from becoming disease."}

All these tests are accurate and can provide initial results to guide treatment decisions within 48 hours of sample collection."}

Use of these tests will lead to major improvements in the early detection of TB and drug-resistant TB.\nDiagnosing drug-resistant forms of TB, including multidrug-resistant TB, as well as HIV-associated TB and pediatric TB can be complex. WHO recommends specific sample types, tests and strategies to detect these forms of TB to increase the chances of detecting disease early and accurately.\nA tuberculin skin test (TST), interferon gamma release assay (IGRA) or newer antigen-based skin test (TBST) can be used to identify people with TB infection. The results from these TB infection tests are used to identify which individuals with a high risk of TB will benefit most from TB preventive treatment.\nTreatment\nTuberculosis disease is treated with special antibiotics. Treatment is recommended for both TB infection and disease.\nThe most common antibiotics used are:\nrifampicin;\nisoniazid;\npyrazinamide; and\nethambutol.\nTo be effective, medications need to be taken daily for 4–6 months."}

MDR-TB is treatable and curable by using other drugs, which tend to be more expensive and with more side effects. People exposed to MDR-TB may receive TB preventive treatment with levofloxacin.\nIn some cases, extensively drug-resistant TB or XDR-TB can develop."}

Only about 2 in 5 people with multidrug-resistant TB accessed treatment in 2024.\nIn accordance with WHO guidelines, detection of MDR-TB requires bacteriological confirmation of TB and testing for drug resistance using rapid molecular tests or culture methods.\nIn 2022, new WHO guidelines prioritized a short 6-month all-oral regimen known as BPaLM/BPaL as a treatment of choice for eligible patients. Globally in 2024, approximately 34 000 people with MDR/RR-TB were reported to have started treatment on the 6-month shorter regimens (known as BPaLM and BDLLfxC), a substantial increase from 5653 in 2023 and 1744 in 2022."}

The shorter duration, lower pill burden and high efficacy of this novel regimen can help ease the burden on health systems and save precious resources to further expand the diagnostic and treatment coverage for all individuals in need. WHO recommends expanded access to all-oral regimens.\nTB and HIV\nPeople living with HIV are 12 times more likely to fall ill with TB disease than people without HIV. TB is the leading cause of death among people with HIV.\nHIV and TB form a lethal combination, each accelerating the other's progress. In 2024, about 150 000 people died of HIV-associated TB. The percentage of people who fell ill with TB and had a documented HIV test result was 82% in 2024. This was a slight increase from 81% in 2023.

Scale-up of TB treatment and ART since 2005 is estimated to have averted 9.8 million deaths.\nImpact\nTB mostly affects adults in their most productive years. However, all age groups are at risk. Over 80% of cases and deaths are in low- and middle-income countries.\nTB occurs in every part of the world.
