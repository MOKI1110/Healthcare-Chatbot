There is no specific treatment for dengue/severe dengue, and early detection and access to proper medical care greatly lower fatality rates of severe dengue.\nOverview\nDengue (break-bone fever) is a viral infection that is spread from mosquitoes to people. It is more common in tropical and subtropical than in temperate climates.\nMost people who get dengue do not have symptoms."}

For those who do, the most common symptoms are high fever, headache, body aches, nausea and rash. Most get better in 1–2 weeks. Some develop severe dengue and need care in a hospital.\nIn severe cases, dengue can be fatal.\nYou can lower your risk of dengue by avoiding mosquito bites, especially during the day.\nDengue is treated through pain management as there is no specific treatment currently.\nSymptoms\nMost people with dengue have mild or no symptoms and will get better in 1–2 weeks. Rarely, dengue can be severe and lead to death.\nIf symptoms occur, they usually begin 4–10 days after infection and last for 2–7 days. Symptoms may include:\nhigh fever (40°C/104°F)\nsevere headache\npain behind the eyes\nmuscle and joint pains\nnausea\nvomiting\nswollen glands\nrash.\nIndividuals who are infected for the second time are at greater risk of severe dengue."}

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen and aspirin should be avoided as they can increase the risk of bleeding.\nFor people with severe dengue, hospitalization is often necessary.\nGlobal burden\nThe incidence of dengue has grown dramatically worldwide in recent decades, with the number of cases reported to WHO increasing from 505 430 cases in 2000 to 14.6 million in 2024."}

Most people are viremic for about 4–5 days, but viremia can last as long as 12 days.\nMaternal transmission\nThe primary mode of transmission of the DENV between humans involves mosquito vectors.
