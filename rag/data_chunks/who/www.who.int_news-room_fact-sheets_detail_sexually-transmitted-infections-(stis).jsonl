Some STIs can also be transmitted from mother-to-child during pregnancy, childbirth and breastfeeding, and unsafe blood transfusion. Eight pathogens are linked to the greatest incidence of STIs. Of these, 4 are currently curable: syphilis, gonorrhoea, chlamydia and trichomoniasis."}

These herald increasing challenges in the provision of adequate services for STIs prevention and control.\nScope of the problem\nSTIs have a profound impact on sexual and reproductive health worldwide.\nMore than 1 million curable STIs are acquired every day.

Although highly effective, condoms do not offer protection for STIs that cause extra-genital ulcers (i.e., syphilis or genital herpes). When possible, condoms should be used in all vaginal, oral and anal sex.\nSafe and highly effective vaccines are available for 2 viral STIs: hepatitis B and HPV. These vaccines have represented major advances in STI prevention. To eliminate cervical cancer as a public health problem globally, high coverage targets for HPV vaccination, screening and treatment of precancerous lesions, and management of cancer must be reached by 2030 and maintained at this high level for decades.\nThe development of vaccines against STIs are a major priority to control STIs worldwide.

Other biomedical interventions to prevent some STIs include adult voluntary medical male circumcision, microbicides, and partner treatment.\nDiagnosis of STIs\nSTIs are often asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they can be non-specific.\nAccurate diagnostic tests for STIs (using molecular technology) are widely used in high-income countries.
