In low-to-middle income countries, as many as 4 in 100 people die from unsafe care (1).\nAbove 50% of harm (1 in every 20 patients) is preventable; half of this harm is attributed to medications (2,3).\nSome estimates suggest that as many as 4 in 10 patients are harmed in primary and ambulatory settings, while up to 80% (23.6–85%) of this harm can be avoided (4).\nCommon adverse events that may result in avoidable patient harm are medication errors, unsafe surgical procedures, health care-associated infections, diagnostic errors, patient falls, pressure ulcers, patient misidentification, unsafe blood transfusion and venous thromboembolism.\nPatient harm potentially reduces global economic growth by 0.7% a year. On a global scale, the indirect cost of harm amounts to trillions of US dollars each year (1).\nInvestment in reducing patient harm can lead to significant financial savings, and more importantly better patient outcomes (5)."}
