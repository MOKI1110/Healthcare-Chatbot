The field is multidisciplinary, and uses a combination of laboratory and bioinformatic techniques to investigate genomes’ structure, function, how they have evolved and how they can be edited.\nLandmark achievements in the early 2000s, culminating with the publication of the first reference human genome, have transformed scientific discovery of diseases and launched a powerful era in genetic medicine."}

Recent breakthroughs include:\nadvances in the field of pharmacogenomics, where genomic information is used to study individual responses to drugs and enable the development of targeted therapies;\nthe publication of the first human 'pangenome', representing the genetic diversity of the species; and\nthe development of genome editing approaches, including by CRISPR/Cas9 technology.\nCollectively, these innovations have reshaped the understanding of the genetic basis of complex diseases, of genotype–phenotype relationships, the way health information is generated and how knowledge is translated in novel medicine and public health practice.\nHealth-related applications\nGenomics is evolving rapidly, and its potential impact for the future of human health cannot yet be known."}
