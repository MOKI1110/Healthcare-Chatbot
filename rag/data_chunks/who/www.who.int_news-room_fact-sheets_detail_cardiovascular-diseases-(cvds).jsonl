Of these deaths, 85% were due to      heart attack and stroke.\nOver three quarters of CVD deaths take place in low- and      middle-income countries.\nOut of the 18 million premature deaths (under the age of 70) due to      noncommunicable diseases in 2021, at least 38% were caused by CVDs.\nMost cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing      behavioural and environmental risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy      diet (including excess salt, sugar, and fats) and obesity, physical inactivity, harmful use of alcohol and air pollution.\nIt is important to detect cardiovascular disease as early as      possible so that management with counselling and medicines can begin.\nOverview\nCardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are a group of disorders of the heart and blood vessels."}

They include:\ncoronary heart disease – a disease of the blood vessels supplying the heart muscle;\ncerebrovascular disease – a disease of the blood vessels supplying the brain;\nperipheral arterial disease – a disease of blood vessels supplying the arms and legs;\nrheumatic heart disease – damage to the heart muscle and heart valves from rheumatic fever, caused by streptococcal bacteria;\ncongenital heart disease – birth defects that affect the normal development and functioning of the heart caused by malformations of the heart structure from birth; and\ndeep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism – blood clots in the leg veins, which can dislodge and move to the heart and lungs.\nHeart attacks and strokes are usually acute events and are mainly caused by a blockage that prevents blood from flowing to the heart or brain. The most common reason for this is a build-up of fatty deposits on the inner walls of the blood vessels that\nsupply the heart or brain."}

The most common reason for this is a build-up of fatty deposits on the inner walls of the blood vessels that\nsupply the heart or brain. Strokes can be caused by bleeding from a blood vessel in the brain or from blood clots.\nRisk factors for cardiovascular disease\nThe most important behavioural risk factors of heart disease and stroke are unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use and harmful use of alcohol. Amongst environmental risk factors, air pollution is an important factor. The effects of behavioural risk factors may show up in individuals as raised blood pressure, raised blood glucose, raised blood lipids, and overweight and obesity. These “intermediate risks factors” can be measured in primary care facilities and indicate an increased risk of heart attack, stroke, heart failure and other complications.\nCessation of tobacco use, reduction of salt in the diet, eating more fruit and vegetables, regular physical activity and avoiding harmful use of alcohol have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease."}

Health policies that create conducive environments for making healthy choices affordable and available, as well as improving air quality and reducing pollution, are essential for motivating people to adopt and sustain healthy behaviours.\nThere are also a number of underlying determinants of CVDs. These are a reflection of the major forces driving social, economic and cultural change – globalization, urbanization and population ageing. Other determinants of CVDs include poverty,\nstress and hereditary factors.\nIn addition, drug treatment of hypertension, diabetes and high blood lipids are necessary to reduce cardiovascular risk and prevent heart attacks and strokes among people with these conditions.\nCommon symptoms of cardiovascular diseases\nSymptoms of heart attacks and strokes\nOften, there are no symptoms of the underlying disease of the blood vessels.
