This will cause chickenpox, not shingles.\nA safe and effective vaccine is available to prevent shingles and its complications.\nAntiviral medications can reduce the severity and duration of shingles, especially if started early.\nOverview\nShingles, also known as herpes zoster, is a viral infection that causes a painful rash. It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus (VZV), the same virus that causes chickenpox. After a person recovers from chickenpox, the virus remains inactive in the body. Shingles occurs when the virus reactivates later in life, often when the immune system is weakened."}

However, it's much more common in adults over the age of 50. The risk increases with age because the immune system tends to weaken, making it harder to keep the VZV suppressed.\nOther factors that can increase the risk of shingles include:\nWeakened immune system.\nConditions like HIV and AIDS, cancer, and organ transplantation, as well as medications that suppress the immune system, can increase the risk.\nStress.\nPeriods of high stress may temporarily weaken the immune system, potentially triggering a shingles outbreak.\nCertain medical conditions.\nConditions like diabetes, chronic kidney disease and lung disease may increase the risk.\nSymptoms\nThe most common symptom of shingles is a painful rash. They include the following.\nPain, itching, tingling, or numbness usually occurs\nbefore\nthe rash appears. This can happen days or even weeks before the rash.\nA rash typically appears on one side of the body, often as a single stripe or band of blisters.

Contact your health-care provider right away.\nThe rash consists of small, fluid-filled blisters that break open and crust over within a few days.\nSome people may experience fever, headache, chills and fatigue.\nThe pain associated with shingles can be intense and is often described as burning, throbbing or stabbing.\nTransmission\nShingles itself is not contagious, so you can’t get shingles from someone who has it.\nHowever, you can spread the varicella-zoster virus (VZV) to someone who has never had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine. In that case, they would develop chickenpox, not shingles.\nThe virus spreads through direct contact with the fluid from the shingles blisters."}

The unique pattern – a stripe of blisters on one side of the body – is often a clear indicator.\nIf the diagnosis is uncertain, especially if the rash is atypical or if there are complications, a sample from a blister can be sent to a lab for testing.
