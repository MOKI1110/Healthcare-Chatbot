These give way to strategies for promotion and\nprevention across the life course.\nOptimizing brain health\nby addressing these determinants not only improves mental and\nphysical health but also creates positive social and economic impacts that\ncontribute to greater well-being and help advance society.\nHowever, conditions affecting the brain and nervous system in general emerge\nthroughout the life course and are characterized by disruptions in brain\ngrowth, damage to brain structure and/or impaired brain functioning. These\ninclude for example congenital and neurodevelopmental conditions as well as\nneurological disorders across the life."}

These\ninclude for example congenital and neurodevelopmental conditions as well as\nneurological disorders across the life. Health and social care for these\nconditions require multisectoral and interdisciplinary collaborations with a holistic\nperson-centred approach focused on promotion, prevention, treatment, care and\nrehabilitation and the active engagement of persons with lived experience,\ntheir families and carers.\nBurden\nThe global burden of neurological and neurodevelopmental conditions is high,\nwith approximately 70% of the burden in low- and middle-income countries.\nNeurological conditions are the leading cause of disability adjusted life years\n(DALYs) and account for about 9 million deaths per year.\nThe largest contributors of neurological DALYs in 2016 were stroke (42.2%),\nmigraine (16.3%), dementia (10.4%), meningitis (7.9%) and epilepsy (5%).\nParkinson disease, propelled by an increasingly ageing population, is the\nfastest growing neurological disorder. Premature birth, neonatal encephalopathy\nand neuroinfections contribute substantially to high disease burden in South-East\nAsia and Africa."}

Premature birth, neonatal encephalopathy\nand neuroinfections contribute substantially to high disease burden in South-East\nAsia and Africa. In 2016, developmental disabilities accounted for 13.3% of the\n29.3 million years lived with disability for all health conditions among\nchildren younger than 5 years.\nDespite the large burden, only 28% of low-income countries have a dedicated\npolicy for neurological diseases in comparison with 64% of high-income\ncountries. Available resources for these conditions are insufficient in most\ncountries, with unacceptably high treatment gaps for many neurological and\nneurodevelopmental conditions. For example, in low- and middle-income\ncountries, there are only three adult neurologists per 10 million people while\nhigh-income countries have approximately 160 times more. Resources for the\nassessment and care of children with neurological and neurodevelopmental\nconditions are even more scarce.\nWHO Response\nIn May 2022, WHO Member States adopted the\nIntersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders 2022–2031\n."}
