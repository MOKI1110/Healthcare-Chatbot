It is one of the most common types of cancer worldwide. It can cause severe harm and death.\nThe risk of colorectal cancer increases with age."}

Regular screenings are crucial for early detection.\nColon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. In 2020, more than 1.9 million new cases of colorectal cancer and more than 930 000 deaths due to colorectal cancer were estimated to have occurred worldwide. Large geographical variations in incidence and mortality rates were observed. The incidence rates were highest in Europe and Australia and New Zealand, and the mortality rates were highest in Eastern Europe."}

It can help to increase quality of life for people with colorectal cancer and their families.\nStages of care\na) Early stage disease\n. The primary treatment for early stage colorectal cancer (i.e. tumour limited to the bowel or local lymph nodes, with no metastatic dissemination to distant organs) is surgical removal of the tumour and nearby lymph nodes. The specific surgical procedure depends on the location of the tumour. It may involve a colectomy (removal of a portion of the colon) or a proctectomy (removal of the rectum). In some cases, a temporary or permanent colostomy or ileostomy may be needed to create an opening for waste elimination. Adjuvant therapy refers to additional treatment given after surgery to lower the risk of cancer recurrence. In early-stage colorectal cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy may be recommended to kill any remaining cancer cells that cannot be seen or removed during surgery. Adjuvant chemotherapy is typically recommended for patients with a higher risk of recurrence, such as those with lymph node involvement or certain tumour characteristics. Sometimes chemotherapy may be given before surgery (neoadjuvant chemotherapy) to shrink the tumour."}

Surveillance may include physical examinations, blood tests, and imaging studies (such as CT scans) to detect any potential recurrence at an early stage.\na) Advanced disease.\nSystemic therapy is the primary treatment approach for metastatic colorectal cancer, as it aims to treat cancer cells throughout the body. Chemotherapy is often used as the first-line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer. Combination chemotherapy regimens are commonly used to kill cancer cells or slow down their growth.
