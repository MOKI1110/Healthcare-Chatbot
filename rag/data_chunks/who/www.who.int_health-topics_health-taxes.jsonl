These taxes are considered win-win-win policies because they save lives and prevent disease while advancing health equity and mobilising revenue for the general budget. They can also be used for specific priorities such as financing universal health coverage (UHC) or highly cost-effective yet underutilised population health measures.\nThe aim of health tax policy is to reduce the consumption of products deemed risk factors for noncommunicable diseases by making them less affordable through higher prices."}

This is achieved with regular tax increases large enough to result in real price increases greater than economic growth.\nExcise taxes are the most effective tax measure for promoting health because they change the price a harmful product relative to other goods and can be easily increased over time.\nConsumption is reduced best with taxes based on the quantity (known as specific taxes) of an unhealthy product (such as packs of cigarettes) or its unhealthy ingredient (such as pure alcohol or sugar) rather than taxes based on the product’s value.\nImpact\nRaising health taxes is a SMART policy because it:\nS\naves lives\nTobacco, alcohol and sugar-sweetened beverages taxes are all effective and cost-effective ways of reducing consumption, preventing diseases and injuries and saving lives.\nM\nobilises revenue\nHealth taxes can be a revenue booster over the short and medium term."}

Accordingly, the net impact of health taxes is progressive once one fully accounts for the distribution of health benefits, income losses averted and reductions in catastrophic healthcare costs.\nR\neduces burdens on health systems\nAn ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure: health taxes are also a high-return investment in averted healthcare expenditure and increased workforce participation.\nT\nargets noncommunicable disease risk factors for the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals.\nBy targeting noncommunicable disease risk factors with health taxes, countries can progress their achievement of Sustainable Development Goal 3.4, which calls for a one-third reduction of"}
