Baked and fried street and restaurant foods often contain industrially produced trans fat. Trans fat can also be found naturally in meat and dairy foods from ruminant animals (e.g. cows, sheep, goats)."}

Both industrially produced and naturally occurring trans fat are equally harmful.\nIndustrially produced trans fat can be eliminated and replaced with healthier fats or oils without changing cost, taste or availability of food.\nWHO’s recommendation for adults is to limit consumption of trans fat to less than 1% of total energy intake, which is less than 2.2 g per day for a 2000-calorie diet.\nOverview\nCardiovascular diseases are the leading cause of mortality in the world. Major risk factors are unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, tobacco and alcohol use. Among other dietary factors, high intake of trans fat increases the risk of death from any cause by 34%, coronary heart disease deaths by 28%, and coronary heart disease by 21%. Trans fat has no known health benefits.\nTrans fat is produced industrially by the partial hydrogenation of any liquid oils, in most cases vegetable oils, but also occurs naturally in meat and dairy products from ruminant animals."}

WHO developed a REPLACE action package that supports governments to design and implement a policy to eliminate industrially produced trans fat from their food supply.\nAbout trans fats\nUse of trans fats increased dramatically in recent years because they tend to be cheaper than healthier fats and have several chemical and physical characteristics, such as being solid at room temperature, that make them suitable for a variety of processed food products.\nIndustrially produced trans fats are formed in an industrial process that adds hydrogen to vegetable oil, converting the liquid into a solid and resulting in partially hydrogenated oil (PHO). On average, trans fat concentrations in PHO are 25–45%. Naturally occurring trans fats come from ruminants (such as cows and sheep), are found in meat and dairy foods, and are equally harmful as industrially produced trans fat.\nFrying oil at high temperatures leads to modest increases in trans fat concentrations."}

However, this amount of trans fat generated is low (up to 2–3 %) when compared with the amount of trans fat in PHO.\nWhat governments do\nReplacing trans fat with healthier oils and fats in food supply is a low-cost solution for governments to save the lives of their citizens. Experiences in several countries demonstrate that industrially produced trans fat can be replaced by healthier oils. Costs of implementing best practice interventions (i.e. regulatory limits on trans fat) are well under the commonly accepted thresholds of cost-effectiveness. Thus, WHO recommends trans fat elimination as a cost-effective intervention for low- and middle-income countries."}

Governments can eliminate the cause of 7% of cardiovascular disease globally with a low-cost investment.\nExperiences in several countries demonstrate that mandatory approaches are much more effective than voluntary approaches to reducing trans fat in the food supply and in the population.\nWHO recommends the following two best-practice alternatives:\n1) mandatory national limit of 2 grams of industrially produced trans fat per 100 grams of total fat in all foods; and\n2) mandatory national ban on the production or use of partially hydrogenated oils (a major source of trans fat) as an ingredient in all foods.\nPHO in foods can be replaced by oils rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), followed by oils rich in monounsaturated fatty-acids (MUFA). Oils rich in PUFA include those from safflower, corn, sunflower, soybean, fatty fishes, walnuts and seeds; oils rich in MUFA include canola, olive, peanut, and oils from nuts and avocados."}
