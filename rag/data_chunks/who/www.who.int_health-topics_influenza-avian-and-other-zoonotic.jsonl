However, zoonotic influenza viruses - animal influenza viruses that may occasionally infect humans through direct or indirect contact - can cause disease in humans ranging from a mild illness to death.\nBirds are the natural hosts for\navian influenza viruses\n. After an outbreak of A(H5N1) virus in 1997 in poultry in Hong Kong SAR, China, since 2003, this avian and other influenza viruses have spread from Asia to Europe and Africa. In 2013, human infections with the influenza A(H7N9) virus were reported in China.\nMost\nswine influenza viruses\ndo not cause disease in humans, but some countries have reported cases of human infection from certain swine influenza viruses."}

Close proximity to infected pigs or visiting locations where pigs are exhibited has been reported for most human cases, but some limited human-to-human transmission has occurred.\nJust like birds and pigs, other animals such as horses and dogs, can be infected with their own influenza viruses (canine influenza viruses, equine influenza viruses, etc.).\nSymptoms\nAvian, swine and other zoonotic influenza infections in humans may cause disease ranging from mild upper respiratory infection (fever and cough) to rapid progression to severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome, shock and even death.\nGastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhea has been reported more frequently in A(H5N1) infection."}

Conjunctivitis has also been reported in influenza A(H7).\nDisease features such as the incubation period, severity of symptoms and clinical outcome varies by the virus causing infection but mainly manifests with respiratory symptoms.\nTreatment\nEvidence suggests that some\nantiviral drugs\n, notably\nneuraminidase inhibitor\n(oseltamivir, zanamivir), can reduce the duration of viral replication and improve prospects of survival, however ongoing clinical studies are needed."}
