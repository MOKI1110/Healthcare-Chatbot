Growth and development of transplantation worldwide is highly unequal and faces many challenges including:\nlack of national strategies for transplantation;\ninadequate legislation, ethical frameworks and regulation, which may allow for practices such as organ trafficking;\nlack of donation, processing and transplantation infrastructure;\ndeficient universal health coverage, meaning that access to transplantation is excluded; and\nlow awareness and engagement amongst the public and healthcare professionals.\nEthical concerns are a major issue."}

The shortage of organs can lead to illegal activities, like trafficking in body parts for transplants.\nResearch into alternatives, like using animal products (xenotransplantation) or bioengineered materials, is progressing. These could help reduce the need for human donations but aren’t yet a full replacement. Even when they become available, high costs might limit access. For now, ensuring access to human cells, tissues, and organs for transplantation remains critical.\nImpact\nThe benefits of tissue transplantation include survival after severe burn trauma, recovery of movement, closure of chronic wounds, rehabilitation of heart function and restoration of sight. Tissue transplants allow many recipients to return to economically productive lives and promote their independence.\nOrgan transplantation is often the best if not the only treatment for acute and chronic organ failure."}

Non-communicable diseases such as diabetes and arterial hypertension, combined with various social determinants such as alcoholism and obesity, may lead to chronic kidney disease and liver cirrhosis. In terms of survival, quality of life and cost-effectiveness, kidney transplantation has better outcomes than dialysis. In chronic or acute liver failure, as well as some cardio-respiratory conditions, transplantation is the only option.\nOver 1.5 million patients have undergone haematopoietic stem cell transplant, primarily for haematological cancer. Its potential for treating non-malignant disorders and genetic diseases such as sickle cell anaemia and thalassemia with this type of transplant is increasingly recognized."}
