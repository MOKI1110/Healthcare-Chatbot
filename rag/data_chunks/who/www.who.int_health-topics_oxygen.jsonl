Healthcare professionals use oxygen to treat respiratory illnesses like\nCOVID-19\nand\npneumonia\n. Oxygen is also essential for\nsurgery\nand trauma. Vulnerable groups like\nolder people\n,\npregnant women\n,\nyoung infants and\nnewborns\nneed oxygen therapy regularly.\nDespite being an essential medicine, oxygen is a complex product. Medicinal oxygen is produced in an industrial process applying good manufacturing practices (GMP) or is generated on-site using oxygen concentrators, which are in many legislations regulated as medical devices. Oxygen also requires a whole system to safely reach patients.\nDue to their complexity, access to medical oxygen meets many challenges on availability, quality, affordability, management, supply, human resources capacity and safety. In face of these challenges, WHO continuously develops resources and tools to overcome them.\nImpact\nSurveys in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) have found that fewer\nthan half of all health facilities have uninterrupted access to oxygen."}

It has\nbeen reported that the lack of access to reliable oxygen supplies contributes\nto preventable deaths, particularly in LMICs. For example, it has been\nestimated that up to 122 000 deaths from childhood pneumonia could be prevented\nannually with the strengthening of oxygen supplies. Numerous studies show that\noxygen access is a global problem. For example, a recent study found that among\nfacilities treating respiratory infections in sub-Saharan Africa, only 1 in 5\nhad oxygen in Mauritania and 1 in 10 in Niger. Surveys by the United States\nAgency for International Development found similar situations for countries in\nSouth America and South Asia."}

Surveys by the United States\nAgency for International Development found similar situations for countries in\nSouth America and South Asia. A serious concern at any time, the global medical\noxygen problem has been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDespite being an essential medicine, producing oxygen that is safe for\npatient use is a complex process since it requires the devices and systems\nneeded to deliver oxygen to patients, ranging from pulse oximeters to\nventilators, and health workers that are trained to use such devices\neffectively. However daunting, the investment of time and resources required to\nmeet oxygen supply demand is worth it. The support for the urgent scale-up of\nmedicinal oxygen will save lives by improving care for people with COVID-19,\nsevere pneumonia and other conditions needing oxygen therapy.\nWHO Response\nThe\nAccess to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator\n, launched in 2020, supported assessment of oxygen needs in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), and supported funding to increase access to medical oxygen."}
