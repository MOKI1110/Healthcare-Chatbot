In LMIC tobacco smoking accounts for 30–40% of COPD cases, and household air pollution is a major risk factor.\nOverview\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common lung disease causing restricted airflow and breathing problems. It is sometimes called emphysema or chronic bronchitis.\nIn people with COPD, the lungs can get damaged or clogged with phlegm. Symptoms include cough, sometimes with phlegm, difficulty breathing, wheezing and tiredness.\nSmoking and air pollution are the most common causes of COPD."}

Symptoms include cough, sometimes with phlegm, difficulty breathing, wheezing and tiredness.\nSmoking and air pollution are the most common causes of COPD. People with COPD are at higher risk of other health problems.\nCOPD is not curable but symptoms can improve if one avoids smoking and exposure to air pollution and gets vaccines to prevent infections. It can also be treated with medicines, oxygen and pulmonary rehabilitation.\nSymptoms\nThe most common symptoms of COPD are difficulty breathing, chronic cough (sometimes with phlegm) and feeling tired.\nCOPD symptoms can get worse quickly. These are called flare-ups. These usually last for a few days and often require additional medicine.\nPeople with COPD also have a higher risk for other health problems. These include:\nlung infections, like the flu or pneumonia\nlung cancer\nheart problems\nweak muscles and brittle bones\ndepression and anxiety.\nCommon symptoms of COPD develop from mid-life onwards. As COPD progresses, people find it more difficult to carry out their normal daily activities, often due to breathlessness."}

As COPD progresses, people find it more difficult to carry out their normal daily activities, often due to breathlessness. There may be a considerable financial burden due to limitation of workplace and home productivity, and costs of medical treatment.\nCOPD is sometimes called emphysema or chronic bronchitis. Emphysema usually refers to destruction of the tiny air sacs at the end of the airways in the lungs. Chronic bronchitis refers to a chronic cough with the production of phlegm resulting from inflammation in the airways. COPD and asthma share common symptoms (cough, wheeze and difficulty breathing) and people may have both conditions.\nCauses\nSeveral processes can cause the airways to become narrow and lead to COPD."}

COPD and asthma share common symptoms (cough, wheeze and difficulty breathing) and people may have both conditions.\nCauses\nSeveral processes can cause the airways to become narrow and lead to COPD. There may be destruction of parts of the lung, mucus blocking the airways, and inflammation and swelling of the airway lining.\nCOPD develops gradually over time, often resulting from a combination of risk factors:\ntobacco exposure from active smoking or passive exposure to second-hand smoke;\noccupational exposure to dusts, fumes or chemicals;\nindoor air pollution: biomass fuel (wood, animal dung, crop residue) or coal is frequently used for cooking and heating in low- and middle-income countries with high levels of smoke exposure;\nearly life events such as poor growth in utero, prematurity, and frequent or severe respiratory infections in childhood that prevent maximum lung growth;\nasthma in childhood; and\na rare genetic condition called alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, which can cause COPD at a young age.\nCOPD should be suspected if a person has typical symptoms, and the diagnosis confirmed by a breathing test called spirometry, which measures how the lungs are working."}

It can be treated with medicines, oxygen and pulmonary rehabilitation.\nThere are several treatments available for COPD.\nInhaled medicines that open and reduce swelling in the airways are the main treatments.\nBronchodilator inhalers are the most important medicines for treating COPD. They relax the airways to keep them open.\nShort-acting bronchodilators start to work in seconds and can last for 4–6 hours. These are often used during flare-ups.\nLong-acting bronchodilators take longer to start working but last longer."}
