Case fatality rates have varied from 25–90% in past outbreaks.\nThe first Ebola disease outbreak occurred in remote villages in Central Africa, near tropical rainforests. The 2014–2016 Ebola virus disease outbreak in West Africa was the largest and most complex Ebola outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976. There were more cases and deaths in this outbreak than all others combined."}

There were more cases and deaths in this outbreak than all others combined. It also spread between countries, starting in Guinea then moving across land borders to Sierra Leone and Liberia.\nIt is thought that fruit bats of the\nPteropodidae\nfamily are natural hosts of the orthoebolavirus.\nSymptoms\nThe incubation period, that is, the time interval from infection with the virus to onset of symptoms, is from 2 to 21 days. A person infected with Ebola cannot spread the disease until they develop symptoms.\nSymptoms of Ebola disease can be sudden and include: fever, fatigue, malaise, muscle, pain, headache, and sore throat. These are followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, rash, and symptoms of impaired kidney and liver function. In  less frequent cases, internal and external bleeding (e.g. oozing from the gums, blood in the stools), can occur.\nIt can be difficult to clinically distinguish Ebola from other infectious diseases such as malaria, typhoid fever and meningitis."}

A range of diagnostic tests have been developed to confirm the presence of the virus.\nTreatment and prevention\nEarly intensive supportive care\n–\nrehydration with oral or intravenous fluids\n–\nand treatment of specific symptoms improves survival. A range of potential treatments is currently being evaluated.\nFor Ebola virus disease, WHO recommends treatment with the monoclonal antibodies mAb114 (ansuvimabTM) or REGN-EB3 (InmazebTM). For other Ebola diseases, there are no approved therapeutics, but candidate products are under development and a CORE protocol for clinical trials is available.\nTwo vaccines have been approved for Ebola disease: Ervebo® and Zabdeno and Mvabea® . The Ervebo vaccine is recommended as part of outbreak response.\nSeveral candidate vaccines are at different stages of development for other Ebola diseases.\nCommunity engagement is key to successfully controlling any outbreak."}
