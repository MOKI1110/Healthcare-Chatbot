It also increases the risk of HIV infection.\nAntimicrobial resistance to gonorrhoea is a serious and growing problem, rendering many classes of antibiotics as ineffective with the risk of becoming untreatable.\nOverview\nGonorrhoea is a common sexually transmitted infection caused by a bacteria.

Rational use of antibiotics and the development of new ones are critical to decrease this eminent threat.\nSigns and symptoms\nGonorrhoea can cause symptoms in the genitals, anus or throat. Men and women may experience different symptoms. Symptoms usually begin 1–14 days after sexual contact with an infected person.\nIn men, common symptoms include:\na white, yellow or greenish discharge from the penis\npain or burn when urinating\npainful or swollen testes.\nMost women with gonorrhoea do not have symptoms or do not notice them.
