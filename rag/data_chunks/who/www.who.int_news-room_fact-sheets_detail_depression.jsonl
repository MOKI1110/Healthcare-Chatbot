It involves a depressed mood or loss of pleasure or interest in activities for long periods of time.\nDepression is different from regular mood changes and feelings about everyday life. It can affect all aspects of life, including relationships with family, friends and community. It can result from or lead to problems at school and at work.\nDepression can happen to anyone. People who have lived through abuse, severe losses or other stressful events are more likely to develop depression. Women are more likely to have depression than men.\nAn estimated 4% of the population experience depression, including 5.7% of adults (4.6% among men and 6.9% among women), and 5.9% of adults aged 70 years and older."}

Suicide is the third leading cause of death in 15–29-year-olds.\nIn high-income countries, only about one third of people with depression receive mental health treatment\n(3)\n.\nBarriers to effective care include a lack of investment in mental health care, lack of trained health-care providers and social stigma associated with mental disorders.\nSymptoms and patterns\nDuring a depressive episode, a person experiences a depressed mood (feeling sad, irritable, empty).

People who have gone through adverse life events (unemployment, bereavement, traumatic events) are more likely to develop depression. Depression can, in turn, lead to more stress and dysfunction and worsen the affected person’s life situation and the depression itself.\nDepression is closely related to and affected by physical health. Many of the factors that influence depression (such as physical inactivity or harmful use of alcohol) are also known risk factors for diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes and respiratory diseases."}

Effective community approaches to prevent depression include school-based programmes to enhance a pattern of positive coping in children and adolescents. Interventions for parents of children with behavioural problems may reduce parental depressive symptoms and improve outcomes for their children. Exercise programmes for older persons can also be effective in depression prevention.\nDiagnosis and treatment\nThere are effective treatments for depression.
