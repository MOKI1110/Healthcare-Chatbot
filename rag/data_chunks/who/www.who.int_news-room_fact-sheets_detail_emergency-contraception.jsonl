These are recommended for use within 5 days but are more effective the sooner they are used after the act of intercourse.\nMode of action\nEmergency contraceptive pills prevent pregnancy by preventing or delaying ovulation and they do not induce an abortion. The copper-bearing IUD prevents fertilization by causing a chemical change in sperm and egg before they meet. Emergency contraception cannot interrupt an established pregnancy or harm a developing embryo.\nWho can use emergency contraception?\nAny woman or girl of reproductive age may need emergency contraception to avoid an unwanted pregnancy. There are no absolute medical contraindications to the use of emergency contraception. There are no age limits for the use of emergency contraception."}

Studies have shown that ECPs with LNG had a pregnancy rate of 1.2% to 2.1%\n(1) (2)\n.\nIdeally, ECPs with UPA, ECPs with LNG or COCs should be taken as early as possible after unprotected intercourse, within 120 hours. ECPs with UPA are more effective between 72–120 hours after unprotected intercourse than other ECPs.\nSafety\nSide effects from the use of ECPs are similar to those of oral contraceptive pills, such as nausea and vomiting, slight irregular vaginal bleeding, and fatigue. Side effects are not common, they are mild, and will normally resolve without further medications.\nIf vomiting occurs within 2 hours of taking a dose, the dose should be repeated. ECPs with LNG or with UPA are preferable to COCs because they cause less nausea and vomiting. Routine use of anti-emetics before taking ECPs is not recommended.\nDrugs used for emergency contraception do not harm future fertility."}

In such situations, further counselling needs to be given on what other and more regular contraceptive options may be more appropriate and more effective.\nFrequent and repeated ECP use may be harmful for women with conditions classified as medical eligibility criteria (MEC) category 2, 3,or 4 for combined hormonal contraception or Progestin-only contraceptives (POC).

This method is particularly appropriate for women who would like to start using a highly effective, long-acting, and reversible contraceptive method.\nEffectiveness\nWhen inserted within 120 hours of unprotected intercourse, a copper-bearing IUD is more than 99% effective in preventing pregnancy.

It is estimated that there may be less than 2 cases of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) per 1000 users\n(3)\n. (FP Global Handbook). The risks of expulsion or perforation are low.\nMedical eligibility criteria\nEligibility criteria for general use of a copper IUD also apply for use of a copper IUD for emergency purposes.

A copper-bearing IUD should not be used as emergency contraception when a woman is already pregnant.\nThe\nWHO Medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use\nstates that IUD insertion may further increase the risk of PID among women at increased risk of sexually transmitted infections (STIs), although limited evidence suggests that this risk if low.
