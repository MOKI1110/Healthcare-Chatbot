Available data suggests that globally one in six people experience infertility in their lifetime. Infertility is a disease of the male or female\nreproductive system defined by the failure to achieve a pregnancy after 12 months or\nmore of regular unprotected sexual intercourse. Primary infertility is the inability to\nhave any pregnancy, while secondary infertility is the inability to have a pregnancy\nafter previously successful conception. WHO’s International Classification of Diseases\nprovides more information on the many primary and secondary causes of infertility in\nboth women and men.\nInfertility may occur due to male factors, female factors, a combination of male and\nfemale factors or may be unexplained. For both women and men, however,\nlifestyle factors such as smoking, excessive alcohol intake and obesity\nhave been associated with higher chances of infertility.\nImpact\nEvery human being has a right to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health."}

Individuals and couples have the right to decide the number, timing and spacing of their children. Addressing infertility is therefore an\nimportant part of realizing the right of individuals and couples to found a family.\nA wide variety of people globally may require infertility management and fertility care services. Disparities in access to fertility care services adversely affect the poor, unmarried, uneducated, unemployed\nand other underserved and marginalised populations.\nInfertility has significant negative impacts on the lives of infertile couples. Women in particular are at greater risk of violence, divorce, social stigma, emotional stress, depression, anxiety\nand low self-esteem. In some settings, fear of infertility can deter women and men from using contraception if they feel socially pressured to prove their fertility at an early age because of a high social value of childbearing."}

Infertility can also\nhave negative economic impact when households incur catastrophic out-of-pocket expenditure to access treatment.\nWHO response\nAvailability, access, and quality of interventions to address infertility remain a\nchallenge in most countries. Prevention, diagnosis and treatment of infertility are often not prioritized in national policies and are rarely covered through public health\nfinancing. A lack of necessary equipment and trained personnel, together with the high\ncosts of treatment, are additional barriers preventing universal access to fertility care.\nWhile assisted reproduction technology (ART) has been available for over three\ndecades, it is still largely unaffordable in many parts of the world.\nThe World Health Organization is committed to addressing infertility and is currently working on a programme on infertility research and fertility care."}
