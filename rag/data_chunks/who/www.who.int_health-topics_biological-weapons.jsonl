Biological\nagents which are capable of secondary transmission can lead to\nepidemics. An attack involving a biological agent may mimic a natural\nevent, which may complicate the public health assessment and response.\nIn case of war and conflict, high-threat pathogens laboratories can be\ntargeted, which might lead to serious public health consequences.\nBiological\nweapons form a subset of a larger class of weapons sometimes referred\nto as unconventional weapons or weapons of mass destruction, which also\nincludes chemical, nuclear and radiological weapons."}
