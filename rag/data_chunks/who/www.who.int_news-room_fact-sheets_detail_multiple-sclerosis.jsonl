These often include vision problems, tiredness, trouble walking and keeping balance, and numbness or weakness in the arms and legs."}

These often include vision problems, tiredness, trouble walking and keeping balance, and numbness or weakness in the arms and legs. Symptoms can come and go or last for a long time.\nThe causes of MS are not known but a family history of the disease may increase the risk.\nWhile there is no cure for MS, treatment can reduce symptoms, prevent further relapses and improve quality of life.\nMS can present in a variety of ways including:\nclinically isolated syndrome (CIS): describes an episode of neurologic symptoms that are the first clinical sign of possible MS;\nrelapsing remitting (RRMS): the most common form of MS characterized by intermittent attacks of symptoms (relapses), followed by a short or long period of no clinical attacks (remissions);\nsecondary progressive (SPMS): after living with RRMS for a long period of time, relapses decrease and symptoms continue progressively without relapses or remissions; and\nprimary progressive (PPMS): starting from the initial symptoms, the disease gradually progresses and gets worse without any clear relapses or remissions.\nMS is not always easy to diagnose in its early stages."}

Typically, people who have been diagnosed with MS will have been through several diagnostic stages, which can be an unsettling and frightening experience.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of multiple sclerosis can be different from person to person. They can come and go or get worse over time. MS can affect any part of the central nervous system.\nMS symptoms can worsen with heat or during other infections such as urinary tract or respiratory infections.\nSymptoms can include:\nvision problems\ndifficulty walking or keeping balance\ndifficulty thinking clearly\nnumbness or weakness especially in the arms and legs\nmuscle stiffness\ndepression\nproblems with sexual function or urination\nfeeling very tired.\nCauses\nMS is an inflammatory demyelinating condition that results from an autoimmune attack on myelin, the fatty insulation that surrounds the nerves in the brain and spinal cord."}

This disrupts the electrical impulses that are sent through the nerves to the rest of the body and results in scars (plaques or sclerosis).\nIt is not known what triggers the immune system to attack myelin, but genetic and environmental factors are thought to play a role. MS happens most commonly in young to middle-aged adults, more in females than males, and is more common in higher latitudes, possibly due to sun exposure and vitamin D.\nDiagnosis\nMS is a diagnosis of exclusion and there are no definitive diagnostic tests. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can help with diagnosis by showing plaques or sclerosis on the brain and spinal cord. Other tests such as lumbar puncture, optical coherence tomography (OCT) and visual evoked potentials can also help support the diagnosis.\nTreatment and care\nTreatments for MS will be different for each person."}

They depend on the stage of the disease and symptoms.\nThe goals of MS treatment are to reduce the frequency and severity of relapses, slow disease progression, manage symptoms, and improve quality of life.\nSpecific MS disease modifying therapies (DMTs) are started as early as possible to slow disease progression and prevent relapses.\nSteroids are sometimes used in the short term to treat relapses. Other medicines can be used to reduce the symptoms of MS such as fatigue, muscle tightening, depression and urinary or sexual problems. These medicines do not change the course of the disease but help manage the symptoms.\nRehabilitation specialists can help improve functioning, quality of life and reduce muscle stiffness and spasms.\nMany people feel fatigue with multiple sclerosis. Ways to manage fatigue include:\nregular exercise\nhealthy sleep patterns\navoiding medicines that make fatigue worse.\nIn the past twenty years treatment options for MS have improved dramatically."}
