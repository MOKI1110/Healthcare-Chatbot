Some of the most common are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma, occupational lung diseases and pulmonary hypertension. In addition to tobacco smoke, other risk factors include air pollution, occupational chemicals and dusts, and frequent lower respiratory infections during childhood. CRDs are not curable; however, various forms of treatment that help open the air passages and improve shortness of breath can help control symptoms and improve daily  life for people living with these conditions. The WHO Global Alliance against CRDs (GARD) vision is “a world in which all people breathe freely”."}

The WHO Global Alliance against CRDs (GARD) vision is “a world in which all people breathe freely”. GARD focuses on the needs of people with CRDs in low- and middle-income countries.\nThe aim of the WHO Chronic Respiratory Diseases Programme is to support Member States in their efforts to reduce the toll of morbidity, disability and premature mortality related to chronic respiratory diseases, specifically asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.\nSymptoms\nThe two most common chronic respiratory diseases are asthma and chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). These both affect the airways in the\nlungs.\nAsthma is characterized by recurrent attacks of breathlessness and wheezing\ndue to airway narrowing, which vary in severity and frequency from person to\nperson. Symptoms may occur several times in a day or week in affected\nindividuals, and for some people become worse during physical activity or at\nnight. Asthma is the most common chronic disease among children.\nIn asthma, the airway obstruction is reversible with inhaled medicines, but\nin COPD it is mostly fixed."}

COPD only affects adults and usually becomes worse\nwith time. The most common symptoms of COPD are breathlessness or a need for\nair, sputum production and a chronic cough.\nRisk factors for chronic respiratory diseases include tobacco smoking\n(including second-hand smoke), air pollution, allergens and occupational risks.\nOutdoor air pollution and indoor air pollution (often caused by cooking with\nsolid fuels) are also common causes.\nAsthma and COPD may be prevented by reducing or avoiding exposure to these\nrisk factors.\nTreatments\nNeither asthma nor chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be cured\nbut treatment can reduce symptoms, prevent deterioration and improve daily life.\nDuring attacks of breathlessness caused by airway narrowing, inhaled\nmedicines (bronchodilators) can open the airways and relieve symptoms."}

Long-term treatment\nis required for people with persistent symptoms and exposures which trigger\nsymptoms (e.g. smoke, fumes, dust, grass and tree pollen, animal fur and\nfeathers) should be avoided.\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease is confirmed by a spirometry test,\nwhich measures how much and how quickly a person can blow air out of their\nlungs. Symptoms can be treated through medical and physical treatments;\nhowever, with COPD in people who smoke tobacco, the most effective treatment\navailable is to stop smoking. This can slow down the progression of the disease\nand decrease COPD-related deaths."}
