These mostly occur in low- and middle-income countries.\nThe developmental, economic, social and medical impacts of the global burden of malnutrition are serious and lasting, for individuals and their families, for communities and for countries.\nOverview\nMalnutrition refers to deficiencies, excesses, or imbalances in a person’s intake of energy and/or nutrients."}

The term malnutrition addresses 3 broad groups of conditions:\nundernutrition, which includes wasting (low weight-for-height), stunting (low height-for-age) and underweight (low weight-for-age);\nmicronutrient-related malnutrition, which includes micronutrient deficiencies (a lack of important vitamins and minerals) or micronutrient excess; and\noverweight, obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases (such as heart disease, stroke, diabetes and some cancers).\nVarious forms of malnutrition\nUndernutrition\nThere are 4 broad sub-forms of undernutrition: wasting, stunting, underweight, and deficiencies in vitamins and minerals. Undernutrition makes children in particular much more vulnerable to disease and death.\nLow weight-for-height is known as wasting. It usually indicates recent and severe weight loss because a person has not had enough food to eat and/or they have had an infectious disease, such as diarrhoea, which has caused them to lose weight."}

A young child who is moderately or severely wasted has an increased risk of death, but treatment is possible.\nLow height-for-age is known as stunting. It is the result of chronic or recurrent undernutrition, usually associated with poor socioeconomic conditions, poor maternal health and nutrition, frequent illness, and/or inappropriate infant and young child feeding and care in early life. Stunting holds children back from reaching their physical and cognitive potential.\nChildren with low weight-for-age are known as underweight. A child who is underweight may be stunted, wasted or both.\nMicronutrient-related malnutrition\nInadequacies in intake of vitamins and minerals often referred to as micronutrients, can also be grouped together."}

Micronutrients enable the body to produce enzymes, hormones and other substances that are essential for proper growth and development.\nIodine, vitamin A, and iron are the most important in global public health terms; their deficiency represents a major threat to the health and development of populations worldwide, particularly children and pregnant women in low-income countries.\nOverweight and obesity\nOverweight and obesity is when a person is too heavy for his or her height. Abnormal or excessive fat accumulation can impair health.\nBody mass index (BMI) is an index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify overweight and obesity. It is defined as a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of his/her height in meters (kg/m²)."}

It is defined as a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of his/her height in meters (kg/m²). In adults, overweight is defined as a BMI of 25 or more, whereas obesity is a BMI of 30 or more.\nAmong children and adolescents, BMI thresholds for overweight and obesity vary by age.\nOverweight and obesity result from an imbalance between energy consumed (too much) and energy expended (too little). Globally, people are consuming foods and drinks that are more energy-dense (high in sugars and fats) and engaging in less physical activity.\nDiet-related noncommunicable diseases\nDiet-related noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) include cardiovascular diseases (such as heart attacks and stroke, and often linked with high blood pressure), certain cancers, and diabetes. Unhealthy diets and poor nutrition are among the top risk factors for these diseases globally.\nScope of the problem\nIn 2022, approximately 390 million adults aged 18 years and older worldwide were underweight, while 2.5 billion were overweight, including 890 million who were living with obesity."}

These mostly occur in low- and middle-income countries.\nWho is at risk?\nEvery country in the world is affected by one or more forms of malnutrition. Combating malnutrition in all its forms is one of the greatest global health challenges.\nWomen, infants, children, and adolescents are at particular risk of malnutrition."}

Optimizing nutrition early in life –including the 1000 days from conception to a child’s second birthday – ensures the best possible start in life, with long-term benefits.\nPoverty amplifies the risk of, and risks from, malnutrition. People who are poor are more likely to be affected by different forms of malnutrition. Also, malnutrition increases health care costs, reduces productivity, and slows economic growth, which can perpetuate a cycle of poverty and ill-health.\nThe United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition\nOn 1 April 2016, the United Nations (UN) General Assembly proclaimed 2016–2025 the United Nations Decade of Action on Nutrition.
