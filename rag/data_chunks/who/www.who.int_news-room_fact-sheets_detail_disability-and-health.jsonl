Shimizu\n©\nCredits\nDisability\n7 March 2023\nKey facts\nAn estimated 1.3 billion people experience significant disability. This represents 16% of the world’s population, or 1 in 6 of us.\nSome persons with disabilities die up to 20 years earlier than those without disabilities.\nPersons with disabilities have twice the risk of developing conditions such as depression, asthma, diabetes, stroke, obesity or poor oral health.\nPersons with disabilities face many health inequities.\nPersons with disabilities find inaccessible and unaffordable transportation 15 times more difficult than for those without disabilities.\nHealth inequities arise from unfair conditions faced by persons with disabilities, including stigma, discrimination, poverty, exclusion from education and employment, and barriers faced in the health system itself.\nOverview\nDisability is part of being human and is integral to the human experience. It results from the interaction between health conditions such as dementia, blindness or spinal cord injury, and a range of environmental and personal factors."}

It results from the interaction between health conditions such as dementia, blindness or spinal cord injury, and a range of environmental and personal factors. An estimated 1.3 billion people – or 16% of the global population – experience a significant disability today. This number is growing because of an increase in noncommunicable diseases and people living longer. Persons with disabilities are a diverse group, and factors such as sex, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, religion, race, ethnicity and their economic situation affect their experiences in life and their health needs. Persons with disabilities die earlier, have poorer health, and experience more limitations in everyday functioning than others.\nFactors contributing to health inequities\nHealth inequities arise from unfair conditions faced by persons with disabilities.\nStructural factors:\nPersons with disabilities experience ableism, stigma and discrimination in all facets of life, which affects their physical and mental health."}

Laws and policies may deny them the right to make their own decisions and allow a range of harmful practices in the health sector, such as forced sterilization, involuntary admission and treatment, and even institutionalization.\nSocial determinants of health:\nPoverty, exclusion from education and employment, and poor living conditions all add to the risk of poor health and unmet health care needs among persons with disabilities. Gaps in formal social support mechanisms mean that persons with disabilities are reliant on support from family members to engage in health and community activities, which not only disadvantages them but also their caregivers (who are mostly women and girls).\nRisk factors:\nPersons with disabilities are more likely to have risk factors for non-communicable diseases, such as smoking, poor diet, alcohol consumption and a lack of physical activity."}

A key reason for this is that they are often left out of public health interventions.\nHealth system:\nPersons with disabilities face barriers in all aspects of the health system. For example, a lack of knowledge, negative attitudes and discriminatory practices among healthcare workers; inaccessible health facilities and information; and lack of information or data collection and analysis on disability, all contribute to health inequities faced by this group.\nInternational frameworks\nCountries have an obligation under international human rights law, and in some cases domestic laws, to address the health inequities faced by persons with disabilities."}
