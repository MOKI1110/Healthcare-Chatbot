These crises disrupt families, livelihoods and essential services, and significantly impact mental health. Nearly all those affected experience psychological distress. A minority go on to develop mental health conditions such as depression or post-traumatic stress disorder.\nEmergencies can worsen mental health conditions and social issues such as poverty and discrimination."}
