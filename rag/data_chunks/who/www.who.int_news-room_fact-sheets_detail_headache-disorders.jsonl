A headache is a painful and disabling feature of primary headache disorders, namely migraine, tension-type headache and cluster headache. Headaches can also be caused by or occur secondarily to a long list of other conditions, the most common of which is medication-overuse headache."}

Headaches, particularly migraine, can also affect children and adolescents but can affect them in different ways. Headache disorders can result in missing school, sports and other activities in children, adolescents and adults.\nPrevalence\nGlobally, headache disorders affect approximately 40% of the population, or 3.1 billion people in 2021, and are more common in females compared to males. They are among the top three most common neurological conditions for most age groups, starting with age 5 and remaining in the top three until the age of 80. Despite some regional variations, headache disorders are a worldwide problem, affecting people of all races, income levels and geographical areas\n(1)\n.\nNot only is a headache painful, but it is also disabling."}

Repeated headache attacks, and often the constant fear of the next one, damage family life, social life and employment. The long-term effort of coping with a chronic headache disorder may also predispose the individual to other illnesses."}

The long-term effort of coping with a chronic headache disorder may also predispose the individual to other illnesses. For example, anxiety and depression are significantly more common in people who experience migraines than in healthy individuals.\nTypes of headache disorders\nMigraines, tension-type headaches, cluster headaches and medication-overuse headaches are of public health importance since they are responsible for high population levels of disability and ill health.\nMigraine\nMigraine is characterized by recurring attacks and is often life-long. It is a primary headache disorder, that is in most cases episodic,  usually lasts 4–72 hours, and is accompanied by nausea, vomiting and/or photophobia and phonophobia. It is sometimes preceded by an aura of reversable, visual, sensory or other symptoms.\nMigraine most often begins at puberty and generally affects those aged between 35 and 45 years. It is more common in women, possibly because of hormonal influences."}

It is more common in women, possibly because of hormonal influences. Children typically experience migraine of shorter duration and abdominal symptoms are usually more prominent.\nThe exact cause of migraine is currently unknown but it is thought to result from the release of pain producing inflammatory substances around the nerves and blood vessels of the head. It can be triggered by alcohol, sleep disruption and certain foods.\nAttacks typically include headache, which is often:\nof moderate or severe intensity\none-sided or behind the eye\npulsating in quality\naggravated by routine physical activity\nwith duration of hours to 2–3 days;\nsensitive to light and sounds; and\naccompanied by nausea.\nTension-type headache\nTension-type headaches (TTH) are described as pressure or tightness, often like a band around the head, sometimes spreading into or from the neck. They may be stress-related or associated with musculoskeletal problems in the neck."}

Episodic TTH attacks usually last a few hours but can persist for several days.\nChronic TTH can be unremitting and is more disabling than episodic TTH.\nCluster headache\nCluster headache (CH) is a primary headache disorder characterized by frequently recurring (up to several times a day), brief but extremely severe headache, usually focused in or around one eye, with tearing and redness of the eye. The nose often runs or is blocked on the affected side and the eyelid may droop.\nCH is relatively uncommon affecting fewer than 1 in 1000 adults, affecting six men to each woman. Most people developing CH are in their 20s or older. CH has episodic and chronic forms.\nMedication-overuse headache\nMedication-overuse headaches (MOH) are caused by chronic and excessive use of medication to treat headache."}

MOH occurs by definition on more days than not, is oppressive, persistent and often at its worst on awakening.\nSocial and economic burden\nMigraines and other headaches can affect people's ability to work, through decreased productivity, and interpersonal relationships. Often people continue to try to work despite the debilitating symptoms that can occur. Headache-related productivity loss may affect people's careers and/or security, financial situation, relationships, and mental health. It also causes economic loss to companies and society.\nTreatment\nMany of those troubled by headaches do not receive effective diagnosis and care."}

Appropriate treatment of headache disorders requires training of health professionals, accurate diagnosis and recognition of the conditions, appropriate treatment with cost-effective medications, simple lifestyle modifications and patient education. The main classes of drugs to treat headache disorders include analgesics, anti-emetics, specific anti-migraine medications and prophylactic medications. For migraine treatment, analgesics need to be taken at the first sign of symptoms (such as visual aura) to prevent the associated headache. Simple interventions to educate people on medication overuse headaches, migraine triggers and lifestyle modifications are highly effective."}

Many people with headache disorders are not diagnosed and treated. In many countries medications, such as sumatriptan for migraines, are not available.\nPoor awareness extends to the general public. Headache disorders are not perceived by the public as serious since they are mostly episodic, do not cause death and are not contagious. The low consultation rates in developed countries may indicate that many affected people are unaware that effective treatments exist. Half of people with headache disorders are estimated to be self-treating.\nMany governments, seeking to constrain health care costs, do not acknowledge the substantial burden of headache on society."}

WHO recognizes this and partners with multiple nongovernmental organizations to address headache. WHO published the\nAtlas of headache disorders\nin 2011, describing the burden due to headache disorders and resources available to reduce them.\nIn May 2022, the World Health Assembly endorsed the\nIntersectoral global action plan on epilepsy and other neurological disorders 2022–2031\n. The action plan addresses the challenges and gaps in providing care and services for people with epilepsy and other neurological disorders such as headache disorders that exist worldwide and ensure a comprehensive, coordinated response across sectors."}
