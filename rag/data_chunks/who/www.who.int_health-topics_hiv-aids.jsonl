HIV destroys these CD4 cells, weakening a person’s immunity against opportunistic infections, such\nas tuberculosis and fungal infections, severe bacterial infections and some cancers.\nWHO recommends that every person who may be at risk of HIV should access testing.\nPeople at increased risk of acquiring HIV\nshould seek comprehensive and effective HIV prevention, testing and treatment services.\nHIV infection can be diagnosed\nusing simple and affordable rapid diagnostic tests, as well as self-tests. It is important that\nHIV testing services\nfollow the 5Cs: consent, confidentiality, counselling, correct results and connection with treatment and\nother services.\nPeople diagnosed with HIV should be offered and linked to\nantiretroviral treatment (ART)\nas\nsoon as possible following diagnosis and\nperiodically monitored\nusing clinical and laboratory parameters, including the test to measure virus in the blood (viral load)."}

If ART is taken consistently, this treatment also\nprevents HIV transmission\nto others.\nAt diagnosis or soon after starting ART, a CD4 cell count should be checked to assess a person’s immune status. The CD4 cell count is a blood test used to assess progression of HIV disease, including risk for developing\nopportunistic infections\nand guides the use of preventive treatment. The normal range of CD4 count is from 500 to 1500 cells/mm3\nof blood, and it progressively decreases over time in persons who are not receiving or not responding well to ART. If the person’s CD4 cell count falls below 200, their immunity is severely compromised, leaving them susceptible to infections\nand death. Someone with a CD4 count below 200 is described as having an\nadvanced HIV disease (AHD)\n.\nHIV viral load measures the amount of virus in the blood. This test is used to monitor the level of viral replication and effectiveness of ART."}

This test is used to monitor the level of viral replication and effectiveness of ART. The treatment goal is to reduce the viral load in the blood to undetectable levels (less than 50 copies/ml),\nand the persistent presence of detectable viral load (greater than 1000 copies/ml) in people living with HIV on ART is an indicator of inadequate treatment response and the need to change or adjust the treatment regimen.\nWHO’s 2022–2030\nglobal health sector strategy on HIV\naims\nto reduce HIV infections from 1.5 million in 2020 to 335 000 by 2030, and deaths from 680 000 in 2020 to under 240 000 in 2030.\nSymptoms\nMany people do not feel symptoms of HIV in the first few months after infection and may not know that they are infected. Others may experience influenza-like symptoms, including fever, headache, rash and sore throat. However, these first few months are when the virus is most infectious.\nAs the disease progresses, symptoms will be expanded and more pronounced. These can include swollen lymph nodes, weight loss, fever, diarrhoea and cough."}

This early identification greatly improves treatment options and reduces the risk of transmission to other people including sexual or drug-sharing partners.\nTreatment\nHIV is fully preventable.

Harm reduction (needle syringe programmes and opioid substitution therapy) prevents HIV and other blood-borne infections for\npeople who inject drugs\n.\nHIV is treated with antiretroviral therapy consisting of one or more medicines.
