The latest burden estimates reflect the significant role air pollution plays in cardiovascular illness and death.\nPolicies reducing air pollution\nAddressing air pollution, which is the\nsecond highest risk factor for noncommunicable diseases\n, is key to protecting public health.\nMost sources of outdoor air pollution are well beyond the control of individuals and this demands concerted action by local, national and regional level policy-makers working in sectors like energy, transport, waste management, urban planning and agriculture.\nThere are many examples of successful policies that reduce air pollution:\nfor industry:\nclean technologies that reduce industrial smokestack emissions; improved management of urban and agricultural waste, including capture of methane gas emitted from waste sites as an alternative to incineration (for use as biogas);\nfor energy:\nensuring access to affordable clean household"}
