Tetanus cannot be transmitted\nfrom person to person.\nTetanus can be prevented through immunization\nwith tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccines (TTCV). However, people who\nrecover from tetanus do not have natural immunity and can be infected\nagain.\nThe majority of reported tetanus cases are\nbirth-associated among newborn babies and mothers who have not been\nsufficiently vaccinated with TTCV.\nIn 2018, about 25 000 newborns died from\nneonatal tetanus, a 97% reduction since 1988, largely due to scaled-up\nimmunization with TTCV.\nIn 2023, 84% of infants worldwide were vaccinated with 3 doses of diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTP) containing vaccine.\nOverview\nTetanus is an acute infectious disease caused by spores of the bacterium\nClostridium tetani\n."}

The spores are found everywhere in the environment, particularly in soil, ash, intestinal tracts/feces of animals and humans, and on the surfaces of skin and rusty tools like nails, needles, barbed wire, etc. Being very resistant to heat and most antiseptics, the spores can survive for years.\nAnyone can get tetanus, but the disease is particularly common and serious in newborn babies and pregnant women who have not been sufficiently immunized with tetanus-toxoid-containing vaccines. Tetanus during pregnancy or within 6 weeks of the end of pregnancy is called maternal tetanus, and tetanus within the first 28 days of life is called neonatal tetanus.\nThe disease remains an important public health problem in many parts of the world, but especially in low-income countries or districts, where immunization coverage is low, and unclean birth practices are common."}

Neonatal tetanus occurs when nonsterile instruments are used to cut the umbilical cord or when contaminated material is used to cover the umbilical stump. Deliveries carried out by people with unclean hands or on a contaminated surface are also risk factors.\nIn 2018, approximately 25 000 newborns died from neonatal tetanus, a 97% reduction from 1988 when an estimated 787 000 newborn babies died of tetanus within their first month of life. However, there is increased risk of tetanus in adolescent and adult males who undergo circumcision due to waning immunity and limited opportunity for receiving booster doses in males in many countries.\nSymptoms and diagnosis\nThe incubation period of tetanus varies between 3 and 21 days after infection."}
