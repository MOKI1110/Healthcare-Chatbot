Chemical incidents can occur as a result of natural events, or as a result of accidental or intentional events. These incidents can be sudden and acute or have a slow onset when there is a ‘silent’ release of a chemical. They can also range from small releases to full-scale major emergencies.\nThe term “chemical incident” might refer to anthropogenic or technological events, including:\nan explosion at a factory that stores or uses chemicals\ncontamination of the food or water supply with a chemical\nan oil spill\na leak from a storage unit during transportation\ndeliberate release of chemicals in conflict or terrorism\nan outbreak of disease that is associated with a chemical exposure.\nChemical incidents arising from natural sources include volcanos, earthquakes and forest fires."}

An estimated 65 000 people died due to technological events between 2009-2018.\nAs the production and use of chemicals continues to increase worldwide the health sector must expand its traditional roles and responsibilities to be able to address the public health and medical issues associated with the use of chemicals and their health effects.\nImpact\nChemical incidents, especially acts of terrorism, may also cause fear and anxiety in populations, as well as injury from fire, explosion or toxicity."}

Depending on the chemical exposure, symptoms may present themselves differently.\nIn general, the adverse health outcomes to toxic chemical exposure may be:\neffects that are local or arise at the site of contact with the chemical, such as bronchoconstriction from respiratory irritants, or irritation of the skin and eyes by gases, liquids and solids;\neffects that are systemic or affect organ systems remote from the site of absorption, such as depression of the central nervous system from inhalation of solvents, or necrosis of the liver from the inhalation of carbon tetrachloride; and\neffects on mental health arising from real or perceived releases, which depend on the psychosocial stress associated with an incident.\nThe time elapsing between exposure and the onset of symptoms can vary:\nSome effects, for example eye and respiratory irritation or central nervous system depression, can occur rapidly, within minutes or hours of exposure.\nOther effects, for example congenital malformations or"}
