However, age is often used to categorize and divide people in ways that lead to harm, disadvantage and injustice and erode solidarity across generations. This is ageism: the stereotypes (how we think), prejudice (how we feel) and discrimination (how we act) towards others or ourselves based on age.\nAgeism is pervasive, affects people of all ages from childhood onwards and has serious and far-reaching consequences for people’s health, well-being and human rights. Ageism can be found within institutions, in interactions between people and within ourselves. Globally, 1 in 2 people are ageist against older people and in Europe, younger people report more perceived ageism than other age groups.\nAgeism remains largely invisible despite its wide reach and negative impact on individuals and society. However, it can be combated: policies and laws, educational activities and intergenerational interventions have all been proven to work to reduce ageism."}

However, it can be combated: policies and laws, educational activities and intergenerational interventions have all been proven to work to reduce ageism. To create a world for all ages, stakeholders across countries, sectors and disciplines must invest in these three strategies, support further research and data collection in this area and join the global movement to change negative narratives around age and ageing.\nImpact\nAgeism has far-reaching impacts on all aspects of our health and well-being when we are older:\nIt is associated with earlier death.\nIt is linked to poorer physical health,      affecting, among others, our ability to recover from disability and our      sexual and reproductive health.\nIt increases risky health behaviours (e.g.,      eating an unhealthy diet, smoking).\nIt is associated with poorer mental health,      including the onset of depression, increases in depressive symptoms over      time and lifetime depression.\nIt is associated with a lower quality of life      and contributes to social isolation and loneliness.\nAgeism also takes a heavy economic toll on individuals and society and exacerbates other forms o"}
