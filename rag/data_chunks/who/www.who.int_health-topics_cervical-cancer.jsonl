In 2022, an estimated 660 000 women were diagnosed with cervical cancer worldwide and about 350 000 women died from the disease.\nEffective primary (HPV vaccination) and secondary prevention approaches (screening for, and treating precancerous lesions) will prevent most cervical cancer cases.\nWhen diagnosed, cervical cancer is one of the most successfully treatable forms of cancer, as long as it is detected early and managed effectively."}

Cancers diagnosed in late stages can also be controlled with appropriate treatment and palliative care.\nWith a comprehensive approach to prevent, screen and treat, cervical cancer can be eliminated as a public health problem within a generation.\nEliminating cervical  cancer\nNo woman should die from cervical cancer. We have the technical, medical and policy tools and approaches to eliminate it. The burden of cervical cancer falls on the women who lack access to health services, mainly in low-and middle income countries.\nIn May 2018, the Director-General\nof  the World Health Organization announced a global call to action towards the elimination of cervical cancer, underscoring renewed political will to make elimination a reality, and called for all stakeholders to unite behind this common goal.\nIn January 2019, the Executive Board requested the Director-General to develop a draft global strategy to accelerate cervical cancer elimination, with clear targets for the period 2020–2030.\nA Glo"}
