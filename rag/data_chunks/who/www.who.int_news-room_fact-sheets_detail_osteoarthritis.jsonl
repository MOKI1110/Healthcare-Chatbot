It causes pain, swelling and stiffness, affecting a person’s ability to move freely.\nOsteoarthritis affects the entire joint, including the tissues around it. It is most common in the knees, hips, spine and hands.\nMany factors can contribute to developing osteoarthritis. Some include a history of joint injury or overuse, older age and being overweight."}

It is most common in the knees, hips, spine and hands.\nMany factors can contribute to developing osteoarthritis. Some include a history of joint injury or overuse, older age and being overweight. It affects women more than men.\nExercise and healthy eating to build strong muscles and keep a healthy weight can reduce symptoms. Surgery to replace joints is used in severe cases to reduce pain and regain mobility.\nOnce pain and loss of movement function become chronic, people with osteoarthritis often experience restrictions in participating in meaningful activities, decreased well-being, and psychological distress.\nScope of the problem\nOsteoarthritis is one of the significant contributors to years lived with disability among the musculoskeletal conditions. As osteoarthritis is more prevalent in older people (about 70% are older than 55), global prevalence is expected to increase with the ageing of populations. The typical onset is in the late 40s to mid-50s, although osteoarthritis may also affect younger people, including athletes and people who sustain joint injury or trauma."}

The typical onset is in the late 40s to mid-50s, although osteoarthritis may also affect younger people, including athletes and people who sustain joint injury or trauma. About 60% of people living with osteoarthritis are women.\nSigns and symptoms\nSymptoms of osteoarthritis include pain, swelling, stiffness and trouble moving the affected joint.\nAs a consequence of reduced movement, muscles often lose strength and people become less able to perform physical activities.\nOsteoarthritis can affect any joint but is most common in the knees, hips, spine and small joints in the hands. Muscles and tissue around the joint are often affected.\nSymptoms can develop slowly or start quickly after an injury or strain. Osteoarthritis is chronic and often progressive, so changes happen gradually over time.\nIn severe cases, it can make the joint unusable and cause long-term pain. Some people feel pain even when resting.\nBeing less physically active can lead to other conditions, including cardiovascular diseases, obesity and diabetes.\nOsteoarthritis can greatly reduce the quality of life."}

It makes movement painful and difficult, which can stop people from participating in home, work or social activities. This can lead to mental health impacts, trouble sleeping and problems in relationships.\nCause and risk factors\nSeveral risk factors are known to increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis:\ninjury to the joint, e.g. fractures, strains, repeated stress in sport or at work;\npre-existing joint diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout;\nspecific metabolic diseases, such as diabetes;\nobesity – specifically for hip and knee osteoarthritis – as characterized by metabolic abnormalities, systemic inflammation, and contributing to excessive load on the joints;\ngenetics;\nsociodemographic factors (age, female sex).\nPrevention and control\nSeveral key prevention strategies have been proposed to prevent osteoarthritis and control the disease progression. In particular, reducing overuse of joints (e.g. related to workload), and promoting healthy lifestyles (e.g."}

Other therapeutic approaches can help the joint to move properly and allow people to continue their daily activities.\nBraces and other assistive technologies can help people to stay independent when movement becomes more difficult.\nMedicines like non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be prescribed to control pain.\nJoint replacement surgery can reduce pain, restore movement and improve quality of life for most people with severely affected joints."}
