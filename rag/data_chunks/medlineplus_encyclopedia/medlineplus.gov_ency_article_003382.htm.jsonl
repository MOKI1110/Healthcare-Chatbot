Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nIndium-labelled WBC scan\nIndium-labelled WBC scan\nThis test uses radioactive material to detect abscesses or infections by scanning to find where the radioactive material accumulates in the body. An\nabscess\noccurs when pus collects due to an infection.\nHow the Test is Performed\nBlood is drawn from a vein, most often on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\nThe site is cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic).\nThe health care provider wraps an elastic band around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area and make the vein swell with blood.\nNext, the provider gently inserts a needle into the vein. The blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle.\nThe elastic band is removed from your arm.\nThe puncture site is covered to stop any bleeding.\nThe blood sample is then sent to a lab. There the white blood cells are tagged with a radioactive substance (\nradioisotope\n) called indium. The cells are then injected back into a vein through another needle stick.\nYou will need to return to the office 6 to 24 hours later."}

At that time, you will have a\nnuclear scan\nto see if white blood cells have gathered in areas of your body where they would normally not be located.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nMost of the time you do not need special preparation. You will need to sign a consent form.\nFor the test, you will need to wear a hospital gown or loose clothing. You will need to take off all jewelry.\nTell your provider if you are pregnant. This test is NOT recommended if you are pregnant or trying to become pregnant. Women of childbearing age (before menopause) should use some form of birth control after this test.\nTell your provider if you have or had any of the following medical conditions, procedures, or treatments, as they can interfere with test results:\nGallium (Ga) scan\nwithin the past month\nHemodialysis\nHyperglycemia\nLong-term antibiotic therapy\nSteroid therapy\nTotal parenteral nutrition (through an IV)\nHow the Test will Feel\nSome people feel a little pain when the needle is inserted to draw blood."}

Others feel only a prick or sting. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nThe nuclear medicine scan is painless. It may be a little uncomfortable to lie flat and still on the scanning table. This most often takes about an hour.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is rarely used today. In some cases, it may be helpful when your provider cannot localize an infection. The most common reason it is used is to look for a bone infection called osteomyelitis.\nIt is also used to look for an abscess that may form after surgery or on its own."}
