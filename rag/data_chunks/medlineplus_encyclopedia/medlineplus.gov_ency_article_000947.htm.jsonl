Symptoms of withdrawal can occur even if the user is not completely off cocaine and still has some of the drug in their blood.\nCauses\nCocaine produces a sense of euphoria (extreme mood elevation) by causing the brain to release higher than normal amounts of some chemicals. But, cocaine's effects on other parts of the body can be very serious, or even deadly.\nWhen cocaine use is stopped or when a binge ends, a crash follows almost right away. The cocaine user has a strong craving for more cocaine during a crash."}

The cocaine user has a strong craving for more cocaine during a crash. Other symptoms include fatigue, lack of pleasure, anxiety, irritability, sleepiness, and sometimes agitation or extreme suspicion or paranoia.\nCocaine withdrawal often has no visible physical symptoms, such as the vomiting and shaking that accompany withdrawal from heroin or alcohol.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of cocaine withdrawal may include:\nAgitation and restless behavior\nDepressed mood\nFatigue\nGeneral feeling of discomfort\nIncreased appetite\nVivid and unpleasant dreams\nSlowing of activity (psychomotor retardation)\nThe craving and depression can last for months after stopping long-term heavy use. Withdrawal symptoms may also be associated with suicidal thoughts in some people.\nDuring withdrawal, there can be powerful, intense cravings for cocaine. The \"high\" associated with ongoing use may become less and less pleasant. It can produce fear and extreme suspicion rather than euphoria."}

Even so, the cravings may remain powerful.\nExams and Tests\nA physical examination and history of cocaine use are often all that is needed to diagnose this condition. However, medical testing will likely be done. It may include:\nBlood tests\nCardiac enzymes (to look for evidence of heart damage or heart attack)\nChest x-ray\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG, to measure electrical activity in the heart)\nToxicology screening\n(poison and drug)\nUrinalysis\nTreatment\nSymptoms of withdrawal usually disappear over time. If symptoms are severe, a live-in treatment program may be recommended. There, medicines may be used to treat the symptoms. Counseling may help end the addiction."}

Treatment should start with the least restrictive option. Outpatient care is as effective as inpatient care for most people.\nWithdrawal from cocaine may not be as dangerous as withdrawal from alcohol. However, the withdrawal from any chronic substance use can be very serious. There is a risk of suicide or overdose.\nPeople who have cocaine withdrawal will often use alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, or anti-anxiety medicines to treat their symptoms."}

There is a risk of suicide or overdose.\nPeople who have cocaine withdrawal will often use alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, or anti-anxiety medicines to treat their symptoms. Long-term use of these drugs is not recommended because it simply shifts addiction from one substance to another. Under proper medical supervision, however, short-term use of these medicines may be helpful in recovery.\nPresently, there are no medicines to reduce cravings for cocaine, but research is ongoing.\nPossible Complications\nComplications of cocaine withdrawal include:\nDepression\nCraving and overdose\nSuicide\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you use cocaine and need help to stop using it.\nIf you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat at\n988lifeline.org\n.
