Such bleeding may be called \"intermenstrual bleeding.\"\nRelated topics include:\nDysfunctional uterine bleeding\nHeavy, prolonged, or irregular menstrual periods\nConsiderations\nNormal menstrual flow lasts about 5 days. It produces a total blood loss of 30 to 80 mL (about 2 to 8 tablespoons), and occurs normally every 21 to 35 days.\nVaginal bleeding that occurs between periods or after menopause can be caused by various problems. Most are benign and can be easily treated. Sometimes, vaginal bleeding may be due to cancer or pre-cancer. Therefore, any unusual bleeding should be evaluated right away. The risk  for cancer increases to about 10% in women with postmenopausal bleeding.\nMake sure that bleeding is coming from the\nvagina\nand is not from the rectum or the urine."}

This exam can be done even while you are bleeding.\nCauses\nCauses may include:\nUterine fibroids or cervical or uterine polyps\nChanges in hormone levels\nInflammation or infection of the cervix (cervicitis)  or uterus (endometritis)\nInjury or disease of the vaginal opening (caused by intercourse, trauma, infection, polyp,\ngenital warts\n, ulcer, or varicose veins)\nIUD use (may cause occasional spotting)\nEctopic pregnancy\nMiscarriage\nOther pregnancy complications\nVaginal dryness due to lack of estrogen after\nmenopause\nStress\nUsing hormonal birth control irregularly (such as stopping and starting or skipping birth control pills, patches, or estrogen rings)\nUnderactive thyroid (low thyroid function)\nUse of blood thinners (anticoagulants)\nCancer or pre-cancer of the cervix, uterus, or"}

Uterine blood loss can be estimated by keeping track of how frequently a pad or tampon is soaked and how often one needs to be changed.\nIf possible, aspirin should be avoided, as it may prolong bleeding."}
