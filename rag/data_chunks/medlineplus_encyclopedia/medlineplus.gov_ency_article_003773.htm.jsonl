Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nVenogram - leg\nVenogram - leg\nVenography for legs is a test used to see the veins in the leg.\nX-rays\nare a form of electromagnetic radiation, like visible light is. However, these rays are of higher energy. Therefore, they can go through the body to form an image on film. Structures that are dense (such as bone) will appear white, air will be black, and other structures will be shades of gray.\nVeins are not normally seen in an x-ray, so a special dye is used to highlight them. This dye is called contrast.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis test is usually done in a hospital. You will be asked to lie on an x-ray table. A numbing medicine is applied to the area. You may ask for a sedative if you are anxious about the test.\nThe health care provider places a needle into a vein in the foot of the leg being looked at. An\nintravenous\n(IV) line is inserted through the needle. The contrast dye flows through this line into the vein."}

A tourniquet may be placed on your leg so the dye flows into the deeper veins.\nX-rays are taken as the dye flows through the leg.\nThe catheter is then removed, and the puncture site is bandaged.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will wear hospital clothing during this procedure. You will be asked to sign a consent form for the procedure. Remove all jewelry from the area being imaged.\nTell the provider:\nIf you are pregnant\nIf you have\nallergies to any medicines\nWhich medicines you are taking (including any herbal preparations)\nIf you have ever had any\nallergic reactions\nto x-ray contrast material or iodine substance\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe x-ray table is hard and cold. You may want to ask for a blanket or pillow. You will feel a sharp poke when the intravenous catheter is inserted."}

As the dye is injected, you may experience a burning sensation.\nThere may be tenderness and bruising at the site of the injection after the test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is used to identify and locate\nblood clots\nin the veins of the legs.\nNormal Results\nFree flow of the blood through the vein is normal.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be due to a blockage. The blockage can be caused by:\nBlood clot\nTumor\nInflammation\nRisks\nRisks of this test are:\nAllergic reaction to the contrast dye\nKidney failure, especially in the older adults or people with diabetes who take the medicine metformin (Glucophage)\nWorsening of a clot in the leg vein\nThere is low radiation exposure. However, most experts feel that the risk of most x-rays is smaller than other daily risks. Pregnant women and children are more sensitive to the risks of the x-ray.\nConsiderations\nUltrasound\nis used more often than this test because it has fewer risks and side effects."}
