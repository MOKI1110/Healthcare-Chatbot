Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTransvaginal ultrasound\nTransvaginal ultrasound\nTransvaginal ultrasound is a test used to look at a woman's uterus, ovaries, tubes,\ncervix\n, and pelvic area.\nTransvaginal means across or through the vagina. The ultrasound probe will be placed inside the vagina during the test.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will lie down on your back on a table with your knees bent. Your feet may be held in stirrups.\nThe ultrasound technician or doctor will introduce an ultrasound probe into your vagina. It may be mildly uncomfortable, but will not hurt. The probe is covered with a condom and a gel.\nThe probe transmits sound waves and records the reflections of those waves off body structures. The ultrasound machine creates an image of the body part.\nThe image is displayed on the ultrasound machine."}

In many offices, the person having the test can see the image also.\nThe health care provider will gently move the probe around the area to see the pelvic organs.\nIn some cases, a special transvaginal ultrasound method called saline infusion sonography (SIS) may be needed to more clearly view the uterus.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will be asked to undress, usually from the waist down. A transvaginal ultrasound is done with your bladder empty or partly filled.\nHow the Test will Feel\nIn most cases, there is no pain. Some women may have mild discomfort from the pressure of the probe."}
