Nutrients supply the body with energy. They provide substances to build and maintain healthy organs and fight off infection.\nInformation\nRecovery from\nsubstance use\nalso affects the body in different ways, including metabolism (processing energy), organ function, and mental well-being.\nThe impact of different drugs on nutrition is described below.\nOPIATES AND OPIOIDS\nOpiates and opioids (including codeine, oxycodone, heroin, morphine, and fentanyl) affect the gastrointestinal system. Constipation is a very common symptom of substance use."}

Constipation is a very common symptom of substance use. Symptoms that are common during withdrawal include:\nDiarrhea\nNausea and vomiting\nThese symptoms may lead to a lack of enough nutrients and an imbalance of electrolytes (such as sodium, potassium, and chloride).\nEating balanced meals may make these symptoms less severe (however, eating can be difficult, due to nausea). A\nhigh-fiber\ndiet with plenty of complex carbohydrates (such as whole grains, vegetables, peas, and beans) is recommended.\nALCOHOL\nAlcohol use\nis one of the major causes of nutritional deficiency in the United States. The most common deficiencies are of the B vitamins (\nB1\n,\nB6\n, and\nfolic acid\n). A lack of these nutrients causes\nanemia\nand nervous system (neurologic) problems. For example, a disease called\nWernicke-Korsakoff syndrome\n(\"wet brain\") occurs when heavy alcohol use causes a lack of vitamin B1.\nAlcohol use also damages two major organs involved in metabolism and nutrition: the liver and the pancreas. The liver removes toxins from harmful substances."}

Infants who were exposed to alcohol while in the womb often have physical and mental problems. The alcohol affects the growing baby by crossing the placenta.

Women who drink heavily are at high risk of\nosteoporosis\nand may need to take calcium supplements.\nSTIMULANTS\nStimulant use (such as crack,\ncocaine\n, and\nmethamphetamine\n) reduces appetite and leads to weight loss and poor nutrition. Users of these drugs may stay up for days at a time. They may be dehydrated and have electrolyte imbalances during these episodes. Returning to a normal diet can be hard if a person has lost a lot of weight.\nMemory problems, which may be permanent, are a complication of long-term stimulant use.\nMARIJUANA\nMarijuana can increase appetite.

Because balanced nutrition helps improve mood and health, it is important to encourage a healthy diet in a person recovering from alcohol and other drug problems.\nBut someone who has just given up an important source of pleasure may not be ready to make other drastic lifestyle changes. So, it is more important that the person avoid returning to substance use than sticking with a strict diet.\nGUIDELINES\nStick to regular mealtimes.\nEat foods that are low in fat.\nGet more protein,\ncomplex carbohydrates\n, and dietary fiber.\nVitamin and mineral supplements may be helpful during recovery (this may include B-complex, zinc, and vitamins A and C).\nA person with substance use is more likely to relapse when they have poor eating habits.

It is important to eat healthy meals and snacks and avoid high-calorie foods with low nutrition, such as sweets.\nThe following tips can help improve the odds of a lasting and healthy recovery:\nEat nutritious meals and snacks.\nGet physical activity and enough rest.\nReduce caffeine and stop smoking, if possible.\nSeek help from counselors or support groups on a regular basis.\nTake vitamin and mineral supplements if recommended by the health care provider.\nAlternative Names\nSubstance use recovery and diet; Nutrition and substance use\nReferences\nKowalchuk A, Reed BC.
