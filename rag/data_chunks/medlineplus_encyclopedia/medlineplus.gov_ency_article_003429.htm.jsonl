Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCaloric stimulation\nCaloric stimulation\nCaloric stimulation is a test that uses differences in temperature to diagnose damage to the acoustic nerve. This is the nerve that is involved in hearing and balance. The test also checks for damage to the brain stem.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis test stimulates your acoustic nerve by delivering cold or warm water or air into your ear canal. When cold water or air enters your ear and the inner ear changes temperature, it should cause fast, side-to-side eye movements called\nnystagmus\n. The test is done in the following way:\nBefore the test, your ear, especially the eardrum, will be checked. This is to make sure it is normal.\nOne ear is tested at a time.\nA small amount of cold water or air is gently delivered into one of your ears. Your eyes should show an involuntary movement called nystagmus. Then they should turn away from that ear and slowly back. If water is used, it is allowed to drain out of the ear canal.\nNext, a small amount of warm water or air is gently delivered into the same ear."}

If water is used, it is allowed to drain out of the ear canal.\nNext, a small amount of warm water or air is gently delivered into the same ear. Again, your eyes should show nystagmus. Then they should turn toward that ear and slowly back.\nYour other ear is tested in the same way.\nDuring the test, your health care provider may observe your eyes directly. Most often, this test is done as part of another test called\nelectronystagmography\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nDo not eat a heavy meal before the test. Avoid the following at least 24 hours before the test, because they can affect the results:\nAlcohol\nAllergy medicines\nCaffeine\nSedatives\nDo not stop taking your regular medicines without first talking to your provider.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may find the cold water or air in the ear uncomfortable. You may feel your eyes scanning back and forth during nystagmus. You may have\nvertigo\n, and sometimes, you may also have nausea. This lasts only a very short time."}

This rarely occurs because the amount of water to be used is measured.\nWater caloric stimulation should not be done if the eardrum is torn (perforated). This is because it can cause an\near infection\n. It also should not be done during an episode of vertigo because it can make symptoms worse.\nAlternative Names\nCaloric test; Bithermal caloric testing; Cold water calorics; Warm water calorics; Air caloric testing\nImages\nVertigo\nReferences\nBaloh RW, Jen JC.
