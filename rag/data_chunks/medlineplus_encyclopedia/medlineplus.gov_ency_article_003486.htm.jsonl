Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCalcium - ionized\nCalcium - ionized\nIonized calcium is calcium in your blood that is not attached to proteins. It is also called free calcium.\nAll cells need calcium in order to work. Calcium helps build strong bones and teeth. It is important for heart function. It also helps with muscle contraction, nerve signaling, and blood clotting.\nThis article discusses the test used to measure the amount of ionized calcium in blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is\ndrawn from a vein\nlocated on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nMany medicines can interfere with blood test results.\nYour health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test.\nDO NOT stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order this test if you have signs of bone, kidney, liver or parathyroid disease."}

The test may also be done to monitor progress and treatment of these diseases.\nMost of the time, blood tests measure your total calcium level. This looks at both ionized calcium and calcium attached to proteins. You may need to have a separate ionized calcium test if you have factors that increase or decrease total calcium levels. These may include abnormal blood levels of albumin or immunoglobulins.\nNormal Results\nResults generally fall in these ranges:\nChildren: 4.8 to 5.3 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 1.20 to 1.32 millimoles per liter (millimol/L)\nAdults: 4.8 to 5.6 mg/dL or 1.20 to 1.40 millimol/L\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nThe examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests."}

Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nHigher-than-normal levels of ionized calcium may be due to:\nDecreased levels of calcium in the urine from an unknown cause (also called hypocalciuria)\nHyperparathyroidism\nHyperthyroidism\nMilk-alkali syndrome\nMultiple myeloma\nPaget disease\nSarcoidosis\nThiazide diuretics\nThrombocytosis (high platelet count)\nTumors\nVitamin A excess\nVitamin D\nexcess\nLower-than-normal levels may be due to (or caused by):\nHypoparathyroidism\nMalabsorption\nOsteomalacia\nPancreatitis\nRenal failure\nRickets\nVitamin D deficiency\nAlternative Names\nFree calcium; Ionized calcium\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nBringhurst FR, Demay MB, Kronenberg HM.
