The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\nSwallowing this type of poison can affect many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue death. Infection, shock, and death can follow, even several months after the poison has been swallowed. Scars may form in these tissues leading to long-term problems with breathing, swallowing and digestion.\nIf gasoline gets into the lungs (aspiration), serious and possibly permanent lung damage can occur.\nThe harsh taste of gasoline makes it unlikely that large quantities will be swallowed. However, several cases of poisoning have occurred in people trying to suck (siphon) gas from an automobile tank using a garden hose or other tube. This practice is extremely dangerous and is not advised.\nReferences\nNelson LS, Calello DP. Acute poisoning. In: Goldman L, Cooney KA, eds.\nGoldman-Cecil Medicine\n. 27th ed.
