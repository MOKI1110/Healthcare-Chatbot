Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterwards, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to check if you have too much or too little vitamin A in your blood. (These conditions are uncommon in the United States.)\nNormal Results\nNormal values range from 20 to 60 micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL) or 0.69 to 2.09 micromoles per liter (micromol/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA lower than normal value means you do not have enough vitamin A in your blood. This may cause:\nBones or teeth that do not develop correctly\nDry or inflamed eyes\nFeeling more irritable\nHair loss\nLoss of appetite\nNight blindness\nRecurring infections\nSkin rashes\nA higher than normal value means you have excess vitamin A in your blood (toxic levels). This may cause:\nAnemia\nBone and muscle pain\nDiarrhea\nDouble vision\nHair loss\nIncreased pressure in the brain (pseudotumor cerebri)\nLack of muscle coordination (ataxia)\nLiver and spleen enlargement\nLoss of appetite\nNausea\nVitamin A deficiency may occur if your body has trouble absorbing fats through the digestive tract."}

Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nAlternative Names\nRetinol test\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nMarkell M, Siddiqui HA.
