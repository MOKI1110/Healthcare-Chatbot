Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nELISA blood test\nELISA blood test\nELISA stands for enzyme-linked immunoassay. It is a commonly used laboratory test to detect\nantibodies\nin the blood. An antibody is a protein produced by the body's immune system when it detects foreign or potentially harmful substances, called antigens.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. Most of the time, blood is\ndrawn from a vein\nlocated on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\nThe sample is sent to a laboratory where the targeted antibody or\nantigen\nis linked to a specific\nenzyme\n. If the target substance is in the sample, the test solution turns a different color.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is often used to see if you have been exposed to bacteria, viruses or other agents that cause infection."}

It is also used to screen for current or past infections. It is also used to test for some disorders of the immune system.\nNormal Results\nNormal values depend on the type of substance being identified. Some laboratories use different measurements or test different samples. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal values depend on the type of substance being identified. In some people, a positive result may be normal.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other."}
