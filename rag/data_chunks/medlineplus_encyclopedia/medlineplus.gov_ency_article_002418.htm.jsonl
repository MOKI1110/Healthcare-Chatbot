It must be obtained from the diet.\nFunction\nChromium is important in the\nbreakdown\nof fats and\ncarbohydrates\n. It stimulates fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis. They are important for brain function and other body processes. Chromium also aids in insulin action and glucose breakdown.\nFood Sources\nThe best source of chromium is brewer's yeast. However, many people do not use brewer's yeast because it causes bloating (\nabdominal distention\n) and\nnausea\n. Meat and whole grain products are relatively good sources. Some fruits, vegetables, and spices are also relatively good sources.\nOther good sources of chromium include the following:\nBeef\nLiver\nEggs\nChicken\nOysters\nWheat germ\nBroccoli\nSide Effects\nLack of chromium may be seen in people with impaired glucose tolerance. It occurs in older people with\ntype 2 diabetes\nand in infants with\nprotein-calorie malnutrition\n."}

It occurs in older people with\ntype 2 diabetes\nand in infants with\nprotein-calorie malnutrition\n. Taking a chromium supplement may help reduce insulin resistance but is not recommended as the sole treatment for people with diabetes.\nBecause of the low absorption and high excretion rates of chromium, toxicity is not common.\nRecommendations\nDosages for chromium, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)\n: The average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people. An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence.\nAdequate Intake (AI)\n: This level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA."}

An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence.\nAdequate Intake (AI)\n: This level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA.

Women who are pregnant or producing breast milk (lactating) need higher amounts."}
