Protozoa are one-celled organisms.\nThe different forms of leishmaniasis are:\nCutaneous leishmaniasis affects the skin and mucous membranes. Skin sores usually start at the site of the sandfly bite. In a few people, sores may develop on mucous membranes.\nSystemic, or visceral, leishmaniasis affects the entire body. This form occurs 2 to 8 months after a person is bitten by the sandfly. Most people do not remember having a skin sore. This form can lead to deadly complications. The parasites damage the immune system by decreasing the numbers of disease-fighting cells.\nCases of leishmaniasis have been reported on all continents except Australia and Antarctica. In the Americas, the disease can be found in Mexico and South America."}

In the Americas, the disease can be found in Mexico and South America. It has also been reported in military personnel who have returned from the Persian Gulf.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of cutaneous leishmaniasis depend on where the lesions are located and may include:\nBreathing difficulty\nSkin sores, which may become a skin ulcer that heals very slowly\nStuffy nose, runny nose, and nosebleeds\nSwallowing difficulty\nUlcers and wearing away (erosion) in the mouth, tongue, gums, lips, nose, and inner nose\nSystemic visceral infection in children usually begins suddenly with:\nCough\nDiarrhea\nFever\nVomiting\nAdults usually have a fever for 2 weeks to 2 months, along with symptoms such as\nfatigue\n,\nweakness\n, and appetite loss."}

You will be asked if you recall being bitten by sandflies or if you've been in an area where leishmaniasis is common.\nTests that may be done to diagnose the condition include:\nBiopsy\nof the spleen and culture\nBone marrow biopsy\nand culture\nDirect agglutination assay\nIndirect immunofluorescent antibody test\nLeishmania-specific PCR test\nLiver biopsy\nand culture\nLymph node biopsy\nand culture\nMontenegro skin test (not approved in the United States)\nSkin biopsy\nand culture\nOther tests that may be done include:\nComplete blood count\nwith\ndifferential\nSerologic testing\nSerum albumin\nSerum immunoglobulin levels\nSerum\nprot"}
