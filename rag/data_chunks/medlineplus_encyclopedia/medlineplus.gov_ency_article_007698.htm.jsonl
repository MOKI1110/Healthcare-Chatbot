One is on the right side, and the other is on the left. Each has two chambers, an atrium and a ventricle. The ventricles are the major pumps in the heart.\nThe right system receives blood from the veins of the whole body. This is \"blue\" blood, which is poor in oxygen and rich in carbon dioxide.\nThe left system receives blood from the lungs. This is \"red\" blood which has become rich in oxygen after passing through the lungs."}

This is \"red\" blood which has become rich in oxygen after passing through the lungs. Blood leaves the heart through the aorta, the major artery that feeds blood to the entire body.\nValves are flaps that open and close so blood will flow in the right direction. There are four valves in the heart.\nOne common way heart failure occurs in children is when the blood from the left side of the heart mixes with the right side of the heart. This leads to an overflow of blood into the lungs or one or more chambers of the heart. This occurs most often due to\nbirth defects of the heart or major blood vessels\n. These include:\nA hole between the right or left upper or lower chambers of the heart\nA defect of the major arteries\nDefective heart valves that are leaky or narrowed\nA defect in the formation of the heart chambers\nAbnormal development or damage to the heart muscle is the other common cause of heart failure."}

This may be due to:\nInfection from a virus or bacteria that causes damage to the heart muscle or heart valves\nMedicines used for other illnesses, most often cancer medicines\nAbnormal heart rhythms\nMuscle disorders, such as\nmuscular dystrophy\nGenetic disorders leading to abnormal development of the heart muscle\nSymptoms\nAs the heart's pumping becomes less effective, blood may back up in other areas of the body.\nFluid may build up in the lungs, liver, abdomen, and the arms and legs. This is called \"congestive heart failure\" or just \"heart failure\".\nSymptoms of heart failure may be present at birth, start during the first weeks of life, or develop slowly in an older child.\nSymptoms of heart failure in infants may include:\nBreathing problems, such as rapid breathing or breathing that appears to take more effort."}
