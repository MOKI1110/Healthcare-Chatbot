It is used to treat certain diseases of the thyroid gland.\nDescription\nThe thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped gland located in the front of your lower neck. It produces hormones that help your body regulate your\nmetabolism\n.\nYour thyroid needs iodine to function properly. That iodine comes from the food you eat. No other organs use or absorb much iodine from your blood. Excess iodine in your body is excreted in the urine.\nRadioiodine  is used for treatment of several thyroid conditions. It is given by nuclear medicine specialists. Depending on the dose of the radioiodine, you may be able to go home the day of the procedure."}

It is given by nuclear medicine specialists. Depending on the dose of the radioiodine, you may be able to go home the day of the procedure. For higher doses, you need to stay in a special room in the hospital and have your urine monitored for the radioactive iodine being excreted.\nYou will swallow radioiodine in the form of capsules (pills) or a liquid.\nYour thyroid will absorb most of the radioactive iodine.\nThe nuclear medicine team may do scans during your treatment to check where the iodine has been absorbed.\nThe radiation will kill cells in the thyroid gland and, if the treatment is for thyroid cancer, any\nthyroid cancer\ncells that might have traveled and settled in other organs.\nMost other cells do not take up iodine, so the treatment is very safe. Very high doses can sometimes decrease the production of saliva (spit) or injure the colon or bone marrow.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nRadioiodine therapy is used to treat\nhyperthyroidism\nand thyroid cancer.\nHyperthyroidism occurs when your thyroid gland makes excess thyroid hormones."}

Radioiodine treats this condition by killing overactive thyroid cells and by shrinking an enlarged thyroid gland. This stops the thyroid gland from producing too much thyroid hormone.\nThe nuclear medicine team will try to calculate a dose that leaves you with normal thyroid function. But, this calculation is not always completely accurate. As a result, the treatment can lead to\nhypothyroidism\n(underactive thyroid gland), which needs to be treated with thyroid hormone supplementation.\nRadioactive iodine treatment is also used in the treatment of some thyroid cancers after surgery has already removed the cancer and most of the thyroid gland. The radioactive iodine kills any remaining thyroid cancer cells that might remain after surgery. You may receive this treatment 3 to 6 weeks after the surgery to remove your thyroid."}

Talk to your health care provider about the risks and benefits of this treatment for you.\nRisks\nRisks of radioiodine therapy include:\nLow sperm count and\ninfertility\nin men for up to 2 years after treatment (rare)\nIrregular periods in women for up to one year (rare)\nVery low or absent thyroid hormone levels that require medicine for thyroid hormone replacement (common)\nShort-lasting side effects include:\nNeck tenderness and swelling\nSwelling of the salivary glands (glands at the bottom and back of the mouth where saliva is produced)\nDry mouth\nGastritis\n(inflammation of the lining of the stomach)\nTaste changes\nDry eyes\nWomen should not be pregnant or breastfeeding at the time of treatment, and they should not become pregnant for"}

Symptoms usually peak about 10 to 14 days after treatment. Most symptoms can be controlled with medicines called beta blockers. Very rarely radioactive iodine treatment can cause a severe form of hyperthyroidism called thyroid storm.\nBefore the Procedure\nYou may have tests to check your thyroid hormone levels before the therapy.\nYou may be asked to stop taking any thyroid hormone medicine before the procedure.\nYou will be asked to stop any thyroid-suppressing medicines (propylthiouracil, methimazole) at least one week before the procedure (very important or the treatment will not work).\nYou may be placed on a low-iodine diet for 2 to 3 weeks before the procedure."}
