It is an ongoing (chronic) inflammatory condition. Psoriatic arthritis occurs in 7% to 42% of people with psoriasis. Nail psoriasis is linked to psoriatic arthritis.\nIn most cases, psoriasis comes before the arthritis. In a few people, the arthritis comes before the skin disease. However, having severe, wide-spread psoriasis appears to increase the chance of getting psoriatic arthritis.\nThe cause of psoriatic arthritis is not known. Genes, immune system, and environmental factors may play a role. It is likely that the skin and joint diseases have similar causes. However, they may not occur together.\nSymptoms\nThe arthritis may be mild and involve only a few joints. The joints at the end of the fingers or toes may be more affected."}

However, they may not occur together.\nSymptoms\nThe arthritis may be mild and involve only a few joints. The joints at the end of the fingers or toes may be more affected. Psoriatic arthritis can cause arthritis only on one side of the body or both sides of the body.\nIn some people, the disease may be severe and affect many joints, including the spine. Symptoms in the spine include stiffness and pain. They most often occur in the lower spine and sacrum.\nSome people with psoriatic arthritis may have inflammation of the eyes.\nMost of the time, people with psoriatic arthritis have the skin and nail changes of psoriasis. Often, the skin gets worse at the same time as the arthritis.\nTendons may become inflamed with psoriatic arthritis. Examples include the Achilles tendon, the plantar fascia, and the tendon sheath in the hand.\nExams and Tests\nDuring a physical exam, the health care provider will look for:\nJoint swelling\nSkin patches, usually red and scaly (psoriasis)\nPitting in the nails\nJoint tenderness\nInflammation in the eyes\nJoint x-rays\nmay be done.\nThere are no specific blood tests for psoriatic arthritis or for psoriasis."}

Tests to check for other types of arthritis may be done:\nRheumatoid factor\nAnti-CCP antibodies\nThe provider may test for a gene called HLA-B27. People with involvement of the spine are more likely to have HLA-B27. Most people who are HLA-B27 positive do not have psoriatic arthritis.\nTreatment\nYour provider may suggest nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to reduce pain and swelling of the joints.\nArthritis that does not improve with NSAIDs may need to be treated with medicines called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). These include:\nMethotrexate\nLeflunomide\nSulfasalazine\nApremilast is another medicine used for the treatment of psoriatic arthritis.\nMultiple injectable biologic medicines are effective for progressive psoriatic arthritis that is not controlled with DMARDs. These medicines block proteins involved in the inflammation process."}

These medicines block proteins involved in the inflammation process. They are often helpful for both the skin disease and the joint disease of psoriatic arthritis.\nAdditionally, there are two JAK-inhibitors that are approved for psoriatic arthritis: Tofacitinib and Upadacitinib. These medications are given orally.\nVery painful joints may be treated with steroid injections. These are used when only one or a few joints are involved. Most experts do not recommend oral corticosteroids for psoriatic arthritis. Their use may worsen psoriasis and interfere with the effect of other medicines.\nIn rare cases, surgery may be needed to repair or replace damaged joints.\nPeople with inflammation of the eye should see an ophthalmologist.\nYour provider may suggest a mix of rest and exercise. Physical therapy may help increase joint movement. You may also use heat and cold therapy.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe disease is sometimes mild and affects only a few joints. However, in many people with psoriatic arthritis damage to joints occurs within the first several years."}
