They are located just in front of your ears. The abbreviation \"TMJ\" refers to the name of the joint, but it is often used to mean any disorders or symptoms of this region.\nMany TMJ-related symptoms are caused by the effects of physical stress on the structures around the joint. These structures include:\nCartilage disk in the joint\nMuscles of the jaw, face, and neck\nNearby ligaments, blood vessels, and nerves\nTeeth\nFor many people with temporomandibular joint disorders, the cause is unknown. Some causes given for this condition are not well-proven. They include:\nA bad bite or orthodontic braces.\nStress and tooth grinding. Many people with TMJ problems do not grind their teeth, and many who have been grinding their teeth for a long time do not have problems with their temporomandibular joint."}

Many people with TMJ problems do not grind their teeth, and many who have been grinding their teeth for a long time do not have problems with their temporomandibular joint. For some people, the stress associated with this disorder may be caused by the pain, as opposed to being the cause of the problem.\nPoor posture can also be an important factor in TMJ symptoms. For example, holding your head forward while looking at a computer all day strains the muscles of your face and neck.\nOther factors that may make TMJ symptoms worse include poor diet and lack of sleep.\nMany people end up having \"trigger points.\" These are contracted muscles in your jaw, head, and neck."}

Get the opinions of several providers. The good news is that most people eventually find something that helps.\nAsk your provider or dentist about medicines you can use. These might include:\nShort-term use of acetaminophen or ibuprofen, naproxen (or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)\nMuscle relaxant medicines or antidepressants\nMuscle relaxant injections like toxin botulinum\nRarely, corticosteroid shots in the TMJ to treat inflammation\nMouth or bite guards, also called splints or appliances, have long been used to treat teeth grinding, clenching, and TMJ disorders."}

Other people may feel worse pain when they wear one.\nThere are different types of splints. Some fit over the top teeth, while others fit over the bottom teeth.\nPermanent use of these items may not be recommended. You should also stop if they cause any changes in your bite.\nIf conservative treatments do not work, it does not automatically mean you need more aggressive treatment.

They tend to go away in time with little or no treatment. Most cases can be successfully treated.\nSome cases of pain go away on their own without treatment. TMJ-related pain may return again in the future. If the cause is nighttime clenching, treatment can be very tricky because it is a sleeping behavior that is hard to control.\nMouth splints are a common treatment approach for teeth grinding. While some splints may silence the grinding by providing a flat, even surface, they may not be as effective at reducing pain or stopping clenching. Splints may work well in the short-term, but could become less effective over time. Some splints can also cause bite changes if they are not fitted properly."}
