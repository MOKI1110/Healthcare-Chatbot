Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTurbinate surgery\nTurbinate surgery\nThe inside walls of the nose have 3 pairs of long thin bones covered with a layer of tissue that can expand. These bones are called nasal turbinates.\nAllergies\nor other nasal problems can cause the turbinates to swell and block airflow. Surgery can be done to open blocked airways and improve your breathing.\nDescription\nThere are several types of turbinate surgery:\nTurbinectomy:\nAll or part of the lower turbinate is taken out. This can be done in several different ways, but sometimes a tiny, high-speed device (microdebrider) is used to shave off the extra tissue.\nThe surgery may be done through a lighted camera (endoscope) that is placed into the nose.\nYou may have general anesthesia or local anesthesia with sedation, so you are asleep and pain-free during surgery.\nTurbinoplasty:\nA tool is placed in the nose to change the position of the turbinate."}

Laser light or radiofrequency energy goes through this tube and shrinks the turbinate tissue.\nThe procedure can be done in the surgeon's office using local anesthesia.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nYour health care provider may recommend this procedure if:\nYou have trouble breathing though your nose because the airways are swollen or blocked.\nOther treatments, such as allergy medicines, allergy shots, and nose sprays have not helped your breathing.\nRisks\nRisks for any surgery are:\nAllergic reactions to medicines\nBreathing problems\nHeart problems\nBleeding\nInfection\nRisks for this surgery are:\nScar tissue or crusting in the nose\nA hole in the tissue that divides the sides of the nose (septum)\nLoss of feeling in the skin"}

Symptoms of nasal blockage may come back, but many people still have better breathing 2 years after the procedure.\nAlmost all people who have turbinoplasty with a microdebrider will still have improved breathing 3 years after surgery. Some do not need to use nasal medicine anymore.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nYou will go home on the same day as surgery.\nYou will have some discomfort and pain in your face for 2 or 3 days. Your nose will feel blocked until the swelling goes down. You may feel partly congested for a few weeks.\nYour surgeon or nurse will show you how to take care of your nose during your recovery.\nYou will be able to go back to work or school in 1 week. You can return to your normal activities after 1 week.\nIt may take up to 2 months to heal completely.\nAlternative Names\nTurbinectomy; Turbinoplasty; Turbinate reduction; Nasal airway surgery; Nasal obstruction - turbinate surgery\nReferences\nBeswick DM, Ramakrishnan JB."}
