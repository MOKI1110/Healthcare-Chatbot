The prostate is a small, walnut-shaped structure that makes up part of a man's reproductive system. It wraps around the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body.\nCauses\nProstate cancer is the most common cause of death from cancer in men over age 75. Prostate cancer is rarely found in men younger than 40.\nPeople who are at high risk include:\nAfrican American men, who are also more likely to develop this cancer at every age\nMen age 60 years and above\nMen who have a father or brother with prostate cancer\nOther people at risk include:\nMen who have been exposed to Agent Orange\nMen who eat a diet high in fat, especially animal fat\nObese men\nProstate cancer is less common in people who do not eat meat (vegetarians).\nA common problem in almost all men as they grow older is an\nenlarged prostate\nthat affects their urinary function. This is called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. It does not raise your risk for prostate cancer."}

This is called benign prostatic hyperplasia, or BPH. It does not raise your risk for prostate cancer. But, it can increase your\nprostate-specific antigen\n(PSA) blood test result.\nSymptoms\nWith early prostate cancer, there are often no symptoms.\nThe PSA blood test may be done to screen men for prostate cancer. Often, the PSA level rises before there are any symptoms.\nThe symptoms listed below can occur with prostate cancer as it grows larger in the prostate. These symptoms can also be caused by other prostate problems:\nDelayed or\nslowed start of urinary stream\nDribbling or leakage of urine, most often after urinating\nSlow urinary stream\nStraining when urinating, or not being able to empty all of the urine\nBlood in the urine or semen\nWhen the cancer has spread, there may be bone pain or tenderness, most often in the lower back and pelvic bones.\nExams and Tests\nAn abnormal prostate gland felt during a\ndigital rectal exam\nmay be the only sign of prostate cancer.\nbiopsy\nis needed to tell if you have prostate cancer. A biopsy is a procedure to remove a sample of tissue from the prostate."}

A biopsy is a procedure to remove a sample of tissue from the prostate. The sample is sent to a lab for examination. It will be done in your doctor's office.\nYour doctor may recommend a biopsy if:\nYou have a high PSA level\nA digital rectal exam reveals that your prostate is hard or has an uneven surface\nThe biopsy result is reported using what is called a Gleason grade and a Gleason score.\nThe Gleason grade tells you how fast the cancer might spread. It grades tumors on a scale of 1 through 5. You may have different grades of cancer in one biopsy sample. The two most common grades are added together. This gives you the Gleason score. The higher your Gleason score, the more likely the cancer can spread beyond the prostate:\nScores 2 through 6: Low-grade prostate cancer.\nScore 7: Intermediate- (or in the middle) grade cancer."}

A higher group means that more of the cancer cells look different from normal cells."}

Your doctor will discuss your treatment options with you.\nIf the cancer has not spread outside the prostate gland, common\ntreatments\ninclude:\nSurgery (\nradical prostatectomy\n)\nRadiation therapy\n, including\nbrachytherapy\n, external beam therapy, and\nproton therapy\nIf you are older, your doctor may recommend simply monitoring the cancer with PSA tests and biopsies. This is called active surveillance.\nHormone therapy is mainly used for cancer that has spread beyond the prostate. It helps relieve symptoms and prevents further growth and spread of the cancer."}

Problems with urine control are possible after surgery and radiation therapy. Discuss your concerns with your health care provider.\nAfter treatment for prostate cancer, you will be closely watched to make sure the cancer does not spread.
