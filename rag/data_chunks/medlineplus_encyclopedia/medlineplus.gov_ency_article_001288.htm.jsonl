The testicles are the male reproductive glands located in the scrotum.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of testicular cancer is poorly understood. Factors that may increase a man's risk of developing testicular cancer are:\nAbnormal testicle development\nExposure to certain chemicals\nFamily history of testicular cancer\nHIV infection\nHistory of testicular cancer\nHistory of an\nundescended testicle\n(one or both testicles fail to move into the scrotum before birth)\nKlinefelter syndrome\nInfertility\nTobacco use\nDown syndrome\nTesticular cancer is the most common cancer in young and middle-aged men."}

It can also occur in older men, and in rare cases, in younger boys.\nWhite men are more likely than African American and Asian American men to develop this type of cancer.\nThere is no link between\nvasectomy\nand testicular cancer.\nThere are two main types of testicular cancer:\nSeminomas\nNonseminomas\nThese cancers grow from germ cells, the cells that make sperm.\nSeminoma: This is a slow-growing form of testicular cancer found in men in their 40s and 50s. The cancer is in the testes, but it can spread to the lymph nodes. Lymph node involvement is either treated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Seminomas are very sensitive to radiation therapy.\nNonseminoma: This more common type of testicular cancer tends to grow more quickly than seminomas.\nNonseminoma tumors are often made up of more than one type of cell, and are identified according to these different cell types:\nChoriocarcinoma\n(rare)\nEmbryonal carcinoma\nTeratoma\nYolk sac tumor\nA stromal tumor is a rare type of testicular tumor."}

Stromal tumors usually occur during childhood.\nSymptoms\nThere may be no symptoms. The cancer may be a painless lump in the testes. If there are symptoms, they may include:\nDiscomfort or pain in the testicle, or a feeling of heaviness in the scrotum\nPain in the back or lower abdomen\nEnlarged testicle or a change in the way it feels\nExcess amount of breast tissue (\ngynecomastia\n), however this can occur normally in adolescent boys who do not have testicular cancer\nLump or swelling in either testicle\nSymptoms in other parts of the body, such as the lungs, abdomen, pelvis, back, or brain, may also occur if the cancer has spread outside the testicles.\nExams and Tests\nA physical examination typically reveals a firm lump (mass) in one of the testicles. When the health care provider holds a flashlight up to the scrotum, the light does not pass through the lump."}
