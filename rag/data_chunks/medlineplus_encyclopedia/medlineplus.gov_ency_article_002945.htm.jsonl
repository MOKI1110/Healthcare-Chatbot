The surgeon makes a cut in the abdomen and removes all or part of the stomach, depending on the reason for the procedure.\nDepending on what part of the stomach was removed, the intestine may need to be reconnected to the remaining stomach (partial gastrectomy) or to the esophagus (total gastrectomy).\nSome surgeons can also do this surgery using a laparoscope. A laparoscope has a tiny camera that is inserted into your belly through a small cut. Video from the camera will appear on a monitor in the operating room. The surgeon views the monitor to do the surgery. When done this way, the surgery, which is called laparoscopy, is done with a few small surgical cuts."}
