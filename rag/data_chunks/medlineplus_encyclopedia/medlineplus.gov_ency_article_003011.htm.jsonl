Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAdenoid removal\nAdenoid removal\nAdenoid removal is surgery to take out the adenoid glands. The adenoid glands sit behind your nose above the roof of your mouth in the nasopharynx. Air passes over these glands when you take a breath.\nThe adenoids are often taken out at the same time as the tonsils (\ntonsillectomy\n).\nAdenoid removal is also called adenoidectomy. The procedure is most often done in children.\nDescription\nYour child will be given general anesthesia before surgery. This means your child will be asleep and unable to feel pain.\nDuring surgery:\nThe surgeon places a small tool into your child's mouth to keep it open.\nThe surgeon removes the adenoid glands using a spoon-shaped tool (curette). Or, another tool that helps cut away soft tissue is used.\nSome surgeons use electricity to heat the tissue, remove it, and stop bleeding. This is called electrocautery. Another method uses radiofrequency (RF) energy to do the same thing. This is called coblation."}

A cutting tool called a microdebrider can also be used to remove the adenoid tissue.\nAbsorbent material called packing material may also be used to control bleeding.\nYour child will stay in the recovery room after surgery. You will be allowed to take your child home when your child is awake and can breathe easily, cough, and swallow. In most cases, this will be a few hours after surgery.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nA health care provider may recommend this procedure if:\nEnlarged adenoids\nare blocking your child's airway. Symptoms in your child can include heavy snoring, problems breathing through the nose, and episodes of not breathing during sleep.\nYour child has chronic ear infections that occur often, continue despite use of antibiotics, cause hearing loss, or cause your child to miss a lot of school days.\nAdenoidectomy may also be recommended if your child has tonsillitis that keeps coming back.\nThe adenoids normally shrink as children grow older."}

Such medicines include aspirin and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin).\nThe night before the surgery, your child should have nothing to eat or drink after midnight. This includes water.\nYou will be told what medicines your child should take on the day of surgery. Have your child take the medicine with a sip of water.\nAfter the Procedure\nYour child will go home on the same day as surgery."}
