Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nDislocation\nDislocation\nA dislocation is a disruption of the normal position of the ends of two or more bones where they meet at a joint. A joint is the place where two bones connect, which allows movement.\nA dislocated joint is a joint where the bones are no longer in their normal positions.\nConsiderations\nIt may be hard to tell a dislocated joint from a\nbroken bone\n. Both are emergencies that need first aid treatment.\nMost dislocations can be treated in your health care provider's office or an emergency room. You may be given\nmedicine to make you sleepy\nand to numb the area. Sometimes,\ngeneral anesthesia\nthat puts you into a deep sleep is needed.\nWhen treated early, most dislocations do not cause permanent injury.\nYou should expect that:\nInjuries to the surrounding tissues generally take 6 to 12 weeks to heal. Sometimes, surgery to repair a ligament that tears when the joint is dislocated is needed.\nInjuries to nerves and blood vessels may result in more long-term or permanent problems.\nOnce a joint has been dislocated, it is more likely to happen again."}

After being treated in the emergency room, you should follow-up with an orthopedic surgeon (a bone and joint specialist).\nCauses\nDislocations are usually caused by a sudden impact to the joint. This usually occurs following a blow, fall, or other trauma.\nSymptoms\nA dislocated joint may be:\nAccompanied by numbness or tingling at the joint or beyond it\nVery painful, especially if you try to use the joint or put weight on it\nLimited in movement\nSwollen or bruised\nVisibly out of place, discolored, or misshapen\nNursemaid's elbow\n, or pulled elbow, is a partial dislocation that is common in toddlers.

This dislocation can be easily treated in your provider's office.\nFirst Aid\nFirst aid steps to take:\nCall 911 or the local emergency number before you begin treating someone who may have a dislocation, especially if the accident that caused the injury may be life threatening.\nIf the person has a serious injury, check their airway, breathing, and circulation. If necessary, begin\nCPR\n, or bleeding control.\nDo not move the person if you think that their head, back, or leg has been injured. Keep the person calm and still.\nIf the skin is broken, take steps to prevent infection. Do not blow on the wound. Rinse the area gently with clean water to remove any dirt you can see, but do not scrub or probe. Cover the area with sterile dressings before immobilizing the injured joint. Do not attempt to put the bone back in place unless you are a bone specialist.\nApply a\nsplint\nor\nsling\nto the injured joint in the position in which you found it. Do not move the joint."}

Do not attempt to put the bone back in place unless you are a bone specialist.\nApply a\nsplint\nor\nsling\nto the injured joint in the position in which you found it. Do not move the joint. Also immobilize the area above and below the injured area.\nCheck blood circulation around the injury by pressing firmly on the skin in the affected area. It should turn white, then regain color within a couple of seconds after you stop pressing on it. To reduce the risk for developing infection, do not do this step if the skin is broken.\nApply ice packs to ease pain and swelling, but do not put ice directly on the skin. Wrap the ice in a clean cloth.\nTake steps to prevent\nshock\n. Unless there is a head, leg, or back injury, lay the victim flat, elevate their feet about 12 inches (in) or 30 centimeters (cm), and cover the person with a coat or blanket.\nDO NOT\nDo not move the person unless the injury has been completely immobilized.\nDo not move a person with an injured hip, pelvis, or upper leg unless it is absolutely necessary."}
