This causes the urine to back up and injure one or both kidneys.\nCauses\nObstructive uropathy occurs when urine cannot drain through the urinary tract. Urine backs up into the kidneys and may cause them to become swollen. This condition is known as\nhydronephrosis\n.\nObstructive uropathy can affect one or both kidneys. It can occur suddenly or be a long-term problem.\nCommon causes of obstructive uropathy include:\nBladder stones\nKidney stones\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia\n(enlarged prostate)\nAdvanced prostate cancer\nBladder or ureteral cancer\nBladder prolapse (also called dropped bladder)\nColon cancer\nCervical or uterine cancer\nOvarian cancer\nAny cancer that spreads\nScar tissue that occurs inside or outside of the ureters\nScar tissue that occurs inside the urethra\nProblems with the nerves that supply the bladder\nSymptoms\nSymptoms depend on whether the problem starts slowly or suddenly and if one or both kidneys are involved."}

Symptoms may include:\nMild to severe pain in the flank. The pain may be felt on one or both sides.\nFever.\nNausea or vomiting.\nWeight gain or swelling (edema) of kidney.\nYou may also have problems passing urine, such as:\nUrge to urinate often\nDecrease in the force of urine stream or difficulty urinating\nDribbling of urine\nNot feeling as if the bladder is emptied\nNeed to urinate more often at night\nDecreased amount of urine\nLeakage of urine (urinary incontinence)\nBlood in urine\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will order functional or imaging studies to detect obstructive uropathy."}

However, the cause of the blockage must be removed and the urinary system repaired."}

However, the cause of the blockage must be removed and the urinary system repaired. Surgery may be needed for long-term relief from the problem.\nThe kidney may need to be removed if the blockage causes severe loss of function.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf the blockage comes on suddenly, kidney damage is less likely if the problem is detected and treated right away. Often, the damage to the kidneys goes away. Long-term damage to the kidneys may occur if the blockage has been present for a long time.\nIf only one kidney is damaged, chronic kidney problems are less likely.\nYou may need dialysis or a kidney transplant if there is damage to both kidneys and they do not function, even after the blockage is repaired.\nPossible Complications\nObstructive uropathy can cause permanent and severe damage to the kidneys, resulting in kidney failure.\nIf the problem was caused by a blockage in the bladder, the bladder may have long-term damage."}
