Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nThoracic aortic aneurysm\nThoracic aortic aneurysm\nAn aneurysm is an abnormal widening or ballooning of a portion of an artery due to weakness in the wall of the blood vessel.\nA thoracic aortic aneurysm occurs in the part of the body's largest artery (the aorta) that passes through the chest.\nCauses\nThe most common cause of a thoracic aortic aneurysm is\nhardening of the arteries\n(atherosclerosis). This condition is more common in people with high cholesterol, long-term high blood pressure, or who smoke.\nOther risk factors for a thoracic aneurysm include:\nChanges caused by age\nConnective tissue disorders such as\nMarfan\nor Ehlers-Danlos syndrome\nInflammation of the aorta\nInjury from falls or motor vehicle accidents\nSyphilis\nSymptoms\nAneurysms develop slowly over many years."}

Most people have no symptoms until the aneurysm begins to leak or expand.\nSymptoms often begin suddenly when:\nThe aneurysm grows quickly.\nThe aneurysm tears open (called a rupture).\nBlood leaks along the wall of the aorta (aortic dissection).\nIf the aneurysm presses on nearby structures, the following symptoms may occur:\nHoarseness\nSwallowing problems\nHigh-pitched breathing (stridor)\nSwelling in the neck\nOther symptoms may include:\nChest or upper back pain\nClammy skin\nNausea and vomiting\nRapid heart rate\nSense of impending doom\nExams and Tests\nThe physical exam is often normal unless a rupture or leak has occurred.\nMost thoracic aortic aneurysms are detected on imaging tests performed for other reasons. These tests include chest x-ray, echocardiogram, or\nchest CT scan\nor MRI."}

These tests include chest x-ray, echocardiogram, or\nchest CT scan\nor MRI. A chest CT scan shows the size of the aorta and the exact location of the aneurysm.\nAn aortogram (a special set of x-ray images made when dye is injected into the aorta) can identify the aneurysm and any branches of the aorta that may be involved.\nTreatment\nThere is a risk that the aneurysm may open up (rupture) if you do not have surgery to repair it.\nThe treatment depends on the location of the aneurysm. The aorta is made of three parts:\nThe first part moves upward toward the head. It is called the ascending aorta.\nThe middle part is curved. It is called the aortic arch.\nThe last part moves downward, toward the feet."}

However, not all people with descending thoracic aneurysms are candidates for stenting.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe long-term outlook for people with thoracic aortic aneurysm depends on other medical problems, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes. These problems may have caused or contributed to the condition.\nPossible Complications\nSerious complications after aortic surgery can include:\nBleeding\nGraft infection\nHeart attack\nIrregular heartbeat\nKidney damage\nParalysis\nStroke\nDeath soon after the operation occurs in 5% to 10% of people.\nComplications after aneurysm stenting include damage to the blood vessels supplying the leg, which may require another operation.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have:\nA family history of connective tissue disorders (such as Marfan or Ehlers-Danlos syndrome)\nChest or back discomfort\nPrevention\nTo prevent atherosclerosis:\nControl your blood pressure and blood lipid levels.\nDO NOT smoke.\nEat a"}
