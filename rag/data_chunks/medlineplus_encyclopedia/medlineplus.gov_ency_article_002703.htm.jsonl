The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.\nExtensive damage to the mouth, throat, and stomach is possible. The outcome depends on how much of this damage there is. Damage to the esophagus and stomach can continue to occur for several weeks after the product is swallowed. A hole can develop in these organs, and that can lead to severe bleeding and infection. Surgery may be needed to treat these and other complications.\nExposure to lead or mercury (one time or continuing) can lead to permanent brain and nervous system damage.\nAlternative Names\nHair tint poisoning\nReferences\nAronson JK.
