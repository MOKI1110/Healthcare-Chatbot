Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nElectroretinography\nElectroretinography\nElectroretinography is a test to measure the electrical response of the eye's light-sensitive cells, called rods and cones. These cells are part of the retina (the back part of the eye).\nHow the Test is Performed\nWhile you are in a sitting position, the health care provider places numbing drops into your eyes, so you will not have any discomfort during the test. Your eyes are held open with a small device called a speculum. An electrical sensor (electrode) is placed on each eye.\nThe electrode measures the electrical activity of the\nretina\nin response to light. A light flashes, and the electrical response travels from the electrode to a TV-like screen, where it can be viewed and recorded."}

A light flashes, and the electrical response travels from the electrode to a TV-like screen, where it can be viewed and recorded. The normal response pattern has waves called A and B.\nThe provider will take the readings in normal room light and then again in the dark, after allowing 20 minutes for your eyes to adjust.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe probes that rest on your eye may feel a little scratchy. The test takes about 1 hour to perform.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to detect disorders of the retina."}

It is also useful for determining if retinal surgery is recommended.\nNormal Results\nNormal test results will show a normal A and B pattern in response to each flash.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThe following conditions may cause abnormal results:\nArteriosclerosis\nwith damage to the retina\nCongenital\nnight blindness\nCongenital retinoschisis (splitting of the retinal layers)\nGiant cell arteritis\nMedicines (chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine)\nMucopolysaccharidosis\nRetinal detachment\nRod-cone dystrophy\n(retinitis pigmentosa)\nTrauma\nVitamin A deficiency\nRisks\nThe cornea may get a temporary scratch on the surface from the electrode. Otherwise, there are no risks with this procedure.\nConsiderations\nYou should not rub your eyes for an hour after the test, as this could injure the cornea. Your provider will talk to you about the results of the test and what they mean for you.\nAlternative Names\nERG; Electrophysiologic testing\nImages\nContact lens electrode on eye\nReferences\nBaloh RW, Jen JC."}
