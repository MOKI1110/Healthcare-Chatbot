The tension helps put the joint back in position and keep it still.\nTraction is also used to keep a group of muscles (such as the neck muscles) stretched to reduce\nmuscle spasms\n. This is called cervical traction.\nInformation\nA traction treatment will involve a:\nCertain amount of tension to pull the body part, which may move it into another position\nLength of time to use the tension\nWay to keep the tension steady at the desired amount, usually based on the weight applied to the traction device\nReferences\nGardocki RJ, Park AL.
