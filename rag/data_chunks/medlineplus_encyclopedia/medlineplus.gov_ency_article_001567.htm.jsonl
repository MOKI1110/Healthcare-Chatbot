Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTetralogy of Fallot\nTetralogy of Fallot\nTetralogy of Fallot is a type of congenital heart defect. Congenital means that it is present at birth.\nCauses\nTetralogy of Fallot causes low oxygen levels in the blood. This leads to cyanosis (a bluish-purple color to the skin).\nThe classic form includes four defects of the heart and its major blood vessels:\nVentricular septal defect\n(hole between the right and left ventricles)\nNarrowing of the pulmonary outflow tract (the valve and artery that connect the heart with the lungs)\nOverriding aorta (the artery that carries oxygen-rich blood to the body) that is shifted over the right ventricle and ventricular septal defect, instead of coming out only from the left ventricle\nThickened wall of the right ventricle (right ventricular hypertrophy)\nTetralogy of Fallot is rare, but it is the most common form of cyanotic congenital heart disease. It occurs equally as often in males and females."}

It occurs equally as often in males and females. People with tetralogy of Fallot are more likely to also have other congenital defects.\nThe cause of most congenital heart defects is unknown. Many factors seem to be involved.\nFactors that increase the risk for this condition during pregnancy include:\nAlcoholism in the mother\nDiabetes\nMother who is over 40 years old\nPoor nutrition during pregnancy\nRubella or other viral illnesses during pregnancy\nChildren with tetralogy of Fallot are more likely to have chromosome disorders, such as Down syndrome, Alagille syndrome, and DiGeorge syndrome (a condition that causes heart defects, low calcium levels, and poor immune function).\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nBluish color to the skin (cyanosis)\ndue to low oxygen level in the blood, which gets worse when the baby is upset\nClubbing of fingers (skin or bone enlargement around the fingernails)\nDifficulty feeding (poor feeding habits)\nFailure to gain weight\nPassing out\nPoor development\nSquatting during episodes of cyanosis (which increases blood flow"}

Sometimes, more than one surgery is needed. When more than one surgery is used, the first surgery is done to help increase blood flow to the lungs.\nSurgery to correct the problem may be done at a later time. Often only one corrective surgery is performed in the first few months of life. Corrective surgery is done to widen part of the narrowed pulmonary tract and close the ventricular septal defect with a patch.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost cases can be corrected with surgery. Babies who have surgery usually do well. More than 90% survive to adulthood and live active, healthy, and productive lives."}

Without surgery, death often occurs by the time the person reaches age 20.\nPeople who have excessive leakiness of the pulmonary valve after surgery (which is common) may need to have the valve replaced.\nRegular follow-up with a cardiologist is strongly recommended.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nDelayed growth\nand development\nIrregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias)\nSeizures\nduring periods when there is not enough oxygen\nDeath from cardiac arrest, even after surgical repair\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if new unexplained symptoms develop or the child is having an episode of cyanosis (blue skin).\nIf a child with tetralogy of Fallot becomes blue, immediately place the child on their side or back and put the knees up to the chest.
