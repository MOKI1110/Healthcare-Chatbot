Bleeding may be:\nInside the body (internal)\nOutside the body (external)\nBleeding may occur:\nInside the body when blood leaks from blood vessels or organs\nOutside the body when blood flows through a natural opening (such as the ear, nose, mouth, vagina, or rectum)\nOutside the body when blood moves through a break in the skin\nConsiderations\nGet emergency medical help for severe bleeding. This is very important if you think there is internal bleeding. Internal bleeding can very quickly become life threatening. Immediate medical care is needed.\nSerious injuries may cause heavy bleeding. Sometimes, minor injuries can bleed a lot. An example is a scalp wound.\nYou may bleed a lot if you take blood-thinning medicine or have a\nbleeding disorder\nsuch as\nhemophilia\n. Bleeding in such people requires medical attention right away.\nThe most important step for external bleeding is to apply direct pressure."}

Bleeding in such people requires medical attention right away.\nThe most important step for external bleeding is to apply direct pressure. This will likely stop most external bleeding.\nAlways wash your hands before (if possible) and after giving first aid to someone who is bleeding. This helps prevent infection.\nTry to use latex gloves when treating someone who is bleeding. Latex gloves should be in every first aid kit. People allergic to latex can use nonlatex gloves. You can catch infections, such as viral hepatitis or HIV/AIDS, if you touch infected blood and it gets into an open wound, even a small one.\nAlthough puncture wounds usually don't bleed very much, they carry a higher risk for infection. Seek medical care to prevent\ntetanus\nor other infection.\nAbdominal, pelvic, groin, neck, and chest wounds can be very serious because of the possibility of severe internal bleeding."}

Apply a cool compress to the area as soon as possible to reduce\nswelling\n. Do not place ice directly on the skin. Wrap the ice in a towel first.\nCauses\nBleeding can be caused by injuries, or it can be spontaneous."}

If bleeding is severe, or if you think there is internal bleeding, or the person is in shock, get emergency help.\nCalm and reassure the person. The sight of blood can be very frightening.\nIf the wound affects just the top layers of skin (superficial), wash it with soap and warm water and pat dry. Bleeding from superficial wounds or scrapes (abrasions) is often described as oozing, because it is slow.\nLay the person down. This reduces the chances of fainting by increasing blood flow to the brain."}

This reduces the chances of fainting by increasing blood flow to the brain. When possible, raise up the part of the body that is bleeding.\nRemove any loose debris or dirt that you can see from a wound.\nDo not remove an object such as a knife, stick, or arrow that is stuck in the body. Doing so may cause more damage and bleeding. Place pads and bandages around the object and tape the object in place.\nPut pressure directly on an external wound with a sterile bandage, clean cloth, or even a piece of clothing. If nothing else is available, use your hand. Direct pressure is best for external bleeding, except for an eye injury.\nMaintain pressure until the bleeding stops. When it has stopped, tightly wrap the wound dressing with adhesive tape or a piece of clean clothing. Do not peek to see if the bleeding has stopped.\nIf bleeding continues and seeps through the material being held on the wound, do not remove it. Simply place another cloth over the first one."}

Be sure to seek medical attention right away.\nIf the bleeding is severe, get medical help right away and take steps to prevent shock. Keep the injured body part completely still. Lay the person flat, raise the feet about 12 inches (in) or 30 centimeters (cm), and cover the person with a coat or blanket. If possible, do not move the person if there has been a head, neck, back, or leg injury, as doing so may make the injury worse. Get medical help as soon as possible.\nWHEN TO USE A TOURNIQUET\nIf continuous pressure has not stopped the bleeding, and bleeding is extremely severe (life threatening), a tourniquet can be used until medical help arrives.\nThe tourniquet should be applied to the limb 2 to 3 in (5 to 7.5 cm) above the bleeding wound. Avoid the joint. If needed, place the tourniquet above the joint, toward the torso.\nIf possible, do not apply the tourniquet directly on the skin. Doing so may twist or pinch the skin and tissues."}

Use padding or apply the tourniquet over the pant leg or sleeve.\nIf you have a first-aid kit that comes with a tourniquet, apply it to the limb.\nIf you need to make a tourniquet, use bandages 2 to 4 in (5 to 10 cm) wide and wrap them around the limb several times. Tie a half or square knot, leaving loose ends long enough to tie another knot. A stick or a stiff rod should be placed between the two knots. Twist the stick until the bandage is tight enough to stop the bleeding and then secure it in place.\nIf at all possible, always write down the time when the tourniquet was applied. If this is not possible, then you must remember the time. Tell this to medical responders. (Keeping a tourniquet on for too long can injure the nerves and tissues.)\nDO NOT\nDo not peek at a wound to see if the bleeding is stopping. The less a wound is disturbed, the more likely it is that you will be able to control the bleeding.\nDo not probe a wound or pull out any embedded object from a wound."}

Get medical help.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nSeek medical help right away if:\nBleeding can't be controlled, it required the use of a tourniquet, or it was caused by a serious injury.\nThe wound might need stitches.\nGravel or dirt can't be removed easily with gentle cleaning.\nYou think there may be internal bleeding or shock.\nSigns of infection develop, including increased pain, redness, swelling, yellow or brown fluid,\nswollen lymph nodes\n, fever, or red streaks spreading from the site toward the heart.\nThe injury was due to an animal or human bite.\nThe person has not had a tetanus shot in the last 5 to 10 years.\nPrevention\nUse good judgment and keep knives and sharp objects away from small children.\nStay"}
