This can make the person's speech difficult to understand.\nCommon speech disorders are:\nArticulation disorders\nPhonological disorders\nDisfluency\nVoice disorders or resonance disorders\nSpeech disorders are different from\nlanguage disorders in children\n. Language disorders refer to someone having difficulty with:\nGetting their meaning or message across to others (expressive language)\nUnderstanding the message coming from others (receptive language)\nCauses\nSpeech is one of the main ways in which we communicate with those around us. It develops naturally, along with other signs of\nnormal growth and development\n. Disorders of speech and language are common in preschool age children.\nDisfluencies are disorders in which a person repeats a sound, word, or phrase.\nStuttering\nmay be the most serious disfluency."}
