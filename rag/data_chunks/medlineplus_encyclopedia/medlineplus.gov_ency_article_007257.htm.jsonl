This allows steps to be taken before symptoms develop. Most of these illnesses are very rare, but can be treated if caught early.\nThe types of newborn screening tests that are done vary from state to state. By April 2011, all states reported screening for at least 26 disorders on an expanded and standardized uniform panel. The most thorough screening panel checks for about 40 disorders. However, because\nphenylketonuria\n(PKU) was the first disorder for which a screening test developed, some people still call the newborn screen \"the PKU test\".\nIn addition to blood tests, screening for hearing loss and critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) is recommended for all newborns. Many states require this screening by law as well.\nHow the Test is Performed\nScreenings are done using the following methods:\nBlood tests. A few drops of blood are taken from the baby's heel."}

Many states require this screening by law as well.\nHow the Test is Performed\nScreenings are done using the following methods:\nBlood tests. A few drops of blood are taken from the baby's heel. The blood is sent to a lab for analysis.\nHearing test\n. A health care provider will place a tiny earpiece or microphone in the infant's ear. Another method uses electrodes that are put on the baby's head while the baby is quiet or asleep.\nCCHD screen. A provider will place a small soft sensor on the baby's skin and attach it to a machine called an oximeter for a few minutes. The oximeter will measure the baby's oxygen levels in the hand and foot.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no preparation needed for newborn screening tests. The tests are most often done before leaving the hospital when the baby is between 24 hours and 7 days old.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe baby will most likely cry when the heel is pricked to get the blood sample. Studies have shown that babies whose mothers hold them skin-to-skin or breastfeed them during the procedure show less distress."}

Studies have shown that babies whose mothers hold them skin-to-skin or breastfeed them during the procedure show less distress. Wrapping the baby tightly in a blanket, or offering a pacifier dipped in sugar water, may also help ease pain and calm the baby.\nThe hearing test and the CCHD screen should not cause the baby to feel pain, cry, or respond.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nScreening tests do not diagnose illnesses. They show which babies need more testing to confirm or rule out illnesses.\nIf follow-up testing confirms that the child has a disease, treatment can be started, before symptoms appear.\nBlood screening tests are used to detect a number of disorders."}

Treatment may be lifesaving. However, not all disorders that can be detected can be treated.\nAlthough hospitals do not perform all screening tests, parents can have other tests done at large medical centers. Private labs also offer newborn screening. Parents can find out about extra newborn screening tests from their provider or the hospital where the baby is born."}
