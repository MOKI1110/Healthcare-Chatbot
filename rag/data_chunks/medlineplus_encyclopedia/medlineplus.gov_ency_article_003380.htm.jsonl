It is used to evaluate some breast symptoms and to find\nbreast cancer\nin women with no symptoms (called screening for breast cancer).\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will be asked to undress from the waist up. You will be given a gown to wear. Depending on the type of equipment used and your physical condition, you will sit or stand.\nOne breast at a time is rested on a flat surface that contains the x-ray plate. A device called a compressor will be pressed firmly against your breast to help flatten the breast tissue. This enables the radiologist to make a better evaluation of your breasts.\nThe x-ray pictures are taken from several angles. You may be asked to hold your breath as each picture is taken.\nYou may be asked to come back at a later date to do more mammogram images. This does not always mean you have breast cancer."}

Your health care provider may simply need to recheck an area that could not be clearly seen on the first test.\nTYPES OF MAMMOGRAPHY\nTraditional mammography uses film, similar to other x-rays.\nDigital mammography is the most common technique:\nIt is now used in most breast imaging centers.\nIt allows the x-ray image of the breast to be viewed and manipulated on a computer screen.\nIt may be more accurate in younger women with dense breasts. It has not yet been proven to help reduce a woman's risk of dying of breast cancer compared to film mammography.\nThree-dimensional (3D) mammography (breast tomosynthesis) is a type of digital mammography.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nDo not use deodorant, perfume, powders, or ointments under your arms or on your breasts on the day of the mammogram. These substances may hide a portion of the images or produce an artifact that can falsely look like an abnormality."}

These substances may hide a portion of the images or produce an artifact that can falsely look like an abnormality. Remove all jewelry from your neck and chest area.\nTell your provider and the x-ray technologist if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, or if you've had a breast biopsy.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe compressor surfaces may feel cold. When the breast is pressed down, you may feel some brief pain or discomfort. This needs to be done to get good quality images.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nWhen and how often to have a screening mammogram is a choice you must make. Different expert groups do not fully agree on the best timing for this test.\nBefore having a mammogram, talk to your provider about the pros and cons of having the test. Ask about:\nYour\nrisk for breast cancer\nWhether screening decreases your chance of dying from breast cancer\nWhether there is any harm from breast cancer screening, such as side effects from testing or overtreatment of cancer when it's discovered\nMammography is performed to screen women to detect early breast cancer when it is more likely to be cured."}

The recommendations of different expert organizations can differ.\nMammography is generally recommended for all women starting at age 40, repeated every 1 to 2 years.\nWomen with a family history of breast cancer should work with their provider to assess their risk of breast cancer. In some situations, additional testing may be considered.\nMammograms work best at finding breast cancer in women ages 40 to 74. It is not clear how well mammograms work at finding cancer in women age 75 and older.\nMammography is also used to:\nFollow a woman who has had an abnormal mammogram.\nEvaluate a woman who has symptoms of a breast disease."}
