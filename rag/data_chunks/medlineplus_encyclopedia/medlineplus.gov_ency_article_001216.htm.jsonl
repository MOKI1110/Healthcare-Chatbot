Because it is large, macroamylase is filtered very slowly from the blood by the kidneys.\nMost people with macroamylasemia do not have a serious disease that is causing it, but the condition has been associated with:\nCeliac disease\nLymphoma\nHIV infection\nMonoclonal gammopathy\nRheumatoid arthritis\nUlcerative colitis\nSymptoms\nMacroamylasemia does not cause symptoms.\nExams and Tests\nA blood test will show high levels of amylase. However, macroamylasemia can cause test results similar to\nacute pancreatitis\n, which also causes high levels of amylase in the blood.\nMeasuring amylase levels in the urine can help tell macroamylasemia apart from acute pancreatitis. Urine levels of amylase are low in people with macroamylasemia, but high in people with acute pancreatitis."}
