Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNeurosarcoidosis\nNeurosarcoidosis\nNeurosarcoidosis is a form of\nsarcoidosis\n, in which inflammation occurs in the brain, spinal cord, and other areas of the nervous system.\nCauses\nSarcoidosis is a chronic disease that affects many parts of the body, mostly the lungs. In a small number of people, the disease involves some part of the nervous system. This is called neurosarcoidosis.\nNeurosarcoidosis may affect any part of the nervous system. Sudden facial weakness (\nfacial palsy\nor facial droop) is a common neurological symptom that involves the nerves to the muscles of the face. Any other nerve in the skull can be affected, including those in the eye and those that control taste, smell, or hearing.\nThe spinal cord is another part of the nervous system that sarcoidosis can affect. People may have weakness in their arms and legs, and difficulty walking or controlling their urine or bowels."}

People may have weakness in their arms and legs, and difficulty walking or controlling their urine or bowels. In some cases, the spinal cord is so severely affected that both legs are paralyzed.\nThe condition can also affect the parts of the brain involved in regulating many bodily functions, such as temperature, sleep, and stress responses. Other areas of the brain, including the pituitary gland at the base of the brain, can be affected.\nInvolvement of\nmuscles\nor\nperipheral\nnerves can cause weakness and sensory loss.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms vary. Any part of the nervous system can be affected."}

However, symptoms of the condition can mimic other medical disorders, including\ndiabetes insipidus\n,\nhypopituitarism\n,\nmultiple sclerosis\n,\noptic neuritis\n,\nmeningitis\n, and certain tumors. Sometimes, the nervous system can be affected before a person is known to have sarcoidosis, or without affecting the lungs or other organs at all.\nBlood tests are not very helpful in diagnosing the condition. A\nlumbar puncture\nmay show signs of inflammation. Increased levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme may be found in the blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). However, this is not a reliable diagnostic test.\nMRI\nof the brain and spinal cord may be helpful. A\nchest x-ray\noften reveals signs of sarcoidosis of the lungs. A\nbiopsy\nof the affected tissue confirms the disorder. A biopsy of lymph nodes or other organs can show findings to support the diagnosis and to exclude other conditions. Sometimes a nerve or brain biopsy is needed.\nTreatment\nThere is no known cure for sarcoidosis."}

Sometimes a nerve or brain biopsy is needed.\nTreatment\nThere is no known cure for sarcoidosis. Treatment is given if symptoms are severe or are getting worse. The goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms.\nCorticosteroids such as prednisone are prescribed to reduce inflammation. They are often prescribed until symptoms get better or go away. You may need to take the medicines for months, or even years.\nOther medicines may include hormone replacement and medicines that suppress the immune system.\nIf you have numbness, weakness, vision or hearing problems, or other problems due to damage of the nerves in the brain and spinal cord, you may need physical therapy, braces, a cane, walker, or wheelchair.\nMental disorders or dementia may require medicines for depression, safety interventions, and assistance with care.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nFor some people, the symptoms of neurosarcoidosis go away on their own in 4 to 6 months. Others continue off and on for the rest of the person's life."}

Others continue off and on for the rest of the person's life. Neurosarcoidosis can cause permanent disability and, in some cases, death.\nPossible Complications\nComplications vary, depending on which part of the nervous system is involved and how you respond to treatment. Slowly worsening or permanent loss of neurological function is possible. In rare cases, the brainstem may be involved. This is life threatening.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have sarcoidosis and any neurological symptoms occur.\nGo to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have a sudden loss of sensation, movement, or body function.\nPrevention\nAggressive treatment of sarcoidosis turns off the body's faulty immune response before your nerves become damaged. This may reduce the chance that neurological symptoms will occur.\nAlternative Names\nSarcoidosis - nervous system\nImages\nSarcoid, stage I - chest x-ray\nSarcoid, stage II - chest x-ray\nSarcoid, stage IV - chest x-ray\nReferences\nIannuzzi MC."}
