They produce saliva, which moistens food to help with chewing and swallowing. Saliva also helps to protect teeth from decay.\nThere are 3 main pairs of salivary glands. The parotid glands are the largest. They are located in each cheek in front of the ears. Two submandibular glands are under the floor of the mouth on both sides of the back of the jaw. Two sublingual glands are under the floor of the mouth next to the jaw on each side. There are also hundreds of small salivary glands lining the rest of the mouth. These are called the minor salivary glands.\nSalivary glands empty saliva into the mouth through ducts that open at various places in the mouth.\nSalivary gland tumors are rare."}

The tumor gradually increases the size of the gland. Some of these tumors can be cancerous (malignant).\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nFirm, usually painless swelling in one of the salivary glands (in front of the ears, under the chin, or on the floor of the mouth)."}

If the tumor is benign, no other treatment is needed.\nRadiation therapy\nor extensive surgery may be needed if the tumor is cancerous.\nChemotherapy\nmay be used when the disease has spread beyond the salivary glands.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost salivary gland tumors are noncancerous and slow growing. Removing the tumor with surgery often cures the condition. In rare cases, the tumor is cancerous and further treatment is needed.\nPossible Complications\nComplications from the cancer or its treatment may include:\nSpread of the cancer to other organs (\nmetastasis\n).\nIn rare cases, injury during surgery to the nerve that controls movement of the face.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have any of the following:\nPain when eating or chewing\nYou notice a lump in the mouth, under the jaw, or in the neck that does not go away in 2 to 3 weeks or is getting larger\nAlternative Names\nTumor - salivary duct\nImages\nHead and neck glands\nReferences\nJackson NM, Mitchell JL, Wal"}
