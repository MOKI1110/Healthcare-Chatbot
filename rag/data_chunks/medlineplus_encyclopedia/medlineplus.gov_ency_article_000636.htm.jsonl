Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nDonovanosis (granuloma inguinale)\nDonovanosis (granuloma inguinale)\nDonovanosis (granuloma inguinale) is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that is rarely seen in the United States.\nCauses\nDonovanosis is caused by the bacterium\nKlebsiella granulomatis\n. The disease is commonly found in tropical and subtropical areas such as southeast India, Guyana, and New Guinea. There are about 100 cases reported per year in the United States. Most of these cases occur in people who have traveled to or are from places where the disease is common.\nThe disease spreads mostly through vaginal or anal intercourse. Very rarely, it spreads during oral sex.\nMost infections occur in people ages 20 to 40.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms can occur 1 to 12 weeks after coming in contact with the bacteria.\nSymptoms may include:\nSores in the anal area (in about half of cases)\nSmall, beefy-red bumps on the genitals or around the anus\nThe skin gradually wears away, and the bumps turn into raised, beefy-red, velvety\nnodules\ncalled granulation tissue."}

They are often painless, but they bleed easily if injured. The disease slowly spreads and destroys genital tissue. Tissue damage may spread to the groin. The genitals and the skin around them lose skin color.\nIn its early stages, it may be hard to tell the difference between donovanosis and\nchancroid\n.\nExams and Tests\nTests may include:\nCulture of tissue sample\n(hard to do and not routinely available)\nScrapings or\nbiopsy of lesion\nLaboratory tests for diagnosing donovanosis are available only on a research basis.\nTreatment\nAntibiotics are used to treat donovanosis. These may include:\nAzithromycin\nDoxycycline\nCiprofloxacin\nErythromycin\nTrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole\nTo cure the condition, long-term treatment is needed. Most treatment courses require 3 weeks or until the sores have completely healed.\nA follow-up exam is needed because the disease can reappear after it seems to be cured.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nEarly treatment helps prevent tissue damage or scarring."}

Untreated, the disease leads to damage of the genital tissue.\nPossible Complications\nHealth problems that may result from this disease include:\nGenital damage and scarring\nLoss of skin color in the genital area\nPermanent genital swelling due to scarring\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider for an appointment if:\nYou have had sexual contact with a person who is known to have donovanosis\nYou develop symptoms of donovanosis\nYou develop an ulcer in the genital area\nPrevention\nAvoiding all sexual activity is the only absolute way to prevent an STD such as donovanosis. However,\nsafer sex\nbehaviors may reduce your risk.\nThe proper use of condoms, either the\nmale\nor\nfemale\ntype, greatly decreases the risk of catching an STD."}
