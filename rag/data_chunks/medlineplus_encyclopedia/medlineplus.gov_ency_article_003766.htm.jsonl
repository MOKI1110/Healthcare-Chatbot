Some of the sample is placed on a glass slide, stained, and heated. The cells in the sample hold onto the dye. The slide is then washed with an acid solution and a different stain is applied.\nBacteria that hold onto the first dye are considered \"acid-fast\" because they resist the acid wash. These types of bacteria are associated with TB and other infections.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nPreparation depends on how the sample is collected. Your provider will tell you how to prepare.\nHow the Test will Feel\nHow much discomfort you may feel depends on how the sample is collected."}
