Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSkin lesion aspiration\nSkin lesion aspiration\nSkin lesion aspiration is the withdrawal of fluid from a skin lesion (sore).\nHow the Test is Performed\nYour health care provider inserts a needle into the skin lesion, which may contain fluid or pus. Fluid is withdrawn. The fluid may be examined under a microscope. A sample of the fluid may also be sent to a lab. There, it is put in a lab dish or other container that contains culture medium and watched for growth of bacteria, virus or fungi.\nIf the sore is deep, the provider may inject or spray numbing medicine (anesthetic) into the skin before inserting the needle.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou do not need to prepare for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel a pricking sensation as the needle enters the skin.\nIn many cases, removing the fluid will lessen pressure within the skin lesion and ease pain.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is used to find the cause of a fluid-filled skin lesion."}
