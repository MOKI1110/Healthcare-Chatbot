X-rays are a form of high energy electromagnetic radiation. The x-rays penetrate the body to form an image on film or screen. X-rays can be either digital or developed on a film.\nStructures that are dense (such as silver fillings or metal restoration) will block most of the light energy from the x-ray. This makes them appear white in the image. Structures that contain air will be black, and teeth, tissue, and fluid will appear as shades of gray.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is performed in the dentist's office. There are many types of dental x-rays. Some of them are:\nBitewing. Shows the crown portions of the top and bottom teeth together when the person bites on a biting tab.\nPeriapical. Shows 1 or 2 complete teeth from crown to root.\nPalatal (also called occlusal). Captures all the upper or lower teeth in one shot while the film rests on the biting surface of the teeth.\nPanoramic. Requires a special machine that rotates around the head."}

Captures all the upper or lower teeth in one shot while the film rests on the biting surface of the teeth.\nPanoramic. Requires a special machine that rotates around the head. The x-ray captures all of the jaws and teeth in one shot. It is used to plan treatment for dental implants, check for impacted wisdom teeth, and detect jaw problems. A panoramic x-ray is not the best method for detecting cavities, unless the decay is very advanced and deep.\nCephalometric. Presents the side view of the face and represents relationship of the jaw to each other as well as to the rest of the structures. It is helpful to diagnose any airway problems.\nMany dentists take x-rays using digital technology. These images run through a computer. The amount of radiation given off during the procedure is less than traditional methods. Other types of dental x-rays can create a 3-D picture of the jaw. Cone beam computerized tomography (CBCT) may be used before dental surgery, such as when several implants are being placed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no special preparation. You need to remove any metal objects in the area of the x-ray exposure."}

Tell your dentist if you might be pregnant.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe x-ray itself causes no discomfort. Biting on the piece of film makes some people gag. Slow, deep breathing through the nose usually relieves this feeling. Both CBCT and cephalometric x-ray do not require any biting pieces.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nDental x-rays help diagnose disease and injury of the teeth and gums as well as help planning the appropriate treatment.\nNormal Results\nNormal x-rays show a normal number, structure, and position of the teeth and jaw bones."}

However, no one should receive more radiation than necessary. A lead apron can be used to cover the body and reduce radiation exposure. Pregnant women should not have x-rays taken unless necessary.\nConsiderations\nDental x-rays can reveal\ndental cavities\nbefore they are clinically visible, even to the dentist."}
