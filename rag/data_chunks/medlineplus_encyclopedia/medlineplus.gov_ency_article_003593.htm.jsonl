Men or boys should wipe the head of the penis. Women or girls should wash the area between the lips of the vagina with soapy water and rinse well.\nAllow a small amount of urine to fall into the toilet bowl as you start to urinate. This clears substances that may contaminate the sample."}

This clears substances that may contaminate the sample. Catch about 1 to 2 ounces (30 to 60 milliliters) of urine in the clean container that you are given.\nRemove the container from the urine stream.\nGive the container to the health care provider or assistant.\nFor an infant:\nThoroughly wash the area where the urine exits the body.\nOpen a urine collection bag (a plastic bag with an adhesive paper on one end).\nFor males, place the entire penis in the bag and attach the adhesive to the skin.\nFor females, place the bag over the labia.\nDiaper as usual over the secured bag.\nIt may take more than one try to get a sample from an infant. An active baby can move the bag, so that the urine goes into the diaper. Check the infant often and change the bag after the urine has been collected."}

Drain the urine from the bag into the container given to you by your provider.\nDeliver the sample to the lab or your provider as soon as possible after it is done.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special steps are necessary for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is most often used to check for the presence of certain proteins called monoclonal immunoglobulins. These proteins are linked to\nmultiple myeloma\nand\nWaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia\n."}

The test is also done with a blood test to check for a monoclonal immunoglobulin in the serum.\nNormal Results\nHaving no monoclonal immunoglobulins in the urine is a normal result.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThe presence of monoclonal proteins may indicate:\nCancers that affect the immune system, such as multiple myeloma or WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia\nOther\ncancers\nConsiderations\nImmunofixation is similar to\nurine immunoelectrophoresis\n, but it may give more rapid results.\nReferences\nCastillo JJ, Treon SP.
