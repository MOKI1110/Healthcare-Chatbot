It is done to detect bacteria or fungi that cause infection (\nperitonitis\n).\nPeritoneal fluid is the fluid in the peritoneal cavity, a space between the wall of the abdomen and the organs inside.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA sample of peritoneal fluid is needed. This sample is obtained using a procedure called an\nabdominal tap\n(paracentesis).\nA sample of fluid is sent to the laboratory for Gram stain and culture. The sample is checked to see if bacteria grows.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nEmpty your bladder before your abdominal tap procedure.\nHow the Test will Feel\nA small area in your lower abdomen will be cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic). You may also receive local anesthesia. You will feel pressure as the needle is inserted."}

You may also receive local anesthesia. You will feel pressure as the needle is inserted. If a large amount of fluid is withdrawn, you may feel dizzy or lightheaded.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is done to find out if there is an infection in the peritoneal space.\nNormal Results\nPeritoneal fluid is a sterile fluid, so normally no bacteria or fungi are present.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThe growth of any microorganism, such as bacteria or fungi, from peritoneal fluid is abnormal and indicates peritonitis.  If you have\ncirrhosis\nand bacteria are found in your peritoneal fluid, you may have\nspontaneous bacterial peritonitis\n(SBP). This is a life-threatening infection that must be treated with antibiotics. If your peritonitis is from another condition, your provider will treat it and look for the cause.\nRisks\nThere is a small risk of the needle puncturing the bowel, bladder, or a blood vessel in the abdomen. This may result in\nbowel perforation\n, bleeding, and infection.\nConsiderations\nThe peritoneal fluid culture may be negative, even if you have peritonitis."}
