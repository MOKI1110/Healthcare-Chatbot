The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina. Abnormal changes in the cells on the surface of the cervix is called cervical dysplasia.\nDescription\nCryotherapy is done in the health care provider's office while you are awake. You may have slight cramping. You may have some amount of pain during the surgery.\nTo perform the procedure:\nAn instrument is inserted into the\nvagina\nto hold the walls open so that the provider can see the cervix.\nThe provider then inserts a device called a cryoprobe into the vagina. The device is placed firmly on the surface of the cervix, covering the abnormal tissue.\nCompressed nitrogen gas flows through the instrument, making the metal cold enough to freeze and destroy the tissue.\nAn \"ice ball\" forms on the cervix, killing the abnormal cells."}

More severe scarring may make it more difficult to get pregnant, or cause increased cramping with menstrual periods.\nBefore the Procedure\nYour provider may suggest you to take medicine such as ibuprofen 1 hour before the procedure. This may reduce pain during the procedure.\nAfter the Procedure\nYou might feel lightheaded right after the procedure. If this happens, lie down flat on the examination table so that you do not faint."}

If this happens, lie down flat on the examination table so that you do not faint. This feeling should go away in a few minutes.\nYou can resume almost all of your normal activities right after surgery.\nFor 2 to 3 weeks after the surgery, you will have a lot of watery discharge caused by the shedding (sloughing) of the dead cervical tissue.\nYou may need to avoid sexual intercourse and using tampons for several weeks.\nAvoid douching. This can cause severe infections in the uterus and tubes.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nYour provider should do a repeat\nPap test\nor\nbiopsy\nat a follow-up visit to make sure that all abnormal tissue was destroyed.\nYou may need more frequent Pap smears for the first 2 years after cryosurgery for cervical dysplasia.\nAlternative Names\nCervix surgery; Cryosurgery - female; Cervical dysplasia - cryosurgery\nImages\nFemale reproductive anatomy\nCervical cryosurgery\nCervical cryosurgery\nReferences\nLewis MR, Pfenninger JL.
