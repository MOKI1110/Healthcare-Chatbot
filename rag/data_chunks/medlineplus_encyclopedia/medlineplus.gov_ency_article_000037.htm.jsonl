The person should not breathe in sharply. This may force the object in further.\nGently press and close the nostril that does not have the object in it. Ask the person to blow gently.

This may push the object further into the nose.\nDo not use tweezers or other tools to remove an object that is stuck deep inside the nose.\nDo not try to remove an object that you cannot see or one that is not easy to grasp."}
