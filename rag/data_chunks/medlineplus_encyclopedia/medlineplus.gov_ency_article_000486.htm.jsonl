It is in the center of the lower abdomen.\nCauses\nBladder cancer often starts from the cells lining the bladder. These cells are called transitional cells.\nThese tumors are classified by the way they grow:\nPapillary tumors look like warts and are attached to a stalk.\nCarcinoma in situ tumors are flat. They are much less common. But they are more\ninvasive\nand have a worse outcome.\nThe exact cause of bladder cancer is not known. But several things that may make you more likely to develop it include:\nCigarette smoking -- Smoking greatly increases the risk of developing bladder cancer. Up to half of all bladder cancers may be caused by cigarette smoke.\nPersonal or family history of bladder cancer -- Having someone in the family with bladder cancer increases your risk of developing it.\nChemical exposure -- Bladder cancer can be caused by coming into contact with cancer-causing chemicals (often at work)."}

These chemicals are called carcinogens. Dye workers, rubber workers, aluminum workers, leather workers, truck drivers, and pesticide applicators are at the highest risk.\nChemotherapy\n-- The chemotherapy drug cyclophosphamide may increase the risk for bladder cancer.\nRadiation treatment\n-- Radiation therapy to the pelvis region for treatment of cancers of the prostate, testes, cervix, or uterus increases the risk of developing bladder cancer.\nBladder infection\n-- A long-term (chronic) bladder infection or irritation may lead to a certain type of bladder cancer.\nResearch has not shown clear evidence that using artificial sweeteners leads to bladder cancer in humans.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of bladder cancer can include:\nAbdominal pain\nBlood in the urine\nBone pain or tenderness\nif the cancer spreads to the bone\nFatigue\nPainful urination\nUrinary frequency and urgency\nUrine leakage (incontinence)\nWeight loss\nOther diseases and conditions can cause similar symptoms."}

Staging helps guide future treatment and follow-up and gives you some idea of what to expect in the future.\nThe TNM (tumor, nodes, metastasis) staging system is used to stage bladder cancer:\nTa -- The cancer is in the lining of the bladder only and has not spread.\nT1 -- The cancer goes through the bladder lining, but does not reach the bladder muscle.\nT2 -- The cancer spreads to the bladder muscle.\nT3 -- The cancer spreads past the bladder into the fatty tissue surrounding it.\nT4 -- The cancer has spread to nearby structures such as the prostate gland, uterus, vagina, rectum, abdominal wall, or pelvic wall.\nTumors are also grouped based on how they appear under a microscope. This is called grading the tumor. A high-grade tumor is fast growing and more likely to spread."}

In these people, chemotherapy, the antibody-drug conjugate enfortumab vedotin (Padcev), targered therapy, and immunotherapy are often considered.\nCHEMOTHERAPY\nChemotherapy may be given to people with stage II and III disease either before or after surgery to help prevent the tumor from returning.\nFor early disease (stages 0 and I), chemotherapy is usually given directly into the bladder.\nIMMUNOTHERAPY\nBladder cancers are often treated with immunotherapy. In this treatment, a medicine triggers your immune system to attack and kill the cancer cells. Immunotherapy for early stage bladder cancer is often performed using the Bacille Calmette-Guerin vaccine (commonly known as BCG). If the cancer returns after the use of BCG, newer agents may be used.\nAs with all treatments, side effects are possible."}

Ask your provider what side effects you might expect, and what to do if they occur.\nSURGERY\nSurgery for bladder cancer includes:\nTransurethral resection of the bladder (TURB) -- Cancerous bladder tissue is removed through the urethra.\nPartial or complete removal of the bladder -- Many people with stage II or III bladder cancer may need to have their bladder removed (radical cystectomy). Sometimes, only part of the bladder is removed. Chemotherapy may be given before or after this surgery.\nSurgery may also be done to help your body drain urine after the bladder is removed. This may include:\nIleal conduit -- A small urine reservoir is surgically created from a short piece of your small intestine. The ureters that drain urine from the kidneys are attached to one end of this piece. The other end is brought out through an opening in the skin (a stoma)."}

The stoma allows the person to drain the collected urine out of the reservoir.\nContinent urinary reservoir -- A pouch to collect urine is created inside your body using a piece of your intestine. You will need to insert a tube into an opening in your skin (stoma) into this pouch to drain the urine.\nOrthotopic neobladder -- This surgery is becoming more common in people who have had their bladder removed. A part of your bowel is folded over to make a pouch that collects urine. It is attached to the place in the body where the urine normally empties from the bladder. This procedure allows you to maintain some normal urinary control.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\ncancer support group\n.

Although the risk for the cancer returning is high, most bladder cancers that return can be surgically removed and cured.\nThe cure rates for people with stage III tumors are less than 50%. People with stage IV bladder cancer are rarely cured.\nPossible Complications\nBladder cancers may spread into the nearby organs. They may also travel through the pelvic lymph nodes and spread to the liver, lungs, and bones."}
