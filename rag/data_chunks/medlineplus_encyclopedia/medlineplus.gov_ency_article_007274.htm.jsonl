Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nStereotactic radiosurgery - CyberKnife\nStereotactic radiosurgery - CyberKnife\nStereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a form of radiation therapy that focuses high-power energy on a small area of the body. Despite its name, radiosurgery is a treatment, not a surgical procedure. Incisions (cuts) are not made on your body.\nMore than one type of machine and system can be used to perform radiosurgery. This article is about radiosurgery using the system called CyberKnife.\nDescription\nSRS targets and treats an abnormal area of the body. Using many tiny beams, radiation is tightly focused on the cancer, which minimizes damage to nearby healthy tissue.\nDuring treatment:\nYou won't need to be put to sleep. The treatment does not cause pain.\nYou lie on a table that slides into a machine that delivers radiation.\nA robotic arm controlled by a computer moves around you. It focuses radiation exactly on the area being treated.\nThe health care providers are in another room."}

It focuses radiation exactly on the area being treated.\nThe health care providers are in another room. They can see you on cameras and hear you and talk with you on microphones.\nYou may be given a small vest to wear during treatment, this allows the machine to better focus on the cancer and track your breathing.\nEach treatment takes about 30 minutes to 2 hours. You may receive more than one treatment session, but usually no more than five sessions.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nSRS is more likely to be recommended for people who are too high risk for conventional surgery. This may be due to age or other health problems."}

This may be due to age or other health problems. SRS may be recommended because the area to be treated is too close to vital structures inside the body.\nCyberKnife is often used to slow the growth of or completely destroy small, deep brain tumors that are hard to remove using conventional surgery.\nTumors of the brain and nervous system that can be treated using CyberKnife include:\nCancer that has spread (metastasized) to the brain from another part of the body\nA slow-growing tumor of the nerve that connects the ear to the brain (\nacoustic neuroma\n)\nPituitary tumors\nSpinal cord tumors\nOther cancers that can be treated include:\nBreast\nKidney\nLiver\nLung\nPancreas\nProstate\nA type of skin cancer (melanoma) that involves the eye\nOther medical problems treated with CyberKnife are:\nBlood vessel problems such as\narteriovenous malformations\nParkinson disease\nSevere tremors (shaking)\nSome types of\nepilepsy\nTrigeminal neuralgia\n(severe nerve pain of the face)\nRisks\nSRS may damage tissue around the area being treated."}

As compared to other types of radiation therapy, CyberKnife treatment is much less likely to damage nearby healthy tissue.\nBrain swelling and tumor breakdown (called necrosis) may occur in people who receive treatment to the brain. Swelling usually goes away without treatment. But some people may need medicines to control this swelling. In rare cases, surgery with incisions (open surgery) is needed to treat the brain swelling caused by the radiation.\nFor cancers near the ribs and chest wall, sometimes pain may develop or even a rib fracture months after treatment.\nFor some cancers near the top of the lung, nerves in the arm be damaged by the radiation in rare cases.\nBefore the Procedure\nBefore the treatment, you will have\nMRI\nor\nCT\nscans or both. You may also have a PET scan."}

These images help your radiation doctor (usually a radiation oncologist) determine the specific treatment area.\nThe day before your procedure:\nDo not use any hair cream or hair spray if CyberKnife surgery involves your brain.\nDo not eat or drink anything after midnight unless told otherwise by your radiation doctor.\nThe day of your procedure:\nWear comfortable clothes.\nBring your regular prescription medicines with you to the hospital.\nDo not wear jewelry, makeup, nail polish, or a wig or hairpiece.\nYou will be asked to remove contact lenses, eyeglasses, and dentures.\nYou will change into a hospital gown.\nAn intravenous (lV) line will be placed into your arm to deliver contrast material, medicines, and fluids.\nAfter the Procedure\nOften, you can go home about 1 hour after the treatment. Arrange ahead of time for someone to drive you home. You can go back to your regular activities the next day if there are no complications, such as swelling."}

The prognosis depends on the condition being treated. Your provider will likely monitor your progress using imaging tests such as MRI and CT scans.
