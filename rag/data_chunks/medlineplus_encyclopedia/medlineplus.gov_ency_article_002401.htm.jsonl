Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nThiamin\nThiamin\nThiamin is one of the B vitamins. The B vitamins are a group of water-soluble vitamins that are part of many of the chemical reactions in the body.\nFunction\nThiamin (vitamin B1) helps the body's cells change carbohydrates into energy. The main role of carbohydrates is to provide energy for the body, especially the brain and nervous system.\nThiamin also plays a role in muscle contraction and conduction of nerve signals.\nThiamin is essential for the metabolism of pyruvate, which is an important molecule in several chemical reactions in the body.\nFood Sources\nThiamin is found in:\nEnriched, fortified, and whole grain products such as bread, cereals, rice, pasta, and flour\nWheat germ\nBeef steak and pork\nTrout and bluefin tuna\nEgg\nLegumes and peas\nNuts and seeds\nDairy products, fruits, and vegetables are not very high in thiamin in small amounts."}

But when you eat large amounts of these, they become a significant source of thiamin.\nSide Effects\nA lack of thiamin can cause\nweakness\n,\nfatigue\n, confusion,\npsychosis\n, and nerve damage.\nThiamin deficiency in the United States is most often seen in people who consume too much alcohol (usually due to an alcohol use disorder). Consuming a lot of alcohol makes it hard for the body to absorb thiamin from foods.\nUnless those with heavy alcohol use receive higher-than-normal amounts of thiamin to make up for the difference, the body will not get enough thiamin. This can lead to a disease called\nberiberi\n.\nIn severe thiamin deficiency, brain damage can occur. One type is called\nKorsakoff syndrome\n. The other is\nWernicke disease\n."}

Either or both of these conditions can occur in the same person.\nThere is no known poisoning linked to excessive intake of thiamin.\nRecommendations\nRecommendations for thiamin, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)\n: The average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people. An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence.\nAdequate Intake (AI)\n: This level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA."}
