It is one of the most common chronic lung diseases in children and young adults. It is a life-threatening disorder.\nCauses\nCystic fibrosis (CF) is a disease that is passed down through families. It is caused by a defective gene that makes the body produce abnormally thick and sticky fluid, called mucus. This mucus builds up in the breathing passages of the lungs and in the pancreas.\nThe buildup of mucus results in life-threatening lung infections and serious digestion problems. The disease may also affect the sweat glands and a man's reproductive system.\nMany people carry a CF gene, but do not have symptoms. This is because for a person to get CF, they must inherit 2 defective genes, 1 from each parent. Some Americans have the CF gene."}

This is because for a person to get CF, they must inherit 2 defective genes, 1 from each parent. Some Americans have the CF gene. It is more common among those of northern or central European descent.\nMost children with CF are diagnosed by age 2, especially as newborn screening is performed across the United States. For a small number, the disease is not detected until age 18 or older. These children often have a milder form of the disease.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms in newborns may include:\nDelayed growth\nFailure to gain weight normally during childhood\nNo bowel movements in first 24 to 48 hours of life\nSalty-tasting skin\nSymptoms related to bowel function may include:\nBelly pain from severe constipation\nIncreased gas, bloating, or a belly that appears swollen (distended)\nNausea and loss of appetite\nStools that are pale or clay-colored\n, foul smelling, have mucus, or that float\nWeight loss\nHistory of rectal prolapse\nSymptoms related to the lungs and sinuses may include:\nCoughing or increased mucus in the sinuses or lungs\nFatigue\nNasal congestion caused by nasal polyps\nRepeated episodes of\npneumonia\n(symptoms of pneumonia"}

The test looks for changes in the CF gene. Other tests used to diagnose CF include:\nImmunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) test is a standard newborn screening test for CF.

Follow-up and monitoring are very important. When possible, care should be received at a cystic fibrosis specialty clinic. When children reach adulthood, they should transfer to a cystic fibrosis specialty center for adults.\nTreatment for lung problems includes:\nAntibiotics to prevent and treat lung and sinus infections. They may be taken by mouth, or given in the veins or by breathing treatments. People with CF may take antibiotics only when needed, or all the time."}
