Drinking large amounts of water or receiving fluids through a vein.\nWater deprivation. Not drinking fluids for a certain amount of time.\nAntidiuretic hormone (ADH) administration. Receiving ADH, which should cause the urine to become concentrated.\nAfter you provide a urine sample, it is tested right away. For urine specific gravity, your health care provider uses a dipstick made with a color-sensitive pad. The dipstick color changes and tells the provider the specific gravity of your urine. The dipstick test gives only a rough result."}

The dipstick color changes and tells the provider the specific gravity of your urine. The dipstick test gives only a rough result. For a more accurate specific gravity result or measurement of urine electrolytes or osmolality, your provider will send your urine sample to a lab.\nIf needed, your provider will ask you to\ncollect your urine at home over 24 hours\n. Your provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nEat your normal diet for several days before the test. Your provider will give you instructions for water loading or water deprivation.\nYour provider will ask you to temporarily stop any medicines that may affect the test results. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take, including dextran and sucrose. Do not stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.\nAlso tell your provider if you recently received intravenous dye (contrast medium) for an imaging test such as a\nCT scan\nor\nMRI\nscan. The dye can also affect test results.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination."}

The dye can also affect test results.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is most often done if your provider suspects\ncentral diabetes insipidus\n, a condition where there is an abnormality with ADH that regulates the concentration of the urine. The test can help tell that disease from\nnephrogenic diabetes insipidus\n, a condition where there is an abnormality in the kidney that prevents ADH from correctly regulating the concentration of the urine.\nThis test may also be done if you have signs of\nsyndrome of inappropriate ADH\n(SIADH).\nNormal Results\nIn general, normal values for specific gravity are as follows:\n1.005 to 1.030 (normal specific gravity)\n1.001 after drinking excessive amounts of water\nMore than 1.030 after avoiding fluids\n50 percent rise in specific gravity after receiving ADH\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}
