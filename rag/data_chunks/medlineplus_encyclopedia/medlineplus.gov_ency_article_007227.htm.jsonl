Apnea of prematurity refers to breathing pauses in babies who were born before 37 weeks of pregnancy (\npremature\nbirth).\nMost premature babies have some degree of apnea because the area of the brain that controls breathing is still developing.\nCauses\nThere are several reasons why newborns, especially those who were born early (prematurely), may have apnea, including:\nThe brain areas and nerve pathways that control breathing are still developing.\nThe muscles that keep the airway open are smaller and not as strong as they will be later in life.\nOther stresses in a sick or premature baby may worsen apnea, including:\nAnemia\nFeeding problems\nHeart or lung problems\nInfection\nLow oxygen levels\nTemperature problems\nSymptoms\nThe breathing pattern of newborns is not always regular and may be called \"periodic breathing.\" This pattern is even more likely in newborns born early."}

It consists of episodes of either shallow breathing or short pauses in breathing lasting just a few seconds. These episodes are then followed by periods of regular breathing. This is generally considered a normal pattern and can be expected in less mature and even some full-term babies. However, the pattern of breathing, length of breathing pauses, and the age of the baby are both important when deciding if it needs to be further evaluated.\nApnea episodes or \"events\" that last longer than 20 seconds are considered serious. The baby may also have a:\nDrop in heart rate. This heart rate drop is called bradycardia (also called a \"brady\").\nDrop in oxygen level (oxygen saturation). This is called desaturation (also called a \"desat\").\nExams and Tests\nAll premature babies under 35 weeks gestation are admitted to newborn intensive care units, or special care nurseries, with special monitors because they are at higher risk for apnea."}

Older babies who are found to have apnea episodes will also be placed on monitors in the hospital. More tests will be done if the baby is not premature and appears unwell.\nMonitors keep track of breathing rate, heart rate, and oxygen levels.\nDrops in breathing rate, heart rate, or oxygen level can set off the alarms on these monitors.\nBaby monitors marketed for home use are not the same as those used in the hospital.\nAlarms may occur for other reasons (such as passing stool or moving around), so the monitor tracings are reviewed regularly by the health care team.\nTreatment\nHow apnea is treated depends on:\nThe cause\nHow often it occurs\nSeverity of episodes\nBabies who are otherwise healthy and have occasional minor episodes are simply watched. In these cases, the episodes go away when the babies are gently touched or \"stimulated\" during periods when breathing stops.\nBabies who are well, but who are very premature or have many apnea episodes may be given caffeine."}
