Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nInterstitial nephritis\nInterstitial nephritis\nInterstitial nephritis is a kidney disorder in which the spaces between the kidney tubules become swollen (inflamed). This can cause problems with the way your kidneys work.\nCauses\nInterstitial nephritis may be temporary (\nacute\n), or it may be long-lasting (\nchronic\n) and get worse over time.\nThe acute form of interstitial nephritis is most often a side effect of certain drugs.\nThe following can cause interstitial nephritis:\nAllergic reaction\nto a drug (acute interstitial allergic nephritis).\nAutoimmune disorders, such as anti-tubular basement membrane disease or\nKawasaki disease\n.\nInfections.\nLong-term use of medicines such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)."}

This is called\nanalgesic nephropathy\n.\nSide effect of certain antibiotics such as penicillin, ampicillin, methicillin, and sulfonamide medicines.\nSide effect of other medicines such as furosemide, thiazide diuretics, omeprazole, triamterene, and allopurinol.\nToo little potassium in your blood.\nToo much calcium or uric acid in your blood.\nSymptoms\nInterstitial nephritis can cause mild to severe kidney problems, including\nacute kidney failure\n. In about half of cases, people will have\ndecreased urine output\nand other signs of acute kidney failure.\nSymptoms of this condition may include:\nBlood in the urine\nFever\nIncreased or\ndecreased urine output\nMental status changes\n(\ndrowsiness\n,\nconfusion\n,\ncoma\n)\nNausea\n,\nvomiting\nRash\nSwelling\nof any area of body\nWeight gain\n(from retaining fluid)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

Avoiding medicines that lead to this condition may quickly relieve symptoms.\nLimiting\nsalt\nand fluid in the diet can improve swelling and high blood pressure. Limiting\nprotein\nin the diet can help control the buildup of waste products in the blood (\nazotemia\n), which can lead to symptoms of acute kidney failure.\nIf dialysis is necessary, it usually is required for only a short time.\nCorticosteroids or stronger anti-inflammatory medicines such as cyclophosphamide can sometimes be helpful.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost often, interstitial nephritis is a short-term disorder."}

The disorder can lead to acute or\nchronic kidney failure\nor\nend-stage kidney disease\n.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of interstitial nephritis.\nIf you have interstitial nephritis, contact your provider if you get new symptoms, especially if you are less alert or have a decrease in urine output.\nPrevention\nOften, the disorder can't be prevented.
