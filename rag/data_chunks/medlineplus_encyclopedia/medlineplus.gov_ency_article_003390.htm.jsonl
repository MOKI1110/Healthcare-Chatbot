This device changes the air pressure in your ear and makes the eardrum move back and forth. A machine records the results on graphs called tympanograms.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou should not move, speak, or swallow during the test. Such movements can change the pressure in the middle ear and give incorrect test results.\nThe sounds heard during the test may be loud. This may be startling. You will need to try very hard to stay calm and not get startled during the test. If your child is to have this test done, it may be helpful to show how the test is done using a doll. The more your child knows what to expect and why the test is done, the less nervous your child will be.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThere may be some discomfort while the probe is in the ear, but no harm will result."}

You will hear a loud tone and feel pressure in your ear as the measurements are taken.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test measures how your ear reacts to sound and different pressures.\nNormal Results\nThe pressure inside the middle ear can vary by a very small amount. The eardrum should look smooth.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nTympanometry may reveal any of the following:\ntumor\nin the middle ear\nFluid in the middle ear\nImpacted\near wax\nLack of contact between the conduction bones of the middle ear\nPerforated eardrum\nScarring of the eardrum\nEustachian tube dysfunction\nRisks\nThere are no risks with this test.\nAlternative Names\nTympanogram; Otitis media - tympanometry; Effusion - tympanometry; Immittance testing\nImages\nEar anatomy\nOtoscope examination\nReferences\nPlayer B.
