This behavior may cause problems in relationships or at work and is often associated with criminal behavior.\nCauses\nThe cause of this disorder is unknown. A person's genes and other factors, such as child abuse, may contribute to developing this condition. People with an antisocial or alcoholic parent are at increased risk. Far more men than women are affected. The condition is common among people who are in prison.\nSetting fires and animal cruelty during childhood are often seen in the development of antisocial personality.\nSome health care providers believe that psychopathic personality (psychopathy) is the same disorder."}
