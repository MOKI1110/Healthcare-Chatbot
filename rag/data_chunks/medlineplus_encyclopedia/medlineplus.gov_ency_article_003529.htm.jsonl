Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAntimitochondrial antibody\nAntimitochondrial antibody\nAntimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) are substances (\nantibodies\n) that form against mitochondria. The mitochondria are an important part of cells. They are the energy source inside the cells. These help the cells work properly.\nThis article discusses the blood test used to measure the amount of AMA in the blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. It is most often taken from a vein. The procedure is called a\nvenipuncture\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour health care provider may tell you not to eat or drink anything for up to 6 hours before the test (most often overnight).\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others may feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou may need this test if you have signs of liver damage."}

This test is most often used to diagnose primary biliary cholangitis, formerly called\nprimary biliary cirrhosis\n(PBC).\nThe test may also be used to tell the difference between\nbile\nsystem-related cirrhosis and liver problems due to other causes such as a blockage, viral\nhepatitis\n, or\nalcoholic cirrhosis\n.\nNormal Results\nNormally, there are no antibodies present.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThis test is important for diagnosing PBC. Almost all people with the condition will test positive. It is rare that a person without the condition will have a positive result."}

Almost all people with the condition will test positive. It is rare that a person without the condition will have a positive result. However, some people with a positive test for AMA and no other sign of liver disease may progress to PBC over time.\nRarely, abnormal results may also be found that are due to other kinds of liver disease and some\nautoimmune diseases\n.\nRisks\nRisks for having blood drawn are slight, but can include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting\nor feeling lightheaded\nHematoma\n(blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nAmerican College of Rheumatology website.
