Most colobomas are present since birth (congenital).\nConsiderations\nColoboma of the iris can look like a second pupil or a black notch at the edge of the pupil. This gives the pupil an irregular shape. It can also appear as a split in the iris from the pupil to the edge of the iris.\nA small coloboma (especially if it is not attached to the pupil) may allow a second image to focus on the back of the eye. This may cause:\nBlurred vision\nDecreased visual acuity\nDouble vision\nGhost image\nIf it is congenital, the defect may include the\nretina\n,\nchoroid\n, or optic nerve.\nMost colobomas are diagnosed at birth or shortly afterward.\nCauses\nMost cases of coloboma have no known cause and are not related to other abnormalities. Some are due to a specific genetic defect."}

An\nMRI\nof the brain, eyes, and connecting nerves may be done if other problems are suspected.\nAlternative Names\nKeyhole pupil; Cat eye syndrome; Iris defect\nImages\nEye\nColoboma of the iris\nReferences\nBrodsky MC, Houghton O.
