Xanthomas vary in size. Some are very small. Others are bigger than 3 inches (7.5 centimeters) in diameter. They may appear anywhere on the body. But, they are most often seen on the elbows, joints, tendons, knees, hands, feet, or buttocks.\nXanthomas may be a sign of a medical condition that involves an increase in blood lipids. Such conditions include:\nCertain cancers\nDiabetes\nHigh blood cholesterol levels\nInherited metabolic disorders, such as\nfamilial hypercholesterolemia\nScarring of the liver due to blocked bile ducts (\nprimary biliary cirrhosis\n)\nInflammation and swelling of the pancreas (\npancreatitis\n)\nUnderactive thyroid (\nhypothyroidism\n)\nXanthelasma palpebra is a common type of xanthoma that appears on the eyelids."}

It usually occurs without any underlying medical condition.\nSymptoms\nA xanthoma looks like a yellow to orange bump (papule) with defined borders. There may be several individual ones or they may form clusters.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine your skin. Usually, a diagnosis can be made by looking at xanthoma. If needed, your provider will\nremove a sample of the growth for testing\n(skin biopsy).\nYou may have blood tests done to check lipid levels, liver function, and for diabetes.\nTreatment\nIf you have a disease that causes increased blood lipids, treating the condition may help reduce the development of xanthomas.\nIf the growth bothers you, your provider may remove it by surgery or with a laser. However, xanthomas may come back after surgery.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe growth is noncancerous and painless, but it may be a sign of another medical condition.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall your provider if xanthomas develop."}
