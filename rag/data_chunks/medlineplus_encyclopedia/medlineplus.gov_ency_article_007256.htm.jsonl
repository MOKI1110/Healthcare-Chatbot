It can replace either the inside (medial) part, the outside (lateral) part, or the kneecap part of the knee.\nSurgery to replace the whole knee joint is called\ntotal knee replacement\n.\nDescription\nPartial knee replacement surgery removes damaged tissue and bone in the knee joint. It is done when arthritis is present in only part of the knee. The areas are replaced with an artificial implant, called a prosthetic. The rest of your knee is preserved. Partial knee replacements are most often done with smaller incisions, so there is less recovery time.\nBefore surgery, you will be given medicine that blocks pain (anesthesia). You will have one of two anesthesia types:\nGeneral anesthesia\n. You will be asleep and pain-free during the procedure.\nRegional (\nspinal or epidural\n) anesthesia. You will be numb below your waist. You will also get medicines to make you relax or feel sleepy.\nThe surgeon will make a cut over your knee."}

You will be numb below your waist. You will also get medicines to make you relax or feel sleepy.\nThe surgeon will make a cut over your knee. This cut is about 3 to 5 inches (7.5 to 13 centimeters) long.\nNext, the surgeon looks at the entire knee joint. If there is damage to more than one part of your knee, you may need a total knee replacement. Most of the time this is not needed, because tests done before the procedure would have shown this damage.\nThe damaged bone and tissue are removed.\nA part made from plastic and metal is placed into the knee.\nOnce the part is in the proper place, it is attached with bone cement or fixated to the bone.\nThe wound is closed with stitches or staples.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThe most common reason to have a partial knee joint replaced is to ease severe arthritis pain.\nYour health care provider may suggest knee joint replacement if:\nYou can't sleep through the night because of knee pain.\nYour knee pain prevents you from doing daily activities.\nYour knee pain has not gotten better with other treatments.\nYour knee pain limits your mobility\nYou will need to understand what surgery\nand r"}

You will also need physical therapy to improve range of motion and strengthen the muscles around the knee.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people recover quickly and have much less pain than they did before surgery. People who have a partial knee replacement recover faster than those who have a total knee replacement.\nMany people are able to walk without a cane or walker within 3 to 4 weeks after surgery. You will need physical therapy for 3 to 4 months.\nMost forms of exercise are OK after surgery, including walking, swimming, tennis, golf, and biking. However, you should\navoid high-impact activities such as jogging\n.\nPartial knee replacement can have good results for some people. However, the unreplaced part of the knee can still degenerate and you may need a full knee replacement down the road.
