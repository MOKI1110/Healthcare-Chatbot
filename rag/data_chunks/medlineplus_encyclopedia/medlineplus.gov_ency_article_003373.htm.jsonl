A test can be done to measure the level of this substance in your blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is used to help diagnose severe problems with blood clotting, such as\ndisseminated intravascular coagulation\n(DIC). Certain types of\nleukemia\nare associated with DIC.\nNormal Results\nIn general, the level of fibrinopeptide A should range from 0.6 to 1.9 (mg/mL).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens."}

Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other.
