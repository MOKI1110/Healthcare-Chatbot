Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nDisk replacement - lumbar spine\nDisk replacement - lumbar spine\nLumbar spine disk replacement is surgery of the lower back (lumbar) area. It is done to treat spinal stenosis or disk problems and allow normal movement of the backbone.\nSpinal stenosis is present when:\nThe space for the spinal column is narrowed.\nThe openings for the nerve roots leaving the spinal column become narrow, placing pressure on the nerve.\nDescription\nDuring total disk replacement (TDR), the inner portion of a damaged spinal disk is replaced with an artificial disk to restore normal movement of the backbone.\nMost often, surgery is done for only one disk, but at times, two levels next to each other may be replaced.\nThe surgery is done under general anesthesia. You will be asleep and not feel any pain.\nDuring surgery:\nYou will lie on your back on the operating table.\nYour arms are padded at the elbow area and folded in front of your chest.\nYour surgeon makes an incision (cut) on your abdomen."}

Doing the operation through the abdomen allows the surgeon to access the spine without disturbing the spinal nerves.\nThe gut organs and blood vessels are moved to the side to get access to the backbone.\nYour surgeon removes the damaged portion of the disk and puts the new artificial disk in its place.\nAll the organs are put back into place.\nThe incision is closed with stitches.\nThe surgery takes about 2 hours to complete.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nCushion-like disks help the spine stay mobile. Nerves in the lower spine area get compressed due to:\nNarrowing of the disk due to old injuries\nBulging of the disk (protrusion)\nArthritis\nthat occurs in your spine that pushes on the nerves\nSurgery for\nspinal stenosis\nmay be considered if you have severe symptoms that interfere with your daily life and do not improve with other therapy. Symptoms most often include:\nPain that may be felt in your thigh, calf or lower back."}

Symptoms most often include:\nPain that may be felt in your thigh, calf or lower back. The pain is often deep and steady.\nPain in your buttock area.\nPain when doing certain activities or moving your body a certain way.\nNumbness, tingling, and muscle weakness.\nDifficulty with balance and walking.\nLoss of bladder or bowel control.\nTalk to your health care provider about whether surgery is right for you. Most people with lower back pain do not need surgery. Most people are first treated with medicines, physical therapy, and exercise which give relief of back pain.\nDuring traditional spinal surgery for spinal stenosis, the surgeon will need to fuse some of the bones in your spine to make your spine more stable. As a result, other parts of your spine below and above the fusion may be more likely to have disk problems in the future.\nWith disk replacement surgery, no fusion is needed. As a result, the spine above and below the site of surgery still has preserved movement."}
