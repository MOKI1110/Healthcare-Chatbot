Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEpidermoid cyst\nEpidermoid cyst\nAn epidermoid cyst is a closed sac under the skin, or a skin lump, filled with dead skin cells.\nCauses\nEpidermoid cysts are very common. Their cause is unknown. The cysts are formed when elements of the surface skin get under the skin surface. The cyst then becomes filled with dead skin because as the skin grows, it can't be shed as it can elsewhere on the body. When a cyst reaches a certain size, it usually stops growing.\nPeople with these cysts may have family members who also have them.\nThese cysts are more common in adults than in children.\nSometimes, epidermoid cysts are called sebaceous cysts. This is not correct because the contents of the two types of cysts are different. Epidermoid cysts are filled with dead skin cells, while true sebaceous cysts are filled with yellowish oily material. (A true sebaceous cyst is called a steatocystoma.)\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom is usually a small, non-painful lump beneath the skin. The lump is usually found on the face, neck, and trunk."}

It will often have a tiny hole or pit in the center. It usually grows slowly and is not painful.\nIf the lump becomes infected or inflamed, other symptoms may include:\nSkin redness\nTender or sore skin\nWarm skin in the affected area\nGrayish-white, cheesy, foul-smelling material that drains from the cyst\nExams and Tests\nIn most cases, your health care provider can make a diagnosis by examining your skin. Sometimes, a\nbiopsy\nmay be needed to check for other conditions. If infection is suspected, you may need to have a\nskin culture\n.\nTreatment\nEpidermoid cysts are not dangerous and do not need to be treated unless they cause symptoms or show signs of inflammation (redness or tenderness)."}

Although epidermoid cysts are not harmful, your provider should examine you for signs of skin cancer. Some skin cancers look like cystic nodules, so have any new lump examined by your provider."}
