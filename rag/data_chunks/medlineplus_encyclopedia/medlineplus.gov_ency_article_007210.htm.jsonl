You may need this procedure if you have severe liver problems.\nDescription\nThis is not a surgical procedure. It is done by an interventional radiologist using\nx-ray\nguidance. A radiologist is a doctor who uses imaging techniques to diagnose and treat diseases.\nYou will be asked to lie on your back. You will be connected to monitors that will check your heart rate and blood pressure.\nYou will probably receive local anesthesia and medicine to relax you. This will make you pain-free and sleepy. Or, you may have\ngeneral anesthesia\n(asleep and pain-free).\nDuring the procedure:\nThe doctor inserts a catheter (a flexible tube) through your skin into a vein in your neck. This vein is called the jugular vein."}

This vein is called the jugular vein. On the end of the catheter is a tiny balloon and a metal mesh stent (tube).\nUsing an x-ray machine, the doctor guides the catheter into a vein in your liver.\nDye (contrast material) is then injected into the vein so that it can be seen more clearly.\nThe balloon is inflated to place the stent. You may feel a little pain when this happens.\nThe doctor uses the stent to connect your portal vein to one of your hepatic veins.\nAt the end of the procedure, your portal vein pressure is measured to make sure it has gone down.\nThe catheter with the balloon is then removed.\nAfter the procedure, a small bandage is placed over the neck area. There are usually no stitches.\nThe procedure takes about 60 to 90 minutes to complete.\nThis new pathway will allow blood to flow better. It will ease pressure on the veins of your stomach, esophagus, intestines, and liver.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nNormally, blood coming from your esophagus, stomach, and intestines first flows through the liver."}

When your liver is very damaged and scar tissue blocks many of the small blood vessels in the liver, blood cannot flow through it very easily. This is called portal hypertension (increased pressure and backup of the portal vein). The veins can then break open (rupture), causing serious bleeding.\nCommon causes of portal hypertension are:\nAlcohol use causing scarring of the liver (\ncirrhosis\n)\nBlood clots in a vein that flows from the liver to the heart\nToo much iron in the liver (\nhemochromatosis\n) causing cirrhosis\nHepatitis B\nor\nhepatitis C\ncausing cirrhosis\nCirrhosis from other liver conditions\nWhen portal hypertension occurs, you may have:\nBleeding from veins of the stomach, esophagus, or intestines (\nvariceal bleeding\n)\nBuildup of fluid in the belly (\nascites\n)\nBuildup of fluid in the chest (hydrothorax)\nThis procedure allows blood to flow better in your liver, stomach, esophagus, and intestines, and then back to your heart.\nRisks\nPossible risks with this procedure are:\nDamage to b"}

Most people recover well.\nTIPS works in about 80% to 90% of people with portal hypertension cases.\nThe procedure is much safer than surgery and does not involve any cutting or stitches.\nAlternative Names\nTIPS; Cirrhosis - TIPS; Liver failure - TIPS\nPatient Instructions\nCirrhosis - discharge\nImages\nTransjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt\nReferences\nGarcia-Tsao G.
