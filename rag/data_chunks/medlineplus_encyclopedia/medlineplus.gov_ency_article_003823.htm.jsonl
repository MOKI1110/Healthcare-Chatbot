Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRadionuclide cisternogram\nRadionuclide cisternogram\nA radionuclide cisternogram is a nuclear scan test. It is used to diagnose problems with the flow of spinal fluid.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA spinal tap (\nlumbar puncture\n) is done first. Small amounts of radioactive material, called a radioisotope, are injected into the fluid within the spine. The needle is removed immediately after the injection.\nYou will then be scanned 1 to 6 hours after getting the injection. A special camera takes images that show how the radioactive materials travel with the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) through the spine. The images also show if the fluid leaks outside the spine or brain.\nYou will be scanned again 24 hours after injection. You may need additional scans possibly at 48 and 72 hours after injection.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nMost of the time, you do not need to prepare for this test. Your health care provider may give you medicine to calm your nerves if you are very anxious."}

Your health care provider may give you medicine to calm your nerves if you are very anxious. You will sign a consent form before the test.\nYou will wear a hospital gown during the scan so your doctors have access to your spine. You will also need to remove jewelry or metallic objects before the scan.\nHow the Test will Feel\nNumbing medicine will be put on your lower back before the lumbar puncture. However, many people find lumbar puncture somewhat uncomfortable. This is often due to the pressure on the spine when the needle is inserted.\nThe scan is painless, although the table may be cold or hard. No discomfort is produced by the radioisotope or the scanner.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is performed to detect problems with the flow of spinal fluid and spinal fluid leaks. In some cases, there may be a concern that the CSF fluid is leaking after a trauma to the head or a surgery in the head."}

In some cases, there may be a concern that the CSF fluid is leaking after a trauma to the head or a surgery in the head. This test will be done to diagnose the leak.\nNormal Results\nA normal value indicates normal circulation of CSF through all parts of the brain and spinal cord.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result indicates disorders of CSF circulation. These disorders may include:\nHydrocephalus\nor dilated spaces in your brain due to an obstruction\nCSF leak\nNormal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH)\nWhether or not a CSF shunt is open or blocked\nRisks\nRisks associated with a lumbar puncture include:\nPain at the injection site\nBleeding\nInfection\nThere is also a very rare chance of nerve damage.\nThe amount of radiation used during the nuclear scan is very small. Almost all of the radiation is gone within a few days. There are no known cases of the radioisotope causing harm to the person getting the scan. However, as with any radiation exposure, caution is advised if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.\nIn rare cases, a person may have an\nallergic reaction\nto the radioisotope used during the scan."}
