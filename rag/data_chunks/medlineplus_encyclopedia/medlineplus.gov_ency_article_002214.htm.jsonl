Just beneath the enamel is dentin, a substance harder than bone. The gum surrounds the base (root) of the tooth.\nThe root of the tooth extends down into the jawbone. The root contains blood vessels and nerves, which supply blood and feeling to the whole tooth. This area is known as the \"pulp\" of the tooth.\nThe jawbone is attached to all of the teeth. It keeps your teeth stable and allows you to move your mouth and teeth to chew. The lower jawbone is called the mandible. The upper jawbone is called the maxilla.\nImages\nTooth anatomy\nReferences\nAdoff S. Dental and mouth pain. In: Olympia RP, O'Neill RM, Silvis ML, eds.\nUrgent Care Medicine Secrets\n.
