They wash away particles and foreign objects in the eye.\nCauses\nYour eyes always contain tears made by the tear (lacrimal) glands just above the eyes. These tears leave the eye through a small hole in the corner of the eye called the tear duct (nasolacrimal duct).\nCauses of watery eyes include:\nAllergy to mold, dander, dust\nBlepharitis\n(swelling along the edge of the eyelid)\nBlockage of the tear duct\nConjunctivitis\nSmog or chemicals in the air or wind\nBright light\nEyelid turning inward or outward\nSomething in the eye (such as dust or sand)\nScrape on the eye\nInfection\nInward-growing eyelashes\nIrritation\nIncreased tearing sometimes happens with:\nEyestrain\nLaughing\nVomiting\nYawning\nOne of the most common causes of excess tearing is\ndry eyes\n. Drying causes the eyes to become uncomfortable, which stimulates the body to produce too many tears."}
