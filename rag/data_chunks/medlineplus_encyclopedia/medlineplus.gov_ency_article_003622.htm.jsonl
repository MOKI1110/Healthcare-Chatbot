Be sure to do this exactly 24 hours after you started the collection.\nCap the container. Keep it in the refrigerator or a cool place during the collection period.\nLabel the container with your name, the date, the time of completion, and return it as instructed.\nFor an infant, thoroughly wash the area around the urethra. Open a urine collection bag (a plastic bag with an adhesive paper on one end), and place it on the infant. For males, place the entire penis in the bag and attach the adhesive to the skin. For females, place the bag over the labia. Diaper as usual over the secured bag.\nThis procedure may take a couple of attempts."}

For females, place the bag over the labia. Diaper as usual over the secured bag.\nThis procedure may take a couple of attempts. Active infants can move the bag, causing the urine to be absorbed by the diaper. The infant should be checked frequently and the bag changed after the infant has urinated into the bag. Drain the urine from the bag into the container provided by your lab or health care provider.\nDeliver it to the lab or your provider as soon as possible upon completion.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider will tell you, if needed, to stop taking any medicines that may interfere with the test results.\nA number of medicines can change the test results."}
