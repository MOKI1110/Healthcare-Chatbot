Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEar tag\nEar tag\nAn ear tag is a small skin tag or pit in front of the outside part of the ear.\nConsiderations\nSkin tags and pits just in front of the opening of the ear are common in newborn infants.\nIn most cases, these are normal. However, they can be associated with other medical conditions. It is important to point out skin tags or pits to your child's health care provider during the routine well-child exam.\nCauses\nSome causes of an ear tag or pit are:\nAn inherited tendency to have this facial feature\nA genetic syndrome that includes having these pits or tags\nA sinus tract problem (an abnormal connection between the skin and tissue underneath)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nYour provider will most often find the skin tag during your first\nwell-baby visit\n."}

However, contact your provider if your child has bleeding, swelling, or discharge at the site.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nYour provider will get a medical history and will do a\nphysical exam\n.\nMedical history questions about this condition might include:\nWhat exactly is the problem (skin tag, pit, or other)?\nAre both ears affected or only one?\nWhat other symptoms are present?\nDoes the child respond normally to sounds?\nIt is now standard of care to have a hearing screen in the newborn nursery. An abnormal screen with the presence of an ear pit or tag should lead to a follow-up hearing screen with an audiologist.\nBabies that are born at birthing centers without hearing screening or at home should have hearing tests completed to check their hearing especially if there is an ear tag or ear pit present.\nPhysical exam:\nYour baby will be examined for other signs of disorders that are sometimes associated with ear tags or pits."}
