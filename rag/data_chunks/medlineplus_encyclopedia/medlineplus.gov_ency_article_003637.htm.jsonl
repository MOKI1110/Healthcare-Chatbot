A reticulocyte count is a blood test that measures the amount of these cells in the blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is done to determine if red blood cells are being created in the bone marrow at an appropriate rate. The number of reticulocytes in the blood is a sign of how quickly they are being produced and released by the bone marrow.\nNormal Results\nA normal result for healthy adults who are not anemic is 0.5% to 2.5%.\nThe normal range depends on your blood level of hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen."}

Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. The range is higher if hemoglobin is low, from bleeding or if red cells are destroyed.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA higher than normal reticulocyte count may indicate:\nAnemia due to red blood cells being destroyed earlier than normal (\nhemolytic anemia\n)\nBleeding\nBlood disorder in a fetus or newborn (erythroblastosis fetalis)\nKidney cysts or tumors, with increased production of a hormone called\nerythropoietin\nPregnancy\nA lower than normal reticulocyte count may indicate:\nAnemia caused by low iron levels, or low levels of vitamin B12 or folate\nBone marrow failure (for example, from a certain medicine, tumor, radiation therapy, or infection)\nChronic kidney disease\n, due to decreased amounts of a key hormone\nCirrhosis of the liver\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having"}

Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other.
