It is most often caused by a type of bacteria called group A beta-hemolytic streptococcus.\nPeritonsillar abscess most often occurs in older children, adolescents, and young adults. The condition is rare now that antibiotics are used to treat tonsillitis.\nSymptoms\nOne or both tonsils become infected. The infection may spread to the area around the tonsil. It can then spread down into the neck and chest. Swollen tissues can block the airway. This is a life-threatening medical emergency.\nThe abscess can break open (rupture) into the throat."}

If an abscess has developed, it will need to be drained with a needle or by cutting it open. You will be given pain medicine before this is done.\nIf the infection is very severe, the tonsils will be removed at the same time the abscess is drained, but this is rare. In this case, you will have general anesthesia so you will be asleep and pain-free.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn most cases, peritonsillar abscess goes away with treatment. The infection may return in the future.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nAirway obstruction\nCellulitis\nof the jaw, neck, or chest\nEndocarditis\n(rare)\nFluid around the lungs (\npleural effusion\n)\nInflammation around the heart (\npericarditis\n)\nPneumonia\nSepsis\n(infection in the blood)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider right away if you have had tonsillitis and you develop symptoms of peritonsillar abscess.\nGet medical help right away if you have:\nBreathing trouble\nHigh-pitched breathing sounds (stridor)\nRetraction of the muscles between the ribs when breathing\nDifficulty turning the head\nDifficulty s"}
