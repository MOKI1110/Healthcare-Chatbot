Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRepair of webbed fingers or toes\nRepair of webbed fingers or toes\nRepair of\nwebbed fingers or toes\nis surgery to fix webbing of the toes, fingers, or both. The middle and ring fingers or the second and third toes are most often affected. Most often this surgery is done when a child is between 6 months and 2 years old.\nDescription\nSurgery is done the following way:\nGeneral anesthesia\nmay be given. This means your child is asleep and won't feel pain. Or regional anesthesia (\nspinal and epidural\n) is given to numb the affected extremity. General anesthesia is more commonly used for younger children because it is safer to manage them while they are sleeping.\nThe surgeon marks the areas of the skin that need repair.\nThe skin is cut into flaps, and the soft tissues are cut to separate the fingers or toes.\nThe flaps are sewn into position. If needed, skin taken (\ngraft\n) from other areas of the body is used to cover places that are missing skin.\nThe hand or foot is then wrapped with a bulky bandage or cast so that it can't move."}

This allows healing to take place.\nSimple webbing of fingers or toes involves only the skin and other soft tissues. The surgery is more complicated when it involves fused bones, nerves, blood vessels, and tendons. These structures may need to be reoriented or reconstructed to allow the digits to move independently.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThis surgery is advised if the webbing causes problems with appearance, or in using or movement of the fingers or toes.\nRisks\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general include:\nProblems breathing\nReactions to medicines\nBleeding, blood clot, or infection\nOther possible complications related to this surgery include the following:\nDamage from not getting enough blood in the hand or foot\nLoss of skin grafts\nLoss of digits\nStiffness of the fingers or toes\nInjuries to the blood vessels, tendons, or bones in the fingers\nContact your surgeon if you notice the following:\nFever\nFingers that tingle, are numb\n, or have a bluish tinge\nSevere pain\nSwelling"}

When joined fingers share a single fingernail, the creation of two normal-looking nails is rarely possible. One nail will look more normal than the other. Some children require a second surgery if the webbing is complicated.\nThe separated fingers will never look or function the same.\nAlternative Names\nWeb finger repair; Web toe repair; Syndactyly repair;  Syndactyly release\nImages\nBefore and after webbed finger repair\nSyndactyly\nRepair of webbed fingers  - series\nReferences\nMauck BM.
