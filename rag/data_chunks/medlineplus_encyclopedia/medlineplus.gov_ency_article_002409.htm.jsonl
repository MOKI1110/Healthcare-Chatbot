Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNiacin\nNiacin\nNiacin is a type of B vitamin. It is a water-soluble vitamin. It is not stored in the body. Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water. Leftover amounts of the vitamin leave the body through the urine. The body keeps a small reserve of these vitamins, but they have to be taken on a regular basis to maintain the reserve.\nFunction\nNiacin helps the digestive system, skin, and nerves to function. It is also important for changing food to energy.\nFood Sources\nNiacin (also known as vitamin B3) is found in:\nMilk\nEggs\nEnriched breads and cereals\nRice\nFish\nLean meats\nLegumes\nPeanuts\nPoultry\nNIACIN AND HEART DISEASE\nIn large doses, niacin can cause a modest increase in the level of good cholesterol (HDL cholesterol) in the blood. It can also bring down the amount of triglyceride in the blood. Always talk to your health care provider before starting any supplements.\nSide Effects\nDEFICIENCY:\nA deficiency of niacin causes\npellagra\n."}

The symptoms include:\nDigestive problems\nInflamed skin\nPoor mental function\nHIGH INTAKE:\nToo much niacin can cause:\nIncreased blood sugar (glucose) level\nLiver damage\nPeptic ulcers\nSkin rashes\nWhen given as a treatment for people with high cholesterol, niacin supplements can cause flushing, which is a feeling of warmth, redness, itching or tingling of the face, neck, arms or upper chest.\nTo prevent flushing, do not drink hot beverages or alcohol with niacin.\nNew forms of niacin supplements have less side effects. Supplements in the form of nicotinamide or niacinamide do not appear to cause side effects.\nRecommendations\nREFERENCE INTAKES\nRecommendations for niacin and other nutrients are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs), which are developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is the term for a set of reference values that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people."}
