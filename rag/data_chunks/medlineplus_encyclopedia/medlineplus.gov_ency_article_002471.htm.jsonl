It is the basis for the fluids of the body.\nFunction\nWater makes up more than two-thirds of the weight of the human body. Without consuming water, humans would die in a few days. All the cells and organs need water to function.\nWater serves as a lubricant. It makes up saliva and the fluids surrounding the joints. Water regulates the body temperature through\nperspiration\n. It also helps prevent and relieve\nconstipation\nby moving food through the intestines.\nFood Sources\nYou get some of the water in your body through the foods you eat. Some of the water is made during the process of\nmetabolism\n.\nYou also get water through liquid foods and beverages, such as soup, milk, tea, coffee, soda, drinking water, and juices. Alcohol does not add to the body's water because it is a diuretic. It causes the body to release water.\nSide Effects\nIf you do not get enough water each day, the body fluids will be out of balance, causing\ndehydration\n."}

When dehydration is severe, it can be life threatening.\nRecommendations\nThe Dietary Reference Intake for water is between 91 and 125 fluid ounces (2.7 to 3.7 liters) of water per day for adults.\nHowever, individual needs will depend on your sex, weight, age, and activity level, as well as any medical conditions you may have. Keep in mind that this is the total amount you get from both food and beverages every day. There is no specific recommendation for how much water you should drink.\nIf you drink fluids when you feel thirsty and have beverages with meals, you should get enough water to keep you hydrated. Try to choose water over sweetened drinks. These beverages can cause you to take in too many calories.\nAs you get older your thirst may change.
