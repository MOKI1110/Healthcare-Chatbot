Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nVLDL test\nVLDL test\nVLDL stands for very low density lipoprotein. Lipoproteins are made up of\ncholesterol\n, triglycerides, and proteins. They move cholesterol, triglycerides, and other lipids (fats) around the body.\nVLDL is one of the three main types of lipoproteins. VLDL contains the highest amount of triglycerides. VLDL is a type of \"bad cholesterol\" because it helps cholesterol build up on the walls of arteries.\nA lab test is used to measure the amount of VLDL in your blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is\ndrawn from a vein\nlocated on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou may have this test to help assess your risk for heart disease. Increased levels of VLDL are linked to\natherosclerosis\n."}

Increased levels of VLDL are linked to\natherosclerosis\n. This condition can lead to\ncoronary heart disease\n.\nThis test may be included in a coronary risk profile.\nNormal Results\nNormal VLDL cholesterol level is 2 to 30 mg/dL.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.\nThe examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA high VLDL cholesterol level may be associated with a higher risk for heart disease and stroke. However, VLDL cholesterol level is rarely targeted when treatment for high cholesterol is done. Instead,\nLDL cholesterol level\nis more often the main target of therapy.\nRisks\nVeins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}

Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nThe risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nConsiderations\nThere is no direct way of measuring VLDL. Most labs estimate your VLDL based on your triglycerides level. It is about one fifth of your triglycerides level. This estimate is not accurate if your triglycerides level is above 400 mg/dL.\nAlternative Names\nVery low density lipoprotein test\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nBredefeld CL, Lau R, Hussain MM.
