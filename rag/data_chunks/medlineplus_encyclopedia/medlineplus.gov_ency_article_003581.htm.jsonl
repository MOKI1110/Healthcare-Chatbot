The presence of glucose in the urine is called glycosuria or glucosuria.\nThe glucose level can also be measured in other bodily fluids using a\nblood test\nor a\ncerebrospinal fluid test\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nAfter you provide a urine sample, it is tested right away. The health care provider uses a dipstick made with a color-sensitive pad. The color of the dipstick changes to tells the provider the level of glucose in your urine.\nIf needed, your provider may ask you to\ncollect your urine at home over 24 hours\n. Your provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nCertain medicines can change the result of this test. Before the test, tell your provider which medicines you are taking. DO NOT stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination."}

Before the test, tell your provider which medicines you are taking. DO NOT stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test was commonly used to test for and monitor diabetes in the past. Now, blood tests to measure glucose level in the blood are easy to do and are usually used instead of the glucose urine test.\nThe glucose urine test may be ordered when your provider suspects renal glycosuria. This is a rare condition in which glucose is released from the kidneys into the urine, even when the blood glucose level is normal.\nNormal Results\nGlucose is not usually found in urine. If it is, further testing is needed.\nNormal glucose range in urine: 0  to 0.8 mmol/l (0  to 15 mg/dL)\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Talk to your provider  about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nHigher than normal levels of glucose may occur with:\nDiabetes\n: Small increases in urine glucose levels after a large meal are not always a cause for concern.\nPregnancy: Up to half of women have glucose in their urine at some time during pregnancy. Glucose in the urine may mean that a woman has\ngestational diabetes\n.\nRenal glycosuria: A rare condition in which glucose is released from the kidneys into the urine, even when blood glucose levels are normal.\nRisks\nThere are no risks with this test.\nAlternative Names\nUrine sugar test; Urine glucose test; Glucosuria test; Glycosuria test\nImages\nMale urinary system\nReferences\nAmerican Diabetes Association Professional Practice Committee. 6.
