Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEmpyema\nEmpyema\nEmpyema is a collection of pus in the space between the lung and the inner surface of the chest wall (pleural space).\nCauses\nEmpyema is usually caused by an infection that spreads directly from the lung. It leads to a buildup of pus in the pleural space.\nThere can be 2 cups (1/2 liter) or more of infected fluid. This fluid puts pressure on the lungs.\nRisk factors include:\nBacterial pneumonia\nTuberculosis\nChest surgery\nLung\nabscess\nTrauma or injury to the chest\nIn rare cases, empyema can occur after\nthoracentesis\n."}

This is a procedure in which a needle is inserted through the chest wall to remove fluid in the pleural space for medical diagnosis or treatment.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of empyema may include any of the following:\nChest pain\n, which worsens when you breathe in deeply (pleurisy)\nDry\ncough\nExcessive sweating\n, especially night sweats\nFever\nand chills\nGeneral discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (\nmalaise\n)\nShortness of breath\nWeight loss\n(unintentional)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider may note decreased breath sounds or an abnormal sound (friction rub) when listening to your chest with a stethoscope (\nauscultation\n).\nTests that may be ordered include:\nChest x-ray\n(may require multiple positions)\nCT scan of chest\nThoracentesis\nPleural fluid analysis\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to cure the infection."}

This involves the following:\nPlacing a tube in your chest to drain the pus\nGiving you antibiotics to control the infection\nIf you have problems breathing, you may need surgery to help your lung expand properly.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWhen empyema complicates pneumonia, the risk for permanent lung damage and death goes up. Long-term treatment with antibiotics and drainage are needed.\nIn general, most people fully recover from empyema.\nPossible Complications\nHaving empyema may lead to the following:\nPleural thickening\nReduced lung function\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of empyema.\nPrevention\nPrompt and effective treatment of lung infections may prevent some cases of empyema.\nAlternative Names\nEmpyema - pleural; Pyothorax; Pleurisy - purulent\nImages\nLungs\nChest tube insertion - series\nReferences\nBroaddus VC, Light RW.
