Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nACTH blood test\nACTH blood test\nThe ACTH test measures the level of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the blood. ACTH is a hormone released from the pituitary gland at the base of the brain.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample is needed\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour health care provider will likely ask you to have the test done early in the morning. This is important because cortisol level varies throughout the day.\nYou may also be told to stop taking medicines that can affect the test results. These medicines include glucocorticoids such as prednisone, hydrocortisone, or dexamethasone. Do not stop these medicines unless instructed by your provider.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe main function of ACTH is to regulate the glucocorticoid (steroid) hormone cortisol. Cortisol is released by the\nadrenal gland\n."}

It regulates blood pressure, blood sugar, the immune system, and the response to stress.\nThis test can help find the causes of certain hormone problems.\nNormal Results\nNormal values for a blood sample taken early in the morning are 9 to 52 pg/mL (2 to 11 pmol/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens."}
