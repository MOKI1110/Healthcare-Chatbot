This damage leads to the release of too much protein in the urine.\nThe most common cause in children is\nminimal change disease\n.\nMembranous glomerulonephritis\nis the most common cause in adults. In both diseases, the glomeruli in the kidneys are damaged."}

Laboratory tests will be done to see how well the kidneys are working. They include:\nAlbumin\nblood test\nBlood chemistry tests, such as\nbasic metabolic panel\nor\ncomprehensive metabolic panel\nBlood urea nitrogen\n(BUN)\nCreatinine - blood test\nCreatinine clearance - urine test\nUrinalysis\nFats are often also present in the urine."}

To control nephrotic syndrome, the disorder that is causing it must be treated. You may need treatment for life.\nTreatments may include any of the following:\nKeeping blood pressure at or below 130/80 mm Hg to delay kidney damage. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are the medicines most often used."}

Medicines to reduce cholesterol and triglycerides (usually statins) may be needed.\nlow-sodium diet\nmay help with swelling in the hands and legs.
