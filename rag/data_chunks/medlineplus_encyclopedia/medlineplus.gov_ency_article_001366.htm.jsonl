GBS septicemia is caused by the bacterium\nStreptococcus agalactiae\n, which is commonly called group B strep, or GBS.\nGBS is commonly found in adults and older children and usually does not cause infection. But it can make newborn babies very sick. There are two ways in which GBS can be passed to a newborn baby:\nThe baby can become infected while passing through the birth canal. In this case, babies become ill between birth and 6 days of life (most often in the first 24 hours). This is called early-onset GBS disease.\nThe infant may also become infected after delivery by coming into contact with people who carry the GBS germ. In this case, symptoms appear later, when the baby is 7 days to 3 months or more old."}

In this case, symptoms appear later, when the baby is 7 days to 3 months or more old. This is called late-onset GBS disease.\nGBS septicemia now occurs less often, because there are methods to screen and treat pregnant women whose babies are at risk.\nThe following increase an infant's risk for GBS septicemia:\nBeing born more than 3 weeks before the due date (prematurity), especially if the mother goes into labor early (preterm labor) and has not been screened for GBS\nMother who has already given birth to a baby with GBS sepsis\nMother who has a fever of 100.4 °F (38 °C) or higher during labor and has not been screened for GBS\nMother who has GBS in her gastrointestinal, reproductive, or urinary tract\nRupture of membranes (water breaks) more than 18 hours before the baby is delivered in a mother who has not been screened for GBS\nSymptoms\nThe baby may have any of the following signs and symptoms:\nBlue appearance\n(cyanosis)\nBreathing difficulties\n, such as flaring of the nostrils, grunting noises, rapid breathing, and short periods without breathing\nIrregular or abnormal (fas"}

The early stages of this disease can produce symptoms that are hard to spot.\nPrevention\nTo help reduce the risk for GBS, pregnant women should get tested for the bacteria at 35 to 37 weeks into their pregnancy. If the bacteria are detected, women are given antibiotics through a vein during labor. If the mother goes into premature labor before 37 weeks and GBS test results are unavailable, she should be treated with antibiotics. Of note, a negative screen for the mother does not mean the baby has no risk for GBS septicemia, because the bacteria are not always detectable by screening the mother.\nNewborns who are at high risk are observed and sometimes tested for GBS infection, depending on their clinical status. They may receive antibiotics through a vein during the first 30 to 48 hours of life until test results are available."}
