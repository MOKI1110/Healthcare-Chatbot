Pancreas transplants give the person a chance to stop taking insulin injections.\nDescription\nThe healthy pancreas is taken from a donor who is brain dead, but is still on life support. The donor pancreas must be carefully matched to the person who is receiving it. The healthy pancreas is transported in a cooled solution that preserves the organ for up to about 20 hours.\nThe person's diseased pancreas is not removed during the operation. The donor pancreas is usually placed in the right lower part of the person's abdomen. Blood vessels from the new pancreas are attached to the person's blood vessels. The donor duodenum (first part of the small intestine right after the stomach) is attached to the person's intestine or bladder.\nThe surgery for a pancreas transplant takes about 3 hours. This operation is usually done at the same time as a\nkidney transplant\nin diabetic people with kidney disease."}

This operation is usually done at the same time as a\nkidney transplant\nin diabetic people with kidney disease. The combined operation takes about 6 hours.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nA pancreas transplant can cure diabetes and eliminate the need for insulin shots. However, because of the risks involved with surgery, most people with type 1 diabetes do not have a pancreas transplant shortly after they are diagnosed.\nA pancreas transplant is rarely done alone. It is almost always done when someone with type 1 diabetes also needs a kidney transplant.\nThe pancreas makes a substance called insulin. Insulin moves glucose, a sugar, from the blood into the muscles, fat, and liver cells, where it can be used as fuel.\nIn people with\ntype 1 diabetes\n, the pancreas has lost the ability to make insulin. This causes glucose to build up in the blood, leading to a high level of sugar in the blood."}
