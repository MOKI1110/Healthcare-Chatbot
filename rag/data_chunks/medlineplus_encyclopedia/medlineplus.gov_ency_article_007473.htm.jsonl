These blood vessels are called the coronary arteries.\nA coronary artery stent is a small, metal mesh tube that expands inside a coronary artery. A\nstent\nis often placed during or immediately after angioplasty. It helps prevent the artery from closing up again. A drug-eluting stent has medicine embedded in it that helps prevent the artery from closing in the long term. These are the most common kind of stent.\nWatch this video about:\nBalloon angioplasty - short segment\nDescription\nBefore the angioplasty procedure begins, you will receive some pain medicine. You may also be given medicine that relaxes you, and blood-thinning medicines to prevent a blood clot from forming.\nYou will lie on a padded table. Your doctor (usually a heart specialist called a cardiologist) will insert a flexible tube (catheter) into an artery."}

Your doctor (usually a heart specialist called a cardiologist) will insert a flexible tube (catheter) into an artery. Sometimes the catheter will be placed in your arm or wrist, or in your upper leg (groin) area. You will be awake during the procedure.\nThe doctor will use live x-ray pictures to carefully guide the catheter up into your heart and arteries. Liquid contrast (sometimes called \"dye,\" will be injected into your body to highlight blood flow through the arteries. This helps the doctor see any blockages in the blood vessels that lead to your heart.\nA guide wire is moved into and across the blockage. A balloon catheter is pushed over the guide wire and into the blockage. The balloon on the end is blown up (inflated). This opens the blocked vessel and restores proper blood flow to the heart.\nA wire mesh tube (stent) may then be placed in this blocked area. The stent is inserted along with the balloon catheter. It expands when the balloon is inflated. The stent is left there to help keep the artery open.\nThe stent is almost always coated with a drug (called a drug-eluting stent)."}

This type of stent may lower the chance of the artery closing back up in the future.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nArteries can become narrowed or blocked by deposits called plaque. Plaque is made up of fat and cholesterol that builds up on the inside of artery walls. This condition is called\nhardening of the arteries\n(atherosclerosis).\nAngioplasty may be used to treat:\nBlockage in a coronary artery during or after a\nheart attack\nBlockage or narrowing of one or more coronary arteries that may lead to poor heart function (heart failure)\nNarrowings that reduce blood flow and cause persistent chest pain (\nangina\n) that medicines do not control\nNot every blockage can or needs to be treated with angioplasty. Some people who have several blockages or blockages in certain locations may need\ncoronary bypass surgery\n."}

Some people who have several blockages or blockages in certain locations may need\ncoronary bypass surgery\n. Some blockages are treated with medical therapy rather than an interventional procedure.\nRisks\nAngioplasty is generally safe, but ask your doctor about the possible complications. Risks of angioplasty and stent placement are:\nAllergic reaction to the drug used in a drug-eluting stent, the stent material (very rare), or the x-ray dye.\nBleeding or clotting in the area where the catheter was inserted.\nBlood clot\n.\nClogging of the inside of the stent (in-stent restenosis). This can be life threatening.\nDamage to a heart valve or blood vessel.\nHeart attack.\nKidney failure\n(higher risk in people who already have kidney problems).\nIrregular heartbeat (\narrhythmias\n).\nStroke\n(this is rare).\nBefore the Procedure\nAngioplasty is often performed when you go to the hospital or emergency room for chest pain, or after a heart attack."}

If you are admitted to the hospital for angioplasty:\nTell your health care provider what medicines you are taking, even medicines or herbs you bought without a prescription.\nYou will most often be asked not to drink or eat anything for 6 to 8 hours before the test.\nTake the mediciness your provider told you to take with a small sip of water.\nTell your provider if you are allergic to seafood, you have had a bad reaction to contrast material or iodine in the past, you are taking sildenafil (Viagra) or similar medicines, or you are or might be pregnant.\nAfter the Procedure\nThe average hospital stay is 2 days or less. Some people may not even have to stay overnight in the hospital.\nIn general, people who have angioplasty are able to walk around within a few hours after the procedure, depending on how the procedure went and where the catheter was placed. Complete recovery takes a week or less."}

You will be given information\nhow to care for yourself after angioplasty\n.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nFor most people, angioplasty greatly improves blood flow through the coronary artery and the heart. It may help you avoid the need for coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG).\nAngioplasty does not cure the cause of the blockage in your arteries. Your arteries may become narrow again.\nFollow your heart-healthy diet, exercise, stop smoking (if you smoke), and reduce stress to lower your chances of having another blocked artery.
