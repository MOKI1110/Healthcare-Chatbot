These bones are called vertebrae.\nDescription\nYou'll be given\ngeneral anesthesia\n, which puts you into a deep sleep so you do not feel pain during surgery.\nThe surgeon will make a surgical cut (incision) to view the spine. Other surgery, such as a\ndiskectomy\n,\nlaminectomy\n, or a\nforaminotomy\n, is almost always done first. Spinal fusion may be done:\nOn the part of your back or neck over the spine. You may be lying face down. Muscles and tissue will be separated to expose the spine.\nOn your side, if you are having surgery on your lower back. The surgeon will use tools called retractors to gently separate, hold the soft tissues such as your bowels and blood vessels apart, and have room to work.\nWith a cut on the front of the neck, toward the side.\nThe surgeon will use a graft (such as bone) to hold (or fuse) the bones together permanently."}

There are several ways of fusing vertebrae together:\nStrips of\nbone graft material\nmay be placed over the back part of the spine.\nBone graft material may be placed between the vertebrae.\nSpecial cages may be placed between the vertebrae. These implantable cages are packed with bone graft material.\nThe surgeon may get the bone graft from:\nAnother part of your body (usually around your pelvic bone). This is called an autograft. Your surgeon will make a small cut over your pelvic bone and remove some bone from the back of the rim of the pelvis.\nA bone bank. This is called an allograft which is bone taken from other people that has been cleaned and preserved.\nAn artificial bone substitute and growth factors.\nThe vertebrae may also be fixed together with rods, screws, plates, or cages."}

It may  be done:\nWith other surgical procedures for\nspinal stenosis\n, such as foraminotomy or laminectomy\nAfter diskectomy in the neck\nSpinal fusion may be done if you have:\nInjury or fractures to the bones in the spine\nWeak or unstable spine caused by infections or tumors\nSpondylolisthesis\n, a condition in which one vertebrae slips forward on top of another\nAbnormal curvatures, such as those from\nscoliosis\nor\nkyphosis\nArthritis in the spine, such as spinal stenosis\nYou and your surgeon can decide when you need to have surgery.\nRisks\nRisks for anesthesia and surgery in general include:\nReactions to medicines,\nbreathing problems\nBleeding,\nblood clots\n, infection\nRisks for this surgery include:\nInfection in the wound or vertebral bones\nDamage to a spinal ner"}
