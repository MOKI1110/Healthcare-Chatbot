The condition can affect children or adults.\nInfants with this problem seem floppy and feel like a \"rag doll\" when held. They rest with their elbows and knees loosely extended. Infants with normal tone tend to have flexed elbows and knees. They may have poor head control. The head may fall to the side, backward, or forward.\nInfants with normal tone can be lifted with the adult's hands placed under the armpits. Hypotonic infants tend to slip between the hands.\nCauses\nMuscle tone and movement involve the brain, spinal cord, nerves, and muscles. Hypotonia may be a sign of a problem anywhere along the pathway that controls muscle movement."}

Geneticists may help diagnose certain disorders. If there are also other medical problems, a number of different specialists will help care for the child.\nWhich diagnostic tests are done depends on the suspected cause of the hypotonia. Most of the conditions associated with hypotonia also cause other symptoms that can help make the diagnosis.\nMany of these disorders require ongoing care and support. Physical therapy may be recommended to help children improve their development.\nAlternative Names\nDecreased muscle tone; Floppy infant\nImages\nHypotonia\nCentral nervous system and peripheral nervous system\nReferences\nBarkoudah E.
