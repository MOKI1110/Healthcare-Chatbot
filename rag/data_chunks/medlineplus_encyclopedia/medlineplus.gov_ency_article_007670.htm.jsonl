Hepatitis A is the most common type of hepatitis in children.\nCauses\nHAV is found in the stool (feces) and blood of an infected child.\nA child can catch hepatitis A by:\nComing in contact with the blood or stool of a person who has the disease.\nEating or drinking food or water that has been contaminated by blood or stools containing the HAV."}

Fruits, vegetables, shellfish, ice, and water are common sources of the disease.\nEating food prepared by someone with the disease who does not wash their hands after using the bathroom.\nBeing lifted or carried by someone with the disease who does not wash their hands after using the bathroom.\nTraveling to another country without being vaccinated for hepatitis A.\nChildren can get hepatitis A at day care center from other children or from child care workers who have the virus and do not practice good hygiene.\nOther common hepatitis virus infections include\nhepatitis B\nand\nhepatitis C\n. Hepatitis A is typically the least serious and mildest of these diseases.\nSymptoms\nMost children age 6 years and younger do not have any symptoms. This means that your child could have the disease, and you may not know it. This can make it easy to spread the disease among young children.\nWhen symptoms occur, they appear about 2 to 6 weeks after infection."}

This can make it easy to spread the disease among young children.\nWhen symptoms occur, they appear about 2 to 6 weeks after infection. The child may have flu-like symptoms, or the symptoms  may be mild. Severe or fulminant hepatitis (liver failure) is rare in healthy children. The symptoms are often easy to manage and include:\nDark urine\nTiredness\nLoss of appetite\nFever\nNausea and vomiting\nPale stools\nAbdominal pain (over the liver)\nYellow skin and eyes (\njaundice\n)\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam of your child. This is done to check for pain and swelling in the liver.\nThe provider will perform a blood test to look for:\nAntibodies (proteins that fight infection) due to HAV\nElevated liver enzymes due to liver damage or inflammation\nTreatment\nThere is no drug treatment for hepatitis A. Your child's immune system will fight the virus. Managing the symptoms can help your child feel better while recovering:\nHave your child rest when symptoms are the worst.\nDO NOT give acetaminophen to your child without first talking with your child's provider."}

It can be toxic because the liver is already weak.\nGive your child fluids in the form of fruit juices or electrolyte solutions, such as Pedialyte. This helps prevent dehydration.\nWhile rare, symptoms may be severe enough that children with HAV need extra fluids through a vein (IV).\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHAV does not remain in a child's body after the infection is gone. As a result, it does not cause a long-term infection in the liver.\nRarely, a new case can cause severe liver failure that develops rapidly.\nPossible Complications\nThe possible complications of hepatitis A in children can be:\nLiver damage\nLiver cirrhosis\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your child's provider if your child has symptoms of hepatitis A.\nAlso contact  the provider  if your child has:\nDry mouth due to loss of fluids\nNo tears while crying\nSwelling in the arms, hands, feet, stomach, or face\nBlood in stools\nPrevention\nYou can protect your child from hepatitis A by having your child vaccinated.\nThe\nhep"}
