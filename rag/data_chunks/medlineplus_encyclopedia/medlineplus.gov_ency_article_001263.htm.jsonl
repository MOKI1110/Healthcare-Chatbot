Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nKnock knees\nKnock knees\nKnock knees are a condition in which the knees touch, but the ankles do not touch. The legs turn inward.\nCauses\nInfants start out with bowlegs because of their folded position while in their mother's womb. The legs begin to straighten once the child starts to walk (at about 12 to 18 months). By age 3, the child becomes knock-kneed. When the child stands, the knees touch but the ankles are apart.\nBy puberty, the legs straighten out and most children can stand with the knees and ankles touching (without forcing the position).\nKnock knees can also develop as a result of a medical problem or disease, such as:\nInjury of the shinbone (only one leg will be knock-kneed)\nOsteomyelitis\n(bone infection)\nOverweight or obesity\nRickets\n(a disease caused by a lack of vitamin D)\nExams and Tests\nA health care provider will examine your child. Tests will be done if there are signs that knock knees are not a part of normal development.\nTreatment\nKnock knees are not treated in most cases.\nIf the problem continues after age 7, the child may use a night brace."}
