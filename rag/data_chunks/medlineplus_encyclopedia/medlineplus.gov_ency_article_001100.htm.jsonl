These changes lead to extra or skipped heartbeats. There is often not a clear cause for these changes. They are common.\nThe two most common types of ectopic heartbeats are:\nPremature ventricular contractions (PVC)\nPremature atrial contractions (PAC)\nCauses\nEctopic heartbeats are sometimes seen with:\nChanges in the blood, such as a low potassium level (\nhypokalemia\n)\nDecrease in blood supply to the heart\nWhen the heart is enlarged\nor structurally abnormal\nEctopic beats may be caused or made worse by smoking,\nalcohol use\n,\ncaffeine\n, stimulant medicines, and some street drugs.\nEctopic heartbeats are rare in children without heart disease that was present at birth (congenital). Most extra heartbeats in children are PACs. These are often benign.\nIn adults, ectopic heartbeats are common. They are most often due to PACs or PVCs. Your health care provider should look into the cause when they are frequent."}
