Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRadiation sickness\nRadiation sickness\nRadiation sickness is illness and symptoms resulting from excessive exposure to ionizing radiation.\nThere are two main types of radiation: nonionizing and ionizing.\nNonionizing radiation comes in the form of light, radio waves, microwaves, and radar. These forms usually don't cause tissue damage.\nIonizing radiation causes immediate effects on human tissue. X-rays, gamma rays, and particle bombardment (neutron beam, electron beam, protons, mesons, and others) give off ionizing radiation. This type of radiation is used for medical testing and treatment. It is also used in industrial and manufacturing purposes, weapons and weapons development, and more.\nConsiderations\nRadiation sickness results when humans (or other animals) are exposed to very large doses of ionizing radiation.\nRadiation exposure can occur as a single large exposure (\nacute\n). Or it can occur as a series of small exposures spread over time (\nchronic\n)."}

Or it can occur as a series of small exposures spread over time (\nchronic\n). Exposure may be accidental or intentional (as in\nradiation therapy\nfor disease treatment).\nRadiation sickness is generally associated with acute exposure and has a characteristic set of symptoms that appear in an orderly fashion. Chronic exposure is usually associated with delayed medical problems such as cancer and premature aging, which may happen over a long period of time.\nThe risk for cancer depends on the dose and begins to build up, even with very low doses. There is no \"minimum threshold.\" On average, Americans receive a radiation dose of about 0.62 rem (620 millirem) each year."}

There is no \"minimum threshold.\" On average, Americans receive a radiation dose of about 0.62 rem (620 millirem) each year. Half of this dose comes from natural background radiation.\nExposure from x-rays or gamma rays is measured in units of roentgens or millisieverts ( mSv):\n10 millisieverts equal 1 roentgen, (abbreviated rad or simply R).\nA single chest x-ray exposes the patient to about 0.1 mSv, or 0.01 rad.\nA CT scan of the abdomen (belly) and pelvis exposes a person to about 10 mSv, or 1 rad.\nTotal body exposure of 50 to100 roentgens/rad or 0.5 to1 Gray unit (Gy), equal to 500 to1,000 mSv causes radiation sickness.\nTotal body exposure of 400 roentgens/rad (or 4 Gy) causes radiation sickness and death in half of the individuals who are exposed."}

Without medical treatment, nearly everyone who receives more than this amount of radiation will die within 30 days.\n100,000 roentgens/rad (1,000 Gy) causes almost immediate unconsciousness and death within an hour.\nThe severity of symptoms and illness (acute radiation sickness) depends on the type and amount of radiation, how long you were exposed, and which part of the body was exposed. Symptoms of radiation sickness may occur right after exposure, or over the next few days, weeks, or months. Bone marrow and the gastrointestinal tract are especially sensitive to radiation injury. Children and babies still in the womb are more likely to be severely injured by radiation.\nBecause it is difficult to determine the amount of radiation exposure from nuclear accidents, the best signs of the severity of the exposure are: the length of time between the exposure and the onset of symptoms, the severity of symptoms, and severity of changes in white blood cells."}

If a person vomits less than an hour after being exposed, that usually means the radiation dose received is very high and death may be expected.\nChildren who receive radiation treatments or who are accidentally exposed to radiation will be treated based on their symptoms and their blood cell counts. Frequent blood studies are necessary and require a small puncture through the skin into a vein to obtain blood samples.\nCauses\nCauses include:\nAccidental exposure to high doses of radiation, such as radiation from a nuclear power plant accident.\nExposure to excessive radiation for medical treatments.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of radiation sickness may include:\nWeakness, fatigue, fainting, confusion\nBleeding from the nose\n, mouth, gums, and rectum\nBruising, skin burns, open sores on the skin, sloughing of skin\nDehydration\nDiarrhea, bloody stool\nFever\nHair loss\nInflammation of exposed areas (redness, tenderness, swelling, bleeding)\nNausea and vomiting, including vomiting of blood\nUlcers (sores) in th"}
