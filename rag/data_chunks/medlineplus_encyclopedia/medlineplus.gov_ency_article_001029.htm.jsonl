Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRetinitis pigmentosa\nRetinitis pigmentosa\nRetinitis pigmentosa is an eye disease in which there is damage to the\nretina\n. The retina is the layer of tissue at the back of the inner eye. This layer converts light images to nerve signals and sends them to the brain.\nCauses\nRetinitis pigmentosa can run in families. The disorder can be caused by several genetic defects.\nThe cells controlling night vision (rods) are most likely to be affected. However, in some cases, retinal cone cells are damaged the most. The main sign of the disease is the presence of dark deposits in the retina.\nThe main risk factor is a family history of retinitis pigmentosa. It is a rare condition affecting about 1 in 4,000 people in the United States.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms often first appear in childhood. However, severe vision problems do not often develop before early adulthood.\nDecreased vision at night or in low light."}

Early signs may include having a harder time moving around in the dark.\nLoss of side (peripheral) vision, causing \"tunnel vision.\"\nLoss of\ncentral\nvision (in advanced cases). This will affect the ability to read.\nLoss of color vision\nSensitivity to bright light\nExams and Tests\nTests to evaluate the retina:\nColor vision\nExam of the retina by\nophthalmoscopy\nafter the pupils have been dilated\nFluorescein angiography\nIntraocular pressure\nMeasurement of the electrical activity in the retina (\nelectroretinogram\n)\nPupil reflex response\nRefraction test\nRetinal photography\nSide vision test (visual field test)\nSlit lamp examination\nVisual acuity\nTreatment\nThere is no effective treatment for this condition. Wearing sunglasses to protect the retina from ultraviolet light may help preserve vision.\nSome studies suggest that treatment with antioxidants (such as high doses of vitamin A palmitate) may slow the disease. However, taking high doses of vitamin A can cause serious liver problems."}

However, taking high doses of vitamin A can cause serious liver problems. The benefit of treatment has to be weighed against risks to the liver.\nClinical trials are in progress to assess new treatments for retinitis pigmentosa, including the:\nUse of DHA, which is an omega-3 fatty acid.\nTreatments related to the possible genetic causes of this disorder\nOther treatments, such as microchip implants into the retina that act like a microscopic video camera, are in the early stages of development. These treatments may be useful for treating blindness associated with RP and other serious eye conditions.\nA vision specialist can help you adapt to vision loss. Make regular visits to an eye care specialist, who can detect\ncataracts\nor retinal swelling. Both of these problems can be treated.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe disorder will continue to progress slowly. Complete blindness is uncommon.\nPossible Complications\nPeripheral and central\nloss of vision\nwill occur over time.\nPeople with retinitis pigmentosa often develop cataracts at an early age."}
