Anti-GBM disease used to be known as Goodpasture syndrome.\nCauses\nAnti-GBM disease is an\nautoimmune disorder\n. It occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. People with this syndrome develop substances that attack a protein called collagen in the tiny air sacs in the lungs and the filtering units (glomeruli) of the kidneys.\nThese substances are called antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies. The glomerular basement membrane is a part of the kidneys that helps filter waste and extra fluid from the blood. Antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies are\nantibodies\nagainst this membrane."}

The glomerular basement membrane is a part of the kidneys that helps filter waste and extra fluid from the blood. Antiglomerular basement membrane antibodies are\nantibodies\nagainst this membrane. They can damage the basement membrane, which can lead to kidney damage.\nSometimes, this disorder is triggered by a viral respiratory infection or by breathing in hydrocarbon solvents. In such cases, the immune system may attack organs or tissues because it mistakes them for these viruses or foreign chemicals.\nThe immune system's faulty response causes bleeding in the air sacs of the lungs and inflammation in the kidney's filtering units.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may occur very slowly over months or even years, but they often develop very quickly over days to weeks.\nLoss of appetite, fatigue, and\nweakness\nare common early symptoms.\nLung symptoms may include:\nCoughing up blood\nDry\ncough\nShortness of breath\nKidney and other symptoms include:\nBloody urine\nBurning sensation when urinating\nNausea and vomiting\nPale skin\nSwelling (edema) in any area of the body, especially in the legs\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam may reveal\nhigh blood pressure\nand signs of fluid overload."}
