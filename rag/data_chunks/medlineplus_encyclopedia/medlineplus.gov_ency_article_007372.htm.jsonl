This is a weak area in a blood vessel wall that causes the vessel to bulge or balloon out and sometimes burst (rupture). It may cause:\nBleeding into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) around the brain (also called a\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage\n)\nBleeding into the brain that forms a collection of blood (intracerebral hemorrhage with hematoma)\nMass effect on nerves\nDescription\nThere are two common methods used to repair an aneurysm:\nClipping is done during an\nopen craniotomy\n.\nEndovascular repair (surgery), most often using a coil or coiling and stenting (mesh tubes), is a less invasive and more common way to treat aneurysms.\nDuring aneurysm clipping:\nYou are given\ngeneral anesthesia\nand a breathing tube.\nYour scalp, skull, and the coverings of the brain are opened.\nYour brain is gently retracted to reach the aneurysm.\nA metal clip is placed at the base (neck) of the aneurysm to prevent it from breaking open (bursting).\nDuring endovascular repa"}

Or, you may be given medicine to relax you, but not enough to put you to sleep.\nA catheter is guided through a small cut in your groin into and through the femoral artery and then guided through your arteries until it reaches the artery in your brain where the aneurysm is located.\nContrast material is injected through the catheter. This allows the surgeon to view the arteries and the aneurysm on a monitor in the operating room.\nThin metal wires are put into the aneurysm. They then coil into a mesh ball. For this reason, the procedure is also called coiling. Blood clots that form around this coil prevent the aneurysm from breaking open and bleeding. Sometimes stents (mesh tubes) are also put in to hold the coils in place and make sure the blood vessel stays open.\nDuring and right after the procedure, you may be given a blood thinner, such as heparin, clopidogrel, or aspirin."}

These medicines prevent dangerous blood clots from forming in the stent.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nIf an aneurysm in the brain breaks open (ruptures), it is an emergency that needs medical treatment in a hospital. Often a rupture is treated with surgery, especially endovascular surgery.\nA person may have an unruptured aneurysm without any symptoms. This kind of aneurysm may be found when an\nMRI\nor\nCT scan\nof the brain is done for another reason.\nNot all aneurysms need to be treated right away. Aneurysms that have never bled, especially if they are very small (less than 3 millimeters or 0.12 inch at their largest point), do not need to be treated right away. These very small aneurysms are less likely to rupture.\nYour surgeon will help you decide whether it is safer to have surgery to block off the aneurysm before it can break open or to monitor the aneurysm with repeated imaging until surgery becomes necessary."}
