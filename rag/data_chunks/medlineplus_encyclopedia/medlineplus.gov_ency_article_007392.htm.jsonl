This is called an\naneurysm\n. The aorta is the large artery that carries blood from your heart to your belly (abdomen), pelvis, and legs.\nAn\naortic aneurysm\nis when part of this artery becomes too large or balloons outward.\nDescription\nThe surgery will take place in an operating room. You will be given\ngeneral anesthesia\n(you will be asleep and pain-free).\nYour surgeon opens up your belly and replaces the aortic aneurysm with a man-made, cloth-like material.\nHere is how it can be done:\nIn one approach, you will lie on your back. The surgeon will make a cut in the middle of your belly, from just below the breastbone to below the belly button. Rarely, the cut goes across the belly.\nIn another approach, you will lie slightly tilted on your right side."}

Rarely, the cut goes across the belly.\nIn another approach, you will lie slightly tilted on your right side. The surgeon will make a 5- to 6-inch (13 to 15 centimeters) cut from the left side of your belly, ending a little below your belly button.\nYour surgeon will replace the aneurysm with a long tube made of man-made (synthetic) cloth. It is sewn in with stitches.\nIn some cases, the ends of this tube (or graft) will be moved through blood vessels in each groin and attached to those in the leg.\nOnce the surgery is done, your legs will be examined to make sure that there is a pulse. Most often a dye test using x-rays is done to confirm that there is good blood flow to the legs.\nThe cut is closed with sutures or staples.\nSurgery for aortic aneurysm replacement may take 2 to 4 hours. Most people recover in the intensive care unit (ICU) after the surgery.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nOpen surgery to repair an AAA is sometimes done as an emergency procedure when there is bleeding inside your body from the aneurysm.\nYou may have an AAA that is not causing any symptoms or problems."}

There is a risk that this aneurysm may suddenly break open (rupture) if you do not have surgery to repair it.
