Why get vaccinated?\nRotavirus vaccine\ncan prevent\nrotavirus disease\n.\nRotavirus commonly causes severe, watery diarrhea, mostly in babies and young children. Vomiting and fever are also common in babies with rotavirus. Children may become dehydrated and need to be hospitalized and can even die.\n2. Rotavirus vaccine\nRotavirus vaccine is administered by putting drops in the child's mouth. Babies should get 2 or 3 doses of rotavirus vaccine, depending on the brand of vaccine used.\nThe first dose must be administered before 15 weeks of age.\nThe last dose must be administered by 8 months of age.\nAlmost all babies who get rotavirus vaccine will be protected from severe rotavirus diarrhea.\nAnother virus called \"porcine circovirus\" can be found in one brand of rotavirus vaccine (Rotarix)."}

This virus does not infect people, and there is no known safety risk.\nRotavirus vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines.\n3. Talk with your health care provider\nTell your vaccination provider if the person getting the vaccine:\nHas had an\nallergic reaction after a previous dose of rotavirus vaccine\n, or has any\nsevere, life-threatening allergies.\nHas a\nweakened immune system.\nHas\nsevere combined immunodeficiency\n(SCID).\nHas had a type of bowel blockage called \"\nintussusception\"\n.\nIn some cases, your child's health care provider may decide to postpone rotavirus vaccination until a future visit.\nInfants with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. Infants who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting rotavirus vaccine.\nYour child's health care provider can give you more information.\n4."}

Infants who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting rotavirus vaccine.\nYour child's health care provider can give you more information.\n4. Risks of a vaccine reaction\nIrritability or mild, temporary diarrhea or vomiting can happen after rotavirus vaccine.\nIntussusception is a type of bowel blockage that is treated in a hospital and could require surgery. It happens naturally in some infants every year in the United States, and usually there is no known reason for it. There is also a small risk of intussusception from rotavirus vaccination, usually within a week after the first or second vaccine dose. This additional risk is estimated to range from about 1 in 20,000 U.S. infants to 1 in 100,000 U.S. infants who get rotavirus vaccine. Your health care provider can give you more information.\nAs with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction, other serious injury, or death.\n5. What if there is a serious problem?\nFor intussusception, look for signs of stomach pain along with severe crying."}

What if there is a serious problem?\nFor intussusception, look for signs of stomach pain along with severe crying. Early on, these episodes could last just a few minutes and come and go several times in an hour. Babies might pull their legs up to their chest. Your baby might also vomit several times or have blood in the stool, or could appear weak or very irritable. These signs would usually happen during the first week after the first or second dose of rotavirus vaccine, but look for them any time after vaccination. If you think your baby has intussusception, contact a health care provider right away. If you can't reach your health care provider, take your baby to a hospital. Tell them when your baby got rotavirus vaccine.\nAn allergic reaction could occur after the vaccinated person leaves the clinic."}

Your health care provider will usually file this report, or you can do it yourself.
