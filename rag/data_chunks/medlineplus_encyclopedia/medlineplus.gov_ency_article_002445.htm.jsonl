It is a\ncentral nervous system\nstimulant and a diuretic (substance that helps rid your body of fluids).\nFunction\nCaffeine is absorbed and passes quickly into the brain. It does not collect in the bloodstream or get stored in the body. It leaves the body in the urine many hours after it has been consumed.\nThere is no nutritional need for caffeine. It can be avoided in the diet.\nCaffeine stimulates, or excites, the brain and nervous system. It will not reduce the effects of alcohol, although many people still erroneously believe a cup of coffee will help a person \"sober-up\".\nCaffeine may be used for the short-term relief of fatigue or\ndrowsiness\n.\nFood Sources\nCaffeine is widely consumed."}
