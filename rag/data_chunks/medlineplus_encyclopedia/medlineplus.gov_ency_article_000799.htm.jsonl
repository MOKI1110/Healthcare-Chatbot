There are three types of TBI:\nMild TBI, also called a concussion\nModerate TBI\nSevere TBI\nA TBI can affect how the brain works. The degree of impaired brain function and other symptoms and how long they will last depends on how severe the TBI is. A TBI may lead to headaches, changes in alertness,\nloss of consciousness\n, memory loss, and changes in thinking. Moderate to severe TBIs can cause life-long health problems.\nCauses\nTBIs can be caused by:\nFalls\nSports injuries\nVehicular accidents\nAssaults\nPenetrating injuries to the skull, such as from a gunshot or other trauma can cause moderate to severe TBIs.\nA big movement of the brain (called jarring) in any direction can cause a person to lose alertness (become unconscious)."}

Some symptoms may not occur right away and show up a few days or weeks later.\nSymptoms of a milder TBI or concussion can include:\nActing somewhat confused, feeling unable to concentrate, or not thinking clearly\nBeing drowsy, hard to wake up, or similar changes\nHeadache\nLoss of consciousness\nfor a fairly short period of time\nMemory loss (\namnesia\n) of events before the injury or right after\nNausea and vomiting\nSeeing flashing lights, light sensitivity\nFeeling like you have \"lost time\"\nSleep abnormalities\nMild TBIs do not always lead to loss of consciousness.
