The clean-catch method is used to prevent germs from the penis or vagina from getting into a urine sample. To collect your urine, your health care provider may give you a special clean-catch kit that contains a cleansing solution and sterile wipes. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination, which should cause no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nMyoglobin is a protein in heart and skeletal muscles. When you exercise, your muscles use up available oxygen. Myoglobin has oxygen attached to it, which provides extra oxygen for the muscles to keep up a high level of activity for a longer period.\nWhen muscle is damaged, myoglobin in muscle cells is released into the bloodstream. The kidneys help remove myoglobin from the blood into the urine."}

When the level of myoglobin is too high, it can damage the kidneys.\nThis test is ordered when your provider suspects you have muscle damage, such as damage to  the heart or skeletal muscle. It may also be ordered if you have\nacute kidney failure\nwithout any clear cause.\nNormal Results\nA normal urine sample does not have myoglobin. A normal result is sometimes reported as negative.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs."}
