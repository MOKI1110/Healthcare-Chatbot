Each type of dysplasia is caused by specific mutations in certain genes. Dysplasia means abnormal development of cells or tissues. The most common form of ectodermal dysplasia usually affects men. Other forms of the disease affect men and women equally.\nSymptoms\nPeople with ectodermal dysplasia have a lack of sweat glands. This means they may not sweat or sweat less than normal.\nIn children with the disease, their bodies may have a problem controlling fevers. When the skin cannot sweat, it is hard for the body to control temperature properly. So even a mild illness can cause a very high fever.\nAdults with the disease can't tolerate a warm environment."}

Instead, symptoms are treated as needed.\nThings you can do may include:\nWear a wig and dentures to feel more comfortable about appearance.\nUse artificial tears to prevent dry eyes.\nUse saline nose spray to remove debris and prevent infection.\nTake cooling water baths or use water sprays to keep a normal body temperature. Water evaporating from the skin replaces the cooling function of sweat evaporating from the skin.\nSupport Groups\nThese resources can provide more information on ectodermal dysplasias:\nNational Foundation for Ectodermal Dysplasias --\nwww.nfed.org\nNIH Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center --\nrarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6317/ectodermal-dysplasia\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf you have a common variant of ectodermal dysplasia, this will not shorten your lifespan."}

However, you may need to pay attention to temperature changes and other problems associated with this condition.\nPossible Complications\nIf untreated, health problems from this condition may include:\nBrain damage caused by increased body temperature\nSeizures caused by high fever (\nfebrile seizures\n)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if your child shows symptoms of this disorder.\nPrevention\nIf you have a family history of ectodermal dysplasia, and you are planning to have children, genetic counseling is recommended. Often, it is possible to diagnose ectodermal dysplasia while the baby is still in the womb.\nAlternative Names\nAnhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia; Christ-Siemens-Touraine syndrome; Anondontia; Incontinentia pigmenti\nImages\nSkin layers\nReferences\nAbidi NY, Martin KL.
