If you are alone and you are choking, you can try to dislodge the thing in your throat or windpipe by performing the Heimlich maneuver on yourself.\nSelf-administered abdominal thrusts is also a clear signal to rescuers that a person is choking.\nInformation\nWhen you are choking, your airway may be blocked so that not enough oxygen reaches the lungs. Without oxygen, brain damage can occur in as little as 4 to 6 minutes. Rapid first aid for choking can save your life.\nIf you are choking on something, you can perform the Heimlich maneuver on yourself. Follow these steps:\nMake a fist with  one hand. Place the thumb of that hand below your rib cage and above your navel.\nGrasp your fist with your other hand. Press your fist forcibly into the upper abdominal area with a quick upward movement.\nYou can also lean over a table edge, chair, or railing."}

Quickly thrust your upper belly area (upper abdomen) against the edge, using gravity to assist you.\nResearchers in one small study found that self-administered thrusts over the back of a chair generated greater pressures than self-administered conventional Heimlich maneuver, and as most food is consumed seated, there is likely to be a chair nearby when choking occurs.\nIf you need to, repeat this motion until the object blocking your airway comes out.\nChoking first aid\nis a related topic.\nImages\nHeimlich maneuver on oneself\nReferences\nBraithwaite SA, Wessel AL.
