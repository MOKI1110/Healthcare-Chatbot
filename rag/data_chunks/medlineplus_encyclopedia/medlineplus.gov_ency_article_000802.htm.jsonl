It may have more than one cause.\nMany people with narcolepsy have a low level of hypocretin (also known as orexin). This is a chemical made in the brain that helps you stay awake. In some people with narcolepsy, there are fewer of the cells that make this chemical. This may be due to an\nautoimmune\nreaction. An autoimmune reaction is when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the body's healthy tissue.\nNarcolepsy can run in families. Researchers have found certain genes linked to narcolepsy.\nSymptoms\nNarcolepsy symptoms usually first occur between age 15 and 30 years. Below are the most common symptoms.\nEXTREME DAYTIME SLEEPINESS\nYou may feel a strong urge to sleep, often followed by a period of sleep. You can't control when you fall asleep."}

Below are the most common symptoms.\nEXTREME DAYTIME SLEEPINESS\nYou may feel a strong urge to sleep, often followed by a period of sleep. You can't control when you fall asleep. This is called a sleep attack.\nThese periods can last from a few seconds to a few minutes.\nThey may happen after eating, while talking to someone, or during other situations.\nMost often, you wake up feeling refreshed.\nAttacks can occur while you are driving or doing other activities where falling asleep can be dangerous.\nCATAPLEXY\nDuring these attacks, you can't control your muscles and can't move. Strong emotions, such as laughter or anger, can trigger cataplexy.\nAttacks often last from 30 seconds to 2 minutes."}

Strong emotions, such as laughter or anger, can trigger cataplexy.\nAttacks often last from 30 seconds to 2 minutes. You remain aware during the attack.\nDuring the attack, your head falls forward, your jaw drops, and your knees may buckle.\nIn severe cases, you may fall and stay paralyzed for as long as several minutes.\nHALLUCINATIONS\nYou see or hear things that aren't there, either as you fall asleep or when you wake up.\nDuring\nhallucinations\n, you may feel afraid or under attack.\nSLEEP PARALYSIS\nThis is when you can't move your body as you start falling asleep or when you first wake up.\nIt may last up to 15 minutes.\nMost people with narcolepsy have daytime sleepiness and cataplexy. Not everyone has all these symptoms."}

Not everyone has all these symptoms. Surprisingly, despite being very tired, many people with narcolepsy don't sleep well at night.\nThere are two main types of narcolepsy:\nType 1 involves having excessive daytime sleepiness, cataplexy, and a low level of hypocretin.\nType 2 involves having excessive daytime sleepiness, but no cataplexy, and a normal level of hypocretin.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will do a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.\nYou may have a blood test to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms. These include:\nInsomnia and other\nsleep disorders\nRestless legs syndrome\nSeizures\nSleep apnea\nOther medical, psychiatric, or nervous system diseases\nYou may have other tests, including:\nECG\n(measures the electrical activity of your heart).\nEEG\n(measures the electrical activity of your brain).\nSleep study\n(polysomnogram).\nMultiple sleep latency test (MSLT). This is a test to see how long it takes you to fall asleep during a daytime nap."}

However, treatment can help control symptoms.\nLIFESTYLE CHANGES\nCertain changes can help improve your sleep at night and ease daytime sleepiness:\nGo to bed and wake up at the same time every day.\nKeep your bedroom dark and at a comfortable temperature. Make sure your bed and pillows are comfortable.\nAvoid caffeine, alcohol, and heavy meals several hours before bedtime.\nDon't smoke.\nDo something relaxing, such as take a warm bath or read a book before going to sleep.\nGet regular exercise every day, which can help you sleep at night. Be sure you do your exercise several hours before bedtime.\nThese tips can help you do better at work and in social situations.\nPlan naps during the day when you typically feel tired."}

This helps control daytime sleepiness and reduces the number of unplanned sleep attacks.\nTell teachers, work supervisors, and friends about your condition. You may want to print out material from the web about narcolepsy for them to read.\nGet counseling, if needed, to help you cope with the condition. Having narcolepsy can be stressful.\nIf you have narcolepsy, you may have driving restrictions. Restrictions vary from state to state. Your provider may recommend that you avoid driving or other activities, depending on how well your symptoms are controlled.\nMEDICINES\nStimulant medicines can help you stay awake during the day.\nAntidepressant medicines can help reduce episodes of cataplexy, sleep paralysis, and hallucinations.\nSodium oxybate (Xyrem) works well to control cataplexy. It can also help control daytime sleepiness.\nThese drugs may have side effects."}

Treating other underlying sleep disorders can improve narcolepsy symptoms.\nPossible Complications\nExcessive sleepiness due to narcolepsy may lead to:\nTrouble functioning at work\nTrouble being in social situations\nInjuries and accidents\nSide effects of medicines used to treat the disorder may occur\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nYou have symptoms of narcolepsy\nNarcolepsy does not respond to treatment\nYou develop new symptoms\nPrevention\nYou can't prevent narcolepsy.
