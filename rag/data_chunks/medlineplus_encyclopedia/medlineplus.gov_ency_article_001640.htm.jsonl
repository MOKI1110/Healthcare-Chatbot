Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTongue tie\nTongue tie\nTongue tie is when the bottom of the tongue is attached to the floor of the mouth.\nThis may make it hard for the tip of the tongue to move freely.\nCauses\nThe tongue is connected to the bottom of the mouth by a band of tissue called the lingual frenulum. In people with tongue tie, this band is overly short and thick. The exact cause of tongue tie is not known. Your\ngenes\nmay play a role. The problem tends to run in some families.\nSymptoms\nIn a newborn or infant, the symptoms of tongue tie are similar to the symptoms in a child who is having problems with\nbreastfeeding\n. Symptoms may include:\nActing irritable or fussy, even after feeding.\nDifficulty creating or keeping suction on the nipple. The infant may become tired in 1 or 2 minutes, or fall asleep before eating enough.\nPoor weight gain or weight loss.\nProblems latching onto the nipple."}

The infant may just chew on the nipple instead.\nThere may be speech and pronunciation difficulties in older children.\nThe breastfeeding mother may have problems with breast pain, plugged milk ducts, or painful breasts, and may feel frustrated.\nExams and Tests\nMost experts do not recommend that health care providers examine newborns for tongue tie unless there are breastfeeding problems.\nMost providers only consider tongue tie when:\nThe mother and baby have had problems starting breastfeeding.\nThe mother has received at least 2 to 3 days of support from a breastfeeding (lactation) specialist.\nTreatment\nMost breastfeeding problems can be managed easily. A person who specializes in breastfeeding (lactation consultant) can help with breastfeeding issues.\nTongue tie surgery, called a frenulotomy, is rarely needed. The surgery involves cutting and releasing the tethered frenulum under the tongue. It is most often done in the surgeon's office."}

A surgical procedure called a z-plasty closure may be needed to prevent scar tissue from forming.\nPossible Complications\nOn rare occasions, tongue tie has been linked to problems with tooth development, swallowing, or speech.\nAlternative Names\nAnkyloglossia\nReferences\nDhar V.
