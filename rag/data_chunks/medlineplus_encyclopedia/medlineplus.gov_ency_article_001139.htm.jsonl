It can cause discomfort, bleeding, and the discharge of mucus or pus.\nCauses\nThere are many causes of proctitis. They can be grouped as follows:\nInflammatory bowel disease\nAutoimmune disease\nHarmful substances\nNon-sexually transmitted infection\nSexually transmitted disease (STD)\nProctitis caused by an STD is common in people who have anal intercourse.
