Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMetachromatic leukodystrophy\nMetachromatic leukodystrophy\nMetachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is a genetic disorder that affects nerves, muscles, other organs, and behavior. It slowly gets worse over time.\nCauses\nMLD is usually caused by the lack of an important\nenzyme\ncalled arylsulfatase A (ARSA). Because this enzyme is missing, chemicals called sulfatides build up in the body and damage the nervous system, kidneys, gallbladder, and other organs. In particular, the chemicals damage the protective sheaths that surround nerve cells.\nThe disease is passed down through families (inherited). You must get a copy of the variant gene from both of your parents to have the disease. Parents can each have one copy of the variant gene, but not have MLD. A person with one variant gene is called a carrier.\nChildren who inherit only one variant gene from one parent will be a carrier, but usually will not develop MLD. When two carriers have a child, there is a 1 in 4 chance that the child will get both genes and have MLD.\nThere are three forms of MLD."}

The forms are based on when the symptoms begin:\nLate infantile MLD symptoms usually begin by ages 1 to 2.\nJuvenile MLD symptoms usually begin between ages 4 and 12.\nAdult (and late-stage juvenile MLD) symptoms may occur between age 14 and adulthood (over age 16), but may begin as late as the 40s or 50s.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of MLD may include any of the following:\nAbnormally high or decreased muscle tone, or abnormal muscle movements, any of which may cause problems walking or frequent falls\nBehavior problems, personality changes,\nirritability\nDecreased mental function\nDifficulty swallowing\nInability to perform normal tasks\nIncontinence\nPoor school performance\nSeizures\nSpeech difficulties, slurring\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam, focusing on the nervous system symptoms.\nTests that may be done include:\nBlood or skin culture to look for low arylsulfatase A activity\nBlood test to look for low arylsulfatase A enzyme levels\nDNA testing for the ARSA gene"}
