This area is the heart's pacemaker. It is called the sinoatrial node, sinus node or SA node. Its role is to keep the heart beat steady and regular.\nSick sinus syndrome is a group of heart rhythm problems due to problems with the sinus node, such as:\nThe heartbeat rate is too slow, called sinus bradycardia\nThe heartbeat pauses or stops, called sinus pauses or sinus arrest\nEpisodes of a fast\nheart rate\nSlow heart rhythms that alternate with fast heart rhythms, called bradycardia-tachycardia or \"tachy-brady syndrome\"\nCauses\nSick sinus syndrome most often occurs in people older than age 50. It is often due to scar-like damage to electrical pathways in the heart muscle tissue.\nIn children, heart surgery on the upper chambers is a common cause of sick sinus syndrome.\nCoronary heart disease\n, high blood pressure, and aortic and mitral valve diseases may occur with sick sinus syndrome."}

However, these diseases may have nothing to do with the syndrome.\nSick sinus syndrome is uncommon, but not rare. It is the most common reason people need to have an artificial pacemaker implanted. Sinus bradycardia occurs more often than the other types of the condition.\nTachycardias (rapid heart rhythms) that start in the upper chambers of the heart may be part of the syndrome. These include atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and atrial tachycardia. A period of fast heart rates is often followed by very slow heart rates. When there are periods of both slow and fast heart rates (rhythms) the condition often will be called tachy-brady syndrome.\nSome medicines can make abnormal heart rhythms worse, especially when doses are high."}

These include digitalis, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, and antiarrhythmics.\nSymptoms\nMost of the time, there are no symptoms.\nSymptoms that do occur may mimic those of other disorders.\nSymptoms may include:\nChest pain\nor\nangina\nConfusion\nor other changes in mental status\nFainting\nor near-fainting\nFatigue\nDizziness\nor lightheadedness\nSensation of feeling the heart beat (\npalpitations\n)\nShortness of breath\n, possibly only with physical activity like walking\nExams and Tests\nThe\nheart rate\nmay be very slow at any time. Blood pressure may be normal or low.\nSick sinus syndrome may cause symptoms of\nheart failure\nto start or get worse. Sick sinus syndrome is diagnosed when the symptoms occur only during episodes of arrhythmia. However, the link is often hard to prove.\nAn\nelectrocardiogram\n(ECG) may show abnormal heart rhythms related to this syndrome.\nHolter or longer term rhythm monitors are effective tools for diagnosing sick sinus syndrome."}

Types of monitors include event monitors, loop recorders, and mobile telemetry.\nAn\nintracardiac electrophysiology study\n(EPS) is a very specific test for this disorder. However, it is not often needed and may not confirm the diagnosis.\nIn some cases, a person's heart rate is observed when walking or exercising to see if it increases enough.\nTreatment\nYou may not need treatment if you do not have any symptoms. Your health care provider will review the medicines you take to make sure they are not making your condition worse. Do not stop taking any of your medicines unless your provider tells you to do so.\nYou may need a permanent implanted pacemaker if your symptoms are related to bradycardia (slow heart rate).\nA fast heart rate (tachycardia) may be treated with medicine."}

Sometimes, a procedure called radiofrequency ablation is used to cure tachycardia.\nIn some cases, medicines used to control periods of fast heart rate are combined with use of a pacemaker, which guards against periods of slow heart rate.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe syndrome is most often progressive. This means it gets worse over time in most cases.\nThe long-term outlook is excellent for people who have a permanent pacemaker implanted.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nAngina\nDecreased exercised capacity\nFainting (syncope)\nFalls or injury caused by fainting\nHeart failure\nPoor heart pumping\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have:\nLightheadedness\nFainting\nPalpitations\nOther symptoms of the condition\nPrevention\nKeeping your heart healthy by eating a well-balanced diet and exercising can prevent many types of heart disease.\nYou may need to avoid some types of medicines."}
