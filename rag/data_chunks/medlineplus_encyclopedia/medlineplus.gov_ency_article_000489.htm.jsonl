It is a serious complication that can lead to death.\nCauses\nHepatorenal syndrome occurs when the kidneys stop working well in people with serious liver problems. Less urine is produced by the body, so waste products that contain nitrogen build up in the bloodstream (\nazotemia\n).\nThe disorder occurs in up to 1 in 10 people who are in the hospital with liver failure."}
