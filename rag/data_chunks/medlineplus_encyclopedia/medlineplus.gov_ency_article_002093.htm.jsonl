Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFood guide plate\nFood guide plate\nBy following the US Department of Agriculture's food guide, called MyPlate, you can make healthier food choices. The newest guide encourages you to eat more fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy. Using the guide, you can learn what type of food you should eat and how much you should eat. You also learn why and how much you should exercise.\nInformation\nUSING MyPlate\nThere are 5 major food groups that make up a healthy diet:\nGrains\nVegetables\nFruits\nDairy\nProtein\nYou should eat foods from each group every day. How much food you should eat from each group depends on your age, sex, and how active you are.\nMyPlate\nmakes specific recommendations for each type of food group.\nGRAINS: MAKE AT LEAST HALF OF YOUR GRAINS WHOLE GRAINS\nWhole grains contain the entire grain. Refined grains have had the bran and germ removed."}

Refined grains have had the bran and germ removed. Be sure to read the ingredient list label and look for whole grains first on the list.\nFoods with whole grains have more fiber and protein than food made with refined grains.\nExamples of whole grains are breads and pastas made with whole-wheat flour, oatmeal, bulgur, faro, or cornmeal.\nExamples of refined grains are white flour, white bread, and white rice.\nMost children and adults should eat about 5 to 8 servings of grains a day (also called \"ounce equivalents\"). Children age 8 and younger need only about 3 to 5 servings. At least half those servings should be whole grain. Examples of one serving of grains include:\n1 slice of bread\n1 cup (30 grams) of flake cereal\n1/2 cup (165 grams) cooked rice\n5 whole-wheat crackers\n1/2 cup (75 grams) cooked pasta\nEating whole grains can help improve your health by:\nReducing the risk for many long-term (chronic) diseases.\nHelping you lose weight. Remember that portion size is still the key."}

Remember that portion size is still the key. Because whole grains have more fiber and protein, they are more filling than refined grains, so you can eat less to get the same feeling of being full. But if you replace vegetables with starches, you'll gain weight, even if you eat whole grain.\nPromoting regular bowel movements.\nWays to eat more whole grains:\nEat brown rice instead of white rice.\nUse whole-grain pasta instead of regular pasta.\nReplace part of white flour with wheat flour in recipes.\nReplace white bread with whole-wheat bread.\nUse oatmeal in recipes instead of breadcrumbs.\nSnack on air-popped popcorn instead of chips or cookies.\nVEGETABLES: MAKE HALF OF YOUR PLATE FRUITS AND VEGETABLES\nVegetables can be raw, fresh, cooked, canned, frozen, dried, or dehydrated.\nVegetables are organized into 5 subgroups based on their nutrient content. The groups are dark-green vegetables, starchy vegetables, red and orange vegetables, beans and peas, and other vegetables.\nTry to include vegetables from each group."}
