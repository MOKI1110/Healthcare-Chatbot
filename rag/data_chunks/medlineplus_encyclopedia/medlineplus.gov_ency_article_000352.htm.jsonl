It occurs most often in people over age 60. It is more common in females than in males. The cause is unknown.\nAnaplastic cancer accounts for only about less than 1% of all thyroid cancers in the United States.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nCough\nCoughing up blood\nDifficulty swallowing\nHoarseness or changing voice\nLoud breathing\nLower neck lump, which often grows quickly\nPain in the neck\nVocal cord paralysis\nOveractive thyroid (\nhyperthyroidism\n)\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam almost always shows a growth in the neck region. Other exams may include:\nAn\nMRI\nor\nCT scan\nof the neck may show a tumor growing from the thyroid gland.\nA thyroid\nbiopsy\nmakes the diagnosis."}
