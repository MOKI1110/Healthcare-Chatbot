It mainly affects the lining of the lung and chest cavity (pleura) or lining of the abdomen (peritoneum). It is due to long-term asbestos exposure.\nCauses\nLong-term exposure to asbestos is the biggest risk factor. Asbestos is a fire-resistant material. It was once commonly found in insulation, ceiling and roofing vinyls, cement, and car brakes. Even though many asbestos workers smoked, experts do not believe smoking itself is a cause of this condition.\nOlder veterans make up 30% of the cases of mesothelioma due to exposure in the military ship, vehicle, and plane industry.\nMen are affected more often than women. The average age at diagnosis is 60 years."}

Most people seem to develop the condition about 30 years after being in contact with the asbestos.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may not appear until 20 to 40 years or longer after exposure to asbestos, and may include:\nAbdominal bloating\nAbdominal pain\nChest pain\n, especially when taking a deep breath\nCough\nFatigue\nShortness of breath\nWeight loss\nFever and sweating\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will do an exam and ask you the person about your symptoms and medical history.
