These tissues are called meninges.\nCauses\nIn most cases, cryptococcal meningitis is caused by the fungus\nCryptococcus neoformans\n. This fungus is found in soil around the world.\nCryptococcus gattii\ncan also cause meningitis, but this form can cause disease in people with a normal immune system as well.\nThis type of meningitis is not spread from person to person. Usually, it spreads through the bloodstream to the brain from another place in the body that has the initial infection.\nCryptococcus neoformans\nmeningitis most often affects people with a weakened immune system, including people with:\nAIDS\nCirrhosis\n(a type of liver disease)\nDiabetes\nLeukemia\nLymphoma\nSarcoidosis\nAn organ transplant\nCryptococcus\nneoformans meningitis  is rare in people who have a normal immune system and no long-term health problems.\nSymptoms\nThis form of meningitis starts slowly, over a few days to a few weeks."}

Symptoms may include:\nFever\nHallucinations\nHeadache\nMental status change\n(confusion)\nNausea and vomiting\nSensitivity to light\nStiff neck\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms.\nA lumbar puncture (\nspinal tap\n) is used to diagnose meningitis. In this test, a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is removed from the space around your spine and tested.\nOther tests that may be done include:\nBlood culture\nChest x-ray\nCryptococcal antigen in CSF or blood\nCSF examination for cell count, glucose, and protein\nCT scan of the head\nGram stain\n, other special stains, and\nculture of CSF\nTreatment\nAntifungal medicines are used to treat this form of meningitis.\nIntravenous\n(IV, through a vein) therapy with amphotericin B is the most common treatment. It is often combined with an oral antifungal medicine called 5-flucytosine.\nAnother oral medicine, fluconazole, may also be effective in high doses."}

If needed, it will be prescribed later in the disease course.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPeople who recover from cryptococcal meningitis need long-term medicine to prevent the infection from coming back. People with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS, will also need long-term treatment to improve their immune system.\nPossible Complications\nThese complications may occur from this infection:\nBrain damage\nHearing\nor vision loss\nHydrocephalus\n(excessive CSF in the brain)\nSeizures\nDeath\nAmphotericin B can have side effects such as:\nNausea and vomiting\nFever and chills\nJoint and muscles aches\nKidney damage\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if you develop any of the serious symptoms listed above."}
