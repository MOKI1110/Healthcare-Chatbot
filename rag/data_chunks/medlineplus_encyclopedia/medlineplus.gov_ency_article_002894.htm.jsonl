If the glue gets on the eyelids, try to keep the eyelids separated. If the eye becomes glued shut, get emergency medical care right away. If the eye is partially open, flush with cool water for 15 minutes.\nDo not try to peel off the glue. It will come off naturally when sweat builds up under it and lifts it off.\nIf fingers or other skin surfaces are stuck together, use a gentle back and forth motion to try to separate them. Applying vegetable oil around the area may help separate the skin that is stuck together.\nBefore Calling Emergency\nHave this information ready:\nPerson's age, weight, and condition\nName of the product\nTime it was swallowed or touched the skin\nPart of the body affected\nPoison Control\nYour local\npoison control center\ncan be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.
