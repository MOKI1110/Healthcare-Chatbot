Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBoric acid poisoning\nBoric acid poisoning\nBoric acid is a dangerous poison. Poisoning from this chemical can be\nacute\nor\nchronic\n. Acute boric acid poisoning usually occurs when someone swallows powdered roach-killing products that contain the chemical. Boric acid is a caustic chemical. If it contacts tissues, it can cause injury.\nChronic poisoning occurs in those who are repeatedly exposed to boric acid. For example, in the past, boric acid was used to disinfect and treat wounds. People who repeatedly received such treatment got sick, and some died.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure."}

Surgery may be needed if the esophagus, stomach, or intestine has a hole (perforation) from the acid.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe infant death rate from boric acid poisonings is high. However, boric acid poisoning is considerably rarer than in the past because the substance is no longer used as a disinfectant in nurseries. It is also no longer commonly used in medical preparations. Boric acid is an ingredient in some vaginal suppositories used for yeast infections, although this is not a standard treatment.\nSwallowing a large amount of boric acid can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Damage to the esophagus and stomach continues to occur for several weeks after the boric acid was swallowed. Death from complications may occur as long as several months later. Holes (perforations) in the esophagus and stomach may result in serious infections in both the chest and abdominal cavities, which may result in death.\nAlternative Names\nBorax poisoning\nReferences\nAronson JK.
