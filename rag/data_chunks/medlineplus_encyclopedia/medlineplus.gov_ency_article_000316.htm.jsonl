Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHyperkalemic periodic paralysis\nHyperkalemic periodic paralysis\nHyperkalemic periodic paralysis (hyperPP) is a disorder that causes occasional episodes of\nmuscle weakness\nand sometimes a higher than normal level of potassium in the blood. The medical name for high potassium level is\nhyperkalemia\n.\nHyperPP is one of a group of genetic disorders that includes\nhypokalemic periodic paralysis\nand\nthyrotoxic periodic paralysis\n.\nCauses\nHyperPP is congenital. This means it is present at birth. In most cases, it is passed down through families (inherited) as an\nautosomal dominant\ndisorder. In other words, only one parent needs to pass the gene related to this condition on to their child in order for the child to be affected.\nOccasionally, the condition may be the result of a genetic problem that is not inherited.\nIt is believed that the disorder is related to problems with the way the body controls sodium and potassium levels in cells.\nRisk factors include having other family members with periodic paralysis."}

It affects men and women equally.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include attacks of muscle weakness or loss of muscle movement (\nparalysis\n) that come and go. There is normal muscle strength between attacks.\nAttacks usually begin in childhood. How often the attacks occur varies. Some people have several attacks a day. They are usually not severe enough to need therapy. Some people have associated\nmyotonia\n, in which they cannot immediately relax their muscles after use.\nThe weakness or paralysis:\nMost commonly occurs at the shoulders, back, and hips\nMay also involve the arms and legs, but does not affect muscles of the eyes and muscles that help with breathing and swallowing\nMost commonly occurs while resting after activity or exercise\nMay occur on awakening\nOccurs on and off\nUsually lasts 15 minutes to 1 hour, but may last up to an entire day\nTriggers may include:\nEating a high carbohydrate meal\nRest after exercise\nExposure to cold\nSkipping meals\nEating potassium-rich foods or taking medicines tha"}

Other clues to the disorder are muscle weakness symptoms that come and go with normal or high results of a blood\npotassium test\n.\nBetween attacks, a physical examination shows nothing abnormal. During and between attacks, the potassium blood level can be normal or high.\nDuring an attack, muscle reflexes are decreased or absent. And muscles go limp rather than staying stiff."}

During and between attacks, the potassium blood level can be normal or high.\nDuring an attack, muscle reflexes are decreased or absent. And muscles go limp rather than staying stiff. Muscle groups near the body, such as the shoulders and hips, are involved more often than the arms and legs.\nTests that may done include:\nElectrocardiogram (\nECG\n), which may be abnormal during attacks\nElectromyography (\nEMG\n), which is usually normal between attacks and abnormal during attacks\nMuscle biopsy\n, which may show abnormalities\nOther tests may be ordered to rule out other causes.\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent further attacks.\nAttacks are seldom severe enough to require emergency treatment. But irregular heartbeats (\nheart arrhythmias\n) may also occur during attacks, for which emergency treatment is needed. Muscle weakness can become worse with repeated attacks, so treatment to prevent the attacks should occur as soon as possible.\nGlucose or other carbohydrates (sugars) given during an attack may reduce the severity of the symptoms."}

Calcium or diuretics may need to be given through a vein to stop sudden attacks.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSometimes, attacks disappear later in life on their own. But repeated attacks may lead to permanent muscle weakness.\nHyperPP responds well to treatment. Treatment may prevent, and may even reverse, progressive muscle weakness.\nPossible Complications\nHealth problems that may be due to hyperPP include:\nKidney stones\n(a side effect of medicine used to treat the condition)\nIrregular heart beat\nMuscle weakness that slowly continues to get worse\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you or your child has muscle weakness that comes and goes, especially if you have family members who have periodic paralysis.\nGo to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you faint or have difficulty breathing, speaking, or swallowing.\nPrevention\nThe medicines acetazolamide and thiazides prevent attacks in many cases."}
