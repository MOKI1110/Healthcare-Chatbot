This is a common organism found in the nose and throat. It normally does not cause disease.\nBecause of the bacteria's normal location in the nose and throat, actinomycosis most commonly affects the face and neck. The infection can sometimes occur in the chest (\npulmonary actinomycosis\n), abdomen, pelvis, or other areas of the body. The infection is not contagious. This means it does not spread to other people.\nSymptoms occur when the bacteria enter the tissues of the face after trauma, surgery, or infection. Common triggers include\ndental abscess\nor oral surgery."}

Common triggers include\ndental abscess\nor oral surgery. The infection can also affect certain women who have had an intrauterine device (IUD) to prevent pregnancy.\nOnce in the tissue, the bacteria cause an abscess, producing a hard, red to reddish-purple lump, often on the jaw, from which comes the condition's common name, \"lumpy jaw.\"\nEventually, the abscess breaks through the skin surface to produce a draining sinus tract.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nDraining sores in the skin, especially on the chest wall from lung infection with Actinomyces\nFever\nMild or no pain\nSwelling\nor a hard, red to reddish-purple lump on the face or upper neck\nWeight loss\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.\nTests that may be done to check for presence of the bacteria include:\nCulture of the tissue or fluid\nExamination of drained fluid under a microscope\nCT scan\nof affected areas\nTreatment\nTreatment of actinomycosis usually requires antibiotics for several months to a year."}

Surgical drainage or removal of the affected area (lesion) may be needed. If the condition is related to an IUD, the device must be removed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nFull recovery can be expected with treatment.\nPossible Complications\nIn rare cases,\nmeningitis\ncan develop from actinomycosis. Meningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. This membrane is called the meninges.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of this infection.  Starting treatment  right away  helps quicken the recovery.\nPrevention\nGood\noral hygiene\nand regular dentist visits may help prevent some forms of actinomycosis.\nAlternative Names\nLumpy jaw\nImages\nActinomycosis (lumpy jaw)\nBacteria\nReferences\nBrook I.
