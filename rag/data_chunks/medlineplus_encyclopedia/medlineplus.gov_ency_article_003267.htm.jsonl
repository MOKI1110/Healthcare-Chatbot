It is also called amniotic fluid disorder, or hydramnios.\nConsiderations\nAmniotic fluid is the liquid that surrounds the baby in the womb (uterus). It comes from the baby's kidneys and developing urinary system, and then it goes into the uterus from the baby's urine. The fluid is absorbed when the baby swallows it and through breathing motions.\nWhile in the womb, the baby floats in the amniotic fluid. It surrounds and cushions the infant during pregnancy. The amount of amniotic fluid is greatest at 34 to 36 weeks of pregnancy. Then the amount slowly decreases until the baby is born.\nThe amniotic fluid:\nAllows the baby to move in the womb, promoting muscle and bone growth\nHelps the baby's lungs to develop\nProtects the baby from heat loss by keeping the temperature constant\nCushions and protects the baby from sudden blows from outside the womb\nCauses\nPolyhydramnios can occur if the baby does not swallow and absorb amniotic fluid in normal amounts."}

This may be due to:\nCertain lung disorders in the baby\nMultiple pregnancy (for example, twins or triplets)\nHydrops fetalis\nin the baby\nSometimes, no specific cause is found.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you are pregnant and notice that your belly is getting large very quickly.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nYour provider measures the size of your belly at every visit.

The baby will need to be delivered in a hospital. That way, the providers can immediately check the health of the mother and baby and give treatment if needed.\nAlternative Names\nPregnancy - polyhydramnios; Hydramnios - polyhydramnios\nImages\nPolyhydramnios\nReferences\nBuhimschi CS, Mesiano S, Muglia LJ.
