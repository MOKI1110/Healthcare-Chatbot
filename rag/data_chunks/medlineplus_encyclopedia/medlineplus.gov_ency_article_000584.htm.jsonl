Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. There are many types and causes of anemia.\nIron deficiency anemia occurs when your body does not have enough iron. Iron helps make red blood cells. Iron deficiency anemia is the most common form of anemia.\nCauses\nRed blood cells bring oxygen to your body's tissues. Red blood cells are made in your bone marrow. Red blood cells circulate through your body for 3 to 4 months. Parts of your body, such as your spleen, remove old blood cells.\nIron is a key part of red blood cells. Without iron to make hemoglobin, your blood cannot carry oxygen effectively. Your body normally gets iron through your diet. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells.\nIron deficiency anemia develops when your body's iron stores run low."}

Common causes of bleeding are:\nHeavy, long, or frequent menstrual periods\nCancer in the\nesophagus\n,\nstomach\n, small bowel, or\ncolon\nEsophageal varices\n, often from cirrhosis\nThe use of aspirin, ibuprofen, or medicines that may thin the blood for a long time, which can cause gastrointestinal bleeding\nPeptic ulcer disease\nYour body may not absorb enough iron from your diet due to:\nCeliac disease\nCrohn disease\nGastric bypass surgery\nTaking too many antacids or too much of the antibiotic tetracycline\nYou may not get enough iron in your diet if:\nYou are a strict vegetarian\nYou do not eat enough foods that contain iron\nSymptoms\nYou may have no symptoms if the anemia is mil"}
