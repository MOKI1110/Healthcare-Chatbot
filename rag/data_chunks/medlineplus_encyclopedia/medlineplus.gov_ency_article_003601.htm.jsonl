Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nChloride - urine test\nChloride - urine test\nThe urine chloride test measures the amount of chloride in the urine.\nHow the Test is Performed\nAfter you provide a urine sample, it is tested in the lab. If needed, the health care provider may ask you to\ncollect your urine at home over a period of 24 hours\n. Your provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider will ask you to temporarily stop taking any medicines that may affect the test result. Tell your provider about all the medicines you take, including:\nAcetazolamide\nCorticosteroids\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nWater pills (diuretic medicines)\nDO NOT stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination."}

There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order this test if you have signs of a condition that affects body fluids or acid-base balance.\nNormal Results\nThe normal range is 110 to 250 mEq per day in a 24-hour collection. This range depends on the amount of salt and fluid you take in.\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test result.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA higher than normal urine chloride level may be due to:\nLow function of the\nadrenal glands\nInflammation of the kidney that results in salt loss (salt-losing nephropathy)\nPotassium depletion (from the blood or body)\nProduction of an unusually large amount of urine (polyuria)\nToo much salt in the diet\nDecreased urine chloride level may be due to:\nBody holding in too much salt (sodium retention)\nCushing syndrome\nDecreased salt intake\nFluid loss that occurs with diarrhea, vomiting, sweating, and\ngastric suction\nSyndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (SIADH)\nRisks\nThere are no risks with this test.\nAlternative Names\nUrinary chloride\nImages\nFemale urinary tract\nMale urinary tract\nReferences\nKamel KS, Halperin ML.
