It appears in both men and women. It may develop in a child if either parent carries the gene for the disorder. In 10% to 30% of cases, the parents do not carry the gene.\nFacioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy is one of the most common forms of muscle dystrophy affecting 1 in 15,000 to 1 in 20,000 adults in the United States. It affects men and women equally.\nSymptoms\nMen often have more symptoms than women.\nFacioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy mainly affects the face, shoulder, and upper arm muscles. However, it can also affect muscles around the pelvis, hips, and lower leg.\nSymptoms can appear soon after birth (infantile form), but often they do not appear until age 10 to 26 years."}

However, it can also affect muscles around the pelvis, hips, and lower leg.\nSymptoms can appear soon after birth (infantile form), but often they do not appear until age 10 to 26 years. However, it is not uncommon for symptoms to appear much later in life. In some cases, symptoms never develop.\nSymptoms are most often mild and very slowly become worse. Muscle weakness of the face is common, and may include:\nEyelid drooping\nInability to whistle due to weakness of the cheek muscles\nDecreased facial expression due to weakness of facial muscles\nDepressed or angry facial expression\nDifficulty pronouncing words\nDifficulty reaching above the shoulder level\nShoulder muscle weakness causes deformities such as pronounced shoulder blades (scapular winging) and sloping shoulders. The person has difficulty raising their arms because of shoulder and arm muscle weakness.\nWeakness of the lower legs is possible as the disorder gets worse. This interferes with ability to play sports because of decreased strength and poor balance. The weakness can be severe enough to interfere with walking."}

This interferes with ability to play sports because of decreased strength and poor balance. The weakness can be severe enough to interfere with walking. A small percentage of people use a wheelchair.\nChronic pain is present in 50% to 80% of people with this type of muscular dystrophy.\nHearing loss and abnormal heart rhythms may occur, but are rare.\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam will show weakness of the face and shoulder muscles as well as scapular winging. Weakness of the back muscles can cause scoliosis, while weakness of the abdominal muscles can be the cause of a sagging belly. High blood pressure may be noted, but is usually mild. An eye exam may show changes in the blood vessels in the back of the eye.\nTests that may be done include:\nBlood creatine kinase\nlevels\nDNA testing\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG)\nElectromyography\n(EMG)\nFluorescein angiography\nGenetic testing of chromosome 4\nHearing tests\nMuscle biopsy\n(may confirm the diagnosis)\nVisual exam\nCardiac testing\nX-rays of the spine to determine if there is a scoliosis\nPulmonary function tests\nTreatment\nPresently, facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy remains incurable."}

Treatments are given to control symptoms and improve quality of life. Activity is encouraged. Inactivity such as bedrest can make the muscle disease worse.\nPhysical therapy may help maintain muscle strength. Other possible treatments include:\nOccupational therapy to help improve activities of daily living.\nOral albuterol to increase muscle mass (but not strength).\nSpeech therapy.\nSurgery to fix a winged scapula.\nWalking aids and foot support devices if there is ankle weakness.\nBiPAP to help breathing. Oxygen alone should be avoided in patients with a high CO2 (hypercarbia).\nCounseling services (psychiatrist, psychologist, social worker).\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nDisability is often minor. Lifespan is most often not affected.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nDecreased mobility.\nDecreased ability to care for self.\nDeformities of the face and shoulders.\nHearing loss.\nVision loss (rare).\nRespiratory insufficiency."}
