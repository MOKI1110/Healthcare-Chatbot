This covering is called the meninges.\nBacteria are one type of germ that may cause meningitis. The staphylococcal bacteria are one type of bacteria that cause meningitis.\nCauses\nStaphylococcal meningitis is caused by staphylococcus bacteria. When it is caused by\nStaphylococcus aureus\nor\nStaphylococcus epidermidis\nbacteria, it usually develops as a complication of surgery or as an infection that spreads through the blood from another site.\nRisk factors include:\nInfections of heart valves\nPast infection of the brain\nPast meningitis due to spinal fluid shunts\nRecent brain surgery\nThe presence of a spinal fluid shunt\nTrauma\nBloodstream infection with\nStaphylococcus aureus\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may come on quickly, and include:\nFever and chills\nMental status changes\nNausea and vomiting\nSensitivity to light (\nphotophobia\n)\nSevere headache\nStiff neck (meningismus)\nOther symptoms that can occur with this disease:\nAgitation\nBulging"}

Questions will focus on symptoms and risk factors.\nIf your provider thinks meningitis is possible, a lumbar puncture (\nspinal tap\n) is done to remove a sample of spinal fluid for testing. If you have a spinal fluid shunt, the sample may be taken from this instead.\nTests may include:\nBlood culture\nChest x-ray\nCT scan of the head\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nGram stain\nor other special stains, and\nculture of the spinal fluid\nTreatment\nAntibiotics will be started as soon as possible. Vancomycin is the first choice for suspected staphylococcal meningitis. Nafcillin is used when tests show that the bacteria are sensitive to this antibiotic.\nOften, treatment will include a search for and removal of possible sources of bacteria in the body."}

These include shunts or artificial heart valves.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nEarly treatment improves the outcome. However, some people do not survive. Young children and adults over age 50 have the highest risk for death.\nStaphylococcal meningitis often improves more quickly, with fewer complications, if the source of the infection is removed. The source may include shunts, hardware in joints, or artificial heart valves.\nPossible Complications\nLong-term complications may include:\nBrain damage\nBuildup of fluid between the skull and brain (\nsubdural effusion\n)\nBuildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling (\nhydrocephalus\n)\nHearing loss\nSeizures\nStaph infection in another area of the body\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall 911 or the local emergency number or go to an emergency room if you suspect meningitis in a young child who has the following symptoms:\nFeeding problems\nHigh-pitched cry\nIrritability\nPersistent, unexplained fever\nMeningitis can quickly become a life-t"}
