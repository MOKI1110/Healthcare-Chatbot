Bleeding may be noted on the stool or be seen as blood on toilet paper or in the toilet. The blood may be bright red. The term \"hematochezia\" is used to describe this finding.\nConsiderations\nThe color of the blood in the stools may indicate the source of bleeding.\nBlack or tarry stools\n(melena) may be due to bleeding in the upper part of the GI (gastrointestinal) tract, such as the esophagus, stomach, or the first part of the small intestine. In this case, blood is most often darker because it gets digested on its way through the GI tract. Much less commonly, this type of bleeding can be brisk enough to present with bright red rectal bleeding.\nBleeding from the rectum may also be red or fresh. This usually means that the source of bleeding is the lower GI tract (colon, rectum, and anus).\nEating beets or foods with red food coloring can sometimes make stools appear reddish."}
