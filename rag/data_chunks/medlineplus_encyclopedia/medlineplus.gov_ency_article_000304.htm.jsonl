It involves an extremely high blood sugar (glucose) level without the presence of ketones.\nCauses\nHHS is a condition of:\nExtremely high blood sugar level\nExtreme lack of water (\ndehydration\n)\nDecreased alertness or consciousness (in many cases)\nA buildup of ketones in the body (ketoacidosis) may also occur, but it is unusual and is often mild compared with\ndiabetic ketoacidosis\n.\nHHS is more often seen in people with type 2 diabetes who don't have their diabetes under control. It may also occur in those who have not been diagnosed with diabetes."}

It may also occur in those who have not been diagnosed with diabetes. The condition may be brought on by:\nInfection\nOther illness, such as heart attack or stroke\nMedicines that decrease the effect of insulin in the body\nMedicines or conditions that increase fluid loss\nRunning out of, or not taking prescribed diabetes medicines\nNormally, the kidneys try to make up for a high glucose level in the blood by allowing the extra glucose to leave the body in the urine. But this also causes the body to lose water. If you do not drink enough water, or you drink fluids that contain sugar and keep eating foods with carbohydrates, you become very dehydrated. When this occurs, the kidneys are no longer able to get rid of the extra glucose. As a result, the glucose level in your blood can become very high, sometimes more than 10 times the normal amount.\nThe loss of water also makes the blood more concentrated than normal. This is called hyperosmolarity. It is a condition in which the blood has a high concentration of salt (sodium), glucose, and other substances."}
