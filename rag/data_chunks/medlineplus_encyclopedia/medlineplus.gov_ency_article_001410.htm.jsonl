It may last for years. This form is very rare compared to the common short-lived childhood tic.\nTourette syndrome\nis a separate condition in which tics are a major symptom.\nSymptoms\nTics may involve repeated, uncontrolled spasm-like muscle movements, such as:\nEye blinking\nGrimacing\nMouth twitching\nNose wrinkling\nSquinting\nRepeated throat clearing or grunting may also be present.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will usually diagnose a tic during a physical examination.

In rare cases, an\nelectroencephalogram\n(EEG) may be done to look for\nseizures\n, which can be the cause of tics.\nTreatment\nShort-lived childhood tics are usually not treated. Calling the child's attention to a tic may make it worse or cause it to continue. A non-stressful environment can make tics occur less often, and help them go away more quickly. Stress reduction programs or cognitive behavioral intervention may also be helpful.\nIf tics severely affect a person's life, medicines may help control them.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSimple childhood tics should go away on their own over a period of months.\nChronic\ntics may continue for a longer period of time.\nPossible Complications\nIn most cases, there are no complications.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nMake an appointment with  your provider if tics:\nAffect many muscle groups\nAre persistent\nAre severe\nPrevention\nMany cases cannot be prevented.
