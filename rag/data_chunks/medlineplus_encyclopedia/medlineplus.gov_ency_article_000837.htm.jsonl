If a parent has this condition, there is a 50% chance of passing on the gene to a child, regardless of sex of the parent or child. This means the abnormal gene is needed from only one parent in order to inherit the disease.\nScientists have identified four genes involved in this condition. All of these genes appear to be important for blood vessels to develop properly. A variant in any one of these genes can cause a person to have HHT.\nSymptoms\nPeople with HHT can develop abnormal blood vessels in several areas of the body. These vessels are called arteriovenous malformations (AVMs).\nIf they are on the skin, they are called\ntelangiectasias\n. The most common sites include the lips, tongue, ears, and fingers."}

The abnormal blood vessels can also develop in the brain, lungs, liver, intestines, or other areas.\nSymptoms of this syndrome include:\nFrequent\nnosebleeds\nin children\nBleeding in the gastrointestinal tract\n(GI), including loss of blood in the stool, or dark or black stools\nSeizures\nor unexplained, small\nstrokes\n(from bleeding into the brain)\nShortness of breath\nEnlarged liver\nHeart failure\nAnemia\ncaused by low iron\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about your symptoms. An experienced provider can detect telangiectases during a physical examination."}

Iron may also be given if there is a lot of blood loss, leading to anemia. Avoid taking blood-thinning medicines."}

Some medicines that affect blood vessel development are being studied as possible future treatments.\nSome people may need to take antibiotics before having dental work or surgery. People with lung AVMs should avoid scuba diving to prevent decompression sickness (the bends).
