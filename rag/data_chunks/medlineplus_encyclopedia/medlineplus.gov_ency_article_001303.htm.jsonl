The reaction occurs when the red blood cells that were given during the transfusion are destroyed by the person's immune system. When red blood cells are destroyed, the process is called hemolysis.\nThere are other types of transfusion reactions that do not cause hemolysis, such as febrile (causing fever) transfusion reactions.\nCauses\nBlood is classified into four different types: A, B, AB, and O.\nAnother way blood cells may be classified is by Rh factors. People who have Rh factors in their blood are called \"Rh positive.\" People without these factors are called \"Rh negative.\" Rh negative people form antibodies against Rh factors if they receive Rh positive blood.\nThere are also many other blood-related factors that differ among people, in addition to ABO and Rh.\nYour immune system can usually tell its own blood cells from those of another person."}

If you receive blood that is even partially not compatible with your blood, your body produces\nantibodies\nto destroy the donor's blood cells. This process causes the transfusion reaction. Blood that you receive in a transfusion must be compatible with your own blood. This means that your body does not have antibodies against the blood you receive.\nMost of the time, a blood transfusion between compatible groups (such as O+ to O+) does not cause a problem. However, minor mismatches in blood factors can cause a reaction. It is usually mild. Blood transfusions between incompatible groups (such as A+ to O-) cause an immune response that is more severe. This can lead to a serious transfusion reaction. The immune system attacks the donated blood cells, destroying them.\nToday, all blood is carefully screened and processed for transfusion by cross-matching."}

Blood samples from the recipient (person getting the transfusion) and from the donor must be tested to tell whether symptoms are being caused by a transfusion reaction.\nMild symptoms may be treated with:\nAcetaminophen, a pain reliever to reduce fever and discomfort\nFluids given through a vein (intravenous) and other medicines to treat or prevent kidney failure and shock\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome depends on how severe the reaction is. The disorder may run its course without problems. Or, it may be severe and life threatening.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nAcute kidney failure\nAnemia\nLung problems\nShock\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nTell your health care provider if you are having a blood transfusion and you have had a reaction before.\nPrevention\nDonated blood is put into ABO and Rh groups to reduce the risk for transfusion reaction.\nBefore a transfusion, recipient and donor blood are tested (cross-matched) to see if they are compatible."}
