It plays an important role in the body's control of metabolism (the many processes that control the rate of activity in cells and tissues).\nA laboratory test can be done to measure the amount of T3 in your blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before the test that may affect your test result. Do not stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.\nMedicines that can increase T3 measurements include:\nBirth control pills\nEstrogens\nMethadone\nCertain herbal remedies\nMedicines that can decrease T3 measurements include:\nAmiodarone\nAnabolic steroids\nAndrogens\nAntithyroid medicines (for example, propylthiouracil and methimazole)\nLithium\nPhenytoin\nPropranolol\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to check your thyroid function. Thyroid function depends on the action of T3 and other hormones, including\nthyroid-stimulating hormone\n(TSH) and\nT4\n.\nSometimes it can be useful to measure both T3 and T4 when evaluating thyroid function.\nThe total T3 test measures the T3 that is both attached to proteins and floating free in the blood.\nThe free T3 test measures only the T3 that is floating free in the blood."}

Some labs use different measurements or test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nNormal values are age specific for people less than age 20."}
