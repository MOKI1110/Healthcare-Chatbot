Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSolitary pulmonary nodule\nSolitary pulmonary nodule\nA solitary pulmonary nodule is a round or oval spot (lesion) in the lung that is seen with a\nchest x-ray\nor\nCT scan\n.\nCauses\nMore than half of all solitary pulmonary nodules are noncancerous (benign). Benign nodules have many causes, including scars and past infections.\nInfectious granulomas (which are formed by cells as a reaction to a past infection) cause most benign nodules. Common infections that often result in granulomas or other healed scars include:\nTuberculosis\n(TB) or exposure to TB\nFungus, such as\naspergillosis\n,\ncoccidioidomycosis\n,\ncryptococcosis\n, or\nhistoplasmosis\nPrimary lung cancer is the most common cause of cancerous (malignant) pulmonary nodules. This is cancer that starts in the lung.\nSymptoms\nA solitary pulmonary nodule itself rarely causes symptoms.\nExams and Tests\nA solitary pulmonary nodule is most often found on a chest x-ray or chest CT scan. These imaging tests are often done for other symptoms or reasons."}

It can also occur as part of the screening chest CT for people age 50 to 80 years who have a 20 pack-year smoking history.\nYour health care provider must decide whether the nodule in your lung is most likely benign or of concern. A nodule more is likely benign if:\nThe nodule is small, has a smooth border, and has a solid and even appearance on an x-ray or CT scan.\nYou are young and never smoked.\nYour provider may then choose to monitor the nodule over time by repeating a series of x-rays or CT scans.\nRepeat chest x-rays or chest CT scans are the most common way to monitor the nodule."}

Treatment may be based on the results of the biopsy or other tests.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook is usually good if the nodule is benign."}
