The most common procedure is to move very large or prominent ears closer to the head.\nDescription\nCosmetic ear surgery may be done in the surgeon's office, an outpatient clinic, or a hospital. It can be performed under local anesthesia, which numbs the area around the ears. You may also receive\nmedicine to make you relaxed and sleepy\n. It can also be done under\ngeneral anesthesia\n, in which you are asleep and pain-free. This is the preferred method of anesthesia in children. The procedure usually lasts about 2 hours.\nDuring the most common method of cosmetic ear surgery, the surgeon makes a cut in the back of the ear and removes the skin to see the ear cartilage. The cartilage is folded to reshape the ear, bringing it closer to the head. Sometimes the surgeon will cut the cartilage before folding it. Sometimes skin is removed from behind the ear."}

Stitches are used to close the wound.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThe procedure is often done to reduce self-consciousness or embarrassment of the unusual shape of the ears.\nIn children, the procedure can be done after they are 5 or 6 years old, when ear growth is almost finished. If the ears are very disfigured (lop ears), the child should have surgery early to avoid possible emotional\nstress\n.\nRisks\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:\nReactions to medicines\nBreathing problems\nBleeding\n,\nblood clots\n, or infection\nRisks of cosmetic ear surgery include:\nAreas of numbness\nCollection of blood (hematoma)\nInfection\nIncreased feeling of cold\nRecurrence of the ear deformity\nKeloids\nand other scars\nPoor results\nBefore the Procedure\nTell your surgeon or nurse if:\nYou are or could be pregnant\nYou are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\nDuring the week before your surgery:\nYou may be asked to temporarily stop taking me"}

These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\nOn the day of surgery:\nFollow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.\nTake the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\nArrive at the hospital on time.\nBe sure to follow any other specific instructions from your surgeon.\nAfter the Procedure\nThe ears are covered with thick bandages with some moderate pressure after surgery. Typically, you can go home after you are awake from the anesthesia.\nAny tenderness and discomfort can be controlled with medicine.
