People with this condition have problems swallowing due to small, thin growths of tissue (webs) that partially block the upper food pipe (esophagus).\nCauses\nThe cause of Plummer-Vinson syndrome is unknown. Genetic factors and a lack of certain nutrients (in particular iron deficiency anemia) may play a role. It is a rare disorder that can be linked to cancers of the esophagus and throat. It is more common in women.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nDifficulty swallowing\nWeakness or fatigue from the anemia\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will do an exam to look for abnormal areas on your skin and nails.\nYou may have an\nupper GI series\nor\nupper endoscopy\nto look for abnormal tissue in the food pipe. You may have tests to look for anemia or iron deficiency.\nTreatment\nTaking iron supplements may improve the swallowing problems."}

You may have tests to look for anemia or iron deficiency.\nTreatment\nTaking iron supplements may improve the swallowing problems. Sometimes, intravenous (IV) iron is needed.\nIf supplements do not help, the web of tissue can be widened during upper endoscopy. This will allow you to swallow food normally.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPeople with this condition  generally respond to treatment.\nPossible Complications\nDevices used to stretch the esophagus (dilators) may cause a tear. This can lead to bleeding.\nPlummer-Vinson syndrome has been linked to\nesophageal cancer\n.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nFood gets stuck after you swallow it\nYou have severe fatigue and weakness\nPrevention\nGetting  enough iron in your diet may prevent this disorder.\nAlternative Names\nPaterson-Kelly syndrome; Sideropenic dysphagia; Esophageal web\nImages\nEsophagus and stomach anatomy\nReferences\nBass AJ, Rustgi AK.
