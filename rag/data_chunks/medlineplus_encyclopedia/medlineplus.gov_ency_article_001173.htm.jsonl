In general, baldness occurs when the hair follicle shrinks over time, resulting in shorter and finer hair. Eventually, the follicle does not grow new hair. The follicles remain alive, which suggests that it is still possible to grow new hair.\nThe reason for female pattern baldness is not well understood, but may be related to:\nAging\nChanges in the levels of androgens (hormones that can stimulate male features)\nFamily history of male or female pattern baldness\nHeavy loss of blood during menstrual periods\nCertain medicines, such as estrogenic oral contraceptives\nSymptoms\nHair thinning is different from that of male pattern baldness. In female pattern baldness:\nHair thins mainly on the top and crown of the scalp. It usually starts with a widening through the center hair part."}

In female pattern baldness:\nHair thins mainly on the top and crown of the scalp. It usually starts with a widening through the center hair part. This pattern of hair loss is known as Christmas tree pattern.\nThe front hairline remains unaffected except for normal recession, which happens to everyone as time passes.\nThe hair loss rarely progresses to total or near total baldness, as it may in men.\nIf the cause is increased androgens, hair on the head is thinner while hair on the face is coarser.\nItching or skin sores on the scalp are generally not seen.\nExams and Tests\nFemale pattern baldness is usually diagnosed based on:\nRuling out other causes of hair loss, such as thyroid disease or iron deficiency.\nThe appearance and pattern of hair loss.\nYour medical history.\nThe health care provider will examine you for other signs of too much male hormone (androgen), such as:\nAbnormal new hair growth, such as on the face or between the belly button and pubic area\nChanges in menstrual periods and enlargement of the clitoris\nNew acne\nskin biopsy\nof the scalp or blood tests may be used to diagnose skin disorders that cause hair loss.\nLooking"}

In most cases, hair loss is mild to moderate. You do not need treatment if you are comfortable with your appearance.\nMEDICINES\nThe only medicine approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat female pattern baldness is minoxidil:\nIt is applied to the scalp.\nFor women, the 2% solution or 5% foam is recommended.\nMinoxidil may help hair grow in about 1 in 4 or 5 women. In most women, it may slow or stop hair loss.\nYou must continue to use this medicine for a long time. Hair loss starts again when you stop using it."}

Also, the hair  that it helps grow will fall out.\nIf minoxidil does not work, your provider may recommend other medicines or treatments, such as vitamins, spironolactone, birth control pills, ketoconazole shampoo, platelet-rich plasma therapy (PRP) injections, and laser treatments. Your provider can tell you more about these if needed.\nHAIR TRANSPLANT\nThis procedure can be effective in females:\nWho do not respond well to medical treatment\nWith no significant cosmetic improvement from their treatment\nDuring hair transplant, tiny plugs of hair are removed from areas where hair is thicker, and placed (transplanted) in areas that are balding. Minor scarring may occur where hair is removed. There is a slight risk of skin infection. You will likely need many transplants, which can be expensive. However, the results can be excellent and permanent.\nOTHER SOLUTIONS\nHair weaving, hairpieces, or a change in hairstyle can help hide hair loss and improve your appearance."}
