Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAortic regurgitation\nAortic regurgitation\nAortic regurgitation is a heart valve disease in which the aortic valve does not close tightly. This allows blood to flow from the aorta (the largest blood vessel) into the left ventricle (a chamber of the heart).\nCauses\nAny condition that prevents the aortic valve from closing completely can cause this problem. When the valve does not close all the way, some blood comes back each time the heart beats.\nWhen a large amount of blood comes back, the heart must work harder to force out enough blood to meet the body's needs. The left lower chamber (left ventricle) of the heart widens (dilates) and the heart beats very strongly (\nbounding pulse\n). Over time, the heart becomes less able to supply enough blood to the body.\nIn the past,\nrheumatic fever\nwas the main cause of aortic regurgitation. The use of antibiotics to treat strep infections has made rheumatic fever less common. Therefore, aortic regurgitation is more commonly due to other causes."}

However, you will need to see a health care provider for regular exams and echocardiograms.\nDiuretics (water pills) or other types of medicines may be prescribed for symptoms of heart failure.\nIn the past, most people with heart valve problems were given antibiotics before dental work or an invasive procedure, such as colonoscopy. The antibiotics were given to prevent an infection of the damaged heart. However, antibiotics are now used much less often.\nYou may need to limit activity that requires more work from your heart.
