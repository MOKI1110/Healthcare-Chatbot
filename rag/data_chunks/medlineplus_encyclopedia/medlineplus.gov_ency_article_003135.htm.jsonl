This can range from sometimes leaking a small amount of stool and passing gas, to not being able to control bowel movements.\nUrinary incontinence\nis when you are not able to control passing urine. It is not covered in this article.\nConsiderations\nIn adults age 65 and older, women tend to have problems with bowel control more often than men.  However, bowel incontinence can happen in both women and men, as well as in younger people with certain medical conditions.\nChildren who have problems with leakage due to toilet training problems or constipation may have\nencopresis\n.\nThe rectum, anus, pelvic muscles, and nervous system must work together to control bowel movements. If there is a problem with any of these, it can cause incontinence. You must also be able to recognize and respond to the urge to have a bowel movement.\nMany people feel embarrassed about bowel incontinence and may not tell their health care provider."}

You must also be able to recognize and respond to the urge to have a bowel movement.\nMany people feel embarrassed about bowel incontinence and may not tell their health care provider. But because incontinence can be treated, you should tell your provider if you are having problems. Proper treatment can help most people gain control of their bowels. Exercises to make the anal and pelvic muscles stronger can help the bowels work properly.\nCauses\nReasons people have bowel incontinence include:\nOngoing (chronic) constipation. This causes the anal muscles and intestines to stretch and weaken, leading to diarrhea and stool leakage.\nFecal impaction\n. It is most often caused by chronic constipation."}

Your provider may suggest one or more of these treatments.\nDiet --\nTrack the foods you eat to see if any types of foods cause problems."}

Foods that may lead to incontinence in some people include:\nAlcohol\nCaffeine\nDairy products (in people who are\nunable to digest lactose\n, a sugar found in most dairy products)\nFatty, fried, or greasy foods\nSpicy foods\nCured or smoked meats\nSweeteners such as fructose, mannitol, sorbitol, and xylitol\nFiber --\nAdding bulk to your diet may thicken loose stool. To\nincrease fiber\n:\nEat more whole grains. Aim for 30 grams of fiber a day. Read food labels to see how much fiber is in breads, cereals, and other foods.\nUse products that contain a type of fiber called psyllium, which adds bulk to stools.\nBowel retraining and pelvic floor exercises --\nThese methods can help you control your anal sphincter muscle when you have a bowel movement. Your provider can show you exercises to strengthen the pelvic floor and anal muscles. Bowel retraining involves trying to have a bowel movement at certain times of the day.\nSome people can't tell when it's time to have a bowel movement."}

Bowel retraining involves trying to have a bowel movement at certain times of the day.\nSome people can't tell when it's time to have a bowel movement. Sometimes they can't move well enough to safely get to the toilet on their own. These people need special care. They may become used to not getting to the toilet when it's time to have a bowel movement. To prevent this problem, help them get to the toilet after meals and when they feel the urge. Also, make sure the\nbathroom is safe\nand comfortable.\nUsing special pads or undergarments can help an incontinent person feel safe when they leave home. You can find these products in pharmacies and in many other stores.\nSURGERY\nIf these treatments do not work, surgery may help correct the problem. There are several types of procedures. The choice of surgery is based on the cause of the incontinence and the person's general health.\nAnal sphincter repair --\nThis surgery may help people whose anal muscle ring (sphincter) isn't working well due to injury or aging."}

The anal muscles are changed to tighten the sphincter and help the anus close more completely.\nGracilis muscle transplant --\nIn people who have lost nerve function in the anal sphincter, gracilis muscle transplants may help. The gracilis muscle is taken from the inner thigh. It is put around the sphincter to help tighten the sphincter muscle.\nArtificial bowel sphincter --\nThe artificial sphincter consists of 3 parts: a cuff that fits around the anus, a pressure-regulating balloon, and a pump that inflates the cuff.\nDuring surgery, the artificial sphincter is placed around the anal sphincter. The cuff stays inflated to maintain continence. You have a bowel movement by deflating the cuff. The cuff will automatically re-inflate in 10 minutes.\nSacral nerve stimulator --\nA device can be put inside the body to stimulate the nerves that maintain continence.\nFecal diversion --\nSometimes, this procedure is performed in people who are not helped by other therapies."}

The large intestine is attached to an opening in the abdominal wall called a colostomy. Stool passes through this opening to a special bag. You will need to use a colostomy bag to collect stool most of the time.\nInjection treatment --\nThis procedure injects a thick gel (Solesta) into the anal sphincter to bulk it up.\nIf treatment does not get rid of bowel incontinence, you can use special fecal collection devices to contain the stool and protect your skin from breakdown. These devices have a drainable pouch attached to an adhesive wafer. The wafer has a hole cut through the center, which fits over the opening to the anus.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nReport any problems with bowel incontinence to your provider."}
