These symptoms occur when you breathe in something you are allergic to, such as dust, animal dander, or pollen. Symptoms can also occur when you eat a food that you are allergic to.\nThis article focuses on allergic rhinitis due to plant pollens. This type of allergic rhinitis is commonly called hay fever or seasonal allergy.\nCauses\nAn allergen is something that triggers an allergy. When a person with allergic rhinitis breathes in an\nallergen\nsuch as pollen, mold, animal dander, or dust, the body releases chemicals that cause allergy symptoms.\nHay fever involves an\nallergic reaction\nto pollen.\nPlants that cause hay fever are trees, grasses, and ragweed. Their pollen is carried by the wind. Flower pollen is carried by insects and does not cause hay fever."}

Their pollen is carried by the wind. Flower pollen is carried by insects and does not cause hay fever. Types of plants that cause hay fever vary from person to person and from area to area.\nThe amount of pollen in the air can affect whether hay fever symptoms develop or not.\nHot, dry, windy days are more likely to have a lot of pollen in the air.\nOn cool, damp, rainy days, most pollen is washed to the ground.\nHay fever and allergies often run in families. If both of your parents have hay fever or other allergies, you are likely to have hay fever and allergies, too."}

If both of your parents have hay fever or other allergies, you are likely to have hay fever and allergies, too. The chance is higher if your mother has allergies.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms that occur shortly after you come into contact with the substance you are allergic to may include:\nItchy nose, mouth, eyes, throat, skin, or any area\nProblems with smell\nRunny nose\nSneezing\nWatery eyes\nSymptoms that may develop later include:\nStuffy nose (nasal congestion)\nCoughing\nClogged ears and decreased sense of smell\nSore throat\nDark circles under the eyes\nPuffiness under the eyes\nFatigue\nand irritability\nHeadache\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. You will be asked whether your symptoms vary by time of day or season, and exposure to pets or other allergens.\nAllergy testing may reveal the pollen or other substances that trigger your symptoms.\nSkin testing\nis the most common method of allergy testing.\nIf your provider determines you cannot have skin testing, special blood tests may help with the diagnosis."}

These tests, known as IgE RAST tests, can measure the levels of allergy-related substances.\nA blood test, called the\neosinophil\ncount, may also help diagnose allergies.\nTreatment\nLIFESTYLE AND AVOIDING ALLERGENS\nThe best treatment is to avoid the pollens that cause your symptoms. It may be impossible to avoid all pollen. But you can often\ntake steps to reduce your exposure\n.\nYou may be prescribed medicine to treat allergic rhinitis. The medicine your provider prescribes depends on your symptoms and how severe they are. Your age and whether you have other medical conditions, such as asthma, will also be considered.\nFor mild allergic rhinitis, a nasal wash can help remove mucus from the nose."}

You can buy a saline solution at a drug store or make one at home using 1 cup (240 milliliters) of distilled or boiled then cooled water, half a teaspoon (3 grams) of salt, and pinch of baking soda.\nTreatments for allergic rhinitis include:\nANTIHISTAMINES\nMedicines called\nantihistamines\nwork well for treating allergy symptoms. They may be used when symptoms do not happen often or do not last long. Be aware of the following:\nMany antihistamines taken by mouth can be bought without a prescription.\nSome can cause sleepiness. You should not drive or operate machines after taking this type of medicine.\nOthers cause little or no sleepiness.\nAntihistamine nasal sprays work well for treating allergic rhinitis. Ask your provider if you should try these medicines first.\nAntihistamine eye drops can be used as needed for itchy, watery eyes.\nCORTICOSTEROIDS\nNasal corticosteroid sprays\nare the most effective treatment for allergic rhinitis."}

They can even help when used intermittently.\nCorticosteroid sprays are generally safe for children and adults.\nMany brands are available without a prescription. For specific brands, you may need a prescription from your provider.\nDECONGESTANTS\nDecongestants may also be helpful for reducing symptoms such as nasal stuffiness.\nDo not use nasal spray decongestants for more than 3 days.\nOTHER MEDICINES\nLeukotriene inhibitors are prescription medicines that block leukotrienes. These are the chemicals the body releases in response to an allergen that also trigger symptoms. These medicines can cause side effects such as anxiety or depression in some people."}

Speak with your provider before starting these medications if you have a history of mental health issues.\nALLERGY SHOTS\nAllergy shots (immunotherapy)\nare sometimes recommended if you cannot avoid the pollen and your symptoms are hard to control. This includes regular shots of the pollen you are allergic to. Each dose is slightly larger than the dose before it, until you reach the dose that helps control your symptoms. Allergy shots may help your body adjust to the pollen that is causing the reaction.\nSUBLINGUAL IMMUNOTHERAPY TREATMENT (SLIT)\nInstead of shots, medicine put under the tongue may help for grass and ragweed allergies.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost symptoms of allergic rhinitis can be treated with medicines. More severe cases need allergy shots.\nSome people, especially children, may outgrow an allergy as the immune system becomes less sensitive to the trigger."}

During pollen season, you should stay indoors where it is air-conditioned, if possible. Sleep with the windows closed, and drive with the windows rolled up.\nAlternative Names\nHay fever; Nasal allergies; Seasonal allergy; Seasonal allergic rhinitis;  Allergies - allergic rhinitis; Allergy - allergic rhinitis\nPatient Instructions\nAllergic rhinitis - what to ask your doctor - adult\nAllergic rhinitis - what to ask your doctor - child\nImages\nAllergic rhinitis\nAllergy symptoms\nRecognizing invader\nReferences\nCorren J, Baroody FM, Togias A.
