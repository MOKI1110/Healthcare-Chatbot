Septic arthritis that is due to the bacteria that cause\ngonorrhea\n, has different symptoms and is called\ngonococcal arthritis\n.\nCauses\nSeptic arthritis develops when bacteria or other tiny disease-causing organisms (microorganisms) spread through the blood to a joint. It may also occur when the joint is directly infected with a microorganism from an injury or during surgery."}

It may also occur when the joint is directly infected with a microorganism from an injury or during surgery. Joints that are commonly affected are the knee and hip.\nMost cases of\nacute\nseptic arthritis are caused by staphylococcus or streptococcus bacteria.\nChronic septic arthritis (which is less common) is caused by organisms including\nMycobacterium tuberculosis\nand\nCandida albicans\n.\nThe following conditions increase your risk for septic arthritis:\nArtificial joint implants\nBacterial infection somewhere else in your body\nPresence of bacteria in your blood\nChronic\nillness or disease (such as diabetes,\nrheumatoid arthritis\n, and\nsickle cell disease\n)\nIntravenous (IV) or injection drug use\nMedicines that suppress your immune system\nRecent joint injury\nRecent joint arthroscopy or other joint surgery\nSeptic arthritis may be seen at any age. In children, it occurs most often in those younger than 3 years. The hip is often the site of infection in infants. Most cases are caused by the bacteria group B streptococcus."}

Another common cause is\nHaemophilus influenza\n, especially if the child has not been vaccinated for this bacterium.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms usually come on quickly. There is a fever and\njoint swelling\nthat is usually in just one joint. There is also intense joint pain, which gets worse with movement.\nSymptoms in newborns or infants:\nCrying when infected joint is moved (for example, during diaper changes)\nFever\nNot able to move the limb with the infected joint (pseudoparalysis)\nFussiness\nSymptoms in children and adults:\nNot able to move the limb with the infected joint (pseudoparalysis)\nSevere joint pain\nJoint swelling\nJoint redness\nFever\nChills may occur, but are uncommon.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine the joint and ask about the symptoms.\nTests that may be done include:\nAspiration of joint fluid\nfor cell count, examination of crystals under the microscope, Gram stain, and\nculture\nBlood culture\nX-ray of affected joint\nBlood work including\ncomplete blood count\n(CBC)\nT"}

After the joint starts to heal, exercising it can help speed up recovery.\nIf joint (synovial) fluid builds up quickly due to the infection, a needle may be inserted into the joint to withdraw (\naspirate\n) the fluid. Severe cases may need surgery to drain the infected joint fluid and irrigate (wash) the joint.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nRecovery is good with prompt antibiotic treatment. If treatment is delayed, permanent joint damage may result.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact for an appointment with your provider if you develop symptoms of septic arthritis.\nPrevention\nPreventive (prophylactic) antibiotics may be helpful for people at high risk.\nAlternative Names\nBacterial arthritis; Non-gonococcal bacterial arthritis\nImages\nBacteria\nReferences\nCook PP, Siraj DS.
