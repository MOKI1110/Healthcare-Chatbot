It uses products that supply low doses of nicotine. These products do not contain the other toxins found in smoke. The goal of therapy is to cut down on cravings for nicotine and ease the symptoms of nicotine withdrawal.\nInformation\nBefore you start using a nicotine replacement product, here are some things to know:\nThe more cigarettes you smoke, the higher the dose you may need to start.\nAdding a\ncounseling program\nwill increase your chances of quitting.\nDo not smoke while using nicotine replacement. It can cause nicotine to build up to toxic levels.\nNicotine replacement helps prevent weight gain while you are using it. You may still gain weight when you stop all nicotine use.\nThe dose of nicotine should be slowly decreased.\nTYPES OF NICOTINE REPLACEMENT THERAPY\nNicotine supplements come in many forms:\nGum\nInhalers\nLozenges\nNasal spray\nSkin patch\nAll of these work equally well if they are used correctly."}

People are more likely to use the gum and patches correctly than other forms.\nNicotine patch\nYou can buy nicotine patches without a prescription. Or, you can have your health care provider prescribe the patch for you.\nAll nicotine patches are placed and used in similar ways:\nA single patch is worn each day. It is replaced after 24 hours.\nPlace the patch on different areas above the waist and below the neck each day.\nPut the patch on a hairless spot of your body.\nPeople who wear the patches for 24 hours will have fewer withdrawal symptoms.\nIf wearing the patch at night causes odd dreams, try sleeping without the patch.\nPeople who smoke fewer than 10 cigarettes per day or who weigh less than 99 pounds (45 kilograms) should start with a lower dose patch. Check with your provider about the best dose for you.\nNicotine gum or lozenge\nYou can buy nicotine gum or lozenges without a prescription."}

Check with your provider about the best dose for you.\nNicotine gum or lozenge\nYou can buy nicotine gum or lozenges without a prescription. Some people prefer gum or lozenges to the patch because they can control the nicotine dose more precisely.\nTips for using the gum:\nFollow the instructions that comes with the package.\nIf you are just starting to quit, chew 1 to 2 pieces each hour. Do not chew more than 24 pieces a day.\nChew the gum slowly until it develops a peppery taste. Then, keep it between the gum and cheek and store it there. This lets the nicotine be absorbed.\nWait at least 15 minutes after drinking coffee, tea, soft drinks, and acidic beverages before chewing a piece of gum.\nPeople who smoke 25 or more cigarettes per day have better results with the 4 mg dose than with the 2 mg dose.\nThe goal is to stop using the gum by 12 weeks. Talk with your provider before using the gum for a longer period.\nNicotine inhaler\nThe nicotine inhaler looks like a plastic cigarette holder. It requires a prescription in the United States.\nInsert nicotine cartridges into the inhaler and puff for about 20 minutes."}

It requires a prescription in the United States.\nInsert nicotine cartridges into the inhaler and puff for about 20 minutes. Do this up to 16 times a day.\nThe inhaler is quick-acting. It takes about the same time as the gum to act. It is faster than the 2 to 4 hours it takes for the patch to work.\nThe inhaler satisfies oral urges.\nMost of the nicotine vapor does not go into the airways of the lung. Some people have mouth or throat irritation and cough with the inhaler.\nIt can help to use the inhaler and patch together when quitting.\nNicotine nasal spray\nThe nasal spray needs to be prescribed by a provider.\nThe spray gives a quick dose of nicotine to satisfy a craving you are unable to ignore. Levels of nicotine peak within 5 to 10 minutes after using the spray.\nFollow your provider's instructions about how to use the spray. When you're starting to quit, you may be told to spray 1 to 2 times in each nostril, every hour. You should not spray more than 80 times in 1 day.\nThe spray should not be used for longer than 6 months.\nThe spray can irritate the nose, eyes, and throat."}

These side effects often go away in a few days.\nSIDE EFFECTS AND RISKS\nAll nicotine products may cause side effects. Symptoms are more likely when you use very high doses. Reducing the dose can prevent these symptoms. Side effects include:\nHeadaches\nNausea and other digestive problems\nProblems getting to sleep in the first few days, most often with the patch. This problem usually passes.\nSPECIAL CONCERNS\nNicotine patches are OK for use by most people with stable heart or blood circulation problems. But, the unhealthy lower HDL cholesterol level (lower HDL level) caused by smoking does not get better until the nicotine patch is stopped.\nNicotine replacement may not be completely safe in pregnant women. Patches and inhalers used during pregnancy may have negative effects on the lungs, heart, brain and other body systems in the unborn child.\nKeep all nicotine products away from children."}
