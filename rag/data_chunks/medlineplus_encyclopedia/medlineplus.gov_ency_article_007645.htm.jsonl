Most surgical wound infections show up within the first 30 days after surgery.\nSurgical wound infections may have pus draining from them and can be red, painful or hot to touch. You might have a fever and feel sick.\nCauses\nSurgical wounds can become infected by:\nGerms that are already on your skin that spread to the surgical wound\nGerms that are inside your body or from the organ on which the surgery was performed\nGerms that are in the environment around you\nYou are more at risk for a surgical wound infection if you:\nHave poorly controlled diabetes\nHave problems with your immune system\nAre overweight or obese\nAre a smoker\nTake corticosteroids (for example, prednisone)\nHave surgery that lasts longer than 2 hours\nHave certain types of surgery, such as a surgery to treat an infection (like an abscess)\nThere are different levels of wound infections:\nSuperficial -- the infecti"}

Sometimes, you also may need surgery to treat the infection.\nANTIBIOTICS\nYou may be started on antibiotics to treat the surgical wound infection. The length of time you will need to take the antibiotics varies, but will typically be for at least 1 week. You may be started on antibiotics through a vein (IV) and then changed to pills later. Take all of your antibiotics and complete the entire course of treatment, even if you feel better.\nIf there is drainage from your wound, it may be tested to figure out the best antibiotic. Some wounds are infected with\nmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)\nwhich is resistant to commonly used antibiotics."}

Some wounds are infected with\nmethicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)\nwhich is resistant to commonly used antibiotics. A MRSA infection will need a specific antibiotic to treat it.\nSURGICAL TREATMENT\nSometimes, your surgeon needs to do a procedure to clean the wound. They can take care of this either in the operating room, in your hospital room or in a clinic. They will:\nOpen the wound by removing some or all of the staples or sutures\nDo tests of the pus or tissue in the wound to figure out if there is an infection and what kind of antibiotic medicine would work best\nDebride the wound by removing dead or infected tissue in the wound\nRinse the wound with salt water (saline solution)\nDrain the pocket of pus (abscess), if present\nPack the wound with saline-soaked dressings and cover it with a bandage\nWOUND CARE\nYour surgical\nwound may need to be cleaned and the dressing changed\non a regular basis. You may learn to do this yourself, or nurses may do it for you. If you do this yourself, you will:\nRemove the old bandage and packing."}

You can shower to wet the wound, which allows the bandage to come off more easily.\nClean the wound.\nPut in new, clean packing material and put on a new bandage.\nTo help some surgical wounds heal, you may have a wound VAC (vacuum-assisted closure) dressing. It increases blood flow in the wound and helps with healing.\nThis is a negative pressure (vacuum) dressing.\nThere is a vacuum pump, a foam piece cut to fit the wound, and a vacuum tube.\nA clear dressing is taped on top.\nThe dressing and the foam piece are changed every 2 to 3 days.\nIt may take days, weeks, or even months for the wound to be clean, clear of infection, and finally heal.\nIf the wound does not close by itself, you may need a skin graft or muscle flap surgery to close the wound. If a muscle flap is necessary, the surgeon may take a piece of muscle from your buttocks, shoulder, or upper chest to put over your wound."}

After that, you will either:\nGo home and follow-up with your surgeon.
