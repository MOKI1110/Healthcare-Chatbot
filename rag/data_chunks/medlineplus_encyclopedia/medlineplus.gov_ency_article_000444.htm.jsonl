Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFungal arthritis\nFungal arthritis\nFungal arthritis is\nswelling\nand irritation (inflammation) of a joint by a fungal infection. It is also called mycotic arthritis.\nCauses\nFungal arthritis is a rare condition. It can be caused by any of the invasive types of fungi. The infection can result from an infection in another organ, such as the lungs and travel to a joint through the bloodstream. A joint can also become infected during a surgery. People with weakened immune systems who travel or live in areas where the fungi are common, are more susceptible to most causes of fungal arthritis.\nConditions that can cause fungal arthritis include:\nBlastomycosis\nCandidiasis\nCoccidioidomycosis\nCryptococcosis\nHistoplasmosis\nSporotrichosis\nSymptoms\nThe fungus can affect bone or joint tissue."}

Commonly used antifungal medicines are amphotericin B or medicines in the azole family (fluconazole, ketoconazole, or itraconazole).\nChronic or advanced bone or joint infection may require surgery (debridement) to remove the infected tissue.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well you do depends on the underlying cause of the infection and your overall health."}
