It is most commonly caused by bacteria called\nSalmonella typhi\n(\nS typhi\n).\nCauses\nS typhi\nis spread through contaminated food, drink, or water. If you eat or drink something that is contaminated with the bacteria, the bacteria enter your body. They travel into your intestines, and then into your blood. In the blood, they travel to your lymph nodes, gallbladder, liver, spleen, and other parts of the body.\nSome people become carriers of\nS typhi\nand continue to release the bacteria in their stools, sometimes for years, spreading the disease.\nTyphoid fever is common in developing countries. Most cases in the United States are brought in from other countries where typhoid fever is common.\nSymptoms\nEarly symptoms include fever, general ill-feeling, and abdominal pain."}
