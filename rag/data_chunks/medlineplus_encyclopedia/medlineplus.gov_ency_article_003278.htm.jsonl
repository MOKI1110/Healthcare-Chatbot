Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLordosis - lumbar\nLordosis - lumbar\nLordosis is the inward curve of the lumbar spine (just above the buttocks). A small degree of lordosis is normal. Too much curving is called swayback.\nCauses\nLordosis tends to make the buttocks appear more prominent. Children with hyperlordosis will have a large space underneath the lower back when lying face up on a hard surface.\nSome children have marked lordosis that most often fixes itself as the child grows. This is called benign juvenile lordosis.\nSpondylolisthesis\nmay cause lordosis. In this condition, a bone (vertebra) in the spine slips out of the proper position onto the bone below it. You may be born with this. It can develop after certain sports activities, such as gymnastics. It may develop along with arthritis in the spine.\nMuch less common causes in children include:\nAchondroplasia\n, a disorder of bone growth that causes the most common type of dwarfism\nMuscular dystrophy\nOther genetic conditions\nHome Care\nMost of the time, lordosis is not treated if the back is flexible."}

It is not likely to progress or cause problems.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you notice that your child has an exaggerated posture or a curve in the back. Your provider must check to see if there is a medical problem.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nThe provider will do a physical exam. To examine the spine, your child may have to bend forward, to the side, and to lie flat on a table. If the lordotic curve is flexible (when the child bends forward the curve reverses itself), it is generally not a concern. If the curve does not move, medical evaluation and treatment are needed.\nOther tests may be needed, particularly if the curve seems \"fixed\" (not bendable). These may include:\nLumbosacral spine x-ray\nOther tests to rule out disorders that could be causing the condition\nMRI of the spine\nLaboratory tests\nAlternative Names\nSwayback; Arched back; Lordosis - lumbar\nImages\nSkeletal spine\nLordosis\nReferences\nMistovich RJ, Spiegel DA."}
