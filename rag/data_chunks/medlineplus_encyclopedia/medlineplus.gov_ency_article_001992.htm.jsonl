While drinking coffee or alcohol? When bored? While driving? Right after a meal or sex? During a work break? While watching TV or playing cards? When you are with other smokers?\nLet your friends, family, and co-workers know of your plan to stop smoking. Tell them your quit date.

Tell them your quit date. It can be helpful if they know what you are going through, especially when you are grumpy.\nGet rid of all your cigarettes just before the quit date. Clean anything that smells of smoke, such as clothes and furniture.\nMAKE A PLAN\nPlan what you will do instead of smoking at those times when you are most likely to smoke.\nBe as specific as possible. For example, if in the past you smoked when drinking a cup of coffee, drink tea instead. Tea may not trigger the desire for a cigarette. Or, when you feel stressed, take a walk instead of smoking a cigarette.\nGet rid of cigarettes in the car. Put pretzels  or other low calorie healthy snack there instead.\nFind activities that focus your hands and mind, but make sure they are not taxing or fattening. Computer games, solitaire, knitting, sewing, and crossword puzzles may help.\nIf you normally smoke after eating, find other ways to end a meal. Eat a piece of fruit. Get up and make a phone call. Take a walk (a good distraction that also burns calories).\nCHANGE YOUR LIFESTYLE\nMake other\nchanges in your lifestyle\n. Change your daily schedule and habits."}

Eat at different times, or eat several small meals instead of three large ones. Sit in a different chair or even a different room.\nSatisfy your oral habits in other ways. Eat celery, carrots, or another low-calorie snack. Chew sugarless gum. Suck on a cinnamon stick. Pretend-smoke with a straw.\nGet more exercise. Take walks or ride a bike. Exercise helps relieve the urge to smoke.\nSET SOME GOALS\nSet short-term quitting goals and reward yourself when you meet them. Every day, put the money you normally spend on cigarettes in a jar. Later, spend that money on something you like.\nTry not to think about all the days ahead you will need to avoid smoking. Take it one day at a time.\nJust one puff or one cigarette will make your desire for cigarettes even stronger. However, it is normal to make mistakes. So even if you have one cigarette, you do not need to take the next one.\nOTHER TIPS\nEnroll in a\nstop smoking support program\n."}
