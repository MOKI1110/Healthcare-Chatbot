Veins and arteries vary in size, so it may be harder to take a blood sample from one person than another.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to check for disease of the pancreas, most often\nacute pancreatitis\n.\nLipase appears in excessive amounts in the blood when the pancreas is damaged.\nNormal Results\nIn general, normal results are 0 to 160 units per liter (U/L) or 0 to 2.67 microkat/L ( µkat/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurement methods."}
