Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nIllness anxiety disorder\nIllness anxiety disorder\nIllness anxiety disorder (IAD) is a preoccupation that physical symptoms are signs of a serious illness, even when there is no medical evidence to support the presence of an illness.\nCauses\nPeople with IAD are overly focused on, and always thinking about, their physical health. They have an unrealistic fear of having or developing a serious disease. This disorder occurs equally in men and women.\nThe way people with IAD think about their physical symptoms can make them more likely to have this condition. As they focus on and worry about physical sensations, a cycle of symptoms and worry begins, which can be hard to stop.\nIt is important to realize that people with IAD do not purposely create these symptoms. They aren't able to control the symptoms.\nPeople who have a history of physical or sexual abuse are more likely to have IAD. But this doesn't mean that everyone with IAD has a history of abuse.\nSymptoms\nPeople with IAD can't control their fears and worries."}

But this doesn't mean that everyone with IAD has a history of abuse.\nSymptoms\nPeople with IAD can't control their fears and worries. They often believe any symptom or sensation is a sign of a serious illness.\nThey seek out reassurance from family, friends, or health care providers on a regular basis. They feel better for a short time and then begin to worry about the same symptoms or new symptoms.\nSymptoms may shift and change, and are often vague. People with IAD often examine their own body.\nSome may realize that their fear is unreasonable or unfounded.\nIAD is different from\nsomatic symptom disorder\n. With somatic symptom disorder, the person has physical pain or other symptoms, but the medical cause isn't found.\nExams and Tests\nThe provider will perform a physical exam. Tests may be ordered to look for illness. A mental health evaluation may be done to look for other related disorders.\nTreatment\nIt is important to have a supportive relationship with a provider. There should be only one primary care provider."}

There should be only one primary care provider. This helps avoid having too many tests and procedures, some of which may be harmful.\nFinding a mental health provider who has experience treating this disorder with talk therapy can be helpful. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a kind of talk therapy, can help you deal with your symptoms. During therapy, you will learn:\nTo recognize what seems to make the symptoms worse\nTo develop methods of coping with the symptoms\nTo keep yourself more active, even if you still have symptoms\nAntidepressants can help reduce the worry and physical symptoms of this disorder if talk therapy has not been effective or only partially effective.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe disorder is usually long-term (chronic), unless psychological factors or mood and anxiety disorders are treated.\nPossible Complications\nComplications of IAD may include:\nComplications from invasive medical testing to look for the cause of symptoms\nDependence on pain relievers or sedatives\nDepression, anxiety, or panic disorder\nLost time from"}
