Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPeripheral arterial line - infants\nPeripheral arterial line - infants\nA peripheral arterial line (PAL) is a tiny, short, flexible catheter that is put through the skin into an artery of the arm or leg. Health care providers sometimes call it an \"art line\" or \"a pal.\" This article addresses PALs in babies.\nWHY IS A PAL USED?\nProviders use a PAL to watch your baby's blood pressure. A PAL can also be used to take frequent blood samples, rather than having to puncture the skin repeatedly to draw blood from a baby. A PAL is often needed if a baby has:\nSevere lung or heart disease and is on a ventilator or other life support (for example, ECMO)\nLow blood pressure requiring medicine\nProlonged illness or immaturity requiring frequent blood tests\nHOW IS A PAL PLACED?\nFirst, the provider cleans the baby's skin with a germ-killing medicine (antiseptic). Then the small catheter is put into the artery."}

Then the small catheter is put into the artery. The PAL is then connected to an IV fluid bag and blood pressure monitor.\nWHAT ARE THE RISKS OF A PAL?\nRisks include:\nThe greatest risk is that the PAL can stop blood from going to the hand or foot. Testing before the PAL is placed can prevent this complication in most cases. The\nNICU nurses\nwill carefully watch your baby for this problem.\nPALs have a greater risk for bleeding than standard IVs.\nThere is a small risk for infection, but it is lower than the risk from a standard IV.\nAlternative Names\nPAL - infants; Art line - infants; Arterial line - neonatal\nImages\nPeripheral arterial line\nReferences\nDonn SM, Stepanovich GE, Attar MA.
