Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCollapsed lung (pneumothorax)\nCollapsed lung (pneumothorax)\nA collapsed lung occurs when air escapes from the lung. The air then can fill the space outside of the lung between the lung and chest wall. This buildup of air puts pressure on the lung, so it cannot expand as much as it normally does when you take a breath.\nThe medical name of this condition is pneumothorax.\nCauses\nCollapsed lung can be caused by an injury to the lung. Injuries can include a gunshot or knife wound to the chest, rib fracture, or certain medical procedures.\nIn some cases, a collapsed lung is caused by air blisters of the lung (blebs) that break open, sending air into the space around the lung. This can result from air pressure changes such as when scuba diving or traveling to a high altitude.\nTall, thin people and smokers are more at risk for a collapsed lung.\nLung diseases can also increase the chance of getting a collapsed lung."}

These include:\nAsthma\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n(COPD)\nCystic fibrosis\nTuberculosis\nWhooping cough\nIn some cases, a collapsed lung occurs without any cause. This is called a spontaneous collapsed lung or spontaneous pneumothorax.\nSymptoms\nCommon symptoms of a collapsed lung include:\nSharp chest or shoulder pain, made worse by a deep breath or a cough\nShortness of breath\nNasal flaring\n(from shortness of breath)\nA larger pneumothorax causes more severe symptoms, including:\nBluish color\nof the skin due to lack of oxygen (cyanosis)\nChest tightness\nLightheadedness and near fainting\nEasy fatigue\nAbnormal breathing patterns or increased effort of breathing\nRapid heart rate\nShock\nand collapse\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will listen to your breathing with a stethoscope.

You may only need oxygen treatment and rest.\nYour provider may use a needle to allow the air to escape from around the lung so it can expand more fully. You may be allowed to go home if you live near the hospital.\nIf you have a large pneumothorax, a\nchest tube\nwill be placed between the ribs into the space around the lungs to help drain the air and allow the lung to re-expand. The chest tube may be left in place for several days and you may need to stay in the hospital. If a small chest tube or flutter valve is used, you may be able to go home."}

You will need to return to the hospital to have the tube or valve removed.\nSome people with a collapsed lung need extra oxygen.\nLung surgery\nmay be needed to treat a collapsed lung or to prevent future episodes. The area where the leak occurred may be repaired. Sometimes, a special chemical is placed into the area of the collapsed lung. This chemical causes a scar to form. This procedure is called pleurodesis.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf you have a spontaneous collapsed lung, you are more likely to have another one in the future if you:\nAre tall and thin\nContinue to smoke\nHave had two collapsed lung episodes in the past\nHow well you do after having a collapsed lung depends on what caused it.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include any of the following:\nAnother collapsed lung in the future\nShock\n,  if there are serious injuries or infection, severe inflammation, or fluid in the lung develops\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of a colla"}
