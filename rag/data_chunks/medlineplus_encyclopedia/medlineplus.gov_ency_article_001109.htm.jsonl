They are often red or blue in color. They most often appear in the legs, but can occur in other parts of the body.\nCauses\nNormally, one-way valves in your leg veins keep blood moving up toward the heart. When the valves do not work properly, they allow blood to back up into the vein. The vein swells from the blood that collects there, which causes varicose veins over time.\nVaricose veins are common, and affect more women than men. They do not cause problems for most people."}
