It occurs as the result of an inflammatory reaction or an infection from a virus, bacteria, or fungus.\nCauses\nThe sinuses are air-filled spaces in the skull. They are located behind the forehead, nasal bones, cheeks, and eyes. Most of the time, mucus is able to drain out and air is able to flow through the sinuses.\nWhen the sinus openings become blocked or too much mucus builds up, bacteria and other germs can grow more easily.\nSinusitis can occur from one of these conditions:\nSmall hairs (cilia) in the sinuses fail to properly move mucus out."}

This may be due to some medical conditions.\nColds and allergies may cause too much mucus to be made or the associated inflammation may block the opening of the sinuses.\nA deviated nasal septum, nasal bone spur, or\nnasal polyps\nmay block the opening of the sinuses.\nChronic infection can cause mucosal swelling and inflammation.\nThere are three types of sinusitis:\nAcute sinusitis is when symptoms are present for 4 weeks or less. It is caused by viruses or bacteria growing in the sinuses.\nChronic sinusitis is when the symptoms and swelling of the sinuses is present for longer than 3 months."}

They may help at first, but using them for more than 3 to 5 days can make nasal stuffiness worse and lead to dependence.\nTo help ease sinus pain or pressure:\nAvoid flying when you are congested.\nAvoid temperature extremes, sudden changes in temperature, and bending forward with your head down.\nTry acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or naproxen.\nMEDICINE AND OTHER TREATMENTS\nMost of the time, antibiotics are not needed for acute sinusitis. Most of these infections go away on their own. Even when antibiotics do help, they may only slightly reduce the time it takes for the infection to go away."}
