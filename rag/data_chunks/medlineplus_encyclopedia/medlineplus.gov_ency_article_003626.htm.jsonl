It is done to look at fluid that has built up in the space in the abdomen around the internal organs. This area is called the peritoneal space. The condition is called\nascites\n.\nThe test to obtain the fluid is known as paracentesis or abdominal tap.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe sample of fluid is removed from\nthe peritoneal space using a needle and syringe\n. Ultrasound is often used to direct the needle to the fluid.\nYour health care provider will clean and numb a small area of your belly area (abdomen). A needle is inserted through the skin of your abdomen and a fluid sample is pulled out. The fluid is collected into a tube (syringe) attached to the end of the needle.\nThe fluid is sent to a lab where it is examined."}
