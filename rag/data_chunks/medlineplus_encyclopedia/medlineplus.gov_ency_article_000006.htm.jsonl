Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTraumatic amputation\nTraumatic amputation\nTraumatic amputation is the loss of a body part, usually a finger, toe, arm, or leg, that occurs as the result of an accident or injury.\nConsiderations\nIf an accident or trauma results in complete amputation (the body part is totally severed), the part sometimes can be reattached, often when proper care is taken of the severed part and stump, or residual limb.\nIn a partial amputation, some soft-tissue connection remains. Depending on how severe the injury is, the partially severed extremity may or may not be able to be reattached.\nComplications often occur when a body part is amputated. The most important of these are bleeding,\nshock\n, phantom pain and infection.\nThe long-term outcome for an amputee depends on early emergency and critical care management. A well-fitting and functional prosthesis and retraining can speed rehabilitation.\nCauses\nTraumatic amputations usually result from factory, farm, power tool accidents, or from motor vehicle accidents."}

Natural disasters, war, and terrorist attacks can also cause traumatic amputations.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nBleeding (may be minimal or severe, depending on the location and nature of the injury)\nPain (the degree of pain is not always related to the severity of the injury or the amount of bleeding)\nCrushed body tissue (badly mangled, but still partially attached by muscle, bone, tendon, or skin)\nFirst Aid\nSteps to take:\nCheck the person's airway (open if necessary); check breathing and circulation. If necessary, begin rescue breathing, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (\nCPR\n), or\nbleeding control\n.\nCall for medical help.\nTry to calm and reassure the person as much as possible. Amputation is painful and  very frightening.\nControl bleeding by applying direct pressure to the wound. Raise the injured area. If bleeding continues, recheck the source of the bleeding and reapply direct pressure, with help from someone who is not tired."}

Raise the injured area. If bleeding continues, recheck the source of the bleeding and reapply direct pressure, with help from someone who is not tired. If the person has life-threatening bleeding, a tight bandage or tourniquet will be easier to use than direct pressure on the wound. However, using a tight bandage for a long time may do more harm than good.\nSave any severed body parts and make sure they  stay with the person. If possible, remove  any dirty material that can contaminate the wound, then gently rinse the body part if the cut end is dirty.\nWrap the severed part in a clean, damp cloth, place it in a sealed plastic bag and place the bag in an ice water bath.\nDo not put the body part directly in water or ice without using a plastic bag.\nDo not put the severed part directly on ice. Do not use dry ice as this will cause frostbite and injury to the part.\nIf cold water is not available, keep the part away from heat as much as possible. Save it for the medical team, or take it to the hospital. Cooling the severed part allows a longer window of time for later reattachment."}

Save it for the medical team, or take it to the hospital. Cooling the severed part allows a longer window of time for later reattachment. Without cooling, the severed part is only good for reattachment for about 4 to 6 hours.\nKeep the person warm and calm.\nTake steps to prevent shock. Lay the person flat, raise the feet about 12 inches (30 centimeters), and cover the person with a coat or blanket. Do not place the person in this position if a head, neck, back, or leg injury is suspected or if it makes the victim uncomfortable.\nOnce the bleeding is under control, check the person for other signs of injury that require emergency treatment."}

Wear seat belts when driving a motor vehicle."}
