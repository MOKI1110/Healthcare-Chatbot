The kidneys also help control the body's chemical balance.\nThe kidneys are part of the urinary system, which also includes the ureters, bladder, and urethra.\nMuscle changes and changes in the reproductive system can affect bladder control.\nAGING CHANGES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE KIDNEYS AND BLADDER\nAs you age, your kidneys and bladder change. This can affect their function.\nChanges in the kidneys that occur with age:\nAmount of kidney tissue decreases and kidney function diminishes.\nNumber of filtering units (nephrons) decreases. Nephrons filter waste material from the blood.\nBlood vessels supplying the kidneys can become hardened. This causes the kidneys to filter blood more slowly.\nChanges in the bladder:\nThe bladder wall changes. The elastic tissue becomes stiffer and the bladder becomes less stretchy."}

This causes the kidneys to filter blood more slowly.\nChanges in the bladder:\nThe bladder wall changes. The elastic tissue becomes stiffer and the bladder becomes less stretchy. The bladder cannot hold as much urine as before.\nThe bladder muscles weaken.\nThe urethra can become partially or totally blocked. In women, this can be due to weakened muscles that cause the bladder or vagina to fall out of position (prolapse). In men, the urethra can become blocked by an enlarged\nprostate gland\n.\nIn a healthy aging person, kidney function declines very slowly. Illness, medicines, and other conditions can significantly degrade kidney function.\nCOMMON PROBLEMS\nAging increases the risk of kidney and bladder problems such as:\nBladder control issues, such as leakage or\nurinary incontinence\n(not being able to hold your urine), or urinary retention (not being able to completely empty your bladder)\nBladder and other\nurinary tract infections\n(UTIs)\nChronic kidney disease\nWHEN TO CONTACT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL\nContact your health care provider right away if you have any of the following:\nSigns of a urinary tract infection, including fever or chills, burning when urinating, naus"}
