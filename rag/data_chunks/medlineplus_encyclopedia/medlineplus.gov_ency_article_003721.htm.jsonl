This is the space between the lining of the outside of the lungs (pleura) and the wall of the chest. When fluid collects in the pleural space, the condition is called\npleural effusion\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA procedure called\nthoracentesis\nis used to get a sample of pleural fluid. Your health care provider examines a sample of pleural fluid under the microscope. If bacteria, mycobacteria, or fungi are found, other methods may be used to further identify those organisms.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed before the test. An\nultrasound\n,\nchest CT scan\n, or\nchest x-ray\nwill be performed before and after the test.\nDo not cough, breathe deeply, or move during the test to avoid injury to the lung.\nHow the Test will Feel\nFor thoracentesis, you sit on the edge of a chair or bed with your head and arms resting on a table."}

Your provider cleans your skin around the insertion site. Numbing medicine (anesthetic) is injected into your skin.\nA needle is placed through the skin and muscles of your chest wall into the space around the lungs, called the pleural space. As fluid drains into a collection bottle, you may cough a bit. This is because your lung re-expands to fill the space where fluid had been. This sensation may last for a few hours after the test.\nUltrasound is often used to decide where to insert the needle and to get a better view of the fluid in your chest.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is performed if you have a pleural effusion and its cause is not known, especially if your provider suspects an infection or cancer.\nNormal Results\nNormally, no bacteria, fungi, or cancer cells are present in the pleural fluid.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}

Other tests can help identify the specific type of infection or cancer. Sometimes, the test may show abnormalities (such as special types of cells) from conditions such as\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\n.\nRisks\nRisks of thoracentesis are:\nCollapsed lung (\npneumothorax\n)\nExcessive loss of blood\nFluid re-accumulation\nInfection\nPulmonary edema\nRespiratory distress\nCough that doesn't go away\nImages\nPleural smear\nReferences\nBroaddus VC, Light RW.
