The diaphragm is the sheet of muscle that divides the chest from the abdomen.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of hiatal hernia is not known. The condition may be due to weakness of the supporting tissue. Your risk for the problem goes up with age,\nobesity\n, and smoking. Hiatal hernias are very common. The problem occurs often in people over 50 years of age.\nThis condition may be linked to\nreflux\n(backflow) of gastric acid from the stomach into the esophagus.\nChildren with this condition are most often born with it (congenital). In infants, it often occurs with\ngastroesophageal reflux\n.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nChest pain\nHeartburn\n, worse when bending over or lying down\nSwallowing difficulty\nA hiatal hernia by itself rarely causes symptoms."}
