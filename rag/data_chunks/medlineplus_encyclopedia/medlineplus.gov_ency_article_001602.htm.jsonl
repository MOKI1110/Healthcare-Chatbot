This muscle covers the front surface of the belly area.\nCauses\nDiastasis recti is common in newborns. It is seen most often in premature and African American infants.\nPregnant women may develop the condition because of increased tension on the abdominal wall. The risk is higher with multiple births or many pregnancies.\nSymptoms\nA diastasis recti looks like a ridge, which runs down the middle of the belly area. It stretches from the bottom of the breastbone to the belly button. It increases with muscle straining.\nIn infants, the condition is most easily seen when the baby tries to sit up. When the infant is relaxed, you can often feel the edges of the rectus muscles.\nDiastasis recti is commonly seen in women who have multiple pregnancies. This is because the muscles have been stretched many times. Extra skin and soft tissue in the front of the abdominal wall may be the only signs of this condition in early pregnancy."}

This is because the muscles have been stretched many times. Extra skin and soft tissue in the front of the abdominal wall may be the only signs of this condition in early pregnancy. In the later part of pregnancy, the top of the pregnant uterus can be seen bulging out of the abdominal wall. An outline of parts of the unborn baby may be seen in some severe cases.\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider can diagnose this condition with a physical exam.\nTreatment\nNo treatment is needed for pregnant women with this condition.\nIn infants, diastasis recti will disappear over time. Surgery may be needed if the baby develops a\nhernia\nthat becomes trapped in the space between the muscles.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn some cases, diastasis recti heals on its own.\nPregnancy-related diastasis recti often lasts long after the woman gives birth. Exercise may help improve the condition. Umbilical hernia may occur in some cases."}
