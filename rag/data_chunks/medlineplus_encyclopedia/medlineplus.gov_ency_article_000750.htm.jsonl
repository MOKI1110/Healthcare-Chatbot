Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSensorimotor polyneuropathy\nSensorimotor polyneuropathy\nSensorimotor polyneuropathy is a condition that causes a decreased ability to move and feel (sensation) because of nerve damage.\nCauses\nNeuropathy means a disease of, or damage to nerves. When it occurs outside of the central nervous system (CNS), that is, the brain and spinal cord, it is called a\nperipheral neuropathy\n.\nMononeuropathy\nmeans one nerve is involved. Polyneuropathy means that many nerves in different parts of the body are involved.\nNeuropathy can affect nerves that provide feeling (sensory neuropathy) or cause movement (motor neuropathy). It can also affect both, in which case it is called a sensorimotor neuropathy.\nSensorimotor polyneuropathy is a bodywide (systemic) process that damages nerve cells, nerve fibers (\naxons\n), and nerve coverings (\nmyelin\nsheath). Damage to the covering of the nerve cell causes nerve signals to slow or stop. Damage to the nerve fiber or entire nerve cell can make the nerve stop working."}

Damage to the covering of the nerve cell causes nerve signals to slow or stop. Damage to the nerve fiber or entire nerve cell can make the nerve stop working. Some neuropathies develop over years, while others can start and get severe within hours to days.\nNerve damage can be caused by:\nAutoimmune (when the body attacks itself) disorders\nConditions that put pressure on nerves\nDecreased blood flow to the nerve\nDiseases that destroy the glue (connective tissue) that holds cells and tissues together\nSwelling (inflammation) of the nerves\nMedical conditions including metabolic disorders\nToxins\nSome diseases lead to polyneuropathy that is mainly sensory or mainly motor."}

Symptoms usually occur on both sides of the body. Most often, they start at the ends of the toes first.\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms. An exam may show:\nDecreased feeling (may affect touch, pain, vibration, or position sensation)\nDiminished reflexes (most commonly the ankle)\nMuscle atrophy\nMuscle twitches\nMuscle weakness\nParalysis\nTests may include:\nBiopsy\nof the affected nerves\nBlood and urine tests\nElectrical test of the muscles (\nEMG\n)\nElectrical test of\nnerve conduction\nX-rays or other imaging tests, such as MRI\nGenetic testing\nSpinal fluid testing (lumbar puncture/spinal tap)\nTreatment\nGoals of treatment include:\nFinding the cause\nControlling the symptoms\nPromoting a person's self-care and independence\nDepending on the cause, treatment may include:\nChanging medicines, if they are causing the problem\nControlling blood sugar level, when the neuropathy is from diabetes\nNot drinking alcohol\nTaking daily nutritional s"}
