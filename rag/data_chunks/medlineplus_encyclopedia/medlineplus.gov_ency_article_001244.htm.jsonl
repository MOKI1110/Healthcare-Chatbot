People with this illness are not able to do their usual activities. Sometimes, they may be confined to bed. The condition can also be called systemic exertional intolerance disease (SEID).\nOne common symptom is severe\nfatigue\n. It does not get better with rest and is not directly caused by other medical problems. Other symptoms can include problems with thinking and concentrating, pain, and dizziness.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of ME/CFS is unknown. It may have more than one cause. For example, two or more possible causes may work together to trigger the illness.\nResearchers are looking into these possible causes:\nInfection\n-- About 1 out of 10 people who develop certain infections, such as Epstein-Barr virus and Q fever, go on to develop ME/CFS."}

Other infections have also been studied, but not one cause has been found.\nImmune system changes\n-- ME/CFS may be triggered by changes in the way a person's immune system responds to stress or illness.\nMental or physical stress\n-- Many people with ME/CFS have been under serious mental or physical stress before becoming ill.\nEnergy production\n-- The way that cells within the body get energy is different in people with ME/CFS than in people without the condition. It's unclear how this is linked to developing the illness.\nLong COVID or Post-acute sequelae of SARS CoV-2 infection (PASC)\n-- Some people who have been infected with the COVID-19 virus continue to have symptoms weeks or months later. This is called\nlong COVID\n."}

This is called\nlong COVID\n. Because symptoms such as extreme fatigue, difficulty concentrating, dizziness, and sleep problems are similar to ME/CFS, researchers are looking into a possible connection between the two conditions.\nGenetics or environmental factors may also play a role in the development of ME/CFS:\nAnyone can get ME/CFS.\nWhile most common in people between 40 and 60 years old, the illness affects children, adolescents, and adults of all ages.\nAmong adults, women are affected more often than men.\nWhite people are diagnosed more than other races and ethnicities. But many people with ME/CFS have not been diagnosed, particularly among minorities.\nSymptoms\nThere are three main, or \"core,\" symptoms in people with ME/CFS:\nProfound fatigue\nWorsening symptoms after physical or mental activity\nSleep problems\nPeople with ME/CFS have persistent and profound fatigue and are unable to do activities they were able to do before the illness."}

This extreme fatigue is:\nNew\nLasts at least 6 months\nNot due to unusual or intense activity\nNot relieved by sleep or bed rest\nSevere enough to keep you from participating in certain activities\nME/CFS symptoms can become worse after physical or mental activity. This is called post-exertional malaise (PEM), also known as a crash, relapse, or collapse.\nFor example, you may experience a crash after shopping at the grocery store and need to take a nap before driving home. Or you may need someone to come pick you up.\nThere is no way to predict what will cause a crash or know how long it will take to recover. It can take days, weeks, or longer to recover.\nSleep issues may include problems falling or staying asleep."}

This is called orthostatic intolerance. You may feel dizzy, lightheaded, or faint when standing or sitting up. You also may have vision changes or see spots.\nOther common symptoms include:\nJoint pain without swelling or redness, muscle aches,\nmuscle weakness\nall over, or headaches that differ from those you have had in the past\nSore throat, sore lymph nodes in the neck or under the arms, chills and night sweats\nDigestive problems, such as irritable bowel syndrome\nAllergies\nSensitivity to noise, food, odors, or chemicals\nExams and Tests\nThe Centers for Disease Control (CDC) describes ME/CFS as a distinct disorder with specific symptoms and physical signs."}

Mild physical exercise may also be helpful. Your health care team will help you figure out how much activity you can do, and how to slowly increase your activity. Tips include:\nAvoid doing too much on days when you feel tired\nBalance your time between activity, rest, and sleep\nBreak big tasks into smaller, more manageable ones\nSpread out your more challenging tasks throughout the week\nRelaxation and stress-reduction techniques can help manage chronic (long-term) pain and fatigue."}

It is hard to predict at the time that symptoms first start. Some people completely recover after 6 months to a year.\nAbout 1 in 4 people with ME/CFS are so severely disabled that they can't get out of bed or leave their home. Symptoms can come and go in cycles, and even when people feel better, they may experience a relapse triggered by exertion or an unknown cause.\nSome people never feel like they did before they developed ME/CFS."}
