Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTesticular biopsy\nTesticular biopsy\nTesticular\nbiopsy\nis surgery to remove a piece of tissue from the\ntesticles\n. The tissue is examined under a microscope.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe biopsy can be done in a few ways. The type of biopsy you have depends on the reason for the test. Your health care provider will talk to you about your options.\nOpen biopsy may be done in the provider's office, a surgical center, or at a hospital. The skin over the testicle is cleaned with a germ-killing (antiseptic) medicine. The area around it is covered with a sterile towel. A local anesthetic is given to numb the area.\nA small surgical cut is made through the skin. A small piece of the testicle tissue is removed. The opening in the testicle is closed with a stich. Another stitch closes the cut in the skin. The procedure is repeated for the other testicle if necessary.\nNeedle biopsy is most often done in the provider's office. The area is cleaned and local anesthesia is used, just as in the open biopsy. A sample of the testicle is taken using a special needle."}

The procedure does not require a cut in the skin.\nDepending on the reason for the test, a needle biopsy may not be possible or recommended.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider may tell you not to take aspirin or medicines that contain aspirin for 1 week before the procedure. Always ask your provider before stopping any medicines.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThere will be a sting when the anesthetic is given. You should only feel pressure or discomfort similar to a pinprick during the biopsy.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is most often done to find the cause of male\ninfertility\n. It is done when a\nsemen analysis\nsuggests that there is abnormal sperm and other tests have not found the cause. In some cases, sperm obtained from a testicular biopsy can be used to fertilize a woman's egg in the lab. This process is called\nin vitro fertilization\n.\nNormal Results\nSperm development appears normal."}

No cancerous cells are found.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may mean a problem with sperm or hormone function. Biopsy may be able to find the cause of the problem.\nIn some cases, the sperm development appears normal in the testicle, but semen analysis shows no sperm or reduced sperm. This may indicate a blockage of the tube through which the sperm travel from the testes to the urethra. This blockage can sometimes be repaired with surgery.\nOther causes of abnormal results:\ncyst-like lump\nfilled with fluid and dead sperm cells (spermatocele)\nOrchitis\nYour provider will explain and discuss all abnormal results with you.\nRisks\nThere is a slight risk for bleeding or infection. The area may be sore for 2 to 3 days after the biopsy. The scrotum may swell or become discolored. This should clear up within a few days.\nConsiderations\nYour provider may suggest that you wear an athletic supporter for several days after the biopsy."}
