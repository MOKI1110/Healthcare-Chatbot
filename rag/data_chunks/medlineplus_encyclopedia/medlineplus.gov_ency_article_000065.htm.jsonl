Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAtelectasis\nAtelectasis\nAtelectasis is the collapse of part or, much less commonly, all of a lung.\nCauses\nAtelectasis is caused by a blockage of the air passages (bronchus or bronchioles) or by pressure on the outside of the lung. Atelectasis is not the same as another type of collapsed lung called\npneumothorax\n, which occurs when air escapes from the lung. The air then fills the space outside of the lung, between the lung and chest wall. In atelectasis, there is usually fluid between the lung and the chest wall and the air sacs within the lung fill with fluid.\nCommon situations in people with atelectasis include:\nThere is fluid or a tumor that compresses the lung.\nThere is a blockage in the airway not allowing air into the air sacs of the lung.\nThe air sacs collapse when the lung has a condition that decreases production of a protein, called surfactant that normally keeps the air sacs open.\nAtelectasis is common after surgery or in people who are or were in the hospital.\nRisk factors for developing atelectasis include:\nAnesthesia\nUse of a\nbreathing tube\nForeign"}

This allows mucus to drain more easily.\nTreat a tumor or other condition.\nTurn the person to lie on the healthy side, allowing the collapsed area of lung to re-expand.\nUse inhaled medicines to open the airway.\nUse other devices that help increase positive pressure in the airways and clear fluids.\nBe physically active if possible\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn an adult, atelectasis in a small area of the lung is usually not life threatening."}
