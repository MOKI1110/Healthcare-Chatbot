Foods that can interfere with 5-HIAA measurements include plums, pineapples, bananas, eggplant, tomatoes, avocados, and walnuts.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination, and there is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test measures the level of 5-HIAA in the urine."}
