The condition makes it hard for the baby to breathe.\nCauses\nNeonatal RDS occurs in infants whose lungs have not yet fully developed.\nThe disease is mainly caused by a lack of a slippery substance in the lungs called surfactant. This substance helps the lungs fill with air and keeps the air sacs from deflating. Surfactant is present when the lungs are fully developed.\nNeonatal RDS can also be due to genetic problems with lung development.\nMost cases of RDS occur in babies born before 37 to 39 weeks. The more premature the baby is, the higher the chance of RDS after birth."}

The more premature the baby is, the higher the chance of RDS after birth. The problem is uncommon in babies born full-term or later (39 weeks or after).\nOther factors that can increase the risk for RDS include:\nA brother or sister who had RDS\nDiabetes in the mother\nCesarean delivery or induction of labor before the baby is full-term\nProblems with delivery that reduce blood flow to the baby\nMultiple pregnancy (twins or more)\nRapid labor\nSymptoms\nMost of the time, symptoms appear within minutes of birth.

This often develops 6 to 12 hours after birth.\nLab tests -- help to rule out infection as a cause of breathing problems.\nTreatment\nBabies who are premature or have other conditions that make them at high risk for the problem need to be treated at birth by a medical team that specializes in newborn breathing problems.\nInfants will be given warm, moist oxygen."}

However, this treatment needs to be monitored carefully to avoid side effects from too much oxygen.\nGiving extra surfactant to a sick infant has been shown to be helpful. However, the surfactant is delivered directly into the baby's airway, so some risk is involved. More research still needs to be done on which babies should get this treatment and how much to use.\nAssisted ventilation with a ventilator (breathing machine) can be lifesaving for some babies. However, use of a breathing machine can damage the lung tissue, so this treatment should be avoided if possible. Babies may need this treatment if they have:\nHigh level of carbon dioxide in the blood\nLow blood oxygen\nLow blood pH (acidity)\nRepeated pauses in breathing\nA treatment called continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may prevent the need for assisted ventilation or surfactant in many babies. CPAP sends air into the nose to help keep the airways open."}

This includes:\nHaving a calm setting\nGentle handling\nStaying at an ideal body temperature\nCarefully managing fluids and nutrition\nTreating infections right away\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe condition often gets worse for 2 to 4 days after birth and improves slowly after that. Some infants with severe respiratory distress syndrome will die. This most often occurs between days 2 and 7.\nLong-term complications may develop due to:\nToo much oxygen.\nHigh pressure delivered to the lungs.\nMore severe disease or immaturity."}

If you have given birth at home or outside a medical center, get emergency help if your baby has breathing problems.\nPrevention\nTaking steps to prevent premature birth can help prevent neonatal RDS. Good prenatal care and regular checkups beginning as soon as a woman discovers she is pregnant can help avoid premature birth.\nThe risk of RDS can also be lessened by the proper timing of delivery. An induced delivery or cesarean may be needed. A lab test can be done before delivery to check the readiness of the baby's lungs. Unless medically necessary, induced or cesarean deliveries should be delayed until at least 39 weeks or until tests show that the baby's lungs have matured.\nMedicines called corticosteroids can help speed up lung development before a baby is born. They are often given to pregnant women between 24 and 34 weeks of pregnancy who seem likely to deliver in the next week."}

More research is needed to determine if corticosteroids may also benefit babies who are younger than 24 or older than 34 weeks.\nAt times, it may be possible to give other medicines to delay labor and delivery until the steroid medicine has time to work. This treatment may reduce the severity of RDS. It may also help prevent other complications of prematurity. However, it will not totally remove the risks.\nAlternative Names\nHyaline membrane disease (HMD); Infant respiratory distress syndrome; Respiratory distress syndrome in infants; RDS - infants\nReferences\nGreenberg JM, Narendran V, Brady JM, Nathan AT, Haberman BB.
