Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRocky Mountain spotted fever\nRocky Mountain spotted fever\nRocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a disease caused by a type of bacteria carried by ticks.\nCauses\nRMSF is caused by the bacterium\nRickettsia rickettsii (R Rickettsii)\n, which is carried by ticks. The bacteria is spread to humans through a\ntick\nbite.\nIn the western United States, the bacteria are carried by the wood tick. In the eastern US, they are carried by the dog tick. Other ticks spread the infection in the southern US and in Central and South America.\nContrary to the name \"Rocky Mountain,\" most recent cases have been reported in the eastern US. States include North and South Carolina, Virginia, Georgia, Tennessee, and Oklahoma. Most cases occur in the spring and summer and are found in children.\nRisk factors include recent hiking or exposure to ticks in an area where the disease is known to occur. The bacteria are unlikely to be transmitted to a person by a tick that has been attached for less than 20 hours. Only about 1 in 1,000 ticks carry the bacteria."}

The bacteria are unlikely to be transmitted to a person by a tick that has been attached for less than 20 hours. Only about 1 in 1,000 ticks carry the bacteria. Bacteria can also infect people who crush ticks they have removed from pets with their bare fingers. Not all people will remember getting a tick bite.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms usually develop about 2 to 14 days after the tick bite. They may include:\nChills and fever\nConfusion\nHeadache\nMuscle pain\nRash -- usually starts a few days after the fever; first appears on wrists and ankles as spots that are 1 to 5 mm in diameter, then spreads to most of the body. Some infected people don't get a rash.\nOther symptoms that may occur with this disease:\nDiarrhea\nLight sensitivity\nHallucinations\nLoss of appetite\nNausea and vomiting\nAbdominal pain\nThirst\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about your symptoms.\nTests that may be done include:\nAntibody titer\nby\ncomplement\nfixation or immunofluorescence\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nKidney function tests\nPartial thromboplastin time (PTT)\nProthrombin time (PT)\nSkin biopsy taken from the rash to check for\nR."}

To get rid of the infection, antibiotics such as doxycycline or tetracycline need to be taken. Pregnant women are usually prescribed chloramphenicol.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nTreatment usually cures the infection. About 3% of people who get this disease will die.\nPossible Complications\nUntreated, the infection may lead to health problems such as:\nBrain damage\nClotting problems\nHeart failure\nKidney failure\nLung failure\nMeningitis\nPneumonitis (lung inflammation)\nShock\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms after exposure to ticks or a tick bite. The complications of untreated RMSF are often life threatening.\nPrevention\nWhen walking or hiking in tick-infested areas, tuck long pants into socks to protect the legs. Wear shoes and long-sleeved shirts."}

Wear shoes and long-sleeved shirts. Ticks will show up on white or light colors better than on dark colors, making them easier to see and remove.\nRemove ticks immediately by using tweezers, pulling carefully and steadily. Insect repellent may be helpful. Because only about 1 in 1,000 ticks carry this infection, antibiotics are not usually given after a tick bite.\nAlternative Names\nSpotted fever\nImages\nRocky mountain spotted fever - lesions on arm\nDeer ticks\nTicks\nRocky mountain spotted fever on the arm\nTick imbedded in the skin\nRocky mountain spotted fever on the foot\nRocky Mountain spotted fever - petechial rash\nAntibodies\nReferences\nBlanton LS, Walker DH.\nRickettsia rickettsii\nand other spotted fever group rickettsiae (Rocky Mountain spotted fever and other spotted fevers).
