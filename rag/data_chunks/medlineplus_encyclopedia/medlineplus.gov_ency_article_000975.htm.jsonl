It is usually due to a viral infection.\nCauses\nBronchiolitis usually affects children under the age of 2, with a peak age of 3 to 6 months. It is a common, and sometimes severe illness.\nRespiratory syncytial virus\n(RSV) is the most common cause. More than half of all infants are exposed to this virus by their first birthday.\nOther viruses that can cause bronchiolitis include:\nAdenovirus\nInfluenza\nParainfluenza\nThe virus is spread to infants by coming into direct contact with nose and throat fluids of someone who has the illness. This can happen when another child or an adult who has a virus:\nSneezes or coughs nearby and tiny droplets in the air are then breathed in by the infant\nTouches toys or other objects that are then touched by the infant\nBronchiolitis occurs more often in the fall and winter than other times of the year."}

It is a very common reason for infants to be hospitalized during winter and early spring.\nRisk factors of bronchiolitis include:\nBeing around cigarette smoke\nBeing younger than 6 months old\nLiving in crowded conditions\nNot being breastfed\nBeing born before 37 weeks of pregnancy\nSymptoms\nSome children have few or mild symptoms.\nBronchiolitis begins as a mild upper respiratory infection. Within 2 to 3 days, the child develops more breathing problems, including\nwheezing\nand a cough.\nSymptoms include:\nBluish skin\ndue to lack of oxygen (cyanosis) - emergency treatment is needed\nBreathing difficulty including wheezing and shortness of breath\nCough\nFatigue\nFever\nMuscles around the ribs sink in as the child tries to breathe in (called\nintercostal retractions\n)\nInfant's nostrils get wide when breathing\nRapid breathing (tachypnea)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

Wheezing and crackling sounds may be heard through the stethoscope.\nMost of the time, bronchiolitis can be diagnosed based on the symptoms and the exam.\nTests that may be done include:\nBlood gases\nChest x-ray\nCulture of a sample of nasal fluid to determine the virus causing the disease\nTreatment\nThe main focus of treatment is to relieve symptoms, such as difficulty breathing and wheezing. Some children may need to stay in the hospital if their breathing problems do not improve after being observed in the clinic or emergency room.\nAntibiotics do not work against viral infections. Medicines that treat viruses may be used to treat very ill children.\nAt home, measures to relieve symptoms\ncan be used. For example:\nHave your child drink plenty of fluids. Breast milk or formula is fine for children younger than 12 months. Electrolyte drinks, such as Pedialyte, are also OK for infants.\nHave your child breathe moist (wet) air to help loosen sticky mucus."}

Then use a nasal suction bulb to help relieve a stuffy nose.\nBe sure your child gets plenty of rest.\nDo not allow anyone to smoke in the house, car, or anywhere near your child. Children who are having trouble breathing may need to stay in the hospital. There, treatment may include oxygen therapy and fluids given through a vein (IV).\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nBreathing often gets better by the third day and symptoms mostly clear within a week."}
