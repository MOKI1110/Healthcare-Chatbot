Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSinus CT scan\nSinus CT scan\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the sinus is an imaging test that uses x-rays to make detailed pictures of the air-filled spaces inside the face (sinuses).\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will be asked to lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner. You may lie on your back, or you may lie face-down with your chin raised.\nOnce you are inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you. You will not see the rotating x-ray beam. Modern \"spiral\" scanners can perform the exam without stopping.\nA computer creates separate images of the body area. These are called slices. The images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, or printed on film. Three-dimensional models of the body area can be created by stacking the slices together.\nYou need to stay still during the exam because movement causes blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time. Straps and pillows may be used to keep you still during the procedure."}

You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time. Straps and pillows may be used to keep you still during the procedure. You may be asked to remove jewelry and earrings.\nThe actual scan should take about 30 seconds. The entire process should take 15 minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nFor some tests, you will need to have a special dye, called contrast, delivered into the body before the test starts. Contrast helps certain areas show up better on the x-rays.\nContrast can be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. If contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.\nLet your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test in order to safely receive this substance.\nLet your provider know if you have kidney problems. Contrast may not be used if this is the case.\nBefore receiving the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes medicine metformin (Glucophage)."}

You may need to take extra steps to prepare.\nIf you weigh more than 300 pounds (135 kilograms), find out if the CT machine has a weight limit. Too much weight can cause damage to the scanner's working parts or injury to the person.\nYou will be asked to remove jewelry and wear a hospital gown during the scan.\nHow the Test will Feel\nSome people may have discomfort from lying on the hard table.\nContrast given through an IV may cause a:\nSlight burning sensation\nMetallic taste in the mouth\nWarm flushing of the body\nThese feelings are normal. They will go away within a few seconds.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nCT rapidly creates detailed pictures of the sinuses."}

Having many x-rays or CT scans over time may increase your risk for cancer. However, the risk from any one scan is very small. You and your provider should weigh this risk against the benefits of getting a correct diagnosis for a medical problem.\nSome people have allergies to contrast dye. Let your provider know if you have ever had an allergic reaction to injected contrast dye.\nThe most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. A person with an iodine allergy may have nausea or vomiting, sneezing, itching, or hives if given this type of contrast.\nIf contrast is needed, you may be given antihistamines (such as Benadryl) or steroids before the test.\nThe kidneys help remove iodine out of the body. Those with kidney disease or diabetes may need to get extra fluids after the test to help flush the iodine out of the body.\nRarely, the dye may cause a life-threatening allergic response called anaphylaxis. If you have any trouble breathing during the test, let the scanner operator know right away."}
