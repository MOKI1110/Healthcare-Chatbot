Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFamilial hypertriglyceridemia\nFamilial hypertriglyceridemia\nFamilial hypertriglyceridemia is a common disorder passed down through families. It causes  a higher-than-normal level of triglycerides (a type of fat) in a person's blood.\nCauses\nFamilial hypertriglyceridemia is most likely caused by genetic variants combined with environmental factors. As a result, the condition clusters in families. How severe the disorder is can vary based on sex, age, hormone use, and dietary factors.\nPeople with this condition also have high levels of\nvery low density lipoprotein\n(VLDL). LDL cholesterol and HDL cholesterol are often low.\nIn most cases, familial hypertriglyceridemia is not noticeable until puberty or early adulthood. Obesity, hyperglycemia (high blood glucose levels), and high levels of insulin are often present as well. These factors may cause even higher triglyceride levels."}

Obesity, hyperglycemia (high blood glucose levels), and high levels of insulin are often present as well. These factors may cause even higher triglyceride levels. Alcohol, a diet high in carbohydrates, and estrogen use can make the condition worse.\nYou are more likely to have this condition if you have a family history of hypertriglyceridemia or\nheart disease\nbefore age 50.\nSymptoms\nYou may not notice any symptoms. Some people with the condition may have coronary artery disease at an early age.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your family history and symptoms.\nIf you have a family history of this condition, you should have blood tests to check\nvery low density lipoprotein\n(VLDL) and triglyceride levels. Blood tests most often show a mild to moderate increase in triglycerides (about 200 to 500 mg/dL).\nA coronary risk profile may also be done.\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to control conditions that can raise triglyceride levels. These include\nobesity\n,\nhypothyroidism\n, and\ndiabetes\n.\nYour provider may tell you not to drink alcohol. Certain birth control pills can raise triglyceride levels."}

Talk to your provider about your risk when deciding whether to take these medicines.\nTreatment also involves avoiding excess calories and\nfoods high in saturated fats and carbohydrates\n.\nYou may need to take medicine if your triglyceride levels stay high, even after making diet changes. Nicotinic acid, gemfibrozil, and fenofibrate will lower triglyceride levels in people with this condition.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nLosing weight and keeping diabetes under control helps improve the outcome.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nPancreatitis\nCoronary artery disease\nPrevention\nScreening family members for\nhigh triglycerides\nmay detect the disease early.\nAlternative Names\nType IV hyperlipoproteinemia\nImages\nHealthy diet\nReferences\nGenest J, Mora S, Libby P.
