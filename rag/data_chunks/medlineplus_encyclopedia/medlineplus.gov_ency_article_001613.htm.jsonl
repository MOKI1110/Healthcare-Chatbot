Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNeuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL)\nNeuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL)\nNeuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (NCL) refers to a group of rare disorders of the nerve cells. NCL is passed down through families (inherited).\nThese are the three main types of NCL:\nAdult (Kufs or Parry disease)\nJuvenile (Batten disease)\nLate infantile (Jansky-Bielschowsky disease)\nCauses\nNCL involves the buildup of an abnormal material called lipofuscin in the brain. NCL is thought to be caused by problems with the brain's ability to remove and recycle proteins.\nLipofuscinoses are inherited as\nautosomal recessive\ntraits."}

NCL is thought to be caused by problems with the brain's ability to remove and recycle proteins.\nLipofuscinoses are inherited as\nautosomal recessive\ntraits. This means each parent passes on a nonworking copy of the gene for the child to develop the condition.\nOnly one adult subtype of NCL is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of NCL include:\nAbnormally increased muscle tone or spasm\nBlindness or vision problems\nDementia\nLack of muscle coordination\nIntellectual disability\nMovement disorder\nLoss of speech\nSeizures\nUnsteady walk\nExams and Tests\nThe disorder may be seen at birth, but it is usually diagnosed much later in childhood.\nTests include:\nAutofluorescence testing of a tissue biopsy (a light technique)\nEEG (measures electrical activity in the brain)\nElectron microscopy of a skin biopsy\nElectroretinogram (an eye test)\nGenetic testing\nMRI or CT scans of the brain\nTissue biopsy\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for NCL disorders. Treatment depends on the type of NCL and extent of symptoms. Your health care provider may prescribe muscle relaxants to control irritability and sleep disturbances."}

Those who develop the disease early can have vision problems that progress to blindness and problems with mental function that get worse."}

Those who develop the disease early can have vision problems that progress to blindness and problems with mental function that get worse. If the disease starts in the first year of life, death by age 10 is likely.\nIf the disease occurs in adulthood, symptoms will be milder, with no vision loss and a normal life expectancy.\nPossible Complications\nThese complications can occur:\nVision impairment or blindness (with the early-onset forms of the disease)\nMental impairment, ranging from severe developmental delays at birth to\ndementia\nlater in life\nRigid muscles (due to severe problems with the nerves that control muscle tone)\nThe person may become totally dependent on others for help with daily activities.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your child shows symptoms of blindness or intellectual disability.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling is recommended if your family has a known history of NCL. Prenatal tests, or a test called preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD), may be available, depending on the specific type of disease."}
