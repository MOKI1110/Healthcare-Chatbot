Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPneumomediastinum\nPneumomediastinum\nPneumomediastinum is air in the mediastinum. The mediastinum is the space in the middle of the chest, between the lungs and around the heart.\nCauses\nPneumomediastinum is uncommon. The condition can be caused by injury or disease. Most often, it occurs when air leaks from any part of the lung or airways into the mediastinum.\nIncreased pressure in the lungs or airways may be caused by:\nToo much coughing\nRepeated bearing down to increase abdominal pressure (such as pushing during childbirth or a bowel movement)\nSneezing\nVomiting\nIt may also happen after:\nAn infection in the neck or center of the chest\nRapid rises in altitude, or scuba diving\nTearing of the esophagus (the tube that connects the mouth and stomach)\nTearing of the trachea (windpipe)\nUse of a breathing machine (\nventilator\n)\nUse of inhaled recreational drugs, such as marijuana or crack cocaine\nSurgery\nTrauma to the chest\nPneumomediastinum also can occur with collapsed lung (\npneumothorax\n) or other diseases.\nSymptoms\nThere may be no symptoms."}

The condition usually causes chest pain behind the breastbone, which may spread to the neck or arms. The pain may be worse when you take a breath or swallow.\nExams and Tests\nDuring a physical exam, your health care provider may feel small bubbles of air under the skin of the chest, arms, or neck (called subcutaneous emphysema).\nchest x-ray\nor\nCT scan of the chest\nmay be done. This is to confirm that air is in the mediastinum, and to help diagnose a hole in the trachea or esophagus.\nWhen examined, sometimes the person can look very puffy (swollen) in the face and eyes. This can look worse than it actually is.\nTreatment\nOften, no treatment is needed because the body will gradually absorb the air. Breathing high concentrations of oxygen may speed this process.\nThe provider may put in a\nchest tube\nif you also have a collapsed lung. You may also need treatment for the cause of the problem."}

A hole in the trachea or esophagus needs to be repaired with surgery.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook depends on the disease or events that caused the pneumomediastinum.\nPossible Complications\nAir may build up and enter the space around the lungs (pleural space), causing the lung to collapse.\nIn rare cases, air may enter the area between the heart and the thin sac that surrounds the heart. This condition is called a pneumopericardium.\nIn other rare cases, so much air builds up in the middle of the chest that it pushes on the heart and the great blood vessels, so they cannot work properly.\nAll of these complications require urgent attention because they can be life threatening.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nGo to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have severe chest pain or difficulty breathing.\nAlternative Names\nMediastinal emphysema\nImages\nRespiratory system\nReferences\nMcCool FD.
