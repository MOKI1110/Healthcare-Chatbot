Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) II\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) II\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia, type II (MEN II) is a disorder passed down through families in which one or more of the endocrine glands are overactive or form a tumor. Endocrine glands most commonly involved include:\nAdrenal gland (about half the time)\nParathyroid gland (20% of the time)\nThyroid gland (almost all the time)\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia, type I (\nMEN I\n) is a related condition.\nCauses\nThe cause of MEN II is a defect in a gene called RET. This defect causes many tumors to appear in the same person, but not necessarily at the same time.\nInvolvement of the adrenal gland is most often with a tumor called a\npheochromocytoma\n.\nInvolvement of the thyroid gland is most often with a tumor called\nmedullary carcinoma of the thyroid\n.\nTumors in the thyroid, adrenal, or parathyroid glands may occur years apart.\nThe disorder may occur at any age, and affects men and women equally."}

The main risk factor is a family history of MEN II.\nThere are two subtypes of MEN II. They are MEN IIa and IIb. MEN IIb is less common.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms may vary. However, they are similar to those of:\nMedullary carcinoma of the thyroid\nPheochromocytoma\nParathyroid adenoma\nParathyroid hyperplasia\nExams and Tests\nTo diagnose this condition, the health care provider looks for a mutation in the RET gene. This can be done with a blood test. Additional tests are done to determine which hormones are being overproduced.\nA physical exam may reveal:\nEnlarged lymph nodes in the neck\nFever\nHigh blood pressure  (\nhypertension\n)\nRapid heart rate\nThyroid nodules\nImaging tests used to identify tumors may include:\nAbdominal CT scan\nImaging of the kidneys or ureters\nMIBG scintiscan\nMRI of abdomen\nThyroid scan\nUltrasound of the thyroid\nBlood and other tests are used to see how well certain glands in the body are working."}

Thyroid hormone replacement therapy is given after surgery.\nIf a child is known to carry the RET gene mutation, surgery to remove the thyroid before it becomes cancerous is considered. This should be discussed with a physician who is very familiar with this condition. It would be done at an early age (before age 5) in people with known MEN IIa, and before age 6 months in people with MEN IIb.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPheochromocytoma is most often not cancerous (benign)."}

Medullary carcinoma of the thyroid is a very aggressive and potentially fatal cancer, but early diagnosis and surgery can often lead to a cure. Surgery does not cure the underlying MEN II.\nPossible Complications\nThe spread of cancerous cells is a possible complication.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you notice symptoms of MEN II or if someone in your family receives such a diagnosis.\nPrevention\nScreening close relatives of people with MEN II may lead to early detection of the syndrome and related cancers. This may allow for steps to prevent complications.\nAlternative Names\nSipple syndrome; MEN II; Pheochromocytoma - MEN II; Thyroid cancer - pheochromocytoma; Parathyroid cancer - pheochromocytoma\nImages\nEndocrine glands\nReferences\nGild ML, Tsang V, Clifton-Bligh RJ, Robinson BG.
