When the capsule becomes inflamed, the shoulder bones are unable to move freely in the joint.\nMost of the time, there is no cause for frozen shoulder. Women 40 to 70 years old are most affected, however, men can also get the condition.\nRisk factors include:\nDiabetes\nThyroid problems\nChanges in your hormones, such as during\nmenopause\nShoulder injury\nShoulder surgery\nOpen heart surgery\nRecent breast surgery\nCervical disk disease of the neck\nSymptoms\nThe main symptoms of a frozen shoulder are:\nPain\nDecreased motion of the shoulder\nStiffness\nFrozen shoulder can start with pain without any cause or minor trauma. The pain may be severe and prevent you from moving your arm. This lack of movement can lead to stiffness and even less motion."}

The pain may be severe and prevent you from moving your arm. This lack of movement can lead to stiffness and even less motion. Over time, you are not able to do movements such as reaching over your head or behind you.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will ask about your symptoms and examine your shoulder. A diagnosis is often made just with a clinical exam when you are not able to rotate your shoulder.\nYou may have\nx-rays\nof the shoulder. This is to make sure there is no other problem, such as arthritis or calcium deposits. Sometimes, an\nMRI exam\nshows inflammation, but these types of imaging tests are usually not needed to diagnose frozen shoulder.\nTreatment\nPain is treated  with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and steroid injections. Steroid injections and physical therapy can improve your motion.\nIt can take a few weeks to see progress. It may take as long as 9 months to a year for complete recovery. Physical therapy may be intense and needs to be done every day.\nLeft untreated, the condition often gets better by itself within 2 years with little residual loss of motion."}

However, your other medical conditions may make the process last longer.\nRisk factors for frozen shoulder, such as menopause, diabetes or thyroid problems, should also be treated.\nSurgery is recommended if nonsurgical treatment is not effective. This procedure (\nshoulder arthroscopy\n) is done under anesthesia. During surgery the scar tissue is cut by bringing the shoulder through a full range of motion. Arthroscopic surgery can also be used to cut the tight ligaments and remove any scar tissue from the shoulder. After surgery, you may receive pain blocks (shots) so you can do physical therapy.\nFollow instructions on\ncaring for your shoulder\nat home.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nTreatment with physical therapy and NSAIDs often restores motion and function of the shoulder within a year. Even untreated, the shoulder may get better by itself in 2 years.\nAfter surgery restores motion, you must continue physical therapy for several weeks or months."}
