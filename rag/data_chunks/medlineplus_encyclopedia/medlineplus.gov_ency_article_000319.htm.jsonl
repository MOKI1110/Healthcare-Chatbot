It occurs in people who have high levels of thyroid hormone in their blood. Examples of this include\nhyperthyroidism\nand thyrotoxicosis.\nCauses\nThis rare condition occurs only in people with high (usually very high) thyroid hormone levels (thyrotoxicosis). Men of Asian or Hispanic descent are affected more often. Most people who develop high thyroid hormone levels are not at risk of periodic paralysis.\nHypokalemic\n, or familial, periodic paralysis is a similar disorder. It is an inherited condition and not related to high thyroid levels, but has the same symptoms.\nRisk factors include a family history of periodic paralysis and hyperthyroidism.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms involve attacks of muscle weakness or\nparalysis\n. Between attacks, normal muscle function returns. Attacks often begin after symptoms of hyperthyroidism have developed."}

The sugar is glucose, which reduces your potassium level. Or you may be given thyroid hormone.\nThe following signs may be seen during the attack:\nDecreased or no reflexes\nAbnormal heartbeat\n(arrhythmia)\nLow potassium\nin the blood (potassium levels are normal between attacks)\nBetween attacks, the examination is normal."}
