Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBronchoscopic culture\nBronchoscopic culture\nBronchoscopic culture is a laboratory exam to check a piece of tissue or fluid from the lungs for infection-causing germs.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA procedure called\nbronchoscopy\nis used to get a sample (\nbiopsy\nor brush) of lung tissue or fluid.\nThe sample is sent to a laboratory. There, it is placed in a special dish (culture). It is then watched to see if bacteria or other disease-causing germs grow. Treatment is based on the results of the culture.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nFollow your health care provider's instructions on how to prepare for bronchoscopy.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYour provider will tell you what to expect during your bronchoscopy. Most times, it's performed under conscious sedation (heavily sedated), or under general\nanesthesia\n(fully asleep) so you will likely not remember much from the procedure.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA bronchoscopic culture is done to find infection in the lung that cannot be accurately detected by a\nsputum culture\n."}

The infection may be caused by bacteria, viruses, parasites, mycobacteria, or fungi. The results of the culture will help determine the best treatment.\nNot all organisms found with bronchoscopic culture need to be treated. Your provider will tell you more about this, after taking into account a lot of information to determine if treatment is needed.\nRisks\nYour provider can discuss the risks of the bronchoscopy procedure with you.\nAlternative Names\nCulture - bronchoscopic\nImages\nBronchoscopy\nBronchoscopic culture\nReferences\nBeamer S, Jaroszewski DE, Viggiano RW, Smith ML."}
