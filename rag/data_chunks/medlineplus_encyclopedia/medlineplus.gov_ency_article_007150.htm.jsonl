Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nStress echocardiography\nStress echocardiography\nStress echocardiography is a test that uses ultrasound imaging to show how well your heart muscle is working to pump blood to your body while you exercise in a controlled setting. It is most often used to detect a decrease in blood flow to the heart muscle due to\nnarrowing in the coronary arteries\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis test is done at a medical center or health care provider's office.\nA resting\nechocardiogram\nwill be done first. While you lie on your left side with your left arm out, a small device called a transducer is held against your chest. A special gel is used to help the ultrasound waves get to your heart.\nMost people will walk on a treadmill (or pedal on an exercise bicycle). Slowly (about every 3 minutes), you will be asked to walk (or pedal) faster and on an incline. It is like being asked to walk fast or jog up a hill.\nIn most cases, you will need to walk or pedal for 5 to 15 minutes, depending on your level of fitness and your age."}

Your provider will ask you to stop:\nWhen your heart is beating at the target rate\nWhen you are too tired to continue\nIf you are having chest pain or a change in your blood pressure that worries the provider administering the test\nIf you are not able to exercise, you will get a medicine, such as dobutamine, through a vein (intravenous line). This medicine will make your heart beat faster and harder, similar to when you exercise.\nYour blood pressure and heart rhythm (\nelectrocardiogram\nor ECG) will be monitored throughout the procedure.\nMore echocardiogram images will be taken while your heart rate is increasing, or when it reaches its peak. The images will show whether any parts of your heart muscle do not work as well when your heart rate increases. This is a sign that part of the heart may not be getting enough blood or oxygen because of narrowed or blocked arteries.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nAsk your provider if you should take any of your normal medicines on the day of the test."}

Never stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.\nIt is important to tell your provider if you have taken any of the following medicines within the past 24 hours (1 day):\nAvanafil (Stendra)\nSildenafil citrate (Viagra)\nTadalafil (Cialis)\nDO NOT eat or drink for at least 3 hours before the test.\nWear loose, comfortable clothing. You will be asked to sign a consent form before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nElectrodes (conductive patches) will be placed on your chest, arms, and legs to record your heart's activity.\nThe blood pressure cuff on your arm will be inflated every few minutes, producing a squeezing sensation that may feel tight.\nDuring the test, people feel chest discomfort, extra or skipped heartbeats, dizziness, headache, nausea, or shortness of breath."}

Your heart pictures show that all parts of your heart respond to increased stress by pumping harder.\nA normal result means that blood flow through the coronary arteries is probably normal.\nThe meaning of your test results depends on the reason for the test, your age, and your history of heart and other medical problems.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be due to:\nReduced blood flow to a part of your heart. The most likely cause is a narrowing or blockage of the arteries that supply your heart muscle.\nScarring of your heart muscle due to a past heart attack.\nAfter the test you may need:\nAngioplasty and stent placement\nChanges in your heart medicines\nCoronary angiography\nHeart bypass surgery\nRisks\nThe risks are very low."}
