Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSubacute thyroiditis\nSubacute thyroiditis\nSubacute thyroiditis is an immune reaction of the thyroid gland that often follows an upper respiratory infection.\nThe thyroid gland is located in the neck, just above where your collarbones meet in the middle.\nCauses\nSubacute thyroiditis is an uncommon condition. It is thought to be the result of a viral infection. The condition often occurs a few weeks after a viral infection of the ear, sinus, or throat, such as mumps, the flu, or a common cold.\nSubacute thyroiditis occurs most often in middle-aged women with symptoms of a viral upper respiratory tract infection in the past month.\nSymptoms\nThe most obvious symptom of subacute thyroiditis is pain in the neck caused by a swollen and inflamed thyroid gland. Sometimes, the pain can spread (radiate) to the jaw or ears."}

Sometimes, the pain can spread (radiate) to the jaw or ears. The thyroid gland may be painful and swollen for weeks or, in rare cases, months.\nOther symptoms include:\nTenderness when gentle pressure is applied to the thyroid gland\nDifficulty or painful swallowing, hoarseness\nFatigue\n, feeling weak\nFever\nThe inflamed thyroid gland may release too much thyroid hormone, causing symptoms of\nhyperthyroidism\n, including:\nMore frequent bowel movements\nHair loss\nHeat intolerance\nIrregular (or very light) menstrual periods in women\nMood changes\nNervousness, shaking hands (\ntremors\n)\nPalpitations\nSweating\nWeight loss, but with increased appetite\nAs the thyroid gland heals, it may release too little hormone, causing symptoms of\nhypothyroidism\n, including:\nCold intolerance\nConstipation\nFatigue\nIrregular (or heavy) menstrual periods in women\nWeight gain\nDry skin\nMood changes\nThyroid gland function often returns to normal over a few months. During this time you may need treatment for your underactive thyroid."}

In rare cases, hypothyroidism may be permanent.\nExams and Tests\nLaboratory tests that may be done include:\nThyroid stimulating hormone\n(TSH) level\nT4\n(thyroxine) and\nT3\n(triiodothyronine) level\nRadioactive iodine uptake\nThyroglobulin level\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate\n(ESR)\nC-reactive protein\n(CRP)\nThyroid ultrasound\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce pain and treat hyperthyroidism, if it occurs. Medicines such as aspirin or ibuprofen are used to control pain in mild cases.\nMore serious cases may need short-term treatment with medicines that reduce swelling and inflammation, such as prednisone. Symptoms of an overactive thyroid are treated with a class of medicines called beta-blockers.\nIf the thyroid becomes underactive during the recovery phase, thyroid hormone replacement may be needed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe condition should improve on its own. But the illness may last for months. Long-term or severe complications do not often occur.\nThe condition is not infectious."}
