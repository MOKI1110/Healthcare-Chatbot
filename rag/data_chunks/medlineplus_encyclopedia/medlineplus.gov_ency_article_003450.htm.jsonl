It uses a radioactive material called gallium and is a type of\nnuclear medicine\nexam.\nA related test is a\ngallium scan of the lung\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will get gallium injected into your vein. Gallium is a radioactive material. The gallium travels through the bloodstream and collects in the bones and certain organs.\nYour health care provider will tell you to return at a later time to be scanned. The scan will take place 6 to 48 hours after the gallium is injected. The test time depends on what condition your doctor is looking for. In some cases, people are scanned more than once.\nYou will lie on your back on the scanner table. A special camera detects where the gallium has gathered in the body.\nYou must lie still during the scan, which takes 30 to 60 minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nStool in the bowel can interfere with the test. You may need to take a laxative the night before you have the test."}

You may need to take a laxative the night before you have the test. Or, you may get an enema 1 to 2 hours before the test. You may eat and drink liquids normally.\nYou will need to sign a consent form. You will need to take off all jewelry and metal objects before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will feel a sharp prick when you get the injection. The site may be sore for a few minutes.\nThe hardest part of the scan is holding still. The scan itself is painless. The technician can help make you comfortable before the scan begins.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is rarely performed."}

It may be done to look for the cause of a fever that has lasted a few weeks without an explanation.\nNormal Results\nGallium normally collects in bones, the liver, spleen, the large bowel, and breast tissue.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nGallium detected outside normal areas can be a sign of:\nInfection\nInflammation\nTumors, including\nHodgkin disease\nor\nnon-Hodgkin lymphoma\nThe test may be done to look for lung conditions such as:\nPrimary\npulmonary hypertension\nPulmonary embolus\nRespiratory infections, most often\nPneumocystis jirovecii\npneumonia\nSarcoidosis\nScleroderma\nof the lung\nTumors in the lung\nRisks\nThere is a small risk for radiation exposure. This risk is less than that with\nx-rays\nor CT scans. Pregnant or nursing women and young children should avoid radiation exposure if at all possible.\nConsiderations\nNot all cancers show up on a gallium scan. Areas of inflammation, such as recent surgical scars, may show up on the scan."}
