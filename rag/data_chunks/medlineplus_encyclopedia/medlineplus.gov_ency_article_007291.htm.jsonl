This condition is called\nhyperhidrosis\n. Usually the surgery is used to treat sweating of the palms or face. The sympathetic nerves regulate sweating. The surgery cuts these nerves to the part of the body that sweats too much.\nDescription\nYou will receive\ngeneral anesthesia\nbefore surgery. This will make you asleep and pain-free.\nThe surgery is usually done the following way:\nThe surgeon makes 2 or 3 small cuts (incisions) under one arm on the side where the excessive sweating occurs.\nYour lung on this side is deflated (collapsed) so that air does not move in and out of it during surgery. This gives the surgeon more room to work.\nA small camera called a  thoracoscope is inserted through one of the cuts into your chest. Video from the camera shows on a monitor in the operating room."}

The surgeon views the monitor while doing the surgery.\nOther small tools are inserted through the other cuts.\nUsing these tools, the surgeon finds the nerves that regulate sweating in the problem area. These are cut, clipped, or destroyed.\nYour lung on this side is inflated.\nThe cuts are closed with stitches (sutures).\nA small drainage tube may be left in your chest for a day or so.\nAfter doing this procedure on one side of your body, the surgeon may do the same on the other side. The surgery takes about 1 to 3 hours.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThis surgery is usually done in people whose palms sweat much more heavily than normal. It may also be used to treat extreme sweating and blushing of the face."}

Some people notice sweating in new places on the body, but this may go away on its own.\nAlternative Names\nSympathectomy - endoscopic thoracic; ETC; Hyperhidrosis - endoscopic thoracic sympathectomy\nPatient Instructions\nSurgical wound care - open\nReferences\nFarrugia ME, Kavanagh GM.
