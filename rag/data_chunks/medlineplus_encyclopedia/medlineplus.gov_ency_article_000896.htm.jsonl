When this happens, glucose level may increase in a pregnant woman's blood.\nYou are at greater risk for gestational diabetes if you:\nAre older than 25 when you are pregnant\nCome from a higher risk ethnic group, such as Latino, African American, Native American, Asian, or Pacific Islander\nHave a family history of\ndiabetes\nGave birth to a baby that weighed more than 9 pounds (4 kg) or had a birth defect\nHave\nhigh blood pressure\nHave too much amniotic fluid\nHave had an unexplained miscarriage or stillbirth\nWere overweight before your pregnancy\nGain too much weight during your pregnancy\nHave\npolycystic ovary syndrome\nSymptoms\nMost of the time, there are no symptoms. The diagnosis is made during a routine prenatal screening.\nMild symptoms, such as increased thirst or shakiness, may be present."}

The diagnosis is made during a routine prenatal screening.\nMild symptoms, such as increased thirst or shakiness, may be present. These symptoms are usually not dangerous to the pregnant woman.\nOther symptoms may include:\nBlurred vision\nFatigue\nFrequent infections, including those of the bladder, vagina, and skin\nIncreased thirst\nIncreased urination\nExams and Tests\nGestational diabetes most often starts halfway through the pregnancy. All pregnant women should receive an\noral glucose tolerance test\n(glucose challenge test) between the 24th and 28th week of pregnancy to look for the condition. Some women who have a low risk of gestational diabetes may skip this test but should always ask their health care provider what is best for them. Women who have risk factors for gestational diabetes may have this test earlier in the pregnancy.\nOnce you are diagnosed with gestational diabetes, you can see how well you are doing by testing your glucose level at home."}
