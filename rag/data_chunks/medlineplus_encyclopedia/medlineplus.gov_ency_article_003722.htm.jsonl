This is the space surrounding the lungs. It involves using crystal violet stain to test a sample of the fluid.\nThe Gram stain method can be used on almost any specimen. It's one of the most commonly used techniques to rapidly identify the type of bacteria causing an infection.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA sample of the fluid can be removed for\ntesting\n. This process is called\nthoracentesis\n. You will have a\nchest x-ray\nor\nultrasound\nbefore the test.\nThe skin of the chest is cleaned with antibacterial soap. Your doctor then inserts a small needle into the chest between the ribs and into the pleural cavity. A small amount of fluid is taken out.\nYou may have a chest x-ray after the procedure. Sometimes, the pleural fluid is taken during chest surgery.\nA drop of the pleural fluid is spread in a very thin layer on a microscope slide. This is called a smear."}

Sometimes, the pleural fluid is taken during chest surgery.\nA drop of the pleural fluid is spread in a very thin layer on a microscope slide. This is called a smear. The specimen is stained with crystal violet stain and goes through more processing before it is examined under the microscope for bacteria.\nThe characteristic appearance of the bacteria, such as their color, shape, clustering (if any), and pattern of staining help determine the type of bacteria.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed before the test. A chest x-ray or an ultrasound will probably be done before and after the test.\nDo not cough, breathe deeply, or move during the test to avoid injury to the lung.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will feel a stinging sensation when the local anesthetic is injected. You may feel pain or pressure when the needle is inserted into the pleural space.\nTell your health care provider if you feel short of breath or have chest pain.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nNormally, the lungs fill a person's chest with air. If fluid builds up in the space outside the lungs but inside the chest, it can cause many problems."}

If fluid builds up in the space outside the lungs but inside the chest, it can cause many problems. Removing the fluid can relieve a person's breathing problems and help explain why the fluid built up there.\nThe test is performed when the provider suspects an infection of the pleural space, or when a chest x-ray reveals an abnormal, usually large collection of pleural fluid. The Gram stain can help identify the bacteria that might be causing the infection.\nNormal Results\nNormally, no bacteria are seen in the pleural fluid.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nYou may have a bacterial infection in the lining of the lungs (pleura).\nAlternative Names\nGram stain of pleural fluid\nImages\nPleural smear\nReferences\nMartin GJ, Friedlander AM.\nBacillus anthracis\n(Anthrax).
