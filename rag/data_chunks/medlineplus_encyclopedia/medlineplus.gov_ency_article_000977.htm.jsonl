The rash also spreads to the body and can cause other symptoms.\nYou can get fifth disease and not have any symptoms. About 20% of people who get the virus do not have symptoms.\nSymptoms\nEarly symptoms of fifth disease include:\nFever\nHeadache\nRunny nose\nThis is followed by a\nrash\non the face and body:\nThe tell-tale sign of this illness is bright-red cheeks. This is often called a \"slapped-cheek\" rash.\nThe rash appears on the arms and legs and middle of the body, and it may itch.\nThe rash comes and goes and most often disappears in about 2 weeks.

It fades from the center outwards, so it looks lacy.\nSome people also have\njoint pain\nand swelling. This more commonly occurs in adult women.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine the rash. Most often this is enough to diagnose the disease.\nYour provider can also do blood tests to look for signs of the virus, although it is not needed in most cases.\nThe provider may choose to do a blood test in certain situations, such as for pregnant women or people with anemia.\nTreatment\nThere is no treatment for fifth disease. The virus will clear up on its own in a couple of weeks. If your child has joint pain or an itchy rash, talk with your child's provider about ways to ease symptoms. Acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) for children can help relieve joint pain.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost children and adults have only mild symptoms and recover completely.\nPossible Complications\nFifth disease does not often cause complications in most people.\nIf you are pregnant and think you may have been exposed to someone with the virus, tell your provider. Usually there is no problem."}
