Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPrimary amyloidosis\nPrimary amyloidosis\nPrimary amyloidosis is a rare disorder in which abnormal proteins build up in tissues and organs. Clumps of the abnormal proteins are called amyloid deposits.\nCauses\nThe cause of primary amyloidosis is not well understood. Genes may play a role.\nThe condition is related to abnormal and excess production of specific proteins. The proteins build up in certain organs. This makes it harder for the organs to work correctly.\nPrimary amyloidosis can lead to conditions that include:\nCarpal tunnel syndrome\n(due to protein deposits in the nerve)\nHeart muscle damage (\ncardiomyopathy\n) leading to\ncongestive heart failure\nIntestinal\nmalabsorption\nLiver swelling and malfunction\nKidney failure\nNephrotic syndrome\n(a group of signs that includes protein in the urine, low protein levels in the blood, high cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, and swelling throughout the body)\nNerve problems (neuropathy)\nOrthostatic hypotension\n(drop in blood pressure when you stand up)\nSymptoms\nSymptoms depend on the organs affected."}

This disease can affect many organs and tissues, including the tongue, intestines, skeletal and smooth muscles, nerves, skin, ligaments, heart, liver, spleen, kidneys, and bladder.\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nAbnormal heart rhythm\nFatigue\nNumbness of hands or feet\nShortness of breath\nSkin changes\nSwallowing problems\nSwelling in the arms and legs\nSwollen tongue\nWeak hand grip\nWeight loss or weight gain\nOther symptoms that may occur with this disease:\nDecreased urine output\nDiarrhea\nHoarseness or changing voice\nJoint pain\nWeakness\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you. You will be asked about your medical history and symptoms. A physical exam may show that you have a\nswollen liver\nor\nspleen\n, or signs of heart or nerve damage.\nThe first step in diagnosing amyloidosis should be blood and urine tests to look for abnormal proteins.\nOther tests depend on your symptoms and the organ that may be affected."}

This may improve symptoms or slow the disease from getting worse. Complications such as heart failure, kidney failure, and other problems can sometimes be treated, when needed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well you do depends on which organs are affected.

Body-wide (\nsystemic\n) amyloidosis can lead to death within 2 years.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of this disease. Also call if you have been diagnosed with this disease and have:\nDecreased urination\nDifficulty breathing\nSwelling of the ankles or other body parts that does not go away\nPrevention\nThere is no known prevention for primary amyloidosis.\nAlternative Names\nAmyloidosis - primary; Immunoglobulin light chain amyloidosis; Primary systemic amyloidosis; Primary localized amyloidosis\nImages\nAmyloidosis of the fingers\nAmyloidosis of the face\nReferences\nBuxbaum JN.
