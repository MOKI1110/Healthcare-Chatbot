Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nApolipoprotein B100\nApolipoprotein B100\nApolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) is a protein that plays a role in moving cholesterol around your body. It is a form of low density lipoprotein (LDL).\nVariants in the gene that directs the body's production of apoB100 can cause a condition called\nfamilial hypercholesterolemia\n. This is a form of high blood cholesterol that is passed down in families (inherited).\nThis article discusses the test used to measure the level of apoB100 in the blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour health care provider may tell you not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, you may feel moderate pain, or only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nMost often, this test is done to help determine the cause or specific type of high blood cholesterol. It is not clear whether the information helps improve treatment."}

It is not clear whether the information helps improve treatment. Because of this, most health insurance companies do not pay for the test. If you do not have a diagnosis of high cholesterol or heart disease, this test may not be recommended for you.\nNormal Results\nThe normal range is about 50 to 150 mg/dL.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result may mean you have high lipid (fat) levels in your blood."}

A medical term for this is\nhyperlipidemia\n.\nOther disorders that may be associated with high apoB100 levels include atherosclerotic vascular disease such as\nangina pectoris\n(chest pain that occurs with activity or stress) and\nheart attack\n.\nRisks\nRisks linked with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nHematoma (blood buildup under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nConsiderations\nApolipoprotein measurements may provide more detail about your risk for heart disease, but the added value of this test beyond a lipid panel is unknown.\nAlternative Names\nApoB100; Apoprotein B100; Hypercholesterolemia - apolipoprotein B100\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nBredefeld CL, Lau R, Hussain MM.
