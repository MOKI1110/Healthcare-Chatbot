Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEndocardial cushion defect\nEndocardial cushion defect\nEndocardial cushion defect (ECD) is an abnormal heart condition. The walls separating all four chambers of the heart are poorly formed or absent. Also, the valves separating the upper and lower chambers of the heart have defects during formation. ECD is a\ncongenital heart disease\n, which means it is present from birth.\nCauses\nECD occurs while a baby is still growing in the womb (uterus). The endocardial cushions are two thicker areas that develop into the walls (septum) that divide the four chambers of the heart. They also form the mitral and tricuspid valves. These are the valves that separate the atria (top collecting chambers) from the ventricles (bottom pumping chambers).\nThe lack of separation between the two sides of the heart causes several problems:\nIncreased blood flow to the lungs. This results in increased pressure in the lungs. In ECD, blood flows through the abnormal openings from the left to the right side of the heart, then to the lungs."}

This results in increased pressure in the lungs. In ECD, blood flows through the abnormal openings from the left to the right side of the heart, then to the lungs. More blood flow into the lungs makes the blood pressure in the lungs rise.\nHeart failure\n. The extra effort needed to pump makes the heart work harder than normal. The heart muscle may enlarge and weaken. This can cause swelling in the baby, problems in breathing, and difficulty in feeding and growing.\nCyanosis\n. As the blood pressure increases in the lungs, blood starts to flow from the right side of the heart to the left. The oxygen-poor blood mixes with the oxygen-rich blood. As a result, blood with less oxygen than usual is pumped out to the body. This causes cyanosis, or bluish skin.\nThere are two types of ECD:\nComplete ECD. This condition involves an atrial septal defect (ASD) and a ventricular septal defect (VSD). People with a complete ECD have only one large heart valve (common AV valve) instead of two distinct valves (mitral and tricuspid).\nPartial (or incomplete) ECD. In this condition, only an ASD, or an ASD and VSD are present."}

In this condition, only an ASD, or an ASD and VSD are present. There are two distinct valves, but one of them (the mitral valve) is often abnormal with an opening (cleft) in it. This defect can leak blood back through the valve.\nECD is strongly linked to\nDown syndrome\n. Several gene changes are also linked to ECD. However, the exact cause of ECD is unknown.\nECD may be associated with other congenital heart defects, such as:\nDouble outlet right ventricle\nSingle ventricle\nTransposition of the great vessels\nTetralogy of Fallot\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of ECD may include:\nTires easily\nBluish skin color, also known as cyanosis (the lips may also be blue)\nFeeding difficulties\nFailure to gain weight and grow\nFrequent pneumonia\nor infections\nPale skin (\npallor\n)\nRapid breathing\nRapid heartbeat\nSweating\nSwollen legs or abdomen (rare in children)\nTrouble breathing, especially during feeding\nExams and Tests\nDuring an exam, your child's health care provider will likely find signs of ECD, including:\nAn abnormal\nelectrocardiogram\n(ECG)\nAn enlarged heart\nHeart murmur\nC"}
