Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nShoulder MRI scan\nShoulder MRI scan\nA shoulder MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan is an imaging test that uses energy from powerful magnets and to create pictures of the shoulder area.\nIt does not use radiation (x-rays).\nSingle MRI images are called slices. The images can be stored on a computer or printed on film. One exam produces dozens or sometimes hundreds of slices.\nRelated tests include:\nArm MRI\nMRI\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou may be asked to wear a hospital gown or clothing without metal snaps or zippers (such as sweatpants and a t-shirt). Make sure you take off your watch, jewelry, and wallet. MRI can pull on any metallic objects. Some types of metal can cause blurry images.\nYou will lie on a narrow table, which slides into a large tunnel-like tube.\nSome exams require a special dye (contrast). The dye is usually given before the test through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. The dye can also be injected into the shoulder."}

The dye helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly.\nDuring the MRI, the person who operates the machine will watch you from another room. The test most often lasts 30 to 60 minutes, but it may take longer.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan.\nTell your health care provider if you are afraid of close spaces (have claustrophobia). You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious (sedative)."}

You will need to lie still. Too much movement can cause errors.\nThe table may be hard or cold, but you can request a blanket or pillow. The machine produces loud thumping and humming noises when turned on. You can wear ear plugs to help reduce the noise.\nAn intercom in the room lets you speak to someone at any time. Some MRIs have televisions and special headphones to help you pass the time.\nThere is no recovery time, unless you received medicine to relax. After an MRI scan, you can go back to your normal diet, activity, and medicines.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nMRI is useful for diagnosing and evaluating sports injuries."}

Talk to your provider with any questions and concerns.\nRisks\nMRI uses no radiation. No side effects from the magnetic fields and radio waves have been reported.\nIt is also safe to have MRI performed during pregnancy. No side effects or complications have been proven.\nThe most common type of contrast (dye) used is gadolinium. It is very safe. Allergic reactions to the substance rarely occur. However, gadolinium can be harmful to people with kidney problems that require dialysis. If you have kidney problems, please tell your provider before the test.\nThe strong magnetic fields created during an MRI can cause heart pacemakers and other implants not to work as well. It can also cause a piece of metal inside your body to move or shift."}
