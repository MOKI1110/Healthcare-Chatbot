It is often associated with urinary frequency or urgency. It is also called painful bladder syndrome.\nCauses\nThe bladder is a hollow organ that stores urine. It has a thin layer of muscle inside it. When your bladder fills up with urine, it sends a signal to your brain, telling the muscles to squeeze. Under normal conditions, these signals are not painful. If you have interstitial cystitis, the signals from the bladder are painful and may occur even when the bladder is not full.\nThe condition most often occurs between ages 20 to 40, although it has been reported in younger people.\nWomen are 10 times more likely to have IC than men.\nThe exact cause of this condition is unknown.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of IC are chronic. Symptoms tend to come and go with periods of lesser or worse severity."}

Symptoms tend to come and go with periods of lesser or worse severity. Common symptoms include:\nBladder pressure or discomfort (mild to severe)\nUrge to urinate often\nBurning pain in the pelvic area\nPain during intercourse\nMany people who have long-term IC may also have other conditions such as\nendometriosis\n,\nfibromyalgia\n,\nirritable bowel syndrome\n, other chronic pain syndromes, anxiety, or\ndepression\n.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will look for other causes of your symptoms. These include:\nSexually transmitted infections\nBladder cancer\nBladder infections\nKidney or ureteral stones\nTests are done on your urine to look for infection or cells that suggest cancer inside the bladder. During a cystoscopy, the provider uses a special tube with a small camera on the end to look inside your bladder. A sample or biopsy of the lining of your bladder may be taken.\nTests at your provider's office may also be done to show how well your bladder fills and how well it empties.\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for IC, and there are no standard treatments."}

Treatment is based on trial and error until you find relief. Results vary from person to person.\nDIET AND LIFESTYLE CHANGES\nSome people find that making changes in their diet can help control symptoms. Try to avoid foods and beverages that can cause bladder irritation. Stop eating certain foods, one at a time, to see if your symptoms get better. Reduce or stop consuming caffeine, chocolate, carbonated beverages, citrus drinks, and spicy or acidic foods (such as those with high levels of vitamin C).\nOther foods that the\nInterstitial Cystitis Association\nlists as possibly causing bladder irritation are:\nAged cheeses\nAlcohol\nArtificial sweeteners\nFava and lima beans\nMeats that are cured, processed, smoked, canned, aged, or that contain nitrites\nAcidic fruits (except blueberries, honeydew melon, and pears, which are OK.)\nNuts, except almonds, cashews, and pine nuts\nOnions\nRye bread\nSeasonings that contain MSG\nSour cream\nSourdough bread\nSoy\nTea\nTofu\nTomatoes\nYogurt\nYou and your provider sho"}

These may include training yourself to urinate at specific times or using pelvic floor physical therapy and biofeedback to relieve pelvic floor muscle tension and spasms.\nMEDICINES AND PROCEDURES\nCombination therapy may include medicines such as:\nPentosan polysulfate sodium, the only medicine taken by mouth that is approved for treating IC\nTricyclic antidepressants, such as amitriptyline, to relieve pain and urinary frequency\nHydroxyzine (Vistaril), an antihistamine that can help reduce inflammation."}
