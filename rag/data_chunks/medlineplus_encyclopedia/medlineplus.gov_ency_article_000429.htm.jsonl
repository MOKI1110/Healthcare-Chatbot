It also damages the cells that line the walls of small arteries. This leads to tissue injury due to poor blood supply.\nCauses\nScleroderma is a type of\nautoimmune disorder\n. In this condition, the immune system mistakenly attacks and damages healthy body tissue.\nThe cause of scleroderma is unknown. A buildup of a protein normally found in the body (called collagen) in the skin and other organs leads to the symptoms of the disease.\nThe disease most often affects people ages 30 to 50 years. Women get scleroderma more often than men. Some people with scleroderma have a history of being around silica dust and polyvinyl chloride, but most do not.\nWidespread scleroderma can occur with other autoimmune diseases, including\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\nand\npolymyositis\n."}

These cases are referred to as undifferentiated connective tissue disease or overlap syndrome.\nSymptoms\nSome types of scleroderma affect only the skin, while others affect the whole body.\nLocalized scleroderma (also called morphea) -- Often affects only the skin on the chest, abdomen, or limb but not usually on the hands and face. Morphea develops slowly, and rarely spreads in the body or causes serious problems such as internal organ damage.\nSystemic scleroderma, or sclerosis -- May affect large areas of skin and organs such as the heart, lungs, or kidneys."}
