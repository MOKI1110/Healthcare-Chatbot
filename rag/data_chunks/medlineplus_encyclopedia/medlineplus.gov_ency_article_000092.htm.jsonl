Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRespiratory acidosis\nRespiratory acidosis\nRespiratory acidosis is a condition that occurs when your lungs can't remove all of the carbon dioxide produced by your body. This causes the blood and other body fluids to become too acidic.\nCauses\nThere are many causes of respiratory acidosis, including:\nAirway diseases, such as\nasthma\nand\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n(COPD)\nDiseases that can affect the chest, such as\nscoliosis\nDiseases that affect the nerves and muscles that signal the lungs to inflate or deflate\nMedicines that suppress breathing, including narcotics (opioids), and \"downers,\" such as benzodiazepines, often when combined with each other or alcohol\nSevere obesity, which restricts how much the lungs can expand\nObstructive sleep apnea\ncan cause respiratory acidosis while you are asleep\nChronic respiratory acidosis occurs over a long time."}

This leads to a stable situation, because the kidneys increase body chemicals, such as bicarbonate, that help restore the body's acid-base balance.\nAcute respiratory acidosis occurs when carbon dioxide builds up very quickly, before the kidneys can return the body to a state of balance.\nSome people with chronic respiratory acidosis get acute respiratory acidosis when a serious illness worsens their condition and disrupts their body's acid-base balance.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nConfusion\nAnxiety\nEasy fatigue\nLethargy\nShortness of breath\nSleepiness\nTremors\n(shaking)\nWarm and flushed skin\nSweating\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about symptoms.\nYou may have certain tests, including:\nArterial\nblood gas\n(measures oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood)\nBasic metabolic panel\nChest x-ray\nCT scan of the chest\nPulmonary function test\nto measure breathing and how well the lungs are functioning\nUltrasound of the heart (\nechocardiogram\n)"}

Smoking can lead to many severe lung diseases that can cause respiratory acidosis.\nLosing weight may help prevent respiratory acidosis due to obesity (obesity-hypoventilation syndrome).\nBe careful about taking sedating medicines, and never combine these medicines with alcohol.\nUse your CPAP device regularly if it has been prescribed for you.\nAlternative Names\nVentilatory failure; Respiratory failure; Acidosis - respiratory\nImages\nRespiratory system\nReferences\nMcCoin NS, Self WH.
