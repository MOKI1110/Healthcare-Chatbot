The child may or may not be doing this on purpose.\nCauses\nThe child may have\nconstipation\n. The stool is hard, dry, and stuck in the colon (called\nfecal impaction\n). The child then passes only wet or almost liquid stool that flows around the hard stool. It may leak out during the day or night.\nOther causes may include:\nNot toilet training the child\nStarting  toilet training when the child was too young\nEmotional problems, such as\noppositional defiant disorder\nor\nconduct disorder\nWhatever the cause, the child may feel shame, guilt, or low self-esteem, and may hide signs of encopresis.\nFactors that may increase the risk of encopresis include:\nChronic constipation\nLow socioeconomic status\nEncopresis is much more common in boys than in girls."}

This is only a short-term treatment because mineral oil interferes with the absorption of calcium and vitamin D.\nSeeing a pediatric gastroenterologist when these treatments are not enough. Your gastroenterologist may use biofeedback, or teach the parents and child how to manage encopresis.\nSeeing a psychotherapist to help the child deal with associated shame, guilt, or loss of self-esteem.\nFor encopresis without constipation, the child may need a psychiatric evaluation to find the cause.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost children respond well to treatment. Encopresis often recurs, so some children need ongoing treatment.\nPossible Complications\nIf not treated, the child may have low self-esteem and problems making and keeping friends."}
