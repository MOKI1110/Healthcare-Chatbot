Blood also can collect under the tissue in larger flat areas (called\npurpura\n), or in a very large bruised area (called an ecchymosis).\nConsiderations\nAside from the common bruise, bleeding into the skin or mucous membranes is a very significant sign and should always be checked out by a health care provider.\nRedness of the skin (erythema) should not be mistaken for bleeding. Areas of bleeding into the skin do not become paler (blanch) when you press on the area, like the redness from erythema does.\nCauses\nMany things can cause bleeding under the skin."}
