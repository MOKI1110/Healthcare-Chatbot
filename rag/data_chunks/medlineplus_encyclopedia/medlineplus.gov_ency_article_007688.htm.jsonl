This is also called reflux. GER can irritate the esophagus and cause heartburn.\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a long-lasting problem where reflux occurs often. It may cause more severe symptoms.\nThis article is about GERD in children. It is a common problem in children of all ages.\nCauses\nWhen we eat, food passes from the throat to the stomach through the esophagus. A ring of muscle fibers in the lower esophagus (lower esophageal sphincter) prevents swallowed food from moving back up.\nWhen this ring of muscle does not close all the way, stomach contents can leak back into the esophagus. This is called reflux or gastroesophageal reflux.\nIn infants, this ring of muscles has not fully developed, and this can allow reflux."}

This is why babies often spit up after feeding.\nReflux in infants\ngoes away once this muscle develops, often by age 1 year.\nWhen symptoms continue or become worse, it may be a sign of GERD.\nCertain factors can lead to GERD in children, including:\nBirth defects, such as\nhiatal hernia\n, a condition in which part of the stomach extends through an opening of the diaphragm into the chest. The diaphragm is the muscle that separates the chest from the abdomen.\nObesity.\nCertain medicines, such as some medicines used for asthma.\nSecondhand smoke.\nSurgery of the upper abdomen.\nBrain disorders, such as\ncerebral palsy\n.\nGenetics -- GERD tends to run in families.\nSymptoms\nCommon symptoms of GERD in children and teens include:\nNausea, bringing food back up (regurgitation), or perhaps vomiting.\nReflux and\nheartburn\n."}

Younger children may not be able to pinpoint the pain as well and instead describe widespread belly or chest pain.\nChoking, chronic cough, or wheezing.\nHiccups or burps.\nNot wanting to eat, eating only a small amount, or avoiding certain foods.\nWeight loss or not gaining weight.\nFeeling that food is stuck behind the breastbone or pain with swallowing.\nHoarseness\nor a change in voice.\nExams and Tests\nYour child may not need any tests if the symptoms are mild.\nA test called a barium swallow or upper GI may be performed to confirm the diagnosis. In this test, your child will swallow a chalky substance to highlight the esophagus, stomach, and upper part of his small intestine. It can show if liquid is backing up from the stomach into the esophagus or if anything is blocking or narrowing these areas.\nIf the symptoms do not improve, or they come back after the child has been treated with medicines, the health care provider may recommend a test. One test is called an\nupper endoscopy\n(EGD)."}

They are more likely to work for children with milder symptoms or symptoms that do not occur often.\nLifestyle changes mainly include:\nLosing weight, if overweight\nWearing clothes that are loose around the waist\nSleeping with the head of the bed slightly raised, for children with nighttime symptoms\nNot lying down for 3 hours after eating\nThe following diet changes may help if a food appears to be causing symptoms:\nAvoiding food with too much sugar or foods that are very spicy\nAvoiding chocolate, peppermint, or drinks with caffeine\nAvoiding acidic drinks such as colas or orange juice\nEating smaller m"}

The benefit of reducing fats in children is not as well proven. It's vital to make sure children have the proper nutrients for healthy growth.\nParents or caretakers who smoke should\nquit smoking\n. Never smoke around children. Secondhand smoke can cause GERD in children.\nIf your child's provider says it's OK to do so, you can give your child over-the-counter (OTC) acid suppressors. They help reduce the amount of acid produced by the stomach. These medicines work slowly, but relieve the symptoms for a longer period. They include:\nProton pump inhibitors\nH2 blockers\nYour child's provider may also suggest using antacids along with other medicines. Do not give your child any of these medicines without first checking with the provider.\nIf these treatment methods fail to manage symptoms,\nanti-reflux surgery\nmay be an option for children with severe symptoms."}
