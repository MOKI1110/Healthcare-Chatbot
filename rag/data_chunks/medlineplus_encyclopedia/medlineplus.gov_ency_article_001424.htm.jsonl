It is congenital, meaning that it is present from birth. It occurs more frequently in northern Scandinavia.\nCauses\nMyotonia congenita is caused by a genetic change (genetic variant). It is passed down from either one or both parents to their children (inherited).\nMyotonia congenita is caused by a problem in the part of the muscle cells that are needed for muscles to relax. Abnormal repeated electrical signals occur in the muscles, causing a type of muscle stiffness called myotonia.\nSymptoms\nThe hallmark of this condition is myotonia. This means the muscles are unable to quickly relax after contracting."}

This means the muscles are unable to quickly relax after contracting. For example, after a handshake, the person is only very slowly able to open and pull away their hand.\nEarly symptoms may include:\nDifficulty swallowing\nGagging\nStiff movements that improve when they are repeated\nShortness of breath or tightening of the chest at the beginning of exercise\nFrequent falls\nDifficulty opening eyes after forcing them closed or crying\nChildren with myotonia congenita often look muscular and well-developed. They may not have symptoms of myotonia congenita until age 2 or 3.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider may ask if there is a family history of myotonia congenita.\nTests include:\nElectromyography\n(EMG) and\nnerve conduction studies\n(NCS)\nGenetic testing\nMuscle biopsy\nTreatment\nAs cold and stress can worsen symptoms, management is first directed at avoiding these potential triggers. Some forms of exercise may also be beneficial. Mexiletine is a medicine that treats symptoms of myotonia congenita."}
