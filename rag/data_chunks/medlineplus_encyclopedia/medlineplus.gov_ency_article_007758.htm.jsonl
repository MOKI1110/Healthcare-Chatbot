It can cause a severe infection in hospital or nursing home patients. These people are often already very sick.\nC auris\ninfections often do not get better with the antifungal medicines that usually treat candida infections. When this occurs, the fungus is said to be resistant to antifungal medicines. This makes it very hard to treat the infection.\nC auris\ninfection is rare in healthy people.\nCauses\nSome people carry\nC auris\non their bodies without it making them sick. This is called \"colonization.\" This means they can easily spread the germ without knowing it. However, people who are colonized with\nC auris\nare still at risk for getting an infection from the fungus.\nC auris\ncan be spread from person-to-person or from contact with objects or equipment. People in hospitals and people living long-term in nursing homes can be colonized with\nC auris\n. They can spread it to objects in the facility, such as bedside tables and handrails."}

Health care providers and visiting family and friends who have contact with a person with\nC auris\ncan spread it to other people in the facility.\nOnce\nC auris\nenters the body, it can cause a severe infection of the bloodstream and organs. This is more likely to occur in people with a weakened immune system. People who have breathing or feeding tubes or IV catheters are at the highest risk of infection.\nOther risk factors for\nC auris\ninfection include:\nLiving in a nursing home or making many visits to the hospital\nTaking antibiotic or antifungal medicines often\nHaving many medical problems\nHaving had a recent surgery\nC auris\ninfections have occurred in people of all ages.\nSymptoms\nC auris\ninfections can be hard to identity for the following reasons:\nSymptoms of a\nC auris\ninfection are similar to those caused by other fungal infections.\nPeople who have a\nC auris\ninfection are often already very sick."}

Symptoms of infection are hard to tell apart from other symptoms.\nC auris\ncan be mistaken for other types of fungus unless special lab tests are used to identify it.\nHigh fever with chills that does not get better after taking antibiotics may be a sign of a\nC auris\ninfection. Tell your provider right away if you or a loved one has an infection that is not getting better, even after treatment.\nExams and Tests\nC auris\ninfection can't be easily diagnosed using standard methods. If your provider thinks your illness is caused by\nC auris\n, they will need to use special lab tests.\nBlood tests include:\nCBC with differential\nBlood cultures\nBasic metabolic panel\nB-1,3 glucan test (testing for a specific sugar found on some fungi)\nYour provider also may suggest testing if they suspect you have been colonized with\nC auris\n, or if you have tested positive for\nC auris\nbefore.\nTreatment\nC auris\ninfections are often treated with antifungal medicines called echinocandins."}

Or, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. Do this before and after contact with people who have this infection and before and after touching any equipment in their room.\nMake sure providers wash their hands or use hand sanitizer and wear gloves and gowns when interacting with patients. Don't be afraid to speak up if you notice any lapses in good hygiene.\nIf a loved one has a\nC auris\ninfection, they should be isolated from other patients and kept in a separate room.\nIf you are visiting your loved one who has been isolated from other patients, please follow the directions of the healthcare workers on the procedure to enter and exit the room to minimize the chance of spreading the fungus.\nThese precautions should also be used for people who are colonized with\nC auris\nuntil their provider determines they can no longer spread the fungus.\nContact your provider right away if you suspect that you or someone you kn"}
