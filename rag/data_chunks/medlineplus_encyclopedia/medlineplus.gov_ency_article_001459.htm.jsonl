The rest appear in the first several months of life.\nThe hemangioma may be:\nIn the top skin layers (\ncapillary hemangioma\n)\nDeeper in the skin (cavernous hemangioma)\nA mixture of both layers of skin\nIn an internal organ and not visible\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a hemangioma are:\nA red to reddish-purple, raised growth on the skin\nA massive, raised, bluish lump with visible blood vessels\nMost hemangiomas are on the head, neck, or extremities.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will do a physical exam to diagnose a hemangioma. If the buildup of blood vessels is deep inside the body, a\nCT\nor\nMRI\nscan may be needed.\nA hemangioma may occur with other rare conditions. Other tests to check for related problems may be done.\nTreatment\nThe majority of small or uncomplicated hemangiomas may not need treatment. They often go away on their own and the appearance of the skin returns to normal."}

They often go away on their own and the appearance of the skin returns to normal. Sometimes, a laser may be used to remove the small blood vessels.\nTaking beta-blocker medicines may also help reduce the size of a hemangioma.\nCavernous hemangiomas that involve the eyelid and block vision can be treated with lasers or steroid injections to shrink them. This allows vision to develop normally. Large cavernous hemangiomas or mixed hemangiomas may be treated with steroids, taken by mouth or injected into the hemangioma.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSmall superficial hemangiomas will often disappear on their own."}
