The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\nThe person may need to stay in the hospital for more treatment. Swallowing poison can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Extensive damage to the mouth, throat, and stomach are possible. Holes (perforations) in the esophagus and stomach may result in serious infections in the chest and abdominal cavities, which may result in death. Surgery may be needed to repair the perforations. Cancer of the esophagus is a high risk in people who survive after ingesting hydrochloric acid.\nReferences\nHoyte C. Caustics.
