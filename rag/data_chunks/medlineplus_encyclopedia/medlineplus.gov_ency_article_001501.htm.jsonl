This blockage leads to infection of the glands.\nThis is an uncommon problem. It affects younger or middle-aged women who are not breastfeeding. Risk factors include:\nDiabetes\nNipple piercing\nSmoking\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of an areolar abscess are:\nSwollen, tender lump beneath the areolar area, with swelling and warmth of the skin over it\nDrainage and possible pus from this lump\nFever and chills\nGeneral ill feeling or fatigue\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a breast exam. Sometimes an\nultrasound\nor other imaging test of the breast is recommended.

A blood count and a culture of the abscess, if drained, may be ordered.\nTreatment\nSubareolar abscesses are treated with antibiotics and by opening and draining the infected tissue. This can be done in a doctor's office with local numbing medicine. If the abscess returns, the affected glands should be surgically removed. The abscess can also be drained using a sterile needle. This is often done under ultrasound guidance.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook is good after the abscess is drained.\nPossible Complications\nSubareolar abscess may return until the affected gland is surgically removed. Any infection in a female who is not nursing has the potential to be due to a rare form of breast cancer. You may need to have a biopsy or other tests if standard treatment fails.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop a painful lump under your nipple or areola. It is very important to have your provider evaluate any breast mass.\nAlternative Names\nAbscess - areolar gland; Areolar gland abscess; Breast abscess - subareolar\nImages\nNormal female breast anatomy\nBreast infection\nReferences\nKlimberg VS, Hunt KK.
