Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAtrial fibrillation and atrial flutter\nAtrial fibrillation and atrial flutter\nAtrial fibrillation (AFib) and atrial flutter are common types of abnormal heart rhythms (\narrhythmias\n) which affect the upper chambers (atria) of the heart.\nIn atrial flutter, the heart beats too fast, but often continues to contract in a regular rhythm. AFib is a closely related condition in which the atria contract in a chaotic manner, or \"quivers.\" This creates a very irregular heart rhythm that is also usually too fast. AFib and atrial flutter often occur in the same person at different times.\nCauses\nWhen working well, the 4 chambers of the heart contract (squeeze) in an organized way.\nElectrical signals direct your heart to pump the right amount of blood for your body's needs. The signals begin in an area called the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node).\nIn people with AFib, the electrical impulse of the heart is not regular."}

The signals begin in an area called the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node).\nIn people with AFib, the electrical impulse of the heart is not regular. This is because the sinoatrial node no longer controls the sequence of heart muscle contractions (rhythm) in the upper chambers of the heart (atria).\nIn AFib:\nThe atria do not contract in an organized pattern.\nThe lower chambers of the heart (ventricles) contract in an irregular manner that is often too fast.\nAs a result, the heart often cannot pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.\nIn people with atrial flutter, the atria beat very rapidly, but in a regular pattern.\nThese problems can affect both men and women. They become more common with increasing age.\nCommon causes of AFib include:\nAlcohol use (especially binge drinking)\nCoronary artery disease\nHeart attack\nor\nheart bypass surgery\nHeart failure\nor an enlarged heart\nHeart valve disease (most often the mitral valve)\nHypertension\nMedicines\nOveractive thyroid gland (\nhyperthyroidism\n)\nPericarditis\nSick sinus syndrome\nSymptoms\nYou may not be aware that your heart is not beating in a normal pattern."}

Call 911 or the local emergency number right away if you have chest pain or pressure.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider may hear a fast heartbeat while listening to your heart with a stethoscope. Your pulse may feel fast, uneven, or both.\nThe normal heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute. In Afib or flutter, the heart rate may be as high as 250 to 350 beats per minute and is very often over 100 beats per minute."}

These medicines are used to reduce the risk of developing a blood clot that travels in the body (and that can cause a stroke, for example). The irregular heart rhythm that occurs with AFib makes blood clots more likely to form.\nBlood thinner medicines include\nheparin\n,\nwarfarin\n(Coumadin), apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), edoxaban (Savaysa) and dabigatran (Pradaxa). Antiplatelet medicines such as\naspirin\nor\nclopidogrel\nmay also be prescribed. However, blood thinners increase the chance of bleeding, so not everyone can use them.\nAnother stroke prevention option for people who cannot safely take these medicines are left atrial appendage occlude (LAAO) devices."}
