Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to tell if a person has abnormal hemoglobin that causes sickle cell disease and sickle cell trait. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen.\nIn sickle cell disease, a person has  two abnormal hemoglobin S genes. A person with sickle cell trait has only  one of these abnormal genes and no symptoms, or only mild ones.\nThis test does not tell the difference between these two conditions."}

A person with sickle cell trait has only  one of these abnormal genes and no symptoms, or only mild ones.\nThis test does not tell the difference between these two conditions. Another test, called\nhemoglobin electrophoresis\n, will be done to tell which condition someone has.\nNormal Results\nA normal test result is called a negative result.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal test result indicates the person might have  one of these:\nSickle cell disease\nSickle cell trait\nIron deficiency or blood transfusions within the past 3 months can cause a false negative result. This means the person might have the abnormal hemoglobin for sickle cell, but these other factors are making their test results appear negative (normal).\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other."}
