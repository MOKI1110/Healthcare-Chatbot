Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAnisocoria\nAnisocoria\nAnisocoria is unequal pupil size. The pupil is the black part in the center of the eye. It gets larger in dim light and smaller in bright light.\nConsiderations\nSlight differences in pupil sizes are found in up to 1 in 5 healthy people. Most often, the diameter difference is less than 0.02 inches (in) or 0.5 millimeters (mm), but it can be up to 0.04 inch (1 mm).\nBabies born with different sized pupils may not have any underlying disorder. If other family members also have similar pupils, then the pupil size difference could be genetic and is nothing to worry about.\nAlso, for unknown reasons, pupils may temporarily differ in size. If there are no other symptoms and if the pupils return to normal, then it is nothing to worry about.\nUnequal pupil sizes of more than  0.04 in (1 mm) that develop later in life and do not return to equal size may be a sign of an eye, brain, blood vessel, or nerve disease.\nCauses\nThe use of eye drops is a common cause of a harmless change in pupil size."}
