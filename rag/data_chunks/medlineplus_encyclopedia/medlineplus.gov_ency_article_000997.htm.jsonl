This form of Down syndrome is called trisomy 21. The extra chromosome causes problems with the way the body and brain develop.\nDown syndrome is one of the most common causes of birth defects.\nSymptoms\nDown syndrome symptoms vary from person to person and can range from mild to severe. No matter how severe the condition is, people with Down syndrome have a widely-recognized appearance.\nThe head may be smaller than normal and abnormally shaped. For example, the head may be round with a flat area on the back."}

Most children with Down syndrome never reach average adult height.\nChildren may also have delayed mental and social development. Common problems may include:\nImpulsive behavior\nPoor judgment\nShort attention span\nSlow learning\nAs children with Down syndrome grow and become aware of their limitations, they may also feel frustration and anger.\nMany different medical conditions are seen in people with Down syndrome, including:\nBirth defects involving the heart, such as an\natrial septal defect\nor\nventricular septal defect\nDementia"}

They should have:\nAn eye exam every year during infancy\nHearing tests every 6 to 12 months, depending on age\nDental exams every 6 months\nX-rays of the upper or cervical spine between ages 3 and 5 years\nPap smears\nand pelvic exams beginning during puberty or by age 21\nThyroid testing every 12 months\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for Down syndrome.

But many infants with Down syndrome can successfully breastfeed.\nObesity can become a problem for older children and adults. Getting plenty of activity and avoiding high-calorie foods are important. Before beginning sports activities, your child's neck and hips should be examined.\nBehavioral training can help people with Down syndrome and their families deal with the frustration, anger, and compulsive behavior that often occur. Parents and caregivers should learn to help a person with Down syndrome deal with frustration. At the same time, it is important to encourage independence.\nTeen girls and women with Down syndrome are usually able to get pregnant.
