This area is the heart's pacemaker. The electrical signals travel to the lower chambers of the heart (ventricles). This keeps the heart beat steady and regular.\nHeart block occurs when the electrical signal is slowed down or does not reach the bottom chambers of the heart. Your heart may beat slowly, or it may skip beats. Heart block may resolve on its own, or it may be permanent and require treatment.\nThere are three degrees of heart block."}

First-degree heart block is the mildest type and third-degree is the most severe.\nFirst-degree heart block:\nRarely has symptoms or causes problems\nSecond-degree heart block:\nThe electrical impulse may not reach the lower chambers of the heart.\nThe heart may miss a beat or beats and may be slow and irregular.\nYou may feel dizzy, faint, or have other symptoms.\nThis may be serious in some cases.\nThird-degree heart block:\nThe electrical signal does not move to the lower chambers of the heart. In this case, the lower chambers beat at a much slower rate, and the upper and lower chambers do not beat sequentially (one after the other) as they do normally.\nThe heart fails to pump enough blood to the body. This can lead to fainting and shortness of breath.\nThis is an emergency that needs medical help right away.\nCauses\nHeart block may be caused by:\nSide effects of medicines."}
