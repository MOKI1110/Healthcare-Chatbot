Von Willebrand factor helps blood platelets clump together and stick to the blood vessel wall, which is necessary for normal blood clotting. There are several types of von Willebrand disease.\nA family history of a bleeding disorder is the primary risk factor.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nAbnormal menstrual bleeding\nBleeding of the gums\nBruising\nNosebleeds\nSkin rash\nNote:\nMost women with heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding do not have von Willebrand disease.\nExams and Tests\nVon Willebrand disease may be hard to diagnose."}

Low von Willebrand factor levels and bleeding do not always mean you have von Willebrand disease.\nTests that may be done to diagnose this disease include:\nBleeding time\nBlood typing\nFactor VIII level\nPlatelet function analysis\nPlatelet count\nRistocetin cofactor test\nVon Willebrand factor specific tests\nTreatment\nTreatment may include desmopressin (desamino-8-arginine vasopressin or DDAVP). It is a medicine to raise von Willebrand factor level and reduce the chances for bleeding.\nHowever, DDAVP does not work for all types of von Willebrand disease. Tests should be done to determine what type of von Willebrand you have."}

Tests should be done to determine what type of von Willebrand you have. If you are going to have surgery, your doctor may give you DDAVP before surgery to see if your von Willebrand factor levels increase.\nThe medicine Alphanate (antihemophilic factor) is approved to decrease bleeding in people with the disease who must have surgery or any other invasive procedure.\nBlood plasma or certain factor VIII preparations may also be used to decrease bleeding.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nBleeding may decrease during pregnancy. Women who have this condition usually do not have excessive bleeding during childbirth.\nThis disease is passed down through families.\nGenetic counseling\nmay help prospective parents understand the risk for their children.\nPossible Complications\nBleeding may occur after surgery or when you have a tooth pulled.\nAspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can make this condition worse."}
