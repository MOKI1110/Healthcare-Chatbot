Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAcromegaly\nAcromegaly\nAcromegaly is a condition in which there is too much growth hormone (GH) in your body.\nCauses\nAcromegaly is a rare condition. It is caused when the pituitary gland makes too much GH. The pituitary gland is a small\nendocrine gland\nattached to the bottom of the brain. It controls, makes, and releases several hormones, including GH.\nUsually, a noncancerous (benign) tumor of the pituitary gland releases too much GH. In rare cases, pituitary tumors can be inherited.\nIn children, too much GH causes\ngigantism\nrather than acromegaly.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of acromegaly may include any of the following:\nBody odor\nBlood in the stool\nCarpal tunnel syndrome\nDecreased muscle strength (\nweakness\n)\nDecreased peripheral vision\nDental problems, gaps between the teeth\nEasy\nfatigue\nEnlarged tongue\nExcessive height (when excess  GH production begins in childhood)\nExcessive sweating\nHeadache\nHeart enlargement, which can cause fainting or shortness of breath\nHoarseness\nJaw pain\nJoint pain\n, limited joint movement, swelling of the bony areas around a joint\nLarge bones"}

This involves drawing blood from a vein 4 or 5 times over 2 hours before and after drinking a specific amount of a sugar solution. Glucose and GH are measured in the blood.\nTreatment\nSurgery to remove the pituitary tumor that is causing this condition often corrects the abnormal GH. Sometimes, the tumor is too large to be removed completely and acromegaly is not cured. In this case, medicines and\nradiation\n(radiotherapy) may be used to treat acromegaly.\nSome people with tumors that are too complicated to remove by surgery are treated with medicines instead of surgery. These medicines may block the production of GH from the pituitary gland or prevent the action of GH in other parts of the body.\nAfter treatment, you will need to see your provider regularly to make sure that the pituitary gland is working normally and that acromegaly does not come back."}
