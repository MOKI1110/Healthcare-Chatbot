Other medicines, such as antivirals, may be given if your child has the flu.\nMany children can be treated at home.

Coughing helps the body get rid of mucus from the lungs.\nOther home care measures include:\nTo bring mucus up from the lungs, tap your child's chest gently a few times a day. This can be done as your child is lying down.\nHave your child take a couple of deep breaths 2 or 3 times every hour. Deep breaths help open up your child's lungs.\nMake sure your child drinks plenty of liquids. Ask your provider how much your child should drink each day.\nHave your child get plenty of rest, including napping throughout the day if needed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost children improve in 7 to 10 days with treatment.
