Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMesenteric venous thrombosis\nMesenteric venous thrombosis\nMesenteric venous thrombosis (MVT) is a\nblood clot\nin one or more of the major veins that drain blood from the intestine. The superior mesenteric vein is most commonly involved.\nCauses\nMVT is a clot that blocks blood flow in a mesenteric vein. There are  two such veins through which blood leaves the intestine. The condition stops the normal blood circulation of the intestine and can result in damage to the intestine.\nThe exact cause of MVT is unknown. However, there are many diseases that can lead to MVT."}

However, there are many diseases that can lead to MVT. Many of the diseases cause swelling (inflammation) of the tissues surrounding the veins, and include:\nAppendicitis\nCancer of the abdomen\nDiverticulitis\nLiver disease with\ncirrhosis\nHigh blood pressure in the blood vessels of the liver\nAbdominal surgery or trauma\nPancreatitis\nInflammatory bowel disorders  (\nCrohn disease\nand ulcerative colitis)\nHeart failure\nPeople who have disorders that make the blood more likely to stick together (clot) have a higher risk for MVT and include:\nProtein C or S deficiencies\nPolycythemia vera\nEssential thrombocythemia\nBirth control pills and estrogen medicines also increase risk.\nMVT is more common in men than women."}

It mainly affects middle aged or older adults.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nAbdominal pain\n, which may get worse after eating and over time\nBloating\nConstipation\nBloody\ndiarrhea\nFever\nSeptic shock\nLower gastrointestinal bleeding\nVomiting and nausea\nExams and Tests\nCT scan\nis the main test used to diagnose MVT.\nOther tests may include:\nAngiogram\n(studying the blood flow to the intestine)\nMRI of the abdomen\nUltrasound of the abdomen\nand mesenteric veins\nTreatment\nBlood thinners are used to treat MVT when there is no associated bleeding. In some cases, medicine can be delivered directly into the clot to dissolve it. This procedure is called thrombolysis.\nLess often, the clot is removed with a type of surgery called thrombectomy.\nIf there are signs and symptoms of a severe infection called\nperitonitis\n, surgery to remove the injured part of the intestine is done."}

After surgery, an\nileostomy\n(opening from the small intestine into a bag on the skin) or\ncolostomy\n(an opening from the colon into the skin) may be needed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook depends on the cause of the thrombosis and any damage to the intestine. Getting treatment for the cause before the intestine has died can result in a good recovery.\nPossible Complications\nIntestinal ischemia\nis a serious complication of MVT. Part or all of the intestine dies because of poor blood supply.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have severe or repeated episodes of abdominal pain.\nAlternative Names\nMVT\nReferences\nCloud A, Dussel JN, Webster-Lake C, Indes J.
