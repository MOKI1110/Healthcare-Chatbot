The artificial joint is called a\nprosthesis\n.\nDescription\nYour hip joint is made up of 2 major parts. One or both parts may be replaced during surgery:\nThe hip socket (a part of the pelvic bone called the acetabulum)\nThe upper end of the thighbone (called the femoral head)\nThe new hip that replaces the old one is made up of these parts:\nA socket, which is usually made of strong metal.\nA liner, which fits inside the socket. It is most often plastic. Some surgeons are now trying other materials, such as ceramic or metal. The liner allows the hip to move smoothly.\nA metal or ceramic ball that will replace the round head (top) of your thigh bone.\nA metal stem that is attached to the thigh bone to anchor the joint.\nYou will not feel any pain during surgery."}

You will have one of the following types of anesthesia:\nGeneral anesthesia\n-- This means you will be asleep and unable to feel pain.\nRegional (\nspinal or epidural\n) anesthesia -- Medicine is put into your back to make you numb below your waist. You will also get medicine to make you sleepy. And you may get medicine that will make you forget about the procedure, even though you will not be fully asleep.\nAfter you receive anesthesia, your surgeon will make a surgical cut to open up your hip joint. This cut is often over the buttocks or the side of your hip."}

Severe arthritis pain can limit your activities.\nMost of the time, hip joint replacement is done in people age 60 and older. Many people who have this surgery are younger. Younger people who have a hip replaced may put extra stress on the artificial hip. That extra stress can cause it to wear out earlier than in older people."}
