Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLegg-Calve-Perthes disease\nLegg-Calve-Perthes disease\nLegg-Calve-Perthes disease occurs when the ball of the thigh bone in the hip does not get enough blood, causing the bone to die.\nCauses\nLegg-Calve-Perthes disease usually occurs in boys 4 through 11 years old. There are many theories about the cause of this disease, but little is actually known.\nWithout enough blood to the area, the bone dies. The ball of the hip collapses and becomes flat. Most often, only one hip is affected, although it can occur on both sides.\nThe blood supply returns over several months, bringing in new bone cells. The new cells gradually replace the dead bone over 2 to 3 years.\nSymptoms\nThe first symptom is often limping, which is usually painless."}

Sometimes there may be mild pain that comes and goes.\nOther symptoms may include:\nHip stiffness that limits hip movement\nKnee pain\nLimited range of motion\nThigh or groin pain that does not go away\nShortening of the leg, or legs of unequal length\nMuscle loss in the upper thigh\nExams and Tests\nDuring a physical examination, your health care provider will look for a loss in hip motion and a typical limp. A hip x-ray or pelvis x-ray may show signs of Legg-Calve-Perthes disease. An\nMRI scan\nmay be needed.\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to keep the ball of the thigh bone inside the socket. The provider may call this containment."}

An\nMRI scan\nmay be needed.\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to keep the ball of the thigh bone inside the socket. The provider may call this containment. The reason for doing this is to make sure the hip continues to have good range of motion.\nThe treatment plan may involve:\nA short period of bed rest to help with severe pain\nLimiting the amount of weight placed on the leg by restricting activities such as running\nPhysical therapy to help keep the leg and hip muscles strong\nTaking anti-inflammatory medicine, such as ibuprofen, to relieve stiffness in the hip joint\nWearing a cast or brace to help with containment\nUsing crutches or a walker\nSurgery may be needed if other treatments do not work. Surgery ranges from lengthening a groin muscle to major hip surgery, called an osteotomy, to reshape the pelvis."}

Surgery ranges from lengthening a groin muscle to major hip surgery, called an osteotomy, to reshape the pelvis. The exact type of surgery depends on the severity of the problem and the shape of the ball of the hip joint.\nIt is important for the child to have regular follow-up visits with the provider and an orthopedic specialist.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nOutlook depends on the child's age and the severity of the disease.\nChildren younger than 6 years old who receive treatment are more likely to end up with a normal hip joint. Children older than age 6 are more likely to end up with a deformed hip joint, despite treatment, and may later develop arthritis in that joint.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider for an appointment if a child develops any symptoms of this disorder.\nAlternative Names\nCoxa plana; Perthes disease\nImages\nBlood supply to bone\nReferences\nMcClincy MP, Olgun ZD, Dede O.
