It does not involve a blockage (obstruction) of the outlet of the stomach.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of gastroparesis is unknown. It may be caused by a disruption of nerve signals to the stomach. The condition is a common complication of\ndiabetes\n. It can also follow some surgeries.\nRisk factors for gastroparesis include:\nDiabetes, especially long-term diabetes or if the blood sugar is very high\nGastrectomy\n(surgery to remove part of the stomach)\nSystemic sclerosis\nand other autoimmune diseases\nPost-viral illness\nParkinson disease\nUse of medicine such as those that block certain nerve signals (anticholinergic medicine) or muscle contraction (narcotic pain relievers)\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nAbdominal distention\nAbdominal pain\nHypoglycemia\n(in people with diabetes)\nNausea\nPremature abdominal fullness after meals\nor feeling full after eating only a small amount of food\nWeight loss\nwithout trying\nVomiting\nExams and Tests\nTests you may ne"}

Other tests that are used include a wireless motility capsule or a breath test.\nUpper GI series\n.\nTreatment\nPeople with diabetes should always control their blood sugar level. Better control of blood sugar level may improve symptoms of gastroparesis. Eating small and more frequent meals and soft/pureed foods (called a small-particle diet) may also help relieve some symptoms.\nMedicines that may help include:\nErythromycin (short-term only)\nMetoclopramide, a medicine that helps empty the stomach, or domperidone (available with special approval in the US)\nSerotonin (5-HT4) agonist medicines, which act on serotonin receptors\nAnti-nausea treatments to help control nausea and vomiting\nOther treatments may include:\nElectrical stimulation of the stomach\nEndoscopic myotomy (cutting muscles at the pylorus, the outlet of the stomach), called G-POEM (gastric per-oral endoscopic myotomy)\nSurgic"}

Gastroparesis is a chronic condition. Management of flare-ups may be helped by the use of diet and medicines. Endoscopic or surgical myotomy often provides a long-term improvement.\nPossible Complications\nOngoing nausea and vomiting may cause:\nDehydration\nElectrolyte\nimbalances\nMalnutrition\nPeople with diabetes may have serious complications from poor blood sugar control.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nChanges in your diet may help control symptoms."}
