The disorder is likely passed down through families.\nThe syndrome may be linked to problems in certain areas of the brain. It may have to do with chemical substances (dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine) that help nerve cells signal one another.\nTourette syndrome can be either severe or mild. Many people with very mild tics may not be aware of them and never seek medical help. Far fewer people have more severe forms of Tourette syndrome.\nTourette syndrome is 3 times as likely to occur in boys as in girls. There is a 50% chance that a person with Tourette syndrome will pass the gene onto his or her children, although the children may have no or fewer symptoms.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of Tourette syndrome are often first noticed during childhood, at about 6 years of age."}

Most children with Tourette syndrome also have other medical problems. These can include\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\n,\nobsessive compulsive disorder (OCD)\n, impulse control disorder, or depression.\nThe most common first symptom is a tic of the face. Other tics may follow. A tic is a sudden, fast, repeated movement or sound.\nSymptoms of Tourette syndrome can range from tiny, minor movements (such as grunts, sniffling, or coughing) to constant movements and sounds that cannot be controlled.\nDifferent types of tics can include:\nArm thrusting\nEye blinking\nJumping\nKicking\nRepeated throat clearing or sniffing\nShoulder shrugging\nTics may occur many times a day. They tend to improve or get worse at different times. The tics may change with time. Symptoms often get worse before the mid-teen years.\nContrary to popular belief, only a small number of people use curse words or other inappropriate words or phrases (coprolalia).\nTourette syndrome is different from OCD."}

People with OCD feel as though they have to do the behaviors. Sometimes a person can have both Tourette syndrome and OCD.\nMany people with Tourette syndrome can stop doing the tic for periods of time. But they find that the tic is stronger for a few minutes after they allow it to start again. Often, the tic slows or stops during sleep.\nExams and Tests\nThere are no lab tests to diagnose Tourette syndrome. Your health care provider will likely do an exam to check for other causes of the symptoms.\nTo be diagnosed with Tourette syndrome, a person must:\nHave had many motor tics and one or more vocal tics, although these tics may not have occurred at the same time.\nHave tics that occur many times a day, nearly every day or on and off, for a period of more than 1 year.\nHave started the tics before age 18.\nHave no other brain problem or taking medicines that could be a likely cause of the symptoms.\nTreatment\nPeople who have mild symptoms are not treated."}

This is because the side effects of the medicines may be worse than the symptoms of Tourette syndrome.\nA type of talk therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy) called habit-reversal may help to suppress tics.\nDifferent medicines are available to treat Tourette syndrome. The exact medicine that is used depends on the symptoms and any other medical problems.\nAsk your provider if deep brain stimulation is an option for you. It is being evaluated for the main symptoms of Tourette syndrome and the obsessive-compulsive behaviors. The treatment is not recommended when these symptoms and behaviors occur in the same person.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with Tourette syndrome and their families can be found at:\nTourette Association of America --\ntourette.org/online-support-groups-tourette-syndrome/\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSymptoms are often worst during the teenage years and then improve in early adulthood."}
