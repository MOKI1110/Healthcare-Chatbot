Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCulture-negative endocarditis\nCulture-negative endocarditis\nCulture-negative\nendocarditis\nis an infection and inflammation of the lining of one or more heart valves, but in which no endocarditis-causing germs (typically bacteria) can be found in a routine\nblood culture\n(most often 2 or 3 cultures are done when endocarditis is suspected). This is because certain germs do not grow well in a lab setting, or some people have received antibiotics in the past that keep such germs from growing outside of the body.\nEndocarditis is usually a result of a bloodstream infection. Bacteria can enter the bloodstream during certain medical procedures, including dental procedures or through intravenous injection using non-sterile needles. Then bacteria can travel to the heart, where they can settle on heart valves.\nAlternative Names\nEndocarditis (culture-negative)\nImages\nCulture-negative endocarditis\nReferences\nBaddour LM, Anavekar NS, Crestanello JA, Wilson WR.
