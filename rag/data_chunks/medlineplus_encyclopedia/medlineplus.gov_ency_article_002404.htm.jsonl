It is needed for normal growth and development.\nWater-soluble vitamins dissolve in water. Leftover amounts of the vitamin leave the body through the urine. Although the body keeps a small reserve of these vitamins, they have to be taken regularly to prevent a shortage in the body.\nFunction\nVitamin C is needed for the growth and repair of tissues in all parts of your body. It is used to:\nForm an important protein called collagen, used to make skin, tendons, ligaments, and blood vessels\nHeal wounds and form scar tissue\nRepair and maintain cartilage, bones, and teeth\nAid in the absorption of iron\nVitamin C is one of many antioxidants."}

Antioxidants are nutrients that block some of the damage caused by free radicals.\nFree radicals are made when your body breaks down food or when you are exposed to tobacco smoke or pollution.\nThe buildup of free radicals over time is largely responsible for the aging process.\nFree radicals may play a role in cancer, heart disease, and conditions like arthritis.\nThe body is not able to make vitamin C on its own. It does not store vitamin C."}

It does not store vitamin C. It is therefore important to include plenty of vitamin C-containing foods in your daily diet.\nFor many years, vitamin C has been a popular household remedy for the common cold.\nResearch shows that for most people, vitamin C supplements or vitamin C-rich foods do not reduce the risk of getting the common cold.\nHowever, people who take vitamin C supplements regularly might have slightly shorter colds or somewhat milder symptoms.\nTaking a vitamin C supplement after a cold starts does not appear to be helpful.\nFood Sources\nAll fruits and vegetables contain some amount of vitamin C.\nFruits with the highest content of vitamin C include:\nCantaloupe\nCitrus fruits and juices, such as orange and grapefruit\nKiwi fruit\nMango\nPapaya\nPineapple\nStrawberries, raspberries, blueberries, and cranberries\nWatermelon\nVegetables with the highest sources of vitamin C include:\nBroccoli, Brussels sprouts, and cauliflower\nGreen and red peppers\nSpinach, cabbage, turnip greens, and other leafy greens\nSweet and whi"}

Fortified means a vitamin or mineral has been added to the food. Check the product labels to see how much vitamin C is in the product.\nThe best food sources of vitamin C are uncooked or raw fruits and vegetables. Cooking vitamin C-rich foods or storing them for a long period of time can reduce the vitamin C content. Microwaving and steaming vitamin C-rich foods may reduce the content of vitamin C. Exposure to light can also reduce vitamin C content. Choose orange juice that is sold in a carton instead of a clear bottle.\nSide Effects\nSerious side effects from too much vitamin C are very rare, because the body cannot store the vitamin. However, amounts greater than 2,000 mg/day are not recommended. Doses this high can lead to stomach upset and diarrhea, and, although rarely, kidney stones."}

Large doses of vitamin C supplementation are not recommended during pregnancy. They can lead to shortage of vitamin C in the baby after delivery.\nToo little vitamin C can lead to signs and symptoms of deficiency, including:\nAnemia\nBleeding gums\nDecreased ability to fight infection\nDecreased wound-healing rate\nDry and splitting hair\nEasy bruising\nGingivitis\n(inflammation of the gums)\nNosebleeds\nPossible weight gain because of slowed metabolism\nRough, dry, scaly skin\nSwollen and painful joints\nWeakened tooth enamel\nA severe form of vitamin C deficiency is known as\nscurvy\n. This mainly affects older, malnourished adults.\nRecommendations\nRecommendations for vitamin C, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people."}
