It can develop when doses of the heart medicine, digitalis, are too high."}

It can develop when doses of the heart medicine, digitalis, are too high. It can also occur with a condition known as\nWolff-Parkinson-White syndrome\n, which often causes symptoms in young people and infants.\nThe following increase your risk for PSVT:\nAlcohol use\nCaffeine\nuse\nIllicit stimulant drug use\nSmoking\nSymptoms\nSymptoms most often start and stop suddenly. They can last for a few minutes or several hours. Symptoms may include:\nAnxiety\nChest tightness\nPalpitations\n(a sensation of feeling the heartbeat), often with an irregular or fast rate (racing)\nRapid pulse\nShortness of breath\nOther symptoms that can occur with this condition include:\nDizziness\nFainting\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam during a PSVT episode will show a rapid heart rate. It may also show forceful pulses in the neck.\nThe\nheart rate\nmay be over 100, and even more than 250 beats per minute (bpm). In children, the heart rate tends to be very high. There may be signs of poor blood circulation such as lightheadedness."}

Between episodes of PSVT, the heart rate is normal (60 to 100 bpm).\nAn\nelectrocardiogram\n(ECG) during symptoms shows PSVT. An\nelectrophysiology study\n(EPS) may be needed for an accurate diagnosis and to find the best treatment.\nBecause PSVT comes and goes, to diagnose it people may need to wear a 24-hour\nHolter monitor\n. For longer periods of time, another type of the rhythm recording device may be used.\nTreatment\nPSVT that occurs only once in a while may not need treatment if you don't have symptoms or other heart problems.\nYou can try the following techniques to interrupt a fast heartbeat during an episode of PSVT:\nValsalva maneuver."}
