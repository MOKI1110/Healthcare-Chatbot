Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLeydig cell testicular tumor\nLeydig cell testicular tumor\nA Leydig cell tumor is a\ntumor\nof the testicle. It develops from Leydig cells. These are the cells in the testicles that release the male hormone,\ntestosterone\n.\nCauses\nThe cause of this tumor is unknown. There are no known risk factors for this tumor. Unlike germ cell tumors of the testicles, this tumor does not seem to be linked to\nundescended testes\n.\nLeydig cell tumors make up a very small number of all testicular tumors. They are most often found in men between 30 and 60 years of age."}

This tumor is not common in children before puberty, but it may cause\nearly puberty\n.\nSymptoms\nThere may be no symptoms.\nWhen symptoms do occur, they can include:\nDiscomfort or pain in the testicle\nEnlargement of a testicle or change in the way it feels\nExcess growth of breast tissue (\ngynecomastia\n) -- however, this can occur normally in adolescent boys who do not have testicular cancer\nHeaviness in the scrotum\nLump or swelling in either testicle\nPain in the lower abdomen or back\nNot able to father children (infertility)\nSymptoms in other parts of the body, such as the lungs, abdomen, pelvis, back, or brain may also occur if the cancer has spread.\nExams and Tests\nA physical examination typically reveals a firm lump in one of the testicles. When your health care provider holds a flashlight up to your scrotum, the light does not pass through the lump."}

Nearby lymph nodes may also be removed (lymphadenectomy).\nChemotherapy\nmay be used to treat this tumor."}

As Leydig cell tumors are rare, these treatments have not been studied as much as treatments for other, more common testicular cancers.\nSupport Groups\nJoining a\nsupport group\nwhere members share common experiences and problems can often help ease the stress of illness.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nTesticular cancer is  one of the most treatable and curable cancers. The outlook is worse if the tumor is not found early.\nPossible Complications\nThe cancer may spread to other parts of the body."}
