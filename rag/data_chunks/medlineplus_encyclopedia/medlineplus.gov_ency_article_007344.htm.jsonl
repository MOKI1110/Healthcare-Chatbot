Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHeart CT scan\nHeart CT scan\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the heart is an imaging method that uses x-rays to create detailed pictures of the heart and its blood vessels.\nThis test is called a coronary calcium scan when it is done to see if you have a buildup of calcium in your heart arteries.\nIt is called CT angiography if it is done to look at the arteries that bring blood to your heart. This test evaluates if there is narrowing or a blockage in those arteries.\nThe test is sometimes done in combination with scans of the\naorta\nor\npulmonary arteries\nto look for problems with those structures.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will be asked to lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner.\nYou will lie on your back with your head and feet outside the scanner on either end.\nSmall patches, called electrodes are put on your chest and connected to a machine that records your heart's electrical activity."}

You may be given medicine to slow your heart rate.\nOnce you are inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you.\nA computer creates separate images of the body area, called slices.\nThese images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, or printed on film.\n3D (three-dimensional) models of the heart can be created.\nYou must be still during the exam because movement causes blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time.\nThe entire scan should only take about 10 minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nCertain exams require a special dye, called contrast, to be delivered into the body before the test starts. Contrast helps certain areas show up better on the x-rays.\nContrast can be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm."}

If contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.\nBefore receiving the contrast:\nLet your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast or any medicines. You may need to take medicines before the test in order to safely receive this substance.\nTell your provider about all your medicines, because you may be asked to hold some, such as the diabetes medicine metformin (Glucophage), prior to the test.\nLet your provider know if you have kidney problems. The contrast material can cause kidney function to worsen.\nIf you weigh more than 300 pounds (136 kilograms), find out if the CT machine has a weight limit."}

Having many x-rays or CT scans over time may increase your risk for cancer. However, the risk from any one scan is small. You and your provider should weigh this risk against the benefits of getting a correct diagnosis for a medical problem.\nSome people have allergies to contrast dye.
