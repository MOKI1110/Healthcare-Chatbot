The portal vein carries blood from your digestive organs to your liver.\nDescription\nDuring DSRS, the vein from your spleen is disconnected from the portal vein. The vein is then attached to the vein to your left kidney. This helps reduce blood flow through the portal vein.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThe portal vein brings blood from the intestine, spleen, pancreas, and gallbladder to the liver. When blood flow is blocked, the pressure in this vein becomes too high. This is called portal hypertension. It often occurs due to liver damage caused by:\nCirrhosis due to alcohol use\nChronic viral hepatitis\nBlood clots\nCertain congenital disorders\nPrimary biliary cirrhosis\n(liver scarring caused by blocked bile ducts)\nWhen blood can't flow normally through the portal vein, it takes another path. As a result, swollen blood vessels called varices form."}

They develop thin walls that can break and bleed into the esophagus and stomach.\nYou may have this surgery if imaging tests such as\nupper GI endoscopy\nor\nx-rays\nshow that you have bleeding varices in the esophagus or stomach. DSRS surgery reduces pressure in the varices and helps control bleeding.\nRisks\nRisks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:\nAllergic reactions to medicines or\nbreathing problems\nBleeding, blood clots, or infection\nRisks of this surgery include:\nBuildup of fluid in the belly (ascites)\nRepeat bleeding from the varices\nEncephalopathy\n(loss of brain function because the liver is unable to remove toxins from the blood)\nPancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), or a\npancreatic pseudocyst\n(fluid collection that forms by the pancreas that can cause pain)\nClotting of the shunt\nPortal vein thrombosis\nBefore the Procedure\nBefore the surgery, you may have certain tests:\nAngiogram\n(to view inside the blood vesse"}

The highest risk of bleeding again is in the first month after surgery.\nAlternative Names\nDSRS; Distal splenorenal shunt procedure; Renal - splenic venous shunt; Warren shunt; Cirrhosis - distal splenorenal; Liver failure - distal splenorenal; Portal vein pressure - distal splenorenal shunt\nImages\nHepatic venous circulation\nReferences\nDudeja V, Ferrantella A, Fong Y.
