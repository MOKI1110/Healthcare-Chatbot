Large amounts of bilirubin in the body can lead to\njaundice\nor yellowing of the skin.\nBilirubin may also be measured with a blood test.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis test can be done on any urine sample.\nFor an infant, thoroughly wash the area where urine exits the body.\nOpen a urine collection bag (a plastic bag with an adhesive paper on one end).\nFor males, place the entire penis in the bag and attach the adhesive to the skin.\nFor females, place the bag over the labia.\nDiaper as usual over the secured bag.\nThis procedure may take a few tries. An active baby can move the bag, causing urine to go into the diaper.\nCheck the infant often and change the bag after the infant has urinated into it."}
