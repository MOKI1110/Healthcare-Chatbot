You may also have back stiffness, decreased movement of the lower back, and difficulty standing straight.\nAcute back pain can last for a few days to a few weeks.\nCauses\nMost people have at least one backache in their life. Although this pain or discomfort can happen anywhere in your back, the most common area affected is your lower back. This is because the lower back supports most of your body's weight.\nLow back pain is the number two reason that Americans see their health care provider. It is second only to colds and flu.\nYou will usually first feel back pain just after you lift a heavy object, move suddenly, sit in one position for a long time, or have an injury or accident.\nAcute low back pain is most often caused by a sudden injury to the muscles and ligaments supporting the back."}

If you usually sleep on your back, place a pillow or rolled towel under your knees to relieve pressure.\nA common misbelief about back pain is that you need to rest and avoid activity for a long time. In fact, bed rest is not recommended. If you have no sign of a serious cause for your back pain (such as loss of bowel or bladder control, weakness, weight loss, or fever), then you should stay as active as possible.
