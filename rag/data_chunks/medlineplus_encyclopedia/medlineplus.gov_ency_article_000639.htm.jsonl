It is an infection with a bacteria called group A streptococcus.\nCauses\nStrep throat is most common in children from ages 5 and 15, although anyone can get it.\nStrep throat is spread by person-to-person contact with fluids from the nose or saliva. It commonly spreads among family or household members.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms appear about 2 to 5 days after coming in contact with the strep germ. They may be mild or severe.\nCommon symptoms include:\nFever\nthat may begin suddenly and is often the highest on the second day\nChills\nRed, sore throat that may have white patches\nPain when swallowing\nSwollen, tender neck glands\nOther symptoms may include:\nGeneral ill feeling\nloss of appetite\nand abnormal sense of taste\nHeadache\nNausea\nSome strains of strep throat can lead to a scarlet fever-like\nrash\n. The rash first appears on the neck and chest. It may then spread over the body."}

The rash first appears on the neck and chest. It may then spread over the body. The rash may feel rough like sandpaper.\nThe same germ that causes strep throat may also cause symptoms of a sinus infection or an ear infection.\nExams and Tests\nMany other causes of sore throat may have the same symptoms. Your health care provider must do a test to diagnose strep throat and decide whether to prescribe antibiotics.\nA rapid\nstrep test\ncan be done in most provider offices. However, the test may be negative, even if strep is present.\nIf the rapid strep test is negative and your provider still suspects that the strep bacteria is causing the sore throat, a throat swab can be tested (cultured) to see if strep grows from it. Results will take 1 to 2 days.\nTreatment\nMost sore throats are caused by viruses, not bacteria.\nA sore throat should be treated with antibiotics only if the strep test is positive."}

Antibiotics are taken to speed up your recovery and to prevent rare but more serious health problems, such as rheumatic fever.\nPenicillin or amoxicillin are most often the first drugs to be tried.\nCertain other antibiotics may also work against the strep bacteria.\nAntibiotics should be taken for 10 days, even though symptoms are often gone within a few days.\nThe following tips may help your sore throat feel better:\nDrink warm liquids, such as lemon tea or tea with honey.\nGargle several times a day with warm salt water (1/2 tsp or 3 grams of salt in 1 cup or 240 milliliters water).\nDrink cold liquids or suck on fruit-flavored ice pops.\nSuck on hard candies or throat lozenges."}

Young children should not be given these products because they can choke on them.\nA cool-mist vaporizer or humidifier can moisten and soothe a dry and painful throat.\nTry over-the-counter pain medicines, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin).\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSymptoms of strep throat most often get better in about 1 week. Untreated, strep can lead to serious complications.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nKidney disease caused by strep\nA skin condition in which small, red, and scaly teardrop-shaped spots appear on the arms, legs, and middle of the body, called\nguttate psoriasis\nAbscess in the area around the tonsils\nRheumatic fever\nScarlet fever\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you or your child develops the symptoms of strep throat."}

Also, contact your provider if symptoms do not get better within 24 to 48 hours of starting treatment.\nPrevention\nMost people with strep can spread the infection to others until they have been on antibiotics for 24 to 48 hours. They should stay home from school, daycare, or work until they have been on antibiotics for at least a day.\nGet a new toothbrush after 2 or 3 days, but before finishing the antibiotics. Otherwise, the bacteria can live on the toothbrush and reinfect you when the antibiotics are done. Also, keep your family's toothbrushes and utensils separate, unless they have been washed.\nIf repeated cases of strep still occur in a family, check to see if someone is a strep carrier. Carriers have strep in their throats, but the bacteria do not make them sick."}
