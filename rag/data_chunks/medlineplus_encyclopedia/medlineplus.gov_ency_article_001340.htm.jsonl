Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nECHO virus\nECHO virus\nEnteric cytopathic human orphan (ECHO) viruses are a group of viruses that can lead to infections in different parts of the body, and skin rashes.\nCauses\nEchovirus is one of several families of viruses that affect the gastrointestinal tract. Together, these are called enteroviruses. These infections are common. In the United States, they are most common in the summer and fall. You can catch the virus if you come into contact with stool contaminated by the virus, and possibly by breathing in air particles from an infected person.\nSerious infections with ECHO viruses are much less common but can be significant."}

For example, some cases of viral meningitis (inflammation of the tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord) are caused by an ECHO virus.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms depend on the site of the infection and may include:\nBreathing difficulty and harsh cough\n(croup)\nMouth sores\nSkin rashes\nSore throat\nChest pain if the infection affects the\nheart muscle\nor sac-like covering around the heart (\npericarditis\n)\nSevere headache, mental status changes, fever and chills, nausea and vomiting,\nsensitivity to light\n, if the infection affects the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (\nmeningitis\n)\nExams and Tests\nBecause the illness is often mild and has no specific treatment, testing for echovirus is often not done.\nIf needed, ECHO virus can be identified from a:\nRectal culture\nSpinal fluid culture\nor polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing\nStool culture\nThroat culture\nTreatment\nECHO virus infections almost always clear up on their own. No specific medicines are available to fight the virus."}

No specific medicines are available to fight the virus. Immune system treatment called intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may help people with severe ECHO virus infections who have a weakened immune system. Antibiotics are not effective against this virus, or any other virus.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPeople who have the less severe types of illness should recover completely without treatment. Infections of organs such as the heart may cause severe disease and can be deadly.\nPossible Complications\nComplications vary with the site and type of infection. Heart infections may be deadly, while most other types of infection improve and go away on their own.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have any of the symptoms listed above.\nPrevention\nNo specific preventive measures are available for ECHO virus infections other than hand-washing, especially when you are in contact with sick people."}
