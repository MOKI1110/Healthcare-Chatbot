The coughing can make it hard to breathe. A deep \"whooping\" sound is often heard when the person tries to take a breath.\nCauses\nPertussis, or whooping cough, is an upper respiratory infection. It is caused by the\nBordetella pertussis\nbacteria. It is a serious disease that can affect people of any age and cause permanent disability in infants, and even death.\nWhen an infected person sneezes or coughs, tiny droplets containing the bacteria move through the air. The disease is easily spread from person to person.\nThe symptoms of infection often last 6 weeks, but it can last as long as 10 weeks.\nSymptoms\nInitial symptoms are similar to the\ncommon cold\n. In most cases, they develop about a week after exposure to the bacteria.\nSevere episodes of coughing start about 10 to 12 days later. In infants and young children, the coughing sometimes ends with a \"whoop\" noise. The sound is produced when the person tries to take a breath."}

In infants and young children, the coughing sometimes ends with a \"whoop\" noise. The sound is produced when the person tries to take a breath. The whoop noise is rare in infants under 6 months of age and in older children or adults.\nCoughing spells may lead to vomiting or a short loss of consciousness. Pertussis should always be considered when vomiting occurs with coughing. In infants,\nchoking\nspells and long pauses in breathing are common.\nOther pertussis symptoms include:\nRunny nose\nSlight\nfever\n, 102 °F (38.9 °C) or lower\nDiarrhea\nExams and Tests\nThe initial diagnosis is most often based on the symptoms. However, when the symptoms are not obvious, pertussis may be hard to diagnose. In very young infants, the symptoms may be caused by pneumonia instead.\nTo know for sure, the health care provider may take a sample of mucus from the nasal secretions. The sample is sent to a lab and tested for pertussis. While this can offer an accurate diagnosis, the test takes some time."}

Most of the time, treatment is started before the results are ready.\nSome people may have a\ncomplete blood count\nthat shows large numbers of lymphocytes.\nTreatment\nIf started early enough, antibiotics such as erythromycin can make the symptoms go away more quickly. Unfortunately, most people are diagnosed too late, when antibiotics aren't very effective. However, the medicines can help reduce the person's ability to spread the disease to others.\nInfants younger than 18 months need constant supervision because their breathing may temporarily stop during coughing spells. Infants with severe cases should be hospitalized.\nAn oxygen tent with high humidity may be used.\nFluids may be given through a vein if coughing spells are severe enough to prevent the person from drinking enough fluids.\nSedatives (medicines to make you sleepy) may be prescribed for young children.\nCough mixtures, expectorants, and suppressants are most often not helpful."}

DTaP vaccine can be safely given to infants. Five DTaP vaccines are recommended. They are most often given to children at ages 2 months, 4 months, 6 months, 15 to 18 months, and 4 to 6 years.\nThe\nTdaP vaccine\nshould be given at age 11 or 12.\nDuring a pertussis outbreak, unimmunized children under age 7 should not attend school or public gatherings. They should also be isolated from anyone known or suspected to be infected. This should last until 14 days after the last reported case.\nIt is also recommended that adults age 19 and older receive 1 dose of the TdaP vaccine against pertussis.\nTdaP is especially important for health care professionals and anyone having close contact with a baby younger than 12 months old.\nPregnant women should get a dose of TdaP during every pregnancy between 27 and 36 weeks of pregnancy, to protect the newborn from pertussis.\nAlternative Names\nWhooping cough\nImages\nRespiratory system overview\nReferences\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention website."}
