Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMeconium aspiration syndrome\nMeconium aspiration syndrome\nMeconium aspiration syndrome (MAS) refers to breathing problems that a newborn baby may have when:\nThere are no other known causes of symptoms\nThe baby has passed meconium (stool) into the amniotic fluid during labor or delivery\nMAS may occur if the baby breathes (aspirates) this fluid into the lungs.\nCauses\nMeconium is the early stool passed by a newborn soon after birth, before the baby starts to feed and digest milk or formula.\nIn some cases, the baby passes meconium while still inside the uterus. This can happen when babies are \"under stress\"  due to a decrease in blood and oxygen supply. This is often due to problems with the placenta or the umbilical cord.\nOnce the baby passes the meconium into the surrounding amniotic fluid, they may breathe it into the lungs. This may happen:\nWhile the baby is still in the uterus\nDuring delivery\nImmediately after birth\nThe meconium can also block the infant's airways right after birth."}

This may happen:\nWhile the baby is still in the uterus\nDuring delivery\nImmediately after birth\nThe meconium can also block the infant's airways right after birth. It can cause breathing problems due to disrupting the balance of proteins normally present as well as causing swelling (inflammation) in the baby's lungs after birth and disrupting the normal changes of blood flow between the heart and lungs following birth.\nRisk factors that may cause stress on the baby before birth include:\n\"Aging\" of the placenta if the pregnancy goes far past the due date\nDecreased oxygen to the infant while in the uterus\nDiabetes\nin the pregnant mother\nDifficult delivery or long labor\nHigh blood pressure in the pregnant mother\nInfection in the placenta affecting the baby\nSymptoms\nMost babies who have passed meconium into the amniotic fluid do not breathe it into their lungs during labor and delivery."}
