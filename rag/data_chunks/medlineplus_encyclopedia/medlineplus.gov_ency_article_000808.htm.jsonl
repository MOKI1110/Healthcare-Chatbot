During the stage called rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, the eyes move quickly and vivid dreaming is most common.\nEach night, people go through several cycles of non-REM and REM sleep. Sleepwalking (somnambulism) most often occurs during deep, non-REM sleep (called N3 sleep) early in the night.\nSleepwalking is much more common in\nchildren\nand young adults than in older adults. This is because as people age, they have less N3 sleep. Sleepwalking tends to run in families.\nFatigue, lack of sleep, and\nanxiety\nare all associated with sleepwalking."}

In adults, sleepwalking may occur due to:\nAlcohol, sedatives, or other medicines, such as some sleeping pills\nMedical conditions, such as\nseizures\nMental disorders\nIn older adults, sleepwalking may be a symptom of a medical problem that causes decreased mental function\nneurocognitive disorder\n.\nSymptoms\nWhen people sleepwalk, they may sit up and look as though they are awake when they are actually asleep. They may get up and walk around. Or they may do complex activities such as moving furniture, going to the bathroom, and dressing or undressing. Some people even drive a car while they are asleep.\nThe episode can be very brief (a few seconds or minutes) or it can last for 30 minutes or longer. Most episodes last for less than 10 minutes. If they are not disturbed, sleepwalkers will go back to sleep."}

But they may fall asleep in a different or even unusual place.\nSymptoms of sleepwalking include:\nActing confused or disoriented when the person wakes up\nAggressive behavior when woken up by someone else\nHaving a blank look on the face\nOpening eyes during sleep\nNot remembering the sleep walking episode when they wake up\nPerforming detailed activity of any type during sleep\nSitting up and appearing awake during sleep\nTalking during sleep and saying things that do not make sense\nWalking during sleep\nExams and Tests\nUsually, examinations and testing are not needed. If the sleepwalking occurs often, your health care provider  may do an exam or tests to rule out other disorders (such as seizures).\nIf the person has a history of emotional problems, they also may need to have a mental health evaluation to look for causes such as excessive anxiety or stress.\nTreatment\nMost people do not need specific treatment for sleepwalking."}

Hypnosis and timed awakenings may help some people.\nIn some cases, medicines such as short-acting tranquilizers are helpful in reducing sleepwalking episodes. However, some of these medicines can also cause sleep walking.\nSome people mistakenly believe that a sleepwalker should not be awakened. It is not dangerous to awaken a sleepwalker, although it is common for the person to be confused or disoriented for a short time when they wake up.\nAnother misconception is that a person cannot be injured while sleepwalking. Sleepwalkers are commonly injured when they trip and lose their balance.\nSafety measures may be needed to prevent injury. This may include moving objects such as electrical cords or furniture to reduce the chance of tripping and falling. Stairways may need to be blocked with a gate.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSleepwalking usually decreases as children get older."}

It usually does not indicate a serious disorder, although it can be a symptom of other disorders.\nIt is unusual for sleepwalkers to perform activities that are dangerous. But precautions should be taken to prevent injuries such as falling down stairs or climbing out of a window.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nYou probably do not need to visit your provider. Discuss your  condition with your provider if:\nYou also have other symptoms\nSleepwalking is frequent or persistent\nYou  do dangerous activities (such as driving) while sleepwalking\nPrevention\nSleepwalking may be prevented by the following:\nDo not use  alcohol or anti-depressant medicines  if you sleepwalk.\nAvoid sleep deprivation, and try to prevent\ninsomnia\n, because these can trigger sleepwalking.\nAvoid or minimize stress, anxiety, and conflict, which can worsen the condition.\nAlternative Names\nWalking during sleep; Somnambulism\nReferences\nAvidan AY.
