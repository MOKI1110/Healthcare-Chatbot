Too much bad cholesterol in your blood can increase your chance of getting\nheart disease\n,\nstroke\n, and other problems.\nCommon medical terms for high blood cholesterol are lipid disorder, hyperlipidemia, or hypercholesterolemia, with the last being the most precise.\nCauses\nThere are many types of cholesterol. The ones talked about most are:\nTotal cholesterol -- all the cholesterols combined\nHigh density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol -- often called good cholesterol\nLow density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol -- often called bad cholesterol\nFor many people, abnormal cholesterol levels are partly due to\nlifestyle choices\n. This often includes\neating a diet that is high in fat\n."}

Several disorders that are passed down through families lead to abnormal cholesterol and triglyceride levels. They include:\nFamilial combined hyperlipidemia\nFamilial dysbetalipoproteinemia\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia\nFamilial hypertriglyceridemia\nSmoking does not cause higher cholesterol levels, but it can reduce your HDL (good) cholesterol.\nExams and Tests\nA cholesterol test is done to diagnose a lipid disorder."}

Different experts recommend different starting ages for adults.\nRecommended starting ages are between 20 to 35 for men and 20 to 45 for women.\nAdults with normal cholesterol levels should have the test repeated every 5 years.\nRepeat testing sooner if changes occur in lifestyle (including weight gain and diet).\nAdults with a history of elevated cholesterol, diabetes, kidney problems, heart disease, and other conditions require more frequent testing.\nIt is important to work with your health care provider to set your cholesterol goals. Newer guidelines steer providers away from targeting specific levels of cholesterol. Instead, they recommend different treatments or medicines and doses depending on a person's history and risk factor profile."}
