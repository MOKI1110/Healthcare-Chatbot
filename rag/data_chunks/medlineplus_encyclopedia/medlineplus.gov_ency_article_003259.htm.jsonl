Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRash - child under 2 years\nRash - child under 2 years\nA rash is a change in the color or texture of the skin. A skin rash can be:\nBumpy\nFlat\nRed, skin-colored, or slightly lighter or darker than skin color\nScaly\nConsiderations\nMost bumps and blotches on a newborn baby are harmless and clear up by themselves.\nThe most common skin problem in infants is diaper rash. Diaper rash is an irritation of the skin caused by dampness, urine, or feces. Most babies who wear diapers will have some type of diaper rash at some point.\nOther skin disorders can cause rashes. These are most often not serious unless they occur with other symptoms.\nCauses\nCauses may include:\nDiaper rash (rash in the diaper area)\nis a skin irritation caused by long-term dampness and by urine and feces touching the skin.\nYeast diaper rash is caused by a type of yeast called Candida, which also causes thrush in the mouth. The rash looks different from a regular diaper rash. It is very red, and there are usually small red bumps on the outer edges of the rash."}

The rash looks different from a regular diaper rash. It is very red, and there are usually small red bumps on the outer edges of the rash. This rash requires treatment with medicine.\nHeat rash, or prickly heat, is caused by the blockage of the pores that lead to the sweat glands. It is most common in very young children but can occur at any age. It is more common in hot and humid weather. The sweat is held within the skin and forms little red bumps or occasionally small\nblisters\n.\nErythema toxicum\ncan cause flat red splotches (usually with a white, pimple-like bump in the middle) that appear in up to one half of all babies. This rash rarely appears after 5 days of age, and most often disappears in 7 to 14 days. It is nothing to worry about.\nBaby acne is caused by exposure to the mother's hormones. Red bumps, sometimes with white dots in the center, may be seen on a newborn's face."}

Acne most often occurs between 2 and 4 weeks of age, but may appear up to 4 months after birth and can last for 12 to 18 months.\nCradle cap\n(seborrheic dermatitis) causes greasy, scaling, crusty patches on the scalp that appear in a baby's first 3 months. It most often goes away by itself, but in some cases may require treatment with medicine.\nEczema\nis a condition of the skin in which areas are dry, scaly, red (or darker than normal skin color), and itchy. When it goes on for a long time the areas become thickened. It is often associated with asthma and allergies, although it can often occur without either of these. Eczema often runs in families.\nHives\nare red welts that often seem to move around on the body. For example, if you drew a circle to mark one of the welts, a few hours later that circle would not have a welt in it, but there may be welts on other parts of the body. They differ in size and shape. Hives may last for a few weeks."}

Allow the baby's skin to air dry as long as is practical. Launder cloth diapers in mild soap and rinse well. Avoid using plastic pants. Avoid irritating wipes (especially those containing alcohol) when cleaning the infant.\nOintments or creams may help reduce friction and protect the baby's skin from irritation. Powders such as cornstarch or talc should be used cautiously, as they can be inhaled by the infant and may cause lung injury.\nIf your baby has a\nyeast diaper rash\n, the health care provider will prescribe an antifungal cream to treat it.\nOTHER RASHES\nHeat rash or prickly heat is best treated by providing a cooler and less humid environment for the child.\nPowders are unlikely to help treat heat rash and should be stored out of reach of the infant to prevent accidental inhalation."}

You do not need to do anything for it.\nWhite or clear\nmilia/miliaria\nwill go away on their own. You do not need to do anything for it.\nFor hives, talk with your provider to try to find the cause. Some causes require prescription medicines. Antihistamines may help stop the itching.\nBABY ACNE\nNormal washing is all that is necessary to treat baby acne most of the time. Use plain water or mild baby soap and only bathe your baby every 2 to 3 days. Avoid acne medicines used by adolescents and adults.\nCRADLE CAP\nFor cradle cap, wash the hair or scalp with water or a mild baby shampoo. Use a brush to remove the flakes of dry skin. If this cannot be removed easily, apply an oil to the scalp to soften it. Cradle cap most often disappears by 18 months."}
