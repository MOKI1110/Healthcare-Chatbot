This article focuses on needle-based, ultrasound-guided breast biopsies. This procedure is usually done by a radiologist or surgeon.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou are asked to undress from the waist up. You wear a robe that opens in the front."}

This procedure is usually done by a radiologist or surgeon.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou are asked to undress from the waist up. You wear a robe that opens in the front. During the biopsy, you are awake.\nYou lie on your back.\nThe biopsy is done in the following way:\nYour doctor cleans the area on your breast.\nNumbing medicine is injected.\nYour doctor makes a very small cut on your breast over the area that needs to be biopsied.\nYour doctor uses an ultrasound machine to guide the needle to the abnormal area in your breast that needs to be biopsied.\nSeveral small pieces of tissue are taken.\nA small metal clip may be placed into the breast in the area of the biopsy to mark it, if needed.\nThe biopsy is done using one of the following:\nFine needle aspiration\nHollow needle (called a core needle)\nVacuum-powered device\nBoth a hollow needle and vacuum-powered device\nOnce the tissue sample has been taken, the needle is removed. Ice and pressure are applied to the site to stop any bleeding. A bandage is applied to absorb any fluid. You do not need any stitches after the needle is taken out."}

If needed, strips of tape may be placed to close the wound.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour doctor will ask about your medical history and may perform a manual breast exam.\nIf you take blood thinning medicines (including aspirin, supplements, or herbs), ask your doctor whether you need to stop taking these before the biopsy. Ask which medicines you should still take on the day of biopsy.\nLet your doctor know If you may be pregnant or about any illness you may have before your biopsy. This includes\nCOVID-19\n, a\ncold\n,\nflu\n, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness. If you do get sick, your biopsy may need to be postponed.\nDo not use lotion, perfume, powder, or deodorant underneath your arms or on your breasts.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the numbing medicine is injected, it may sting a bit.\nDuring the procedure, you may feel slight discomfort or light pressure.\nAfter the test, the breast may be sore and tender to the touch for several days."}
