Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nOphthalmoscopy\nOphthalmoscopy\nOphthalmoscopy is an examination of the back part of the eye (fundus), which includes the\nretina\n, optic disc,\nchoroid\n, and blood vessels.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThere are different types of ophthalmoscopy.\nDirect ophthalmoscopy\n. You will be seated in a darkened room. The health care provider performs this exam by shining a beam of light through the pupil using an instrument called an ophthalmoscope. An ophthalmoscope is about the size of a flashlight. It has a light and different small lenses that allow the provider to view the back of the eyeball.\nIndirect ophthalmoscopy\n. You will either lie or sit in a semi-reclined position. The provider holds your eye open while shining a very bright light into the eye using an instrument worn on their head. (The instrument looks like a miner's light.) The provider views the back of the eye through a lens held close to your eye. Some pressure may be applied to the eye using a small, blunt probe. You will be asked to look in various directions."}

The provider views the back of the eye through a lens held close to your eye. Some pressure may be applied to the eye using a small, blunt probe. You will be asked to look in various directions. This exam is usually used to look for a\ndetached retina\n.\nSlit-lamp ophthalmoscopy\n. You will sit in a chair with the instrument placed in front of you. You will be asked to rest your chin and forehead on a support to keep your head steady. The provider will use the microscope part of the slit lamp and a tiny lens placed close to the front of the eye. The provider can see about the same with this technique as with indirect ophthalmoscopy, but with higher magnification and narrower field of view.\nThe ophthalmoscopy examination takes about 5 to 10 minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nIndirect ophthalmoscopy and slit-lamp ophthalmoscopy are often performed after eyedrops are placed to widen (dilate) the pupils."}

Direct ophthalmoscopy and slit-lamp ophthalmoscopy can be performed with or without the pupil dilated.\nYou should tell your provider if you:\nAre allergic to any medicines\nAre taking any medicines\nHave\nglaucoma\nor a family history of glaucoma\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe bright light will be uncomfortable, but the test is not painful.\nYou may briefly see images after the light shines in your eyes. The light is brighter with indirect ophthalmoscopy, so the sensation of seeing after-images may be greater.\nPressure on the eye during indirect ophthalmoscopy may be slightly uncomfortable, but it should not be painful.\nIf eyedrops are used, they may sting briefly when placed in the eyes."}

You may also have an unusual taste in your mouth.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nOphthalmoscopy may be done as part of a routine physical but is always part of a complete eye examination.\nIt is used to detect and evaluate symptoms of retinal detachment or eye diseases such as glaucoma.\nOphthalmoscopy may also be done if you have signs or symptoms of high blood pressure, diabetes, or other diseases that affect the blood vessels.\nNormal Results\nThe retina, blood vessels, and the optic disc appear normal.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be seen on ophthalmoscopy with any of the following conditions:\nViral inflammation of the retina (\nCMV retinitis\n)\nDiabetes\nGlaucoma\nHigh blood pressure\nLoss of sharp, central vision due to\nage-related macular degeneration\nMelanoma of the eye\nOptic nerve problems\nSeparation of the retina in the back of the eye from its supporting layers (retinal detachment)\nOphthalmoscopy is considered to be 90% to 95% accurate."}

It can detect the early stages and effects of many serious diseases. For conditions that cannot be detected by ophthalmoscopy, there are other techniques and devices that may be helpful.\nRisks\nIf you receive drops to dilate your eyes for the ophthalmoscopy, your vision will be blurred.\nWear sunglasses to protect your eyes from sunlight, which can damage your eyes.\nHave someone drive you home.\nThe drops usually wear off in several hours.\nThe test itself involves no risk. In rare cases, the dilating eyedrops cause:\nAn attack of narrow-angle glaucoma\nDizziness\nDryness of the mouth\nFlushing\nNausea and vomiting\nIf narrow-angle glaucoma is suspected, dilating drops are usually not used.\nAlternative Names\nFunduscopy; Funduscopic exam\nImages\nEye\nSide view of the eye (cut section)\nReferences\nAtebara NH, Miller D, Thall EH, Brodie SE.
