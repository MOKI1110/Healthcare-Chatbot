This can cause problems with development and fertility. Some men have no symptoms and never know they have it.\nCauses\nMost people have 46 chromosomes. Chromosomes contain all of your genes and DNA, the building blocks of the body. The 2 sex chromosomes (X and Y) determine the genetic sex of a child.  The genetic sex of a child is determined at conception. The mother's egg cell contains an X chromosome, while the father's sperm cell contains either an X or a Y chromosome.\nNormally, an infant inherits 1 pair of sex chromosomes, 1 X from the mother and 1 X or 1 Y from the father. A baby who inherits the X chromosome from the father is a genetic female and has 2 X chromosomes. A baby who inherits the Y chromosome from the father is a genetic male and has 1 X and 1 Y\nchromosome\n.\nKlinefelter syndrome results when a male child is born with at least 1 extra X chromosome."}

They have 47 chromosomes instead of 46. This is written as 47, XXY.\nKlinefelter syndrome occurs as a random event. There is no exact cause, and the condition is not inherited.\nKlinefelter syndrome occurs in about 1 out of 500 to 1,000 male infants. Women who get pregnant after age 35 are slightly more likely to have a male child with this syndrome than younger women.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms vary widely, with some males having few or only mild signs. Some may never know they have the condition or only discover it as adults when they have fertility problems."}
