It is usually done by a general dentist, an oral surgeon, or a periodontist.\nDescription\nThe procedure will take place in the dental office or hospital dental clinic. It may involve removing one or more teeth. You may be asked to take antibiotics before the procedure.\nYou will get a local anesthetic to numb the area around the tooth so you do not feel pain.\nYour dentist may loosen the tooth in the gum using a tooth removal instrument called an elevator.\nYour dentist will then place forceps around the tooth and pull the tooth out from the gum.\nIf you need a more complex tooth extraction (often done by an oral surgeon):\nYou may be given sedation so you are relaxed and asleep, as well as an anesthetic so you are pain-free.\nThe surgeon may need to remove several teeth using the methods above.\nFor an\nimpacted tooth\n, the surgeon may have to cut a flap of gum tissue and remove some surrounding bone."}

The tooth will be removed with forceps. If it is hard to remove, the tooth may be sectioned (broken) into pieces.\nAfter your tooth is removed:\nYour dentist will clean out the socket and smooth out the bone.\nThe gum may need to be closed with one or more stitches, also called sutures.\nYou will be asked to bite down on a damp piece of gauze to stop the bleeding.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThere are several reasons people have a tooth pulled:\ndeep infection in a tooth\n(abscess)\nOvercrowded or poorly positioned teeth\nGum disease\nthat loosens or damages teeth\nTooth injury from trauma\nImpacted teeth that are causing problems, such as wisdom teeth (third molars)\nRisks\nWhile uncommon, certain problems may occur:\nThe blood clot in the socket falls out days after the extraction (this is known as\ndry socket\n)\nInfection\nNerve damage\nFractures caused by instruments used during the procedure\nDamage to other teeth or restorations\nBruising and swelling at the treatment site\nDiscomfort or pain at t"}

A tooth extraction can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream. So be sure to tell your dentist if you have or have had conditions that may make you prone to infection. These may include:\nHeart disease\nLiver disease\nWeakened immune system\nRecent surgery, including heart surgery and bone and joint procedures that involve metal hardware\nAfter the Procedure\nYou may go home shortly after the procedure.\nYou will have gauze in your mouth to stop the bleeding. This will also help a blood clot to form."}

This will also help a blood clot to form. The clot fills the socket as the bone grows back in.\nYour lips and cheek may be numb, but this will wear off in a few hours.\nYou may be given an ice pack for your cheek area to help keep swelling down.\nAs the numbing medicine wears off, you may begin to feel pain. Your dentist will recommend pain relievers, such as ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil). Or, you may be given a prescription for pain medicine.\nTo help with healing:\nTake any antibiotics or other medicines as prescribed.\nYou can apply a cold compress 10 to 20 minutes at a time to your cheek to reduce swelling and pain. Use ice in a towel or a cold pack. Do not place ice directly on the skin.\nAvoid doing too much physical activity for the first couple of days.\nDo not smoke or use tobacco.\nWhen eating or drinking:\nChew on the other side of your mouth.\nEat soft foods such as yogurt, mashed potatoes, soup, avocado, and bananas until the wound heals. Avoid hard and crunchy foods for 1 week.\nDo not drink from a straw for at least 24 hours."}

Avoid hard and crunchy foods for 1 week.\nDo not drink from a straw for at least 24 hours. This can disturb the blood clot in the hole where the tooth was, causing bleeding and pain. This is called a dry socket.\nTo care for your mouth:\nBegin gently brushing and flossing your other teeth the day after your surgery, or as instructed by your dentist or surgeon.\nAvoid the area near the open socket for at least 3 days. Avoid touching it with your tongue.\nYou may rinse and spit starting about 3 days after surgery. Your dentist may ask you to gently wash out the socket with a syringe filled with water and salt.\nThe stitches may loosen (this is normal) and will dissolve on their own.\nFollow up:\nFollow up with your dentist as directed.\nSee your dentist for regular cleanings.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nEveryone heals at a different rate. It will take 1 to 2 weeks for the socket to heal. Affected bone and other tissue may take a bit longer to heal."}
