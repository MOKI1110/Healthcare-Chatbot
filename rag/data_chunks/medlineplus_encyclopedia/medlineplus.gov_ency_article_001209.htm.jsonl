One side of the body may also appear to be larger than the other.\nCauses\nIn 35% to 67% of cases, SRS is due to a variant in chromosome 11. A variant in chromosome 7 accounts for 7% to 10% of cases. The remaining 30% to 40% of cases have unknown causes.\nMost of the time, it occurs in people with no family history of the disease.\nThe estimated number of people who develop this condition varies greatly."}

Males and females are equally affected.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms can include:\nBirthmarks that are the color of coffee with milk (\ncafe-au-lait\nmarks)\nLarge head for body size, wide projecting forehead with a small triangle-shaped face and small, narrow chin\nCurving of the pinky toward the ring finger\nFailure to thrive\n, including delayed bone age\nLow birth weight\nShort height, short arms, stubby fingers and toes\nAll or part of one side of the body is smaller than the other side (asymmetry)\nStomach and intestine problems such as acid reflux and constipation\nExams and Tests\nThe condition is usually diagnosed by early childhood. Your health care provider will perform a physical exam.\nThere are no specific lab tests to diagnose SRS. The diagnosis is usually based on the judgment of your child's provider."}

Other treatments include:\nMaking sure the person gets enough calories to prevent low blood sugar and promote growth\nPhysical therapy to improve muscle tone\nEducational assistance to address learning disabilities and\nattention deficit problems\nthe child may have\nMany specialists may be involved in treating a person with this condition."}

Intelligence may be normal, although the person may have a learning disability. Birth defects of the urinary tract may be present.\nPossible Complications\nPeople with SRS may have these problems:\nChewing or speaking difficulty if jaw is very small\nLearning disabilities\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your child's provider if signs of SRS develop.
