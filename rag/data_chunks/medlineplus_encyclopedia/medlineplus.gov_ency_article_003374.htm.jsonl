This protein is called thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG).\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis taken and then sent to a laboratory for testing.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nCertain drugs and medicines can affect test results. Your health care provider may tell you to stop taking a certain medicine for a short time before the test. Never stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.\nThese medicines and drugs can increase TBG level:\nEstrogens, found in birth control pills and estrogen replacement therapy\nHeroin\nMethadone and opioids\nPhenothiazines (certain antipsychotic medicines)\nThe following medicines can decrease TBG levels:\nDepakote or depakene (also called valproic acid)\nDilantin (also called phenytoin) and carbamazepine\nHigh doses of salicylates, including aspirin\nMale hormones, including androgens and testosterone\nPrednisone or other glucocorticoids (steroids)\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is ins"}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test may be done to diagnose problems with your thyroid.\nNormal Results\nNormal range is 13 to 39 micrograms per deciliter (mcg/dL), or 0.13 to 0.39 milligrams per liter (mg/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples."}

Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn increased TBG level may be due to:\nAcute intermittent porphyria\n(a rare metabolic disorder)\nHypothyroidism\n(underactive thyroid)\nLiver disease\n, such as hepatitis\nPregnancy (TBG levels normally increased during pregnancy)\nNote: TBG levels are normally high in newborns.\nDecreased TBG levels may be due to:\nAcute\nillness\nAcromegaly\n(disorder caused by too much growth hormone)\nHyperthyroidism\n(overactive thyroid)\nMalnutrition\nNephrotic syndrome\n(symptoms that show kidney damage is present)\nStress from surgery\nHigh or low TBG levels affect the relationship between total T4 and\nfree T4\nblood tests. A change in TBG blood levels can alter the appropriate dose of levothyroxine replacement for persons with hypothyroidism.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
