It causes a chickenpox-like\nrash\non the body.\nCauses\nRickettsialpox is caused by the bacteria,\nRickettsia akari\n. It is commonly found in the United States in New York City and other cities. It also has been seen in Europe, South Africa, Korea, and Russia.\nThe bacteria are spread by the bite of a mite that lives on mice.\nSymptoms\nThe disease begins at the site of the\nmite bite\nas a painless, firm, red lump (\nnodule\n). The nodule develops into a fluid-filled\nblister\nthat bursts and crusts over. This lump may be up to 1 inch (in) or 2.5 centimeters (cm) wide. These lumps usually appear on the face, trunk, arms, and legs. They do not appear on the palms of hands and soles of feet."}
