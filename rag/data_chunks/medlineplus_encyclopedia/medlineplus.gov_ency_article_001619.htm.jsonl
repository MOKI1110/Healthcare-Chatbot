It most often occurs where the eyelashes grow. Dandruff-like debris builds up at the base of the eyelashes as well.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of blepharitis is unknown. It is thought to be due to:\nAn overgrowth of bacteria.\nA skin mite called Demodex.\nA decrease or breakdown of the normal oils produced by the eyelid.\nBlepharitis is more likely to be seen in people with:\nA skin condition called\nseborrheic\ndermatitis or seborrhea. This problem may involve the scalp, eyebrows, eyelids, skin behind the ears, and the creases of the nose.\nAllergies\nthat affect the eyelashes (less common).\nExcess growth of the bacteria that are normally found on the skin.\nRosacea\n, which is a skin condition that causes a red rash on the face.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nRed, irritated eyelids\nScales\nthat stick to the base of the eyelashes\nBurning feeling in the eyelids\nCrusting,\nitching\nand swelling of the eyelids\nYou may feel like you have sand or dust in your eye when you blink."}

Sometimes, the eyelashes may fall out. The eyelids may become scarred if the condition continues long-term.\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider can most often make the diagnosis by looking at the eyelids during an eye exam.  Special photos of the glands that produce oil for the eyelids can be taken to see if they are healthy or not.\nTreatment\nCleaning the edges of the eyelid every day will help remove excess bacteria and oil. Your provider might recommend using baby shampoo or special cleansers. Using an antibiotic ointment on the eyelid or taking antibiotic pills may help treat the problem."}

It may also help to take fish oil supplements.\nIf you have blepharitis:\nApply warm compresses to your eyes for 5 minutes, at least 2 times per day.\nAfter the warm compresses, gently rub a solution of warm water and no-tears baby shampoo along your eyelid, where the lash meets the lid, using a cotton swab.\nA device has recently been developed that can warm and massage the eyelids to increase the flow of oil from the glands. The role of this device in treatment of blepharitis remains unclear.\nA medicine containing hypochlorous acid, which is sprayed onto the eyelids is helpful in certain cases of blepharitis, especially when rosacea is also present.\nIf Demodex is suspected as the cause, tea tree oil applied to the lids by your provider can be helpful; a new prescription medicine has recently become available. The medicine is lotilaner ophthalmic solution.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome is most often good with treatment."}
