Dengue in its mild form causes fever and a rash and lasts about a week. Severe dengue can cause shock, internal bleeding, and death. About 1 out of 20 people with dengue will develop severe dengue within a few hours after symptoms start. The main risk factor for severe dengue is a prior infection with dengue.\nCauses\nDengue fever is caused by 1 of 4 different but related viruses. It is spread by the bite of mosquitoes, most commonly the mosquito\nAedes aegypti\n, which is found in tropic and subtropic regions. This area includes parts of:\nThe Indonesian archipelago into northeastern Australia\nSouth and Central America\nSoutheast Asia\nSub-Saharan Africa\nThe Caribbean (including Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands)\nDengue fever is rare in the US mainland, but has been found in Hawaii, Florida, and Texas."}

Since 2022, dengue has also been reported in California and Arizona.\nMany cases in the United States occur when someone travels to an area where dengue is present and returns home with the illness. Dengue cannot spread from human to human.\nSymptoms\nDengue fever begins with a sudden high fever, often as high as 105 °F (40.6 °C), 4 to 7 days after the infection.\nA flat, red rash may appear over most of the body 2  to 5 days after the fever starts. A second rash, which looks like\nmeasles\n, appears later in the disease. Infected people may have increased skin sensitivity and are very uncomfortable.\nOther symptoms include:\nFatigue\nHeadache (especially behind the eyes)\nJoint aches\n(often severe)\nMuscle aches\n(often severe)\nNausea and vomiting\nSwollen lymph nodes\nCough\nSore throat\nNasal stuffiness\nSymptoms of severe dengue can occur 24 to 48 hours after the fever has gone away."}

Fluids are given if there are signs of\ndehydration\n. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is used to treat a high fever.\nAvoid taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve). They may increase bleeding problems.\nSevere dengue is a medical emergency."}
