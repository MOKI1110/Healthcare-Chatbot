When it becomes swollen (inflamed) or infected, the condition is called\nappendicitis\n. When you have appendicitis, your appendix may need to be removed. An appendix that has a hole in it can leak and infect the entire abdomen area. This can be life threatening.\nAppendectomy is done using either:\nSpinal anesthesia\n-- Medicine is put into your lower back to make you numb below your waist. You will also get medicine to make you sleepy.\nGeneral anesthesia\n-- You will be asleep and not feel any pain during the surgery.\nYour surgeon may make a small cut in the lower right side of your belly area and remove the appendix.\nYour appendix can also be removed using small surgical cuts and a camera. This is called a laparoscopic appendectomy.\nIf your appendix broke open or a pocket of infection (\nabscess\n) formed, your abdomen may be washed out during surgery."}

A small tube may be left in the belly area to help drain out fluids or pus.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nAn appendectomy is done for appendicitis. The condition can be hard to diagnose, especially in children, older people, and women of childbearing age.\nMost often, the first symptom is pain around your belly button:\nThe pain may be mild at first, but it becomes sharp and severe.\nThe pain often moves into your right lower abdomen and becomes more focused in this area.\nOther symptoms include:\nDiarrhea or constipation\nFever (usually not very high)\nNausea and vomiting\nReduced appetite\nIf you have symptoms of appendicitis, seek medical help right away. Do not use heating pads, enemas, laxatives, or other home treatments to try to relieve symptoms.\nYour health care provider will examine your abdomen and may perform a rectal exam and pelvic exam."}

Do not use heating pads, enemas, laxatives, or other home treatments to try to relieve symptoms.\nYour health care provider will examine your abdomen and may perform a rectal exam and pelvic exam. Other tests may be done:\nBlood tests, including a\nwhite blood cell (WBC) count\n, may be done to check for infection.\nYour provider may order a\nCT scan\nor\nultrasound\nto determine if the appendix is the cause of the problem since other illnesses can cause the same or similar symptoms.\nThe goal is to remove an infected appendix before it breaks open (ruptures). After reviewing your symptoms and the results of the physical exam and medical tests, your surgeon will decide whether you need surgery.\nRisks\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general include:\nReactions to medicines\nProblems breathing\nBleeding, blood clots, or infection\nRisks of an appendectomy after a ruptured appendix include:\nBuildup of pus (abscess), which may need draining and antibiotics\nInfection of the incision\nAfter the Procedure\nMost people leave the hospital in 1 to 2 days after surgery."}

You can go back to your normal activities within a few weeks after leaving the hospital though it may take several weeks to get back to your normal energy level.\nIf you had laparoscopic surgery, you will likely recover quickly. Recovery is slower and more complicated if your appendix has broken open or an abscess has formed.\nLiving without an appendix causes no known health problems.\nAlternative Names\nAppendix removal; Surgery - appendectomy; Appendicitis - appendectomy\nImages\nAnatomical landmarks adult - front view\nAppendectomy  - series\nDigestive system\nReferences\nQuick CRG, Biers SM, Arulampalam THA.
