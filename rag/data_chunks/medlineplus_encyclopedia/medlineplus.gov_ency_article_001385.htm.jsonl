The problem is most often associated with\nhoarseness\nor loss of voice.\nCauses\nThe voice box (larynx) is located at the top of the airway to the lungs (trachea). The larynx contains the vocal cords. When the vocal cords become inflamed or infected, they swell. This can cause hoarseness. Sometimes, the airway can get blocked.\nThe most common form of laryngitis is an infection caused by a virus. It may also be caused by:\nAllergies\nBacterial infection\nBronchitis\nGastroesophageal reflux disease\n(GERD)\nInjury to the throat\nIrritants and chemicals\nOveruse of the voice\nLaryngitis often occurs with an\nupper respiratory infection\n, which is typically caused by a virus.\nSeveral forms of laryngitis occur in children that can lead to a dangerous or fatal respiratory blockage."}

An exam of the throat and upper airway will be done, often with a flexible scope.\nTreatment\nLaryngitis is often caused by a virus, so antibiotics likely will not help. Your health care provider will make this decision.\nResting your voice helps to reduce inflammation of the vocal cords. A humidifier may soothe the scratchy feeling that comes with laryngitis."}

Decongestants and pain medicines may relieve the symptoms of an upper respiratory infection.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nLaryngitis that is not caused by a serious condition often gets better on its own.\nPossible Complications\nIn rare cases, severe respiratory distress develops. This requires immediate medical attention.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nA small child who is not teething has difficulty breathing, swallowing, or is\ndrooling\nA child less than 3 months old has hoarseness\nHoarseness has lasted for more than 1 week in a child, or 2 weeks in an adult\nPrevention\nTo prevent getting laryngitis:\nTry to avoid people who have upper respiratory infections during cold and flu season.\nWash your hands often.\nDo not strain your voice.\nStop smoking\n. This can help prevent tumors of the head and neck or lungs, which can lead to hoarseness.\nAlternative Names\nHoarseness  - laryngitis\nImages\nThroat anatomy\nReferences\nAllen CT, Nussenbaum B, Merati AL."}
