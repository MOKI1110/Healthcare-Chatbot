The stump should dry and fall off by the time your baby is 5 to 15 days old. Keep the stump clean with gauze and water only. Sponge bathe the rest of your baby, as well. Do not put your baby in a tub of water until the stump has fallen off.\nLet the stump fall off naturally. Do not try to pull it off, even if it is only hanging on by a thread.\nWatch the umbilical cord stump for infection. This does not occur often. But if it does, the infection can spread quickly.\nSigns of a local infection at the stump include:\nFoul-smelling, yellow drainage from the stump\nRedness, swelling, or tenderness of the skin around the stump\nBe aware of signs of a more serious infection."}

If the cord stump continues to bleed, contact your baby's provider immediately.\nSometimes, instead of completely drying, the cord will form pink scar tissue called a granuloma. The granuloma drains a light-yellowish fluid. This will most often go away in about a week. If it does not, contact your baby's provider.\nIf your baby's stump has not fallen off in 4 weeks (and more likely much sooner), contact your baby's provider. There may be a problem with the baby's anatomy or immune system.\nAlternative Names\nCord - umbilical; Neonatal care - umbilical cord\nImages\nUmbilical cord healing\nSponge bath\nReferences\nEsper F.
