The syndrome often involves port wine stains, excess growth of bones and soft tissue, and varicose veins.\nCauses\nKTS is caused by a genetic variation that occurs during fetal development. Why this occurs is unknown.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of KTS include:\nMany\nport wine stains\nor other blood vessel problems, including dark spots on the skin\nVaricose veins\n(may be seen in early infancy, but are more likely to be seen later in childhood or adolescence)\nUnstable gait due to limb-length difference (involved limb is longer)\nBone, vein, or nerve pain\nOther possible symptoms:\nBleeding from the rectum\nBlood in the urine\nExams and Tests\nPeople with this condition may have excessive growth of bones and soft tissue. This occurs most commonly in the legs, but it also may affect the arms, face, head, or internal organs.\nVarious imaging techniques can be used to find out any change in body structures due to this condition."}
