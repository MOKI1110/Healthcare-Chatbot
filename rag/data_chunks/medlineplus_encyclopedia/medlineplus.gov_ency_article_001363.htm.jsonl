It is usually seen in areas where hygiene is poor, and the temperature is cold. Endemic typhus is sometimes called jail fever. The bacteria that cause this type of typhus are usually spread from rats to fleas to humans.\nMurine typhus occurs in the southern United States, including California and Texas. It is often seen during the summer and fall. It is rarely deadly. You are more likely to get this type of typhus if you are around rat feces or fleas, and other animals such as cats, possums, raccoons, and skunks.\nRickettsia prowazekii\ncauses epidemic typhus. It is spread by lice.\nBrill-Zinsser disease is a mild form of epidemic typhus. It occurs when the bacteria become active again in a person who was previously infected."}

Later, the rash becomes dull and red and does not fade. People with severe typhus may also develop small areas of bleeding into the skin.\nExams and Tests\nThe diagnosis is often based on a physical exam and detailed information about the symptoms. You may be asked if you recall being bitten by fleas. If your health care provider suspects typhus, you will be started on medicines right away. Blood tests will be ordered to confirm the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nTreatment includes the following antibiotics:\nDoxycycline\nTetracycline\nChloramphenicol (much less common)\nTetracycline taken by mouth can permanently stain teeth that are still forming. Tetracycline is usually not prescribed for:\nChildren until after all of their permanent teeth have grown\nPregnant women\nPeople with epidemic typhus may need oxygen and\nintravenous\n(IV) fluids.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPeople with epidemic typhus who receive treatment quickly should completely recover."}

Without treatment, death can occur, with those over age 60 having the highest risk of death.\nOnly a small number of untreated people with murine typhus may die. Prompt antibiotic treatment will cure nearly all people with murine typhus.\nPossible Complications\nTyphus may cause these complications:\nRenal insufficiency\n(kidneys cannot function normally)\nPneumonia\nCentral nervous system\ndamage\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of typhus.
