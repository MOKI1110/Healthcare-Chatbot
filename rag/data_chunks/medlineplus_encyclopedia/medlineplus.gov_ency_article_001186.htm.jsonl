It is a congenital condition, which means it is present at birth. The signs and symptoms of the disorder vary somewhat from child to child.\nInfancy can be a critical period in babies with this condition because of the possibility of:\nLow blood sugar\n(hypoglycemia)\nA type of hernia called an\nomphalocele\n(when present)\nAn enlarged tongue (macroglossia)\nAn increased rate of\ntumor\ngrowth.\nWilms tumors\nand hepatoblastomas are the most common tumors in children with this syndrome\nCauses\nBeckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is caused by a defect in the genes on\nchromosome\n11."}

About 10% of cases are passed down through families.\nSymptoms\nSigns and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome include:\nLarge size for a newborn\nRed birth mark on forehead or eyelids (nevus flammeus)\nCreases in ear lobes\nLarge tongue (\nmacroglossia\n)\nLow blood sugar (hypoglycemia)\nAbdominal wall defect (\numbilical hernia\nor omphalocele)\nEnlargement of some organs\nOvergrowth of one side of the body (hemihyperplasia/hemihypertrophy)\nTumor growth, such as Wilms tumors and hepatoblastomas\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will do a physical exam to look for signs and symptoms of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. Often this is enough to make a diagnosis.\nTests for the disorder include:\nBlood tests for low blood sugar\nChromosomal studies for abnormalities in chromosome 11\nUltrasound of the abdomen\nTreatment\nInfants with low blood sugar may be treated with fluids given through a vein (\nintravenous\n, IV)."}

Some infants may need medicine or other management if low blood sugar continues.\nDefects in the abdominal wall may need to be repaired. If the enlarged tongue makes it hard to breathe or eat, surgery may be needed. Children with overgrowth on one side of the body should be watched for a curved spine (\nscoliosis\n). The child also must be watched closely for the development of tumors. Tumor screening includes blood tests and abdominal ultrasounds.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nChildren with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome typically lead normal lives."}
