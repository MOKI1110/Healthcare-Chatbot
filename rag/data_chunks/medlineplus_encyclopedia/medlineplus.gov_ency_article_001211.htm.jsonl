Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHypothalamic tumor\nHypothalamic tumor\nA hypothalamic\ntumor\nis an abnormal growth in the\nhypothalamus\ngland, which is located in the brain.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of hypothalamic tumors is not known. It is likely that they result from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.\nIn children, most hypothalamic tumors are gliomas. Gliomas are a common type of brain tumor that result from the abnormal growth of glial cells, which support nerve cells. Gliomas can occur at any age. They are often more aggressive in adults than in children.\nIn adults, tumors in the hypothalamus are more likely cancer that has spread from another organ.\nPeople with\nneurofibromatosis\n(a hereditary condition) are at increased risk for this type of tumor."}

People who have undergone radiation therapy are at increased risk of developing tumors in general.\nSymptoms\nThese tumors can cause a range of symptoms:\nEuphoric \"high\" sensations\nFailure to thrive\n(lack of normal growth in children)\nHeadache\nHyperactivity\nLoss of body fat and appetite (cachexia)\nThese symptoms are most often seen in children whose tumors affect the front part of the hypothalamus.\nSome tumors may cause vision loss. If the tumors block the flow of spinal fluid, headaches and sleepiness may result from fluid collecting in the brain (\nhydrocephalus\n).\nSome people can have\nseizures\nas a result of brain tumors. Other people may develop\nprecocious puberty\nfrom a change in pituitary gland function.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider may see signs of a hypothalamic tumor during a regular checkup. A brain and nervous system (neurological) exam, including tests of\nvisual function\n, may be done."}

Blood tests for hormone imbalances may also be ordered.\nDepending on the results of the examination and blood tests, a\nCT scan\nor\nMRI scan\ncan determine whether you have a hypothalamic tumor.\nVisual field testing\nmay be done to check for vision loss and to determine whether the condition is improving or getting worse.\nTreatment\nThe treatment depends on how aggressive the tumor is, and whether it is a glioma or another type of cancer. Treatment may involve combinations of surgery,\nradiation\n, and\nchemotherapy\n.\nSpecial radiation treatments can be focused on the tumor. They can be as effective as surgery, with less risk to surrounding tissue. Brain swelling caused by a tumor may need to be treated with steroids.\nHypothalamic tumors may produce hormones or affect hormone production, leading to imbalances that may need to be corrected."}

Regular medical check-ups may detect early signs of a problem, such as abnormal weight gain or early puberty.\nAlternative Names\nHypothalamic glioma; Hypothalamus - tumor\nImages\nHypothalamus\nReferences\nGoodden J, Mallucci C.
