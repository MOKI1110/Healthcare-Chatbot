Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nGranuloma annulare\nGranuloma annulare\nGranuloma annulare (GA) is a long-term (\nchronic\n) skin disease consisting of a rash with reddish bumps arranged in a circle or ring.\nCauses\nGA most often affects children and young adults. It is slightly more common in females.\nThe condition is usually seen in otherwise healthy people. Sometimes, it may be associated with\ndiabetes\nor thyroid disease. The exact cause of GA is unknown.\nSymptoms\nGA usually causes no other symptoms, but the rash may be slightly itchy.\nPeople usually notice a ring of small, firm bumps (papules) over the backs of the forearms, hands, or feet. Occasionally, they may find a number of rings.\nIn rare cases, GA appears as a firm nodule under the skin of the arms or legs. In some cases, the rash spreads all over the body.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider may think you have a fungal infection when looking at your skin as the ring shape may look like\nringworm\n."}

A skin scraping and\nKOH test\ncan be used to tell the difference between GA and a fungal infection.\nYou may also need a\nskin punch biopsy\nto confirm the diagnosis of GA.\nTreatment\nGA can resolve on its own. You may not need treatment for GA, except for cosmetic reasons. Very strong steroid creams or ointments are sometimes used to clear up the rash more quickly. Injections of steroids directly into the rings may also be effective. Some providers may choose to freeze the bumps with liquid nitrogen.\nPeople with severe or widespread cases may need medicines that suppress the immune system. Laser and ultraviolet light therapy (phototherapy) may also help.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn most cases, GA disappears without treatment within 2 years. The rings can remain for many years."}
