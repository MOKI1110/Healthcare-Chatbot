Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nCMV infection\nis a disease caused by a type of herpes virus.\nThe CMV blood test is performed to detect current active CMV infection, or past CMV infection in people who are at risk for reactivation of infection. These people include organ transplant recipients and those with a suppressed immune system."}

The test may also be performed to detect\nCMV infection in newborns\n.\nNormal Results\nPeople who have never been infected with CMV have no detectable antibodies to CMV.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThe presence of antibodies to CMV indicates a current or past infection with CMV. If the number of antibodies (called the antibody titer) rises over a few weeks, it may mean that you have a current or recent infection.\nLong-term (chronic) CMV infection (in which the antibody count stays about the same over time) can reactivate in a person with a suppressed immune system.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
