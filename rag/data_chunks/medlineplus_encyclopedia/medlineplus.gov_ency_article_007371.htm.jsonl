It stores bile, which your body uses to digest fats in the small intestine.\nDescription\nSurgery using a laparoscope is the most common way to remove the gallbladder. A laparoscope is a thin, lighted tube that lets your surgeon see inside your belly.\nGallbladder removal surgery is done while you are under\ngeneral anesthesia\nso you will be asleep and pain-free.\nThe operation is done the following way:\nYour surgeon makes 3 to 4 small cuts in your belly.\nThe laparoscope is inserted through one of the cuts.\nOther medical instruments are inserted through the other cuts.\nGas is pumped into your belly to expand the space."}

This gives your surgeon more room to see and work.\nThe gallbladder is then removed using the laparoscope and other instruments.\nAn x-ray called a\ncholangiogram\nmay be done during your surgery.\nTo do this test, dye is injected into your common bile duct and an x-ray picture is taken. The dye helps find stones that may be in the common bile duct.\nIf other stones are found, your surgeon will remove them with a special instrument.\nSometimes your surgeon cannot safely take out the gallbladder using a laparoscope. In this case, your surgeon will use\nopen surgery\n, in which a larger cut is made.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nYou may need this surgery if you have pain or other symptoms from\ngallstones\n."}
