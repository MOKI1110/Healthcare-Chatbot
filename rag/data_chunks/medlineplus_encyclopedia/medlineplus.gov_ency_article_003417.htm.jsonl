Most of the time, urine is collected in the health care provider's office. A sample can also be collected at home.\nHow the Test is Performed\nTo collect a urine sample from an infant:\nThoroughly wash the area around the urethra (the hole where urine flows out). Use the soap, or cleansing wipes that your provider gave you.\nYou will be given a special bag to collect the urine. It will be a plastic bag with a sticky strip on one end, made to fit over your baby's genital area. Open this bag and place it on the infant.\nFor males, place the entire penis in the bag and attach the adhesive to the skin.\nFor females, place the bag over the two folds of skin on either side of the vagina (labia).\nPut a diaper on the baby (over the bag).\nCheck the infant often, and change the bag after the infant has urinated."}

(An active infant can cause the bag to move, so it may take more than one try to collect the sample.)\nEmpty the urine from the bag into the container provided by your provider. Do not touch the inside of the cup or lid. If at home, place the container in a plastic bag in the refrigerator until you return it to your provider.\nWhen finished, label the container and return it as instructed.\nThoroughly wash the area around the urethra. Clean from the front to the back on a female infant, and from the tip of the penis down on a male infant.\nSometimes, it may be necessary to obtain a sterile urine sample. This is done to check for a urinary tract infection. A provider will take this sample using a catheter. The area around the urethra is cleaned with an antiseptic. A small catheter is inserted into the baby's bladder to collect the urine. It is removed after the procedure.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no preparation for the test."}

Rarely, a mild skin rash from the adhesive on the collection bag may develop. There may be a small amount of bleeding if a catheter is used.\nReferences\nBoswell B, Thomas AA.
