In men, these glands are the testes. In women, these glands are the ovaries.\nCauses\nThe cause of hypogonadism can be primary (testes or ovaries) or secondary (problem with the pituitary or hypothalamus). In primary hypogonadism, the ovaries or testes themselves do not function properly. Causes of primary hypogonadism include:\nCertain\nautoimmune disorders\nGenetic and developmental disorders\nInfection\nIron excess (hemochromatosis)\nLiver and kidney disease\nRadiation (to the gonads)\nSurgery\nTrauma\nThe most common genetic disorders that cause primary hypogonadism are\nTurner syndrome\n(in women) and\nKlinefelter syndrome\n(in men).\nIf you already have other autoimmune disorders you may be at higher risk for autoimmune damage to the gonads."}

These can include disorders that affect the liver, adrenal glands, and thyroid glands, as well as type 1 diabetes.\nIn central hypogonadism, the centers in the brain that control the gonads (hypothalamus and pituitary) do not function properly. Causes of central hypogonadism include:\nAnorexia nervosa\nBleeding in the area of the pituitary\nTaking medicines, such as glucocorticoids and opiates\nStopping anabolic steroids\nGenetic problems\nInfections\nNutritional deficiencies\nIron excess (\nhemochromatosis\n)\nRadiation (to the pituitary or hypothalamus)\nRapid, significant weight loss (including weight loss after bariatric surgery)\nSurgery (skull base surgery near the pituitary)\nTrauma\nTumors\nA genetic cause of central hypogonadism is\nKallmann syndrome\n. Many people with this condition also have a decreased sense of smell.\nMenopause is the most common reason for hypogonadism. It is normal in all women and occurs on average around age 50. Testosterone levels decrease in men as they age, as well."}

The range of normal testosterone in the blood is much lower in a 50 to 60 year-old man than it is in a 20 to 30 year-old man.\nSymptoms\nGirls who have hypogonadism will not begin menstruating. Hypogonadism can affect their breast development and height. If hypogonadism occurs after puberty, symptoms in women include:\nHot flashes\nEnergy and mood changes\nMenstruation becomes irregular or stops\nIn boys, hypogonadism affects muscle, beard, genital and voice development. It also leads to growth problems."}

If pituitary disease is suspected, an\nMRI\nor\nCT scan of the brain\nmay be done.\nTreatment\nYou may need to take hormone-based medicines. Estrogen and progesterone are used for girls and women. The medicines come in the form of a pill or skin patch. Testosterone is used for boys and men. The medicine can be given as a skin patch, skin gel, a solution applied to the armpit, a patch applied to the upper gum, or by injection.\nMenopausal symptoms may be treated with estrogen alone (if the woman does not have a uterus) or estrogen and progesterone for a woman who still has a uterus. This is called combination hormone therapy.\nIn some women, injections or pills can be used to stimulate ovulation. Injections of pituitary hormone may be used to help men produce sperm."}

Menopause is a form of hypogonadism that occurs naturally. It can cause hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and irritability as estrogen levels fall. The risk for\nosteoporosis\nand\nheart disease\nincrease after menopause.\nSome women with hypogonadism take\nestrogen therapy\n, most often those who have early menopause. But long-term use of hormone therapy may increase the risk for breast cancer, blood clots and heart disease (especially in older women). Women should talk with their health care provider about the risks and benefits of menopausal hormone therapy.\nIn men, hypogonadism results in the loss of sex drive and may cause:\nImpotence\nInfertility\nOsteoporosis\nWeakness\nMen normally have lower testosterone as they age."}
