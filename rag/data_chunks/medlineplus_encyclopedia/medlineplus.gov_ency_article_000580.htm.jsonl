Lymph tissue is found in the lymph nodes, spleen, liver, bone marrow, and other sites.\nCauses\nThe cause of Hodgkin lymphoma is not known. Hodgkin lymphoma is most common among people 15 to 35 years old and those 55 and older. Past infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is thought to contribute to some cases. People with HIV infection are at increased risk compared to the general population.\nSymptoms\nThe first sign of Hodgkin lymphoma is often a painless swollen lymph node that appears without a known cause. The disease can spread to nearby lymph nodes."}
