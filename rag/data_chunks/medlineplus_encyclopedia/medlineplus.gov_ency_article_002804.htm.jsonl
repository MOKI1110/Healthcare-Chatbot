This includes motor vehicle exhaust, faulty heaters, fires, and factory emissions.\nWhere Found\nThe following items may produce carbon monoxide:\nAnything that burns coal, gasoline, kerosene, oil, propane, or wood\nAutomobile engines\nCharcoal grills (charcoal should never be burned indoors)\nIndoor and portable heating systems\nPortable\npropane\nheaters\nStoves (indoor and camp stoves)\nWater heaters that use natural gas\nNote: This list may not be all-inclusive.\nSymptoms\nWhen you breathe in carbon monoxide, the poison replaces the oxygen in your bloodstream. Your heart, brain, and body then become starved of oxygen.\nSymptoms vary from person to person. Those at high risk for more severe bodily damage include young children, older adults, people with lung or heart disease, people who are at high altitudes, and smokers."}

People who have pets at home may notice that their animals become weak or unresponsive from carbon monoxide exposure. Pets will often show symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning before humans have symptoms.\nSince many of these symptoms can occur with viral illnesses, carbon monoxide poisoning is often confused with these conditions. This can lead to a delay in getting help.\nHome Care\nIf the person breathed in carbon monoxide, immediately move them to fresh air. Seek immediate medical attention.\nPREVENTION\nInstall a carbon monoxide detector on each floor of your home. Place an additional detector near any major gas-burning appliances (such as a furnace or water heater).\nMany carbon monoxide poisonings occur in the winter months when furnaces, gas fireplaces, and portable heaters are being used and windows are closed."}
