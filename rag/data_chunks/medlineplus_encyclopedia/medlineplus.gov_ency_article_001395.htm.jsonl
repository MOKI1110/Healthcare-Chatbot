A loss of movement or weakness of the arm may occur if these nerves are damaged. This injury is called neonatal brachial plexus palsy (NBPP).\nCauses\nThe nerves of the brachial plexus can be affected by compression inside the mother's womb or during a difficult delivery. Injury may be caused by:\nThe infant's head and neck pulling toward the side as the shoulders pass through the birth canal or surgical incision\nThe infant's shoulders stretching or arm being pulled during a head-first delivery\nPressure on the baby's raised arms during a breech (feet-first) delivery\nThere are different forms of NBPP. The type depends on the amount of arm paralysis:\nBrachial plexus palsy most often affects only the upper arm. It is also called Duchenne-Erb or Erb-Duchenne paralysis.\nKlumpke paralysis affects the lower arm and hand."}

This is less common.\nThe following factors increase the risk of NBPP:\nBreech delivery\nMaternal obesity\nLarger-than-average newborn (such as an\ninfant of a diabetic mother\n)\nDifficulty delivering the baby's shoulder after the head has already come out (called shoulder dystocia)\nNBPP is less common than in the past. Cesarean delivery is used more often when there are concerns about a difficult delivery. Although a C-section reduces the risk of injury, it does not prevent it. A C-section also carries other risks.\nNBPP may be confused with a condition called\npseudoparalysis\n. This is seen when the infant has a fracture of the clavicle (collarbone) and is not moving the arm because of pain, but there is no nerve damage.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms can be seen right away or soon after birth."}

The affected arm may flop when the infant is rolled from side to side.\nThe Moro reflex is absent on the side of injury.\nThe health care provider will examine the clavicle to look for a fracture. The infant may need to have an x-ray taken.\nTreatment\nIn mild cases, the provider will suggest:\nGentle massage of the arm\nRange-of-motion exercises\nPediatric physical therapists can help with these."}

The infant may need to be seen by specialists if the damage is severe or the condition does not improve in the first few weeks.\nSurgery may be considered if strength does not improve by 3 to 9 months of age.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost babies will fully recover within 3 to 4 months. Those who do not recover during this time have a poor outlook for full recovery. In these cases, there may have been a separation of the nerve root from the spinal cord (avulsion).\nIt is not clear whether surgery to fix the nerve problem can help. Surgery may involve nerve grafts or nerve transfers. It may take many years for healing to occur.\nIn cases of pseudoparalysis, the child will begin to use the affected arm as the fracture heals. Fractures in infants heal quickly and easily in most cases.\nPossible Complications\nComplications include:\nAbnormal muscle contractions (contractures) or tightening of the muscles."}

These may be permanent.\nPermanent, partial, or total loss of function of the affected nerves, causing paralysis of the arm or arm weakness.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your newborn is not moving an arm.\nPrevention\nIt is difficult to prevent NBPP. Taking steps to avoid a difficult delivery, whenever possible, reduces the risk.\nAlternative Names\nKlumpke paralysis; Erb-Duchenne paralysis; Erb's palsy; Brachial palsy; Brachial plexopathy; Obstetrical brachial plexus palsy; Birth-related brachial plexus palsy; Neonatal brachial plexus palsy; NBPP\nReferences\nExecutive summary: neonatal brachial plexus palsy.
