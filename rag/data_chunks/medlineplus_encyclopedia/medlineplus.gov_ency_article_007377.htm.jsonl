This is urine leakage that happens when you laugh, cough, sneeze, lift things, or exercise. The surgery helps close your urethra and bladder neck. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside. The bladder neck is the part of the bladder that connects to the urethra.\nDescription\nYou have either\ngeneral anesthesia\nor\nspinal anesthesia\nbefore the surgery starts.\nWith general anesthesia, you are asleep and feel no pain.\nWith spinal anesthesia, you are awake, but from the waist down, you are numb and feel no pain.\ncatheter\n(tube) is placed in your bladder to drain urine from your bladder.\nA small surgical cut (incision) is made inside your vagina."}

Two small cuts are made in your belly just above the pubic hair line or on the inside of each inner thigh near the groin.\nA special man-made (synthetic mesh) tape is passed through the cut inside the vagina. The tape is then positioned under your urethra. One end of the tape is passed through one of the belly incisions or through one of the inner thigh incisions. The other end of the tape is passed through the other belly incision or inner thigh incision.\nThe surgeon then adjusts the tightness (tension) of the tape just enough to support your urethra. This amount of support is why the surgery is called tension-free. If you do not receive general anesthesia, you may be asked to cough. This is to check the tension of the tape.\nAfter the tension is adjusted, the ends of the tape are cut level with the skin at the incisions. The incisions are closed."}

As you heal, scar tissue that forms at the incisions will hold the tape ends in place so that your urethra is supported.\nThe surgery takes about 2 hours.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nTension-free vaginal tape is placed to treat stress incontinence.\nBefore discussing surgery, your health care provider will have you try bladder retraining, Kegel exercises, medicines, or other options. If you tried these and are still having problems with urine leakage, surgery may be your best option.\nRisks\nRisks of any surgery are:\nBleeding\nBreathing problems\nInfection in the surgical cut or the cut opens up\nBlood clots\nin the legs\nOther infection\nRisks of this surgery are:\nInjury to nearby organs - Changes in the vagina (prolapsed vagina, in which the vagina is not in the proper place).\nDamage to the urethra, bladder, or vagina.\nErosion of the tape into surrounding normal tissues (urethra or vagina).\nFistula\n(abnormal passage) between the bladder or urethra and vagina.\nIrritable bladder, causing the"}
