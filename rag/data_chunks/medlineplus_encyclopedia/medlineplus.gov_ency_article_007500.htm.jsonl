Other medical instruments may also be inserted to examine or treat your hip joint.\nDescription\nDuring arthroscopy of the hip, the surgeon uses a tiny camera called an arthroscope to see inside your hip.\nAn arthroscope is made up of a tiny tube, a lens, and a light source. A small surgical cut is made to insert it into your body.\nThe surgeon will look inside your hip joint for damage or disease.\nOther medical instruments may also be inserted through one or two other small surgical cuts. This allows the surgeon to treat or fix certain problems, if needed.\nYour surgeon may remove extra pieces of bone that are loose in your hip joint, or fix cartilage or other tissues that are damaged.\nSpinal or epidural\nor\ngeneral anesthesia\nwill be used in most cases, so you will not feel pain."}

You may also be asleep or receive medicine to help you relax.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThe most common reasons for hip arthroscopy are to:\nRemove small pieces of bone or cartilage that may be loose inside your hip joint and causing pain.\nHip impingement syndrome (also called femoral-acetabular impingement, or FAI). This procedure is done when other treatment has not helped the condition. The surgery is performed to remove excess bone that formed along the hip joint, causing the bones to develop an irregular shape and rub against one another.\nRepair a torn labrum (a tear in the cartilage that is attached to the rim of your hip socket bone).\nRepair of your hip tendons.\nLess common reasons for hip arthroscopy are:\nHip pain that does not go away and your doctor suspects a problem that hip arthroscopy can fix."}
