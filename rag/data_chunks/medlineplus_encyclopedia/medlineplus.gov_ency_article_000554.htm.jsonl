Bone marrow is the soft, tissue in the center of bones that is responsible for producing blood cells and platelets.\nCauses\nAplastic anemia results from damage to the blood stem cells. Stem cells are immature cells in the bone marrow that give rise to all blood cell types (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets). Injury to the stem cells leads to a decrease in the number of these blood cell types.\nAplastic anemia can be caused by:\nUse of certain medicines or exposure to toxic chemicals (such as chloramphenicol, benzene)\nExposure to radiation or\nchemotherapy\nAutoimmune disorders\nPregnancy\nViruses\nSometimes, the cause is unknown. In this case, the disorder is called idiopathic aplastic anemia.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms are due to the underproduction of red cells, white cells, and platelets."}

Over time, transfusions may stop working, resulting in very low blood cell counts. This is a life-threatening condition.\nBone marrow\n, or stem cell transplant may be recommended for younger people. It is more likely to be recommended for those 50 years and younger, but people over 50 may receive a transplant if they are healthy enough. This treatment works best when the donor is a fully-matched brother or sister. This is called a matched sibling donor..\nOlder people and those who do not have a matched sibling donor are given medicine to suppress the immune system. These medicines may allow the bone marrow to once again make healthy blood cells. But the disease may return (relapse). A bone marrow transplant with an unrelated donor may be tried if these medicines do not help or if the disease comes back after getting better.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nUntreated, severe aplastic anemia leads to rapid death."}

Bone marrow transplant can be very successful in young people. A transplant is also used in older people or when the disease comes back after medicines have stopped working.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nSevere infections or bleeding\nComplications of bone marrow transplant\nReactions to medicines\nHemochromatosis (buildup of too much iron in the body tissues from many red cell transfusions)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider or go to the emergency room if bleeding occurs for no reason, or if bleeding is hard to stop. Contact your provider if you notice frequent infections or unusual fatigue.\nAlternative Names\nHypoplastic anemia; Bone marrow failure - aplastic anemia\nPatient Instructions\nBone marrow transplant - discharge\nImages\nBone marrow aspiration\nReferences\nCulligan D, Watson HG.
