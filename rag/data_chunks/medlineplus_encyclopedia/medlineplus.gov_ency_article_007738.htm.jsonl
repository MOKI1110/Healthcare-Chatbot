This can cause breathing problems or choking. The area around the object also can become inflamed or infected.\nConsiderations\nChildren ages 6 months to 3 years are in the age group most likely to breathe in (inhale) a foreign object. These items may include nuts, coins, toys, balloons, or other small items or foods.\nCauses\nYoung children can easily inhale small foods (nuts, seeds, or popcorn) and objects (buttons, beads, or parts of toys) when playing or eating. This may cause a partial or\ntotal airway blockage\n.\nYoung children have smaller airways than adults. They also can't move enough air when coughing to dislodge an object."}

First aid measures include:\nBack blows or chest compressions for infants.\nAbdominal thrusts for older children.\nIf the infant or child continues to have trouble breathing, they might need emergency cardiopulmonary resuscitation.\nBe sure you are trained to perform these first aid measures.\nParents of infants and young children should consider taking a Basic Life Support class from the American Heart Association.\nAny child who may have inhaled an object should be seen by their health care provider. A child with a total airway blockage requires emergency medical help.\nIf choking or coughing goes away, and the child does not have any other symptoms, he or she should be watched for signs and symptoms of infection or irritation. X-rays may be needed.\nA procedure called\nbronchoscopy\nmay be needed to confirm the diagnosis and to remove the object. Antibiotics and breathing therapy may be needed if an infection develops.\nDO NOT\nDo not force feed infants who are crying or breathing rapidly."}
