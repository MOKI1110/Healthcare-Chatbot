There are only isolated cases. However, one government estimate suggests that as many as half of older age people living in nursing homes in the United States do not get enough protein in their diet.\nWhen kwashiorkor does occur in the United States, it is most often a sign of\nchild abuse\nand severe neglect.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nChanges in\nskin pigment\nDecreased muscle mass\nDiarrhea\nFailure to gain weight and grow\nFatigue\nHair changes (change in color or texture)\nIncreased and more severe infections due to damaged immune system\nIrritability\nLarge belly that sticks out (protrudes)\nLethargy\nor apathy\nLoss of muscle mass\nRash (dermatitis)\nShock (late stage)\nSwelling (\nedema\n)\nExams and Tests\nThe\nphysical exam\nmay show an enlarged liver (\nhepatomegaly\n) and general bodily swelling.\nTests may include:\nArterial blood gas\nBUN\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nCreatinine clearance\nSerum creatinine\nSerum potassium\nTotal protein\nlevels\nUrinalysis\nTreatment\nPeople who start early treatment can recover fully."}

The goal is to get more calories and protein into their diet. Children with the disease cannot reach their complete height and growth.\nCalories are given first in the form of\ncarbohydrates\n,\nsimple sugars\n, and fats. Proteins are started after other sources of calories have already provided energy. Vitamin and mineral supplements will be given.\nFood must be restarted slowly since the person has been without much food for a long period of time. Suddenly eating high-calorie foods can cause problems.\nMany malnourished children will develop intolerance to milk sugar (\nlactose intolerance\n). They will need to be given supplements with the\nenzyme\nlactase so that they can tolerate milk products.\nPeople who are in shock need treatment right away to restore blood volume and maintain blood pressure.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nGetting treatment early generally leads to good results. Treating kwashiorkor in its late stages will improve the child's general health."}

Treating kwashiorkor in its late stages will improve the child's general health. However, the child may be left with permanent physical and mental problems.
