Some people continue to be at risk of exposure to the virus that causes smallpox, including people who work in emergency preparedness and some laboratory workers. The virus can spread from person to person, causing symptoms including fever and a skin rash. Many people who had smallpox in the past recovered, but about 3 out of every 10 people with the disease died.\nMonkeypox\nis a rare disease with symptoms that are similar to but milder than the symptoms of smallpox."}

However, monkeypox can cause death. Monkeypox is an emerging infection in Africa and outbreaks of imported cases of monkeypox sometimes happen in other countries, including the United States.\nVaccinia virus can cause disease when people are exposed to infected people (such as exposure to someone who has recently been vaccinated with ACAM2000 ®, another type of smallpox vaccine) or animals. People who work with vaccinia virus in laboratories can be accidentally exposed to the virus, and if they become infected, they can get sick."}
