It affects a protein called fibrinogen. This protein is needed for the blood to clot.\nCauses\nThis disease is due to a deficiency of the amount or function of fibrinogen. How fibrinogen is affected depends on how the genes that determine how it is formed are inherited:\nWhen the variant gene is passed down from both parents, a person will have a complete lack of fibrinogen (afibrinogenemia).\nWhen the variant gene is passed down from one parent, a person will have either a reduced level of fibrinogen (hypofibrinogenemia) or a problem with the function of fibrinogen (dysfibrinogenemia)."}

Sometimes, these two fibrinogen problems can occur in the same person.\nSymptoms\nPeople with a complete lack of fibrinogen may have any of the following bleeding symptoms:\nBruising\neasily\nBleeding from the umbilical cord just after birth\nBleeding in the mucous membranes\nBleeding in the brain (very rare)\nBleeding in the joints\nHeavy bleeding after injury or surgery\nNosebleeds that do not stop easily\nPeople with a reduced level of fibrinogen bleed less often and the bleeding is not as severe when compared to people with no fibrinogen at all."}

Those with a problem with the function of fibrinogen often don't have symptoms.\nExams and Tests\nIf your health care provider suspects this problem, you will have lab tests to confirm the type and severity of the disorder.\nTests include:\nBleeding time\nFibrinogen test\nand reptilase time to check fibrin level and quality\nPartial thromboplastin time\n(PTT)\nProthrombin time\n(PT)\nThrombin time\nTreatment\nThe following treatments can be used for bleeding episodes or to prepare for surgery:\nCryoprecipitate (a blood product containing concentrated fibrinogen and other clotting factors)\nFibrinogen (RiaSTAP)\nPlasma (the liquid portion of the blood containing clotting factors)\nPeople with this condition should get the\nhepatitis B vaccine\n. Having many transfusions raises your risk of getting hepatitis.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nExcessive bleeding is common with this condition. These episodes may be severe, or even fatal."}

There is no known prevention.\nAlternative Names\nAfibrinogenemia; Hypofibrinogenemia; Dysfibrinogenemia; Factor I deficiency\nReferences\nGailani D, Benjamin TF, Wheeler AP.
