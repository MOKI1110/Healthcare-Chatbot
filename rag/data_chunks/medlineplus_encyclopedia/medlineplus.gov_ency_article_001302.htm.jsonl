It affects mostly teens and young adults.\nCauses\nEwing sarcoma can occur anytime during childhood and young adulthood. But it usually develops during puberty, when bones are growing rapidly. It is more common in White children than in Black or Asian children.\nThe tumor may start anywhere in the body. Most often, it starts in the\nlong bones\nof the arms and legs, the pelvis, or the chest. It can also develop in the skull or the\nflat bones\nof the trunk.\nThe tumor often spreads (\nmetastasizes)\nto the lungs and other bones. At the time of diagnosis, spread is seen in about one third of children with Ewing sarcoma.\nIn rare cases, Ewing sarcoma occurs in adults.\nSymptoms\nThere are few symptoms."}

At the time of diagnosis, spread is seen in about one third of children with Ewing sarcoma.\nIn rare cases, Ewing sarcoma occurs in adults.\nSymptoms\nThere are few symptoms. The most common is pain and sometimes swelling at the site of the tumor.\nBecause the tumor weakens the bone, children may also break a bone at the site of the tumor after a minor injury.\nFever may also be present.\nExams and Tests\nIf a tumor is suspected, tests to locate the primary tumor and any spread (metastasis) often include:\nBone scan\nChest x-ray\nCT scan of the chest\nMRI\nof the tumor\nX-ray of the tumor\nbiopsy\nof the tumor will be done. Different tests are done on this tissue to help determine how aggressive the cancer is and what treatment may be best.\nTreatment\nTreatment often includes a combination of:\nChemotherapy\nRadiation therapy\nSurgery\nto remove the primary tumor\nTreatment depends on the following:\nStage\nof the cancer\nAge and sex of the person\nResults of the tests on the biopsy sample\nSupport Groups\nThe stress of illness can be eased by joining a\ncancer support group\n."}

Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nBefore treatment, outlook depends on:\nWhether the tumor has spread to distant parts of the body\nWhere in the body the tumor started\nHow large the tumor is when it's diagnosed\nWhether the\nlactate dehydrogenase\n(LDH) level in the blood is higher than normal\nWhether the tumor has certain gene changes\nWhether the child is younger than 15 years\nChild's sex\nWhether the child has had treatment for a different cancer before Ewing sarcoma\nWhether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has come back\nThe best chance for cure is with a combination of treatments that includes chemotherapy plus radiation or surgery.\nPossible Complications\nThe treatments needed to fight this disease may have many complications. Discuss these with your health care provider.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your child has any of the symptoms of Ewing sarcoma."}
