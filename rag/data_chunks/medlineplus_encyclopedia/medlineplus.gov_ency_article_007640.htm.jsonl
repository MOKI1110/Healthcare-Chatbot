When this happens, blood flow to the brain and the rest of the body also stops. Cardiac arrest is a medical emergency. If it is not treated within a few minutes, cardiac arrest most often causes death.\nCauses\nWhile some people refer to a\nheart attack\nas a cardiac arrest, they are not the same thing. A heart attack occurs when a blocked artery stops the flow of blood to the heart. The medical term for this is myocardial infarction. A heart attack can damage the heart, but it does not necessarily cause death. However, a heart attack can sometimes trigger a cardiac arrest.\nCardiac arrest is caused by a problem with the heart's electrical system, such as:\nVentricular fibrillation\n(VF) -- When VF occurs, the lower chambers in the heart quiver instead of beating regularly. The heart cannot pump blood, which results in cardiac arrest."}

The heart cannot pump blood, which results in cardiac arrest. This can happen without any cause or as a result of another condition.\nHeart block -- This occurs when the electrical signal is slowed or stopped as it moves through the heart.\nProblems that may lead to cardiac arrest include:\nCoronary heart disease\n(CHD) -- CHD can clog the arteries in your heart, so the blood cannot flow smoothly. Over time, this can put a strain on your heart's muscle and electrical system.\nHeart attack\n-- A prior heart attack can create scar tissue that can lead to VF and cardiac arrest.\nHeart problems, such as congenital heart disease, heart valve problems, heart rhythm problems, and an enlarged heart can also lead to cardiac arrest.\nAbnormal levels of potassium or magnesium -- These minerals help your heart's electrical system work. Abnormally high or low levels can cause cardiac arrest.\nSevere physical stress -- Anything that causes a severe stress on your body can lead to cardiac arrest."}

This can include trauma, electrical shock, or major blood loss.\nRecreational drugs -- Using certain drugs, such as cocaine or amphetamines, also increases your risk for cardiac arrest.\nMedicines -- Some medicines can increase the likelihood of abnormal heart rhythms.\nSymptoms\nMost people do not have any symptoms of cardiac arrest until it happens. Symptoms may include:\nSudden loss of consciousness; a person will fall to the floor or slump down if sitting\nNo pulse\nNo breathing\nIn some cases, you may notice some symptoms about an hour before cardiac arrest. These may include:\nA racing heart\nDizziness\nShortness of breath\nNausea or vomiting\nChest pain\nExams and Tests\nCardiac arrest happens so quickly, there is no time to do tests. If a person survives, most tests are done afterwards to help find out what caused the cardiac arrest. These may include:\nBlood tests to check for enzymes that can show if you have had a heart attack."}

ECG can show if your heart has been damaged from CHD or a heart attack.\nEchocardiogram\nto show if your heart has been damaged and find other types of heart problems (such as problems with the heart muscle or valves).\nCardiac MRI helps your provider see detailed pictures of your heart and blood vessels.\nIntracardiac electrophysiology study\n(EPS) to see how well your heart's electrical signals are working."}

It can be done by anyone who has been trained in CPR. It can help keep oxygen flowing in the body until emergency care arrives.\nDefibrillation -- This is the most important treatment for cardiac arrest. It is performed using a medical device that gives an electrical shock to the heart. The shock can get the heart beating normally again. Small, portable defibrillators are often available in public areas for emergency use by people trained to use them."}
