If needed, the health care provider may ask you to\ncollect your urine at home over 24 hours\n. Your provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider may ask you to temporarily stop taking any medicines that may affect the test results. Tell your provider about all the medicines you take, including:\nCorticosteroids\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nPotassium supplements\nWater pills (diuretics)\nDO NOT stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThis test involves only normal urination."}

There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order this test if you have signs of a condition that affects body fluids, such as dehydration, vomiting, or diarrhea.\nIt may also be done to diagnose or confirm disorders of the kidneys or\nadrenal glands\n.\nNormal Results\nFor adults, normal urine potassium values are generally 20 mEq/L in a random urine sample and 25 to 125 mEq per day in a 24 hour collection. Lower or higher urinary level may occur depending on the amount of potassium in your diet and the amount of potassium in your body.\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA higher than normal urine potassium level may be due to:\nDiabetic acidosis\nand other forms of metabolic acidosis\nEating disorders (anorexia, bulimia)\nKidney problems, such as damage to kidney cells called tubule cells (\nacute tubular necrosis\n)\nLow blood magnesium level (hypomagnesemia)\nMuscle damage (rhabdomyolysis)\nLow urine potassium level may be due to:\nCertain medicines, including beta blockers, lithium, trimethoprim, potassium-sparing diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nAdrenal glands\nreleasing too little aldosterone (hypoaldosteronism)\nRisks\nThere are no risks with this test.\nAlternative Names\nUrine potassium\nImages\nFemale urinary tract\nMale urinary tract\nReferences\nKamel KS, Halperin ML.
