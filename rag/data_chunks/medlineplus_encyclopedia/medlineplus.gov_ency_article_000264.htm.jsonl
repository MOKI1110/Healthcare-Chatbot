It causes severe belly pain.\nCauses\nThe gallbladder is an organ that sits below the liver. It stores bile, which is produced in the liver. Your body uses bile to digest fats in the small intestine.\nAcute cholecystitis occurs when\nbile\nbecomes trapped in the gallbladder. This often happens because a\ngallstone\nblocks the cystic duct, the tube through which bile travels into and out of the gallbladder. When a stone blocks this duct, bile builds up, causing irritation and pressure in the gallbladder. This can lead to swelling and infection.\nOther causes include:\nSerious illnesses, such as HIV or diabetes\nTumors of the gallbladder (rare)\nSome people are more at risk for gallstones. Risk factors include:\nBeing female\nPregnancy\nHormone therapy\nOlder age\nBeing Native American or Hispanic\nObesity\nLosing or gaining weight rapidly\nDiabetes\nSometimes, the bile duct becomes blocked temporarily."}

When this occurs repeatedly, it can lead to\nlong-term (chronic) cholecystitis\n. This is swelling and irritation that continues over time. Eventually, the gallbladder becomes thick and hard. It does not store and release bile as well as it did.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom is pain in the upper right side or upper middle of your belly that usually lasts at least 30 minutes. You may feel:\nSharp, cramping, or dull pain\nSteady pain\nPain that spreads to your back or below your right shoulder blade\nOther symptoms that may occur include:\nClay-colored stools\nFever\nNausea and vomiting\nYellowing of skin and whites of the eyes (\njaundice\n)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms."}

You may have one or more of these tests:\nAbdominal ultrasound\nAbdominal CT scan\nor MRI scan\nAbdominal x-ray\nOral cholecystogram\nGallbladder radionuclide scan\nTreatment\nIf you have severe belly pain, seek medical attention right away.\nIn the emergency room, you'll be given fluids through a vein. You also may be given antibiotics to fight infection.\nCholecystitis may clear up on its own."}
