Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRetinal vein occlusion\nRetinal vein occlusion\nRetinal vein occlusion is a blockage of the small veins that carry blood away from the retina. The retina is the layer of tissue at the back of the inner eye that converts light images to nerve signals and sends them to the brain.\nCauses\nRetinal vein occlusion is most often caused by hardening of the arteries (\natherosclerosis\n) and the formation of a blood clot.\nBlockage of smaller veins (branch veins or BRVO) in the retina often occurs in places where retinal arteries that have been thickened or hardened by atherosclerosis cross over and place pressure on a retinal vein.\nRisk factors for retinal vein occlusion include:\nAtherosclerosis\nDiabetes\nHigh blood pressure\n(hypertension)\nOther eye conditions, such as\nglaucoma\n, macular edema, or vitreous hemorrhage\nThe risk of these disorders increases with age, therefore retinal vein occlusion most often affects older people.\nBlockage of retinal veins may cause other eye problems, including:\nGlaucoma (high pressure in the eye), caused by new, abnormal blood vessel"}

Some harmful effects, such as glaucoma, may take 3 or more months to develop after the occlusion.\nTreatment\nMany people will regain vision, even without treatment."}

There is no way to reverse or open the blockage.\nYou may need treatment to prevent another blockage from forming in the same or the other eye.\nIt's important to manage diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol levels.\nSome people may need to take aspirin or other blood thinners.\nTreatment for the complications of retinal vein occlusion may include:\nFocal laser treatment, if macular edema is present.\nInjections of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs into the eye. These drugs may block the growth of new blood vessels that can cause glaucoma.\nLaser treatment to prevent the growth of new, abnormal blood vessels that leads to glaucoma.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome varies.

Measures used to prevent other blood vessel diseases may decrease the risk for retinal vein occlusion.\nThese measures include:\nEating a low-fat diet\nGetting regular exercise\nMaintaining an ideal weight\nNot smoking\nAspirin or other blood thinners may help prevent blockages in the other eye.\nControlling diabetes may help prevent retinal vein occlusion.\nAlternative Names\nCentral retinal vein occlusion; CRVO; Branch retinal vein occlusion; BRVO; Vision loss - retinal vein occlusion; Blurry vision - retinal vein occlusion\nReferences\nArepalli S, Bessette A, Kaiser PK.
