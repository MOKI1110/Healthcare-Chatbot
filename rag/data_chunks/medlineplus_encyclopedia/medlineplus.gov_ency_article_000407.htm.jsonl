Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCushing syndrome due to adrenal tumor\nCushing syndrome due to adrenal tumor\nCushing syndrome due to adrenal tumor is a form of\nCushing syndrome\n. It occurs when a tumor of the adrenal gland releases excess amounts of the hormone cortisol.\nCauses\nCushing syndrome is a disorder that occurs when your body has a higher than normal level of the hormone cortisol. This hormone is made in the\nadrenal glands\n. Too much cortisol can be due to various problems. One such problem is a tumor on one of the adrenal glands. Adrenal tumors release cortisol.\nAdrenal tumors are rare. They can be noncancerous (benign) or cancerous (malignant).\nNoncancerous tumors that can cause Cushing syndrome include:\nAdrenal adenomas, a common tumor that rarely makes excess cortisol\nMacronodular\nhyperplasia\n, which causes the adrenal glands to enlarge and make excess cortisol\nCancerous tumors that may cause Cushing syndrome include an adrenal carcinoma."}

Often, the entire adrenal gland is removed.\nGlucocorticoid replacement treatment is usually needed until the other adrenal gland recovers from surgery. You may need this treatment for 3 to 12 months.\nIf surgery is not possible, such as in cases of adrenal cancer that has spread (metastasis), medicines can be used to stop the release of cortisol.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPeople with an adrenal tumor who have surgery have an excellent outlook.
