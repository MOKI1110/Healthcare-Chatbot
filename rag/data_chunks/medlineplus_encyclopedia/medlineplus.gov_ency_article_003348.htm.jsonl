Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRSV antibody test\nRSV antibody test\nThe\nrespiratory syncytial virus\n(RSV) antibody test is a blood test that measures the levels of\nantibodies\n(immunoglobulins) the body makes after an infection with RSV.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to identify someone who has been infected by RSV recently or in the past.\nThis test does not detect the virus itself. If the body has produced antibodies against RSV, then either a current or past infection has occurred.\nIn infants, RSV antibodies that have been passed from mother to baby may also be detected.\nNormal Results\nA negative test means the person does not have antibodies to RSV in their blood."}

This means the person has never had an RSV infection.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA positive test means the person has antibodies to RSV in their blood. These antibodies may be present because:\nA positive test in people older than infants means there is a current or past infection with RSV. Most adults and older children have had an RSV infection.\nInfants may have a positive test because antibodies were passed from their mother to them before they were born. This may mean they have not had a true RSV infection.\nSome children younger than 19 months at high risk for RSV infection get a shot with antibodies to RSV to protect them. These children will also have a positive test.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
