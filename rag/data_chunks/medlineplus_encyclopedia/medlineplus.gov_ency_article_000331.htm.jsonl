The thyroid gland is located in front of the lower neck.\nCauses\nAbout 85% of all thyroid cancers diagnosed in the United States are the papillary carcinoma type. It is more common in women than in men. It may occur in childhood, but is most often seen in adults between ages 20 and 60.\nThe cause of this cancer is not known. A genetic defect or family history of the disease may be a risk factor.\nRadiation increases the risk for developing thyroid cancer."}

Exposure may occur from:\nHigh-dose external radiation treatments to the neck, especially during childhood, used to treat childhood cancer or some noncancerous childhood conditions\nRadiation exposure from nuclear plant disasters\nRadiation given through a vein (through an IV) during medical tests and treatments does not increase the risk for developing thyroid cancer.\nSymptoms\nThyroid cancer often begins as a small lump (nodule) in the thyroid gland.\nWhile some small lumps may be cancer, most (90%) thyroid nodules are harmless and are not cancerous.\nMost of the time, there are no other symptoms.\nExams and Tests\nIf you have a lump on your thyroid, your health care provider may order the following tests:\nBlood tests.\nUltrasound of the\nthyroid gland and neck region\n.\nCT scan\nof the neck or\nMRI\nto determine the size of the tumor.\nAn examination of the airway with a fiberoptic scope (\nlaryngoscopy\n) may show a paralyzed vocal cord.\nFine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB)\nto determine if the lump"}

FNAB may be performed if the ultrasound shows that the lump is less than 1 centimeter.\nGenetic testing\nmay be done on the biopsy sample to see what genetic changes (mutations) may be present. Knowing this may help guide treatment recommendations.\nThyroid function tests\nare often normal in people with thyroid cancer.\nTreatment\nThyroid cancer treatment may include:\nSurgery\nRadioactive iodine therapy\nThyroid suppression therapy (thyroid hormone replacement therapy)\nExternal beam radiation therapy (EBRT)\nSurgery is done to remove as much of the cancer as possible. The bigger the lump, the more of the thyroid gland must be removed. Often, the entire gland is taken out.\nAfter the surgery, you may receive radioiodine therapy, which is often taken by mouth. This substance kills any remaining thyroid tissue."}

This replaces the hormone the thyroid would normally make.\nYour provider will likely have you take a blood test every several months to check thyroid hormone levels. Other follow-up tests that may be done after treatment for thyroid cancer include:\nUltrasound of the thyroid\nAn imaging test called a\nradioactive iodine (I-131) uptake scan\nRepeat FNAB\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\ncancer support group\n."}

Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe survival rate for papillary thyroid cancer is excellent. More than 90% of adults with this cancer survive at least 10 to 20 years. The prognosis is better for people who are younger than 40 and for those with smaller tumors.\nThe following factors may decrease the survival rate:\nOlder than 55 years of age\nCancer that has spread to distant parts of the body\nCancer that has spread to soft tissue around the thyroid\nLarge tumor\nPossible Complications\nComplications include:\nAccidental removal of the parathyroid glands, which help regulate blood calcium levels\nDamage to the nerve that controls the vocal cords\nSpreading of cancer to lymph nodes (rare)\nSpreading of cancer to other sites (\nmetastasis\n)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have a lump in your neck.\nAlternative Names\nPapillary carcinoma of the thyroid; Papillary thyroid cancer; Papillary"}
