This is done to see the inside of the bladder and urethra using a thin, lighted tube.\nHow the Test is Performed\nCystoscopy is done with a cystoscope. This is a special tube with a small camera on the end (endoscope). There are two types of cystoscopes:\nStandard, rigid cystoscope\nFlexible cystoscope\nThe tube can be inserted in different ways. However, the test is the same either way. The type of cystoscope your doctor (urologist) will use depends on the purpose of the exam.\nThe procedure will take about 5 to 20 minutes. The urethra is cleansed. A numbing medicine is applied to the skin lining the inside of the urethra. This is done without needles. The scope is then inserted through the urethra into the bladder.\nWater or salt water (saline) flows through the tube to fill the bladder. As this occurs, you may be asked to describe the feeling. Your answer will give some information about your condition.\nAs fluid fills the bladder, it stretches the bladder wall."}

As this occurs, you may be asked to describe the feeling. Your answer will give some information about your condition.\nAs fluid fills the bladder, it stretches the bladder wall. This lets your doctor see the entire bladder wall. You will feel the need to urinate when the bladder is full. However, the bladder must stay full until the exam is finished.\nIf any tissue looks abnormal, a small sample can be taken (\nbiopsy\n) through the tube. This sample will be sent to a lab to be tested.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nAsk your doctor if you should stop taking any medicines that could thin your blood.\nThe procedure may be done under anesthesia in a hospital or surgery center. In that case, you will need to have someone take you home afterward.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight discomfort when the tube is passed through the urethra into the bladder. You will feel an uncomfortable, strong need to urinate when your bladder is full.\nYou may feel a quick pinch if a biopsy is taken. After the tube is removed, the urethra may be sore."}
