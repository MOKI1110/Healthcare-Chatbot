The bacteria can spread to humans by:\nComing in contact with infected meat or the placenta of infected animals\nEating unpasteurized cheese\nDrinking unpasteurized milk\nBrucellosis is rare in the United States. About 100 to 200 cases occur each year. Most cases are caused by the\nBrucella melitensis\nbacteria.\nPeople working in jobs where they often come in contact with animals or meat are at higher risk. This includes slaughterhouse workers, farmers, and veterinarians.\nBrucella is found in many countries worldwide including:\nEgypt\nIraq\nIran\nJordan\nSaudi Arabia\nChad\nGreece\nMexico\nSymptoms\nAcute\nbrucellosis may begin with mild\nflu-like\nsymptoms, or symptoms such as:\nAbdominal pain\nBack pain\nFever and chills\nExcessive sweating\nFatigue\nHeadache\nJoint and muscle pain\nLoss of appetite\nSwollen glands\nWeakness\nWeight loss\nHigh fever spikes often occur every afternoon."}

The name undulant fever is often used to describe this disease because the fever rises and falls in waves.\nThe illness may be\nchronic\nand last for years.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms. You'll also be asked if you've been in contact with animals or possibly eaten dairy products that were not pasteurized.\nTests that may be done include:\nBlood test for brucellosis\nBlood culture\nBone marrow culture\nUrine culture\nCSF (spinal fluid) culture\nBiopsy and culture of specimen from affected organ\nTreatment\nAntibiotics are used to treat the infection and prevent it from coming back. These include:\nDoxycycline\nStreptomycin\nGentamicin\nRifampin\nOften, you need to take antibiotics for 6 weeks. If there are complications from brucellosis, you will likely need to take the medicines for a longer period.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSymptoms may come and go for years."}

Also, the illness can come back after a long period of not having symptoms.\nPossible Complications\nHealth problems that may result from brucellosis include:\nBone and joint infection and damage\nEncephalitis\n(swelling or inflammation of the brain)\nInfective endocarditis\n(inflammation of the inside lining of the heart chambers and heart valves)\nMeningitis\n(infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider for an appointment if:\nYou develop symptoms of brucellosis\nYour symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment\nYou develop new symptoms after treatment for brucellosis\nPrevention\nDrinking and eating only pasteurized dairy products, such as milk and cheeses, is the most important way to reduce the risk for brucellosis. People who handle meat should wear protective eyewear and clothing and protect\nskin breaks\nfrom infection.\nDetecting infected animals controls the infection at its source."}
