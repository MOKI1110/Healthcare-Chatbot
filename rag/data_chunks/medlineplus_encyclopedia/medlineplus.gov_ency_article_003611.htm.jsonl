The test compares the creatinine level in urine with the creatinine level in blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis test requires both a\nurine sample\nand\nblood sample\n. You will\ncollect your urine for 24 hours\nand then have blood taken. Follow instructions exactly. This ensures accurate results.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nBefore the test, your health care provider may ask you to stop taking medicines that may affect the test results. These include some antibiotics and stomach acid medicines. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take.\nDo not stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe urine test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise."}

There is no discomfort.\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nCreatinine is a waste product of creatine. Creatine is a chemical the body makes to supply energy, mainly to muscles.\nThe creatinine clearance test compares the\ncreatinine level in urine\nwith the\ncreatinine level in blood\n. This gives an estimate of the\nglomerular filtration rate\n(GFR). GFR is a measure of how well the kidneys are working, mainly the kidneys' filtering units. These filtering units are called glomeruli.\nCreatinine is removed, or cleared, from the body by the kidneys. If kidney function is abnormal, creatinine level increases in the blood because less creatinine is excreted through the urine.\nNormal Results\nClearance is often measured as milliliters per minute (mL/min) or milliliters per second (mL/s). Normal values are:\nMale: 97 to 137 mL/min (1.65 to 2.33 mL/s).\nFemale: 88 to 128 mL/min (1.467 to 2.18 mL/s).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}

Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider to know about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA lower than normal creatinine clearance may indicate:\nKidney problems, such as\ndamage to the tubule cells\nKidney failure\nToo little blood flow to the kidneys\nDamage to the filtering units of the kidneys\n(glomerulonephritis)\nLoss of body fluids\n(dehydration)\nBladder outlet obstruction\nHeart failure\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
