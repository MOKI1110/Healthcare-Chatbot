This makes it difficult to see fine details and read.\nThe disease is most common in people over age 60, which is why it is often called age-related macular degeneration (ARMD or AMD).\nWatch this video about:\nMacular degeneration\nCauses\nThe retina is at the back of the eye. It changes light and images that enter the eye into nerve signals that are sent to the brain. A part of the retina called the macula makes vision sharper and more detailed. It is a yellow spot in the center of the retina. It has a high amount of two natural colors (pigments) called lutein and zeaxanthin.\nAMD is caused by damage to the blood vessels that supply the macula. This change also harms the macula.\nThere are two types of AMD:\nDry AMD occurs when the blood vessels under the macula become thin and brittle. Small yellow deposits, called drusen, form."}

This change also harms the macula.\nThere are two types of AMD:\nDry AMD occurs when the blood vessels under the macula become thin and brittle. Small yellow deposits, called drusen, form. Almost all people with macular degeneration start with the dry form.\nWet AMD occurs in about 10% of people with macular degeneration. New abnormal and very fragile blood vessels grow under the macula. These vessels leak blood and fluid. This type of AMD causes most of the vision loss associated with the condition.\nHealth care providers are not sure what causes AMD. The condition is rare before age 55. It occurs mostly in people 75 years or older.\nRisk factors for AMD are:\nFamily history of AMD\nBeing White\nCigarette smoking\nHigh-fat diet\nBeing female\nSymptoms\nYou may not have any symptoms at first. As the disease gets worse, you may have problems with your central vision.\nSYMPTOMS OF DRY AMD\nThe most common symptom of dry AMD is blurred vision. Objects in the center part of your vision often look distorted and dim, and colors look faded. You may have trouble reading print or seeing other details."}

But you can see well enough to walk and do most daily activities.\nAs dry AMD gets worse, you may need more light to read or do everyday tasks. A blurred spot in the center of vision gradually gets larger and darker.\nIn the later stages of dry AMD, you may not be able to recognize faces until they are close.\nSYMPTOMS OF WET AMD\nThe most common early symptom of wet AMD is that straight lines look distorted and wavy.\nThere may be a small dark spot in the center of your vision that gets larger over time.\nWith both types of AMD, central vision loss can occur quickly. If this happens, you will need to be seen right away by an ophthalmologist. Make sure this eye doctor has experience in treating problems with the retina.\nExams and Tests\nYou will have an eye exam. Drops will be placed into your eyes to widen (dilate) your pupils."}

Your eye doctor will use special lenses to view your retina, blood vessels, and optic nerve.\nYour eye doctor will look for specific changes in the macula and blood vessels and for drusen.\nYou may be asked to cover one eye and look at a pattern of lines called an Amsler grid. If the straight lines look wavy, it may be a sign of AMD. The American Macular Degeneration Foundation has an\nAmsler grid\nyou can download along with instructions for how to check your vision.\nOther tests that may be done include:\nUsing special dye and camera to look at blood flow in the retina (\nfluorescein angiogram\n)\nTaking a photo of the inner lining of the eye (fundus photography)\nUsing light waves to view the retina (optical coherence tomography)\nA test that measures the pigment in the macula\nTreatment\nIf you have advanced or severe dry AMD, no treatment can restore your vision.\nIf you have early AMD and do not smoke, a combination of certain vitamins, antioxidants, and zinc may prevent the disease from getti"}

The supplements contain:\n500 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C\n400 international units (IU) of vitamin E\n15 mg beta-carotene\n80 mg of zinc\n2 mg of copper\nOnly take this vitamin combination if your eye doctor recommends it.

Early detection leads to earlier treatment and often, a better outcome.\nThe best way to detect changes is by self-testing at home with the Amsler grid. Your eye doctor can give you a copy of the grid or you can print one from the Internet. Test each eye individually while wearing your reading glasses. If the lines look wavy, call your eye doctor right away for an appointment.\nTreatments in development:\nStem cell research is showing some promise in restoring some vision in AMD. But this type of treatment is still years away at this point. Similarly, gene therapy may also have a place in the treatment of AMD."}

This means complete vision loss never occurs. AMD results in the loss of central vision only.\nMild, dry AMD usually does not cause disabling central vision loss.\nWet AMD often leads to significant vision loss.\nIn general, with AMD you may lose the ability to read, drive a car, and recognize faces at a distance. But most people with AMD can carry out daily tasks without much difficulty.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIf you have AMD, your eye doctor may recommend that you check your vision every day with an Amsler grid."}
