Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHemophilia B\nHemophilia B\nHemophilia B is a hereditary bleeding disorder caused by a lack of blood clotting factor IX. Without enough factor IX, the blood cannot clot properly to control bleeding.\nCauses\nWhen you bleed, a series of reactions take place in the body that helps blood clots form. This process is called the coagulation cascade. It involves as many as 20 different special proteins called coagulation, or clotting factors. You may have a higher chance of excess bleeding if one or more of these factors are missing or are not functioning like they should.\nFactor IX (nine) is one such coagulation factor. Hemophilia B is the result of the body not making enough factor IX. Hemophilia B is caused by an inherited\nX-linked recessive\ntrait, with the variant gene located on the X chromosome.\nFemales have two copies of the X chromosome. If the factor IX gene on one chromosome does not work, the gene on the other chromosome can do the job of making enough factor IX.\nMales have only one X chromosome."}

If the factor IX gene on one chromosome does not work, the gene on the other chromosome can do the job of making enough factor IX.\nMales have only one X chromosome. If the factor IX gene is missing on a boy's X chromosome, he will have Hemophilia B. For this reason, most people with hemophilia B are male.\nIf a woman has a variant factor IX gene, she is considered a carrier. This means the variant gene can be passed down to her children. Boys born to such women have a 50% chance of having hemophilia B. Their daughters have a 50% chance of being a carrier.\nAll female children of men with hemophilia carry the variant gene whereas male children do not.\nRisk factors for hemophilia B include:\nFamily history of bleeding\nBeing male\nSymptoms\nSeverity of symptoms can vary. Prolonged\nbleeding\nis the main symptom. It is often first seen when the infant is circumcised. Other bleeding problems usually show up when the infant starts crawling and walking.\nMild cases may go unnoticed until later in life. Symptoms may first occur after surgery or injury."}

Once the specific variant has been identified, other people in your family will need tests to diagnose the disorder.\nTests to diagnose hemophilia B include:\nPartial thromboplastin time\n(PTT)\nProthrombin time\n(PT)\nSerum factor IX\nactivity\nTreatment\nTreatment includes replacing the missing clotting factor. You will receive factor IX concentrates."}

How much you get depends on:\nSeverity of bleeding\nSite of bleeding\nYour weight and height\nTo prevent a bleeding crisis, people with hemophilia and their families can be taught to give factor IX concentrates at home at the first signs of bleeding. People with severe forms of the disease may need regular, preventive infusions.\nIf you have severe hemophilia, you may also need to take factor IX concentrate before surgery or certain types of dental work.\nYou should get the\nhepatitis B vaccine\n. People with hemophilia are more likely to get hepatitis B because they may receive blood products.\nSome people with hemophilia B develop\nantibodies\nto factor IX. These antibodies are called inhibitors. The inhibitors attack factor IX so that it no longer works. In such cases, a man-made clotting factor called VIIa can be given.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\nhemophilia support group\n."}
