It is hereditary, which means it is passed down in families.\nCauses\nG6PD deficiency occurs when a person is missing or does not have enough of an enzyme called glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase. This enzyme helps red blood cells work properly.\nToo little G6PD leads to the destruction of red blood cells. This process is called hemolysis. When this process is actively occurring, it is called a hemolytic episode. The episodes are most often brief."}

This process is called hemolysis. When this process is actively occurring, it is called a hemolytic episode. The episodes are most often brief. This is because the body continues to produce new red blood cells, which have normal G6PD activity.\nRed blood cell destruction can be triggered by infections, certain foods (such as fava beans), and certain medicines, including:\nAntimalarial medicines such as quinine\nAspirin (high doses)\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nQuinidine\nSulfa medicines\nAntibiotics such as quinolones, nitrofurantoin\nOther chemicals, such as those in mothballs, can also trigger an episode.\nIn the United States, G6PD deficiency is more common among blacks than whites. Men are more likely to have this disorder than women.\nYou are more likely to develop this condition if you:\nAre African American\nAre of Middle Eastern decent, particularly Kurdish or Sephardic Jewish\nAre male\nHave a family history of the deficiency\nA form of this disorder is common in whites of Mediterranean descent. This form is also associated with acute episodes of hemolysis."}
