This is not a common form of Morton neuroma, but symptoms and treatment are similar.\nExams and Tests\nYour provider can usually diagnose this problem by examining your foot. Squeezing your forefoot or toes together bring on the symptoms.\nA foot\nx-ray\nmay be done to rule out bone problems.\nMRI\nor\nultrasound\ncan successfully diagnose the condition.\nNerve testing (\nelectromyography\n) cannot diagnose Morton neuroma. But it may be used to check for conditions that cause similar symptoms.\nBlood tests may be done to check for inflammation-related conditions, including certain forms of arthritis.\nTreatment\nNonsurgical treatment is tried first. Your provider may recommend any of the following:\nPadding and taping the toe area\nShoe inserts (orthotics)\nChanges to footwear, such as wearing shoes with wider toe boxes or flat heels\nAnti-inflammatory medicines taken by mouth or injected into the area between the toes\nNerve blocking medicines injected into the toe area\nOther painkillers\nPhysical therapy\nAnti-inflammatories and painkillers are not recommended for long-term treatment.\nIn some cases, surgery is needed to remove the thickened tissue and inflamed nerve."}
