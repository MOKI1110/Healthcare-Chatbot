You feel uncomfortable unless you move your legs. Moving stops the unpleasant feeling for a short time.\nThis disorder is also known as restless legs syndrome/Willis-Ekbom disease (RLS/WED).\nCauses\nNo one knows exactly what causes RLS. It may be due to a problem with the way brain cells use dopamine. Dopamine is a brain chemical that helps with muscle movement.\nRLS may be linked to some other conditions. It may occur more often in people with:\nChronic kidney disease\nDiabetes\nIron, magnesium, or folic acid deficiency\nAnemia (often due to iron deficiency)\nParkinson disease\nPeripheral neuropathy\nPregnancy\nMultiple sclerosis\nRLS may also occur in people who:\nUse certain medicines such as calcium channel blockers, lithium, or neuroleptics\nAre stopping sedative use\nUse caffeine, alcohol, or nicotine\nRLS occurs most often in middle-aged and older adults."}

Your health care provider will take your medical history and do a physical exam. You may have blood tests and other exams to check for conditions that can cause similar symptoms. Your provider may order blood tests to look for iron deficiency anemia and other medical problems.\nSleep studies may be done to check for other conditions.\nUsually, your provider will determine whether you have RLS based on your symptoms.\nTreatment\nRLS can't be cured.
