Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nIntravenous pyelogram\nIntravenous pyelogram\nAn intravenous pyelogram (IVP) is a special\nx-ray\nexam of the kidneys, bladder, and ureters (the tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder).\nHow the Test is Performed\nAn IVP is done in a hospital radiology department or a health care provider's office.\nYou may be asked to take some medicine to clear your bowels before the procedure to provide a better view of the urinary tract. You will need to empty your bladder right before the procedure starts.\nYour provider will inject an iodine-based contrast (dye) into a vein in your arm. A series of x-ray images are taken at different times. This is to see how the kidneys remove the dye and how it collects in your urine.\nYou will need to lie still during the procedure. The test may take up to an hour.\nBefore the final image is taken, you will be asked to urinate again. This is to see how well the bladder has emptied.\nYou can go back to your normal diet and medicines after the procedure."}

This is to see how well the bladder has emptied.\nYou can go back to your normal diet and medicines after the procedure. You should drink plenty of fluids to help remove all the contrast dye from your body.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nAs with all x-ray procedures, tell your provider if you:\nAre allergic to contrast material\nAre pregnant\nHave any medicine allergies\nHave kidney disease or diabetes\nYour provider will tell you if you can eat or drink before this test. You may be given a laxative to take the afternoon before the procedure to clear the intestines. This will help your kidneys to be seen clearly.\nYou must sign a consent form. You will be asked to wear a hospital gown and to remove all jewelry.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel a burning or\nflushing\nsensation in your arm and body as the contrast dye is injected. You may also have a metallic taste in your mouth."}

You may also have a metallic taste in your mouth. This is normal and will go away quickly.\nSome people develop a headache, nausea, or vomiting after the dye is injected.\nThe belt across the kidneys may feel tight over your belly area.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nAn IVP can be used to evaluate:\nAn abdominal injury\nBladder and kidney infections\nBlood in the urine\nFlank pain\n(possibly due to\nkidney stones\n)\nTumors\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThe test may reveal kidney diseases, birth defects of the urinary system, tumors, kidney stones, or damage to the urinary system.\nRisks\nThere is a chance of an\nallergic reaction\nto the dye, even if you have received contrast dye in the past without any problem. If you have a known allergy to iodine-based contrast, a different test can be done. Other tests include retrograde pyelography,\nmagnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI), or ultrasound.\nThere is low radiation exposure. Most experts feel that the risk is low compared with the benefits.\nChildren are more sensitive to the risks of radiation."}
