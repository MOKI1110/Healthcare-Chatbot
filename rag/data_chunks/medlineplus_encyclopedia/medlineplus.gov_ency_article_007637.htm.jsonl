Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBotulinum toxin injection - larynx\nBotulinum toxin injection - larynx\nBotulinum toxin (BTX) is a type of nerve blocker. When injected, BTX blocks nerve signals to muscles so they relax.\nBTX is the toxin that causes botulism, a rare but serious illness. It is safe when used in very small doses.\nDescription\nBTX is injected into the muscles around the vocal cords. This weakens the muscles and improves voice quality. It is not a cure for laryngeal dystonia, but can help ease the symptoms.\nIn most cases, you will have the BTX injections in your health care provider's office. There are two common ways to inject BTX into the larynx:\nThrough the neck:\nYou may have local anesthesia to numb the area.\nYou may lie down on your back or remain sitting up. This will depend on your comfort and your provider's preference.\nYour provider may use an EMG (\nelectromyography\n) machine. An EMG machine records the movement of your vocal cord muscles through tiny electrodes placed on your skin."}

An EMG machine records the movement of your vocal cord muscles through tiny electrodes placed on your skin. This helps your provider guide the needle to the correct area.\nAnother method involves using a flexible laryngoscope inserted through the nose to help guide the needle.\nThrough the mouth:\nYou may have general anesthesia so you are asleep during this procedure.\nYou may also have numbing medicine sprayed into your nose, throat, and larynx.\nYour provider will use a long, curved needle to inject directly into the vocal cord muscles.\nYou provider may place a small camera (\nendoscope\n) into your mouth to guide the needle.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nYou may have this procedure if you have been diagnosed with\nlaryngeal dystonia\n. BTX injections are the most common treatment for this condition.\nBTX injections are used to treat other problems in the voice box (larynx). They are also used to treat many other conditions in different parts of the body.\nAfter the Procedure\nYou may not be able to talk for about an hour after the injections.\nBTX can cause some side effects."}

Some of the side effects include:\nA breathy sound to your voice\nHoarseness\nWeak cough\nTrouble swallowing\nPain where the BTX was injected\nFlu-like symptoms\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn most cases, BTX injections should improve your voice quality for about 3 to 4 months. To maintain your voice, you may need injections every few months.\nYour provider may ask you to keep a diary of your symptoms to see how well and how long the injection is working. This will help you and your provider find the right dose for you and to decide how often you need treatment.\nAlternative Names\nInjection laryngoplasty; Botox - larynx: spasmodic dysphonia - BTX; Essential voice tremor (EVT) - BTX; Glottic insufficiency; Percutaneous electromyography-guided botulinum toxin treatment; Percutaneous indirect laryngoscopy-guided botulinum toxin treatment; Adductor dysphonia - BTX; OnabotulinumtoxinA - larynx; AbobotulinumtoxinA\nReferences\nAkst L."}
