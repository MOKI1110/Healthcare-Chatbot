The proteins are markers that may help diagnose\nleukemia\nor lymphoma.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nIn some cases, white blood cells are removed during a\nbone marrow biopsy\n. The sample may also be taken during a\nlymph node biopsy\nor other biopsy when lymphoma is suspected.\nThe blood sample is sent to a laboratory, where a laboratory specialist checks the cell type and characteristics. This procedure is called immunophenotyping. The test is often done using a technique called flow cytometry.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is usually necessary.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise."}
