Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nChronic thyroiditis (Hashimoto disease)\nChronic thyroiditis (Hashimoto disease)\nChronic thyroiditis is caused by a reaction of the immune system  against the thyroid gland. It often results in reduced thyroid function (\nhypothyroidism\n).\nThe disorder is also called Hashimoto disease.\nThe thyroid gland is located in the neck, just above where your collarbones meet in the middle.\nCauses\nHashimoto disease is a common thyroid gland disorder. It can occur at any age, but is most often seen in middle-aged women. It is caused by a\nreaction of the immune system\nagainst the thyroid gland.\nThe disease begins slowly. It may take months or even years for the condition to be detected and for thyroid hormone levels to become lower than normal. Hashimoto disease is most common in people with a family history of thyroid disease.\nIn rare cases, the disease may be related to other hormone problems caused by the immune system. It can occur with poor adrenal function and type 1 diabetes."}

You'll likely need to have regular blood tests to check the levels of the medicines in your body.\nTreatment\nIf you have findings of an underactive thyroid, you may receive thyroid replacement medicine.\nNot everyone with thyroiditis or goiter has low levels of thyroid hormone. You may just need regular follow-up by a health care provider.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe disease stays stable for years. If it does slowly progress to thyroid hormone deficiency (hypothyroidism), it can be treated with hormone replacement therapy.\nPossible Complications\nThis condition can occur with other autoimmune disorders. In rare cases, thyroid cancer or thyroid lymphoma may develop.\nSevere untreated hypothyroidism can lead to a change in consciousness, coma, and death."}
