This is a hormone produced by the\nadrenal glands\nand sex glands.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. Most of the time, blood is\ndrawn from a vein\nlocated on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\nIn infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin.\nThe blood collects in a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip.\nA bandage is put over the spot to stop any bleeding.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nMany medicines can interfere with blood test results.\nYour health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test.\nDo not stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted."}

You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe main use of this test is to check infants for an inherited disorder that affects the adrenal gland, called\ncongenital adrenal hyperplasia\n(CAH). It is often done on infants who are born with outer genitals that do not clearly look like those of a boy or a girl.\nThis test is also used to identify people who develop symptoms of CAH later in life, a condition called nonclassical adrenal hyperplasia.\nA  provider may recommend this test for women or girls who have male traits such as:\nExcess hair growth in places where adult men grow hair\nDeep voice or an increase in muscle mass\nAbsence of menses\nInfertility\nNormal Results\nNormal and abnormal values differ for babies born with low birth weight."}

In general, normal results are as follows:\nBabies more than 24 hours old - less than 400 to 600 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL) or 12.12 to 18.18 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L)\nChildren before puberty around 100 ng/dL or 3.03 nmol/L\nAdults - less than 200 ng/dL or 6.06 nmol/L\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nThe examples above show the common measurements for results of these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA high level of 17-OH progesterone may be due to:\nTumors of the adrenal gland\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia\n(CAH)\nIn infants with CAH, the 17-OHP level ranges from 2,000 to 40,000 ng/dL or 60.6 to 1212 nmol/L."}
