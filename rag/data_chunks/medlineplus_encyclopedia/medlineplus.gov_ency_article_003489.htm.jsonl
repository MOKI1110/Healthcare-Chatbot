Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTotal iron binding capacity\nTotal iron binding capacity\nTotal iron binding capacity (TIBC) is a blood test to see if you have too much or too little iron in your blood. Iron moves through the blood attached to a protein called transferrin. This test helps your health care provider know how well that protein can carry iron in your blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou should not eat or drink for 8 hours before the test.\nCertain medicines may affect the result of this test. Your provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines. Do not stop any medicine before talking to your provider.\nMedicines that can affect the test result include:\nAdrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)\nBirth control pills\nFluorides\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may recommend this test if:\nYou have signs or symptoms of\nanemia\ndue to low iron\nOther lab tests suggest you have anemia due to low iron levels\nNormal Results\nNormal value range is:\nIron: Males: 50 to 150 mcg/dL (8.95 to 26.85 micromol/L); Females: 35 to 145 mcg/dL (6.26 to 25.95 micromol/L)\nTotal iron binding capacity (TIBC): Males: 171 to 505 mcg/dL (30.6 to 90.3 micromol/L); Females: 149 to 492 mcg/dL (26.7 to 88.0 micromol/L)\nIron saturation: Males: 20% to 50%; Females: 15% to 45%\nThe numbers above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nTIBC is usually higher than normal when the body's iron supplies are low."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nTIBC is usually higher than normal when the body's iron supplies are low. This can occur with:\nIron deficiency anemia\nPregnancy (late)\nLower-than-normal TIBC may mean:\nAnemia due to red blood cells being destroyed too quickly (\nhemolytic anemia\n)\nLower-than-normal level of protein in the blood (hypoproteinemia)\nInflammation\nLiver disease, such as\ncirrhosis\nMalnutrition\nDecrease in red blood cells from the intestines not properly absorbing vitamin B12 (\npernicious anemia\n)\nSickle cell anemia\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting\nor feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma\n(blood buildup under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nTIBC; Anemia -TIBC\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nCamaschella C."}
