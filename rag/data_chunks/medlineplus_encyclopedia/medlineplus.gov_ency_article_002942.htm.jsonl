Stools moving through the intestine drain through the stoma into a bag attached to the skin of the abdomen.\nDescription\nThe procedure is usually done after:\nBowel resection\nInjury to the bowel\nThe colostomy may be short-term or permanent.\nColostomy is done while you are under\ngeneral anesthesia\n(asleep and pain-free). It may be done either with a large surgical cut in the abdomen or with a small camera and several small cuts (laparoscopy).\nThe type of approach used depends on what other procedure needs to be done. The surgical cut is usually made in the middle of the abdomen. The bowel resection or repair is done as needed.\nFor the colostomy, one end of the healthy colon is brought out through an opening made in the abdomen wall, usually on the left side. The edges of bowel are stitched to the skin of opening. This opening is called a stoma."}

The edges of bowel are stitched to the skin of opening. This opening is called a stoma. A bag called a stoma appliance is placed around the opening to allow stool to drain.\nYour colostomy may be short-term. If you have surgery on part of your large intestine, a colostomy allows the other part of your intestine to rest while you recover. Once your body has fully recovered from the first surgery, you will have another surgery to reattach the ends of the large intestine. This is usually done after 12 weeks.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nReasons a colostomy is done include:\nInfection of the abdomen, such as perforated\ndiverticulitis\nor an\nabscess\n.\nInjury to the colon or rectum (for example, a gunshot wound).\nPartial or complete blockage of the large bowel (intestinal obstruction).\nRectal or colon cancer\n.\nWounds or\nfistulas\nin the perineum."}

You may have to stay longer if your colostomy was done as an emergency procedure.\nYou will be allowed to slowly go back to your normal diet:\nThe same day as your surgery, you may be able to suck on ice chips to ease your thirst.\nBy the next day, you will probably be allowed to drink clear liquids.\nThicker fluids and then soft foods will be added as your bowels begin to work again. You may be eating normally within 2 days after surgery.\nThe colostomy drains stool (feces) from the colon into the colostomy bag. Colostomy stool is often softer and more liquid than stool that is passed normally."}
