Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nDoppler ultrasound exam of an arm or leg\nDoppler ultrasound exam of an arm or leg\nThis test uses\nultrasound\nto look at the blood flow in the large arteries and veins in the arms or legs.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is done in the ultrasound or radiology department, a hospital room, or in a peripheral vascular lab.\nDuring the exam:\nA water-soluble gel is placed on a handheld device called a transducer. This device directs high-frequency sound waves to the artery or veins being tested.\nBlood pressure cuffs may be put around different parts of the body, including the thigh, calf, ankle, and different points along the arm.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will need to remove clothes from the arm or leg being examined.\nHow the Test will Feel\nSometimes, the person performing the test will need to press on the vein to make sure it does not have a clot. Some people may feel slight pain from the pressure.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done as the first step to look at arteries and veins."}

Sometimes,\narteriography\nand\nvenography\nmay be needed later. The test is done to help diagnose:\nArteriosclerosis of the arms or legs\nBlood clot\n(deep vein thrombosis)\nVenous insufficiency\nThe test may also be used to:\nLook at injury to the arteries\nMonitor arterial reconstruction and bypass grafts\nNormal Results\nA normal result means the blood vessels show no signs of narrowing, clots, or closure, and the arteries have normal blood flow.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be due to:\nBlockage in an artery by a blood clot\nBlood clot in a vein (DVT)\nNarrowing or widening of an artery\nSpastic arterial disease (arterial contractions brought on by cold or emotion)\nVenous occlusion (closing of a vein)\nVenous reflux (blood flow going the wrong direction in veins)\nArterial occlusion from atherosclerosis\nThis test may also be done to help assess the following conditions:\nAtherosclerosis of the extremities\nDeep venous thrombosis\nSuperficial thrombophlebitis\nRisks\nThere are no risks f"}

Nicotine can cause the arteries in the extremities to constrict.\nQuitting smoking lowers the risk for problems with the heart and circulatory system. Most smoking-related deaths are caused by cardiovascular problems, not lung cancer.\nAlternative Names\nPVD - Doppler; PAD - Doppler; Blockage of leg arteries - Doppler; Intermittent claudication - Doppler; Arterial insufficiency of the legs - Doppler; Leg pain and cramping - Doppler; Calf pain - Doppler; Venous Doppler - DVT\nImages\nDoppler ultrasonography of an extremity\nReferences\nAziz MU, Zahid M, Weber TM, Robbin ML.
