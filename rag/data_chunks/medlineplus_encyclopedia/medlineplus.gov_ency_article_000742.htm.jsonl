It causes a stabbing or electric shock-like pain in parts of the face.\nCauses\nThe pain of TN comes from the trigeminal nerve. This nerve carries the sensations of touch and pain from the face, eyes, sinuses, and mouth to the brain.\nTN may be caused by:\nMultiple sclerosis\n(MS) or other diseases that damage the protective covering\nmyelin\nof the nerves\nPressure on the trigeminal nerve from a swollen blood vessel or\ntumor\nInjury to the trigeminal nerve, such as from trauma to the face or from oral or sinus surgery\nOften, no exact cause is found. TN usually affects adults above age 50 years, but it can occur at any age. Women are affected more often than men. When TN affects people younger than 40, it is often due to MS or a tumor.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nVery painful, sharp electric-like spasms that are usually brief. The spasms may occur close together such that it feels like they last from several seconds to minutes."}

The spasms may occur close together such that it feels like they last from several seconds to minutes. Pain can become constant.\nPain is usually only on one side of the face, often around the eye, cheek, and lower part of the face.\nThere is usually no loss of sensation or movement of the affected part of the face.\nPain may be triggered by touch or sounds.\nPainful attacks of TN can be triggered by common, everyday activities, such as:\nTalking\nSmiling\nBrushing teeth\nChewing\nDrinking\nEating\nExposure to hot or cold temperature\nTouching the face\nShaving\nWind\nApplying make-up\nThe right side of the face is mostly affected. In some cases, TN goes away on its own.\nExams and Tests\nA brain and nervous system (neurologic) exam is often normal."}

Tests that are done to look for the cause may include:\nComplete blood count\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate\n(ESR)\nMRI of the head\nMRA (angiography) of brain\nor\nCTA\nEye examination (to rule out intraocular disease)\nSpinal tap\n(lumbar puncture)\nCT scan of head\n(who cannot undergo MRI)\nTrigeminal reflex testing (in rare cases)\nTreatment\nYour primary care provider, a neurologist, or a pain specialist may be involved in your care.\nCertain medicines sometimes help reduce pain and the rate of attacks. These medicines include:\nAnti-seizure medicines, such as carbamazepine\nMuscle relaxants, such as baclofen\nTricyclic antidepressants\nIf you are found to have MS as a cause of TN, your health care provider will discuss medicines that can treat the underlying MS.\nShort-term pain relief occurs through surgery, but is associated with risk of complications. One surgery is called microvascular decompression (MVD) or the Jannetta procedure."}

During surgery, a sponge-like material is placed between the nerve and the blood vessel that is pressing on the nerve.\nTrigeminal nerve block (injection) with local anesthetic and steroid is an excellent treatment option to rapidly relieve pain while waiting for medicines to take effect.\nOther techniques involve destroying or cutting parts of the trigeminal nerve root. Methods used include:\nRadiofrequency ablation (uses high-frequency heat)\nInjection of glycerol or alcohol\nBalloon microcompression\nRadiosurgery\n(uses high power energy)\nIf a tumor is the cause of TN, surgery is done to remove it.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well you do depends on the cause of the problem."}
