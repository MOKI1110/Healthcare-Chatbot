These cells help control movement and coordination. The disease leads to shaking (\ntremors\n) and\ntrouble walking and moving\n.\nCauses\nNerve cells use a brain chemical called dopamine to help control muscle movement. With Parkinson disease, the brain cells that make\ndopamine\nslowly die. Without enough dopamine, the cells that control movement can't send proper messages to the muscles. This makes it hard to control the muscles. Slowly, over time, this damage gets worse. No one knows exactly why these brain cells waste away.\nParkinson disease most often develops after age 60. It is one of the most common nervous system problems in older adults.\nThe disease affects men more often than women, although women also develop the disease. Parkinson disease sometimes runs in families.\nThe disease can occur in younger adults."}

For instance, you may have a mild tremor or a slight feeling that one leg is stiff and dragging. Jaw tremor has also been an early sign of Parkinson disease. Symptoms may affect one or both sides of the body.\nGeneral symptoms may include:\nProblems with balance and walking\nRigid or stiff muscles\nMuscle aches\nand pains\nLow blood pressure when you stand up (\northostatic hypotension\n)\nStooped posture\nConstipation\nSweating and not being able to control your body temperature\nSlow or infrequent blinking\nDifficulty swallowing\nDrooling\nSlowed, quieter speech and monotone voice\nNo expression in your face (like you are wearing a mask)\nUnable to write clearly or handwriting is very small (micrographia)\nMovement problems may include:\nDifficulty starting movement, such as starting to walk or getting out of a chair\nDifficulty co"}

This is called resting tremor.\nMay occur when your arm or leg is held out.\nGo away when you move.\nMay be worse when you are tired, excited, or stressed.\nCan cause you to rub your finger and thumb together without meaning to (called pill-rolling tremor).\nEventually may occur in your head, lips, tongue, and feet.\nOther symptoms may include:\nAnxiety, stress, and tension\nCognitive changes\nConfusion\nDepression\nDisturbed sleep\nFainting\nLow blood pressure\nMemory loss\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider may be able to diagnose Parkinson disease based on your symptoms and a physical exam.
