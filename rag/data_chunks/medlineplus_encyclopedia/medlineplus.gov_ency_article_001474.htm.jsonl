They are most often caused by the bacteria\nStaphylococcus aureus\n. They can also be caused by other types of bacteria or fungi found on the skin's surface. Damage to the hair follicle allows the infection to grow deeper into the follicle and the tissues under it.\nBoils may occur in the hair follicles anywhere on the body. They are most common on the face, neck, armpit, buttocks, and thighs. You may have one or many boils. The condition may occur only once or it can be a long-lasting (chronic) or a recurring problem.\nSymptoms\nA boil may begin as tender, pinkish-red, and swollen spot, on a firm area of the skin. Over time, it will feel like a water-filled balloon or\ncyst\n.\nThe pain gets worse as it fills with pus and dead tissue. It lessens when the boil drains."}
