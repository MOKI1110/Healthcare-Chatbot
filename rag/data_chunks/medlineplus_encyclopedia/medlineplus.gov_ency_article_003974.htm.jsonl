Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nExternal incontinence devices\nExternal incontinence devices\nExternal incontinence devices are products (or appliances). These are worn on the outside of the body. They protect the skin from constant\nleakage of stool or urine\n. Certain medical conditions can cause people to lose control of their bowel or bladder.\nInformation\nThere are several products available. The features of these different products are listed below.\nFECAL INCONTINENCE DEVICES\nThere are many types of products for managing long-term\ndiarrhea\nor\nfecal incontinence\n. These devices have a drainable pouch attached to an adhesive wafer. This wafer has a hole cut through the center that fits over the anal opening (rectum).\nIf put on properly, a fecal incontinence device may stay in place for 24 hours. It is important to remove the pouch if any stool has leaked. Liquid stool can irritate the skin.\nAlways clean the skin and apply a new pouch if any leakage has occurred.\nThe device should be applied to clean, dry skin:\nYour health care provider may prescribe a protective skin barrier."}

This barrier is usually a paste. You apply the barrier to the skin before attaching the device. You can put the paste in the skin folds of the buttocks to prevent liquid stool from leaking through this area.\nSpread the buttocks apart, exposing the anus, and apply the wafer and pouch. It may help to have someone help you. The device should cover the skin with no gaps or creases.\nYou may need to trim the hair around the anus to help the wafer stick better to the skin.\nAn enterostomal therapy nurse or skin care nurse can provide you with a list of products that are available in your area.\nURINARY INCONTINENCE DEVICES\nUrine collection devices are mainly used by men with\nurinary incontinence\n. Women are generally treated with medicines and disposable undergarments.  An alternative for some women may be a urinary wicking device.\nThe systems for men most often consist of a pouch or condom-like device. This device is securely placed around the\npenis\n. This is often called a condom catheter."}

This tube empties into a storage bag, which can be emptied directly into the toilet.\nCondom catheters are most effective when applied to a clean, dry penis. You may need to trim the hair around the pubic area for better grip of the device.\nYou must change the device at least every other day to protect the skin and prevent\nurinary tract infections\n. Make sure the condom device fits snugly, but not too tightly. Skin damage may occur if it is too tight.\nAlternative Names\nCondom catheter; Incontinence devices; Fecal collection devices; Urinary incontinence - devices; Fecal incontinence - devices; Stool incontinence - devices\nImages\nMale urinary system\nReferences\nBoone TB, Stewart JN, Martinez LM.
