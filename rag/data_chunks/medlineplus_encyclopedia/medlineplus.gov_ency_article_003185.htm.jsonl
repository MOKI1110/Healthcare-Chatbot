This tissue makes it hard to stretch the area and prevents normal movement.\nContractures mostly occur in the skin, the tissues underneath, and the muscles, tendons, joint capsule, and ligaments surrounding a joint. They reduce the\nrange of motion\nand function in a certain body part. Often, there is also pain.\nCauses\nContracture can be caused by any of the following:\nBrain and nervous system disorders, such as\ncerebral palsy\nor\nstroke\nInherited disorders (such as\nmuscular dystrophy\n)\nNerve damage\nReduced use (for example, from lack of mobility or injuries)\nSevere muscle and bone injuries\nScarring after traumatic injury or burns\nHome Care\nFollow your health care provider's instructions for treating a contracture at home."}
