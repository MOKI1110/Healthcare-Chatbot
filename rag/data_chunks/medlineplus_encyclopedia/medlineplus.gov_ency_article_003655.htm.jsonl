A blood test can be done to measure these products.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nCertain medicines can change blood test results.\nTell your health care provider about all the medicines you take.\nYour provider will tell you if you need to temporarily stop taking any medicines before you have this test. This includes blood thinners such as aspirin, heparin, and urokinase, which make it hard for the blood to clot.\nDo not stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to see if your clot-dissolving (fibrinolytic) system is working properly. Your provider may order this test if you have signs of\ndisseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)\nor another clot-dissolving disorder.\nNormal Results\nThe result is normally less than 10 mcg/mL (10 mg/L).\nNote: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIncreased FDPs may be a sign of primary or secondary fibrinolysis (clot-dissolving activity) due to a variety of causes, including:\nBlood clotting problems\nBurns\nProblem with the heart's structure and function that is present at birth (\ncongenital heart disease\n)\nDisseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)\nLow level of oxygen in the blood\nInfections\nLeukemia\nLiver disease\nProblem during pregnancy such as\npreeclampsia\n,\nplacenta abruption\n, miscarriage\nRecent blood transfusion\nRecent surgery that involved a heart and lung bypass pump, or surgery to lower high blood pressure in the liver\nKidney disease\nTransplanted organ rejection\nLarge blood clots inside the body\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other."}
