Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe hemoglobin test is a common test and is almost always done as part of a\ncomplete blood count\n(CBC)."}

Reasons or conditions for ordering the hemoglobin test include:\nBefore and after major surgery\nBlood in your stools, or vomit (if you throw up)\nChronic medical problems, such as kidney disease or certain types of arthritis\nDuring pregnancy\nFatigue, poor health, or unexplained weight loss\nHeadaches\nHeavy menstrual periods\nLeukemia or other problems in the bone marrow\nMonitoring during treatment for cancer\nMonitoring medicines that may cause anemia or low blood counts\nMonitoring of anemia and its cause\nPoor nutrition\nProblems concentrating\nNormal Results\nNormal results for adults vary, but in general are:\nMale: 13.8 to 17.2 grams per deciliter (g/dL) or 138 to 172 grams per liter (g/L)\nFemale: 12.1 to 15.1 g/dL or 121 to 151 g/L\nNormal results for children vary, but in general are:\nNewborn: 14 to 24 g/dL or 140 to 240 g/L\nInfant: 9.5 to 13 g/dL or 95 to 130 g/L\nThe ranges above are common measurements for results of these tests."}

Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nLOWER THAN NORMAL HEMOGLOBIN\nLow hemoglobin level may be due to:\nAnemia\nBleeding\nBone marrow being unable to produce new red blood cells. This may be due to\nleukemia\n, other cancers, drug toxicity, radiation therapy, infection, or bone marrow disorders\nChronic illness\nChronic kidney disease\nDestruction of red blood cells (hemolysis)\nLeukemia\nMalnutrition\nPregnancy\nToo little iron,\nfolate\n,\nvitamin B12\n, and\nvitamin B6\nin the diet\nToo much water in the body\nHIGHER THAN NORMAL HEMOGLOBIN\nHigh hemoglobin level is most often caused by low oxygen levels in the blood (hypoxia), present over a long period of time."}
