It is passed to humans by the bite of infected Anopheles mosquitoes. After infection, the parasites (called sporozoites) travel through the bloodstream to the liver. There, they mature and release another form of parasites, called merozoites. The parasites enter the bloodstream and infect red blood cells (RBCs).\nThe parasites multiply inside the red blood cells. The cells then break open within 48 to 72 hours and infect more red blood cells. The first symptoms usually occur 2 to 4 weeks after infection, though they can appear as early as 8 days or as long as a year after infection."}

The first symptoms usually occur 2 to 4 weeks after infection, though they can appear as early as 8 days or as long as a year after infection. The symptoms occur in cycles of 48 to 72 hours.\nMost symptoms are caused by:\nThe release of merozoites into the bloodstream\nAnemia resulting from the destruction of the red blood cells\nLarge amounts of free hemoglobin being released into circulation after red blood cells break open, which can damage other organs such as the kidneys\nMalaria can also be transmitted from a mother to her unborn baby (congenitally) and by blood transfusions. Malaria can be carried by mosquitoes in temperate climates, but the parasite disappears over the winter.\nThe disease is a major health problem in much of the tropics and subtropics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in 2020 there were about 241 million cases of malaria. About 627,000 people died of it. Malaria is a major disease hazard for travelers to warm climates.\nIn some areas of the world, mosquitoes that carry malaria have developed resistance to insecticides."}

In addition, the parasites have developed resistance to some antibiotics. These conditions have made it hard to control both the rate of infection and spread of this disease.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nAnemia\n(condition in which the body doesn't have enough healthy red blood cells)\nBloody stools\nChills, fever, sweating\nComa\nConvulsions\nHeadache\nJaundice\nMuscle pain\nNausea and vomiting\nExams and Tests\nDuring a physical examination, the health care provider may find an\nenlarged liver\nor\nenlarged spleen\n.\nTests that are done include:\nRapid diagnostic tests, which are becoming more common because they are easier to use and require less training by laboratory technicians\nMalaria blood smears taken at 6 to 12 hour intervals to confirm the diagnosis\ncomplete blood count\n(CBC) will identify anemia if it is present\nTreatment\nMalaria, especially falciparum malaria, is a medical emergency that requires a hospital stay.

Visitors will not have immunity and should take preventive medicines.\nIt is important to see your provider well before your trip. This is because treatment may need to begin as long as 2 weeks before travel to the area, and continue for a month after you leave the area.
