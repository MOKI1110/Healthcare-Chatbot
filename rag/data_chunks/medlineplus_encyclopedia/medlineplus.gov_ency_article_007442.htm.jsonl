Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nThoracic spine CT scan\nThoracic spine CT scan\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the thoracic spine is an imaging method. It uses x-rays to rapidly create detailed pictures of the middle back (thoracic spine).\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner.\nOnce you are inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you. Modern \"spiral\" scanners can perform the exam without stopping as your body moves through the scanner in small increments.\nA computer creates separate images of the body area. These are called slices. These images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, or printed on film. The slices together can create three-dimensional models of the body area.\nYou must be still during the exam. Movement will create blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time.\nThe scan should take only 10 to 15 minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nCertain exams require a special dye, called contrast. Contrast is delivered into the body before the test starts."}

Contrast is delivered into the body before the test starts. This helps certain areas show up better on the x-rays.\nContrast can be given in several ways. It may be given as an injection through:\nA vein (IV) in your hand or forearm\nYour back into the space surrounding the spinal cord\nA joint if one is under investigation\nIf contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.\nBefore receiving the contrast, tell your health care provider if:\nYou have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test to safely receive the dye.\nYou take the diabetes medicine metformin (Glucophage). You may need to take extra steps if you take this medicine.\nFind out if the CT machine has a weight limit if you weigh more than 450 pounds (200 kilograms)."}

Too much weight can cause damage to the scanner.\nYou will be asked to remove jewelry and wear a hospital gown during the study.\nHow the Test will Feel\nSome people may find it uncomfortable to lie on the hard table.\nContrast given through an IV may cause:\nSlight burning feeling\nMetallic taste in the mouth\nWarm flushing of the body\nThese feelings are normal and will often go away within a few seconds.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nCT rapidly creates detailed pictures of the thoracic spine."}

Having many x-rays or CT scans over time may increase your risk for cancer. However, the risk from any one scan is small. You and your provider should weigh this risk against the benefits of getting a correct diagnosis for a medical problem.\nSome people have allergies to contrast dye.\nThe most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. People with an iodine allergy may have:\nNausea or vomiting\nSneezing\nItching\nor\nhives\nIn case you are allergic, your provider may give you antihistamines (such as Benadryl) or steroids before the test.\nThe kidneys help remove the dye from the body. People with kidney disease or diabetes may need to receive extra fluids after the test. This will help flush the dye out of the body. Be sure to tell your provider if you have any kidney problems.\nRarely, the dye may cause\nanaphylaxis\n. Notify the scanner operator right away if you have any trouble breathing or swallowing. Scanners come with an intercom and speakers, so the operator can hear you at all times.\nConsiderations\nThe thoracic CT scan is good for evaluating large herniated disks."}
