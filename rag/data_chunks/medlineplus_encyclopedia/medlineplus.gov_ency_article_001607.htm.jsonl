Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPierre Robin sequence\nPierre Robin sequence\nPierre Robin sequence is a condition in which an infant has a smaller than normal lower jaw, a tongue that falls back in the throat, and difficulty breathing. It is present at birth.\nCauses\nThe exact causes of Pierre Robin sequence are unknown. It may be part of many genetic syndromes.\nThe lower jaw develops slowly before birth, but may grow faster during the first few years of life.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of this condition include:\nCleft palate\nHigh-arched palate\nJaw that is very small with a small chin\nJaw that is far back in the throat\nRepeated ear infections\nSmall opening in the roof of the mouth, which  may cause choking or liquids coming back out through the nose\nTeeth that appear when the baby is born\nTongue that is large compared to the jaw\nExams and Tests\nA health care provider can often diagnose this condition during a physical exam. Consulting with a genetic specialist can rule out other problems linked to this condition.\nTreatment\nTalk to your child's provider about safe sleeping positions."}

Consulting with a genetic specialist can rule out other problems linked to this condition.\nTreatment\nTalk to your child's provider about safe sleeping positions. Some infants with Pierre-Robin sequence need to sleep on their stomachs instead of their back to prevent their tongue from falling back into their airway. This is different than the usual sleeping recommendations for infants.\nIn moderate cases, the child will need to have a tube placed through the nose and into the airway to avoid airway blockage. In severe cases, surgery is needed to prevent a blockage in the upper airway. Some children need surgery to make a hole in their airway or to move their jaw forward.\nFeeding must be done very carefully to avoid choking and breathing liquids into the airways."}

There is a high risk for problems if the child's airways are not kept from getting blocked.\nPossible Complications\nThese complications can occur:\nBreathing difficulties, especially when the child sleeps\nChoking episodes\nCongestive heart failure\nDeath\nFeeding difficulties\nLow blood oxygen and brain damage (due to difficulty breathing)\nType of high blood pressure called pulmonary hypertension\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nBabies born with this condition are often diagnosed at birth.\nContact your provider if your child has choking episodes or breathing problems. A blockage of the airways may cause a high-pitched noise when the child breathes in. It can also lead to blueness of the skin (cyanosis).\nAlso contact your provider if your child has other breathing problems.\nPrevention\nThere is no known prevention."}
