Solder poisoning occurs when someone swallows solder in large amounts. Skin burns can occur if solder touches the skin.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\nPoisonous Ingredient\nThe substances in solder that can be harmful are:\nAntimony\nBismuth\nCadmium\nCopper\nEthylene glycol\nLead\nMild acids\nSilver\nTin\nZinc\nWhere Found\nSolder contains these substances."}

The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.\nOutcomes depend on the type of poison swallowed:\nEthylene glycol is extremely poisonous.\nComplete recovery from lead poisoning may take a year or more. It may cause permanent brain, nerve, or kidney damage.\nIf the amount of zinc or tin swallowed is low, recovery should occur within approximately 6 hours.\nSkin color changes due to silver poisoning are permanent.\nLong-term poisoning with antimony and cadmium may lead to lung cancer.\nRecovery from acid poisoning depends on how much tissue has been damaged.\nSwallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body."}
