It may be passed down through families.\nPeople who have otosclerosis have an abnormal extension of sponge-like bone growing in the middle ear cavity. This growth prevents the ear bones from vibrating normally in response to sound waves. These vibrations are needed in order for you to hear.\nOtosclerosis is the most common cause of middle ear hearing loss in young adults. It typically begins in early to mid-adulthood. It is more common in women than in men. The condition may affect one or both ears.\nRisks for this condition include pregnancy and a family history of hearing loss."}

It is more common in women than in men. The condition may affect one or both ears.\nRisks for this condition include pregnancy and a family history of hearing loss. White people are more likely to develop this condition than people of other races.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nHearing loss (slow at first, but worsens over time)\nRinging in the affected ear (\ntinnitus\n)\nVertigo or dizziness\nExams and Tests\nA hearing test (\naudiometry\n/\naudiology\n) may help determine the severity of hearing loss.\nA special imaging test of the head called a temporal-bone CT may be used to look for other causes of hearing loss.\nTreatment\nOtosclerosis may slowly get worse. The condition may not need to be treated until you have more serious hearing problems.\nUsing some medicines such as fluoride, calcium, or\nvitamin D\nmay help to slow the hearing loss. However, the benefits of these treatments have not yet been proven.\nA hearing aid may be used to treat the hearing loss. This will not cure or prevent hearing loss from getting worse, but it may help with symptoms.\nSurgery can cure or improve conductive hearing loss."}

Either all or part of one of the small middle ear bones behind the eardrum (stapes) is removed and replaced with a\nprosthesis\n.\nA total replacement is called a stapedectomy.\nSometimes only part of the stapes is removed and a small hole is made in the bottom of it. This is called a stapedotomy. Sometimes a laser is used to help with the surgery.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nOtosclerosis gets worse without treatment. Surgery can restore some or all of your hearing loss. Pain and dizziness from the surgery go away within a few weeks for most people.\nTo reduce the risk of complications after surgery:\nDO NOT blow your nose for 2 to 3 weeks after surgery.\nAvoid people with\nrespiratory\nor other infections.\nAvoid bending, lifting, or straining, which may cause\ndizziness.\nAvoid loud noises or sudden pressure changes, such as scuba diving, flying, or driving in the mountains until you have healed.\nIf surgery does not work, you may have total hearing loss."}
