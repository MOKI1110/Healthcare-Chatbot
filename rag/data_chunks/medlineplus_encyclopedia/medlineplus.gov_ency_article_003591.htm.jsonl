Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMicroalbuminuria test\nMicroalbuminuria test\nThis test looks for a protein called albumin in a urine sample.\nAlbumin can also be measured using a\nblood test\nor another urine test, called the\nurine protein test\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will usually be asked to give a small urine sample while at your health care provider's office.\nIn rare cases, you will have to collect all of your urine at home for\n24 hours\n. To do this, you will get a special container from your provider and specific instructions to follow.\nTo make the test more accurate,\nurine creatinine\nlevel will also be measured to allow calculating the ratio of albumin to creatinine in your urine. Creatinine is a chemical waste product of creatine. Creatine is a chemical made by the body that is used to supply energy to muscles.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary for this test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nPeople with\ndiabetes\nhave an increased risk for reduced kidney function. The filters in the kidneys, called nephrons, slowly thicken and become scarred over time."}

The filters in the kidneys, called nephrons, slowly thicken and become scarred over time. The nephrons begin to leak certain proteins into the urine. This kidney damage can also start to happen before any diabetes symptoms begin. In the early stages of kidney problems, blood tests that measure kidney function are usually normal.\nIf you have diabetes, you should have this test each year. The test checks for early signs of\nkidney problems\n.\nNormal Results\nIn a person with healthy kidneys, only very small amounts of albumin passes from the blood into urine. There is little or no albumin in the urine sample. Normal albumin levels in the urine are less than 30 milligrams (mg) per gram of creatinine.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens."}

Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf the test finds a high level of albumin in your urine, your provider may have you repeat the test.\nAbnormal results may mean your\nkidneys are starting to get damaged\n. But the damage may not yet be bad. If the amount of albumin in the urine is small, it is called microalbuminuria.\nAbnormal results are most often reported as 30 mg of albumin per gram of creatinine or more.\nIf you have even more severe kidney damage and there is 300 mg of albumin per gram of creatinine or more, it is called macroalbuminuria.\nYou will need more tests to confirm a problem and show how severe the kidney damage may be.\nIf this test shows that you are starting to have a kidney problem, you can get treatment before the problem gets worse. There are a number of medicines that have been shown to slow the progression of kidney damage. Talk to your provider about specific medicines."}

They may eventually need a new kidney (\nkidney transplant\n).\nThe most common cause of a high level of albumin in the urine is diabetes. Controlling your blood sugar level may lower the albumin level in your urine.\nA high albumin level may also occur with:\nSome immune and inflammatory disorders affecting the kidney\nSome genetic disorders\nRare cancers\nHigh blood pressure\nInflammation in the whole body (systemic)\nNarrowed artery of the kidney\nFever or exercise\nHealthy people may have a higher level of protein in the urine after exercise."}
