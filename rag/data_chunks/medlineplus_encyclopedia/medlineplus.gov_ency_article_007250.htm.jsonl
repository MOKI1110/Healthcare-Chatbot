These cushions are called disks, and they separate your spinal bones (vertebrae).\nDescription\nA surgeon may perform disk removal (diskectomy) in these different ways.\nMicrodiskectomy: When you have a microdiskectomy, the surgeon does not need to do much surgery on the bones, joints, ligaments, or muscles of your spine.\nDiskectomy in the lower part of your back (lumbar spine) may be part of a larger surgery that also includes a\nlaminectomy\n,\nforaminotomy\n, or\nspinal fusion\n.\nDiskectomy in your neck (cervical spine) is most often done along with foraminotomy, or fusion.\nMicrodiskectomy is done in a hospital or outpatient surgical center. You will be given general anesthesia. You will be asleep and pain-free.\nThe surgeon makes a small (1 to 1.5-inch, or 2.5 to 3.8-centimeter) incision (cut) on your back and moves the back muscles away from your spine."}

The surgeon uses a special microscope to see the problem disk or disks and nerves during surgery.\nThe nerve root is located and gently moved away.\nThe surgeon removes the injured disk tissue and pieces of the disk.\nThe back muscles are returned to their normal place.\nThe incision is closed with stitches or staples.\nThe surgery takes about 1 to 2 hours.\nDiskectomy and laminotomy are usually done in the hospital, using general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free).\nThe surgeon makes a larger cut on your back over the spine.\nMuscles and tissue are gently moved to expose your spine.\nA small part of the lamina bone (part of the vertebrae that surrounds the spinal column and nerves) is cut away. The opening may be as large as the ligament that runs along your spine.\nA small hole is cut in the disk that is causing your symptoms. Material from inside the disk is removed."}

The opening may be as large as the ligament that runs along your spine.\nA small hole is cut in the disk that is causing your symptoms. Material from inside the disk is removed. Other fragments of the disk may also be removed.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nWhen one of your disks moves out of place (\nherniates\n), the soft gel inside pushes through the wall of the disk. The disk may then place pressure on the spinal cord and nerves that are coming out of your spinal column.\nMany of the symptoms caused by a herniated disk get better or go away over time without surgery. Most people with low back or neck pain, numbness, or even mild weakness are often first treated with anti-inflammatory medicines, physical therapy, and exercise.\nOnly a few people with a herniated disk need surgery.\nYour health care provider may recommend a diskectomy if you have a herniated disk and:\nLeg or arm pain or numbness that is very bad or is not going away, making it hard to do daily tasks\nSevere weakness in muscles of your arm, lower leg or buttocks\nPain that spreads into your buttocks or legs\nIf you are having problems with your bowels or bladder, or the pain is so bad that strong pai"}
