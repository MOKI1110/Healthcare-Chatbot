Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nB and T cell screen\nB and T cell screen\nB and T cell screen is a lab test to determine the amount of B and T lymphocytes in the blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample is needed\n.\nBlood could also be obtained by\ncapillary sample\n(fingerstick or heel stick in infants).\nAfter the blood is drawn, it goes through a two-step process. First, the lymphocytes are separated from other blood parts. Once the cells are separated, identifiers are added to distinguish between T and B cells.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nTell your health care provider if you have had any of the following, which might affect your T and B cell count:\nChemotherapy\nHIV/AIDS\nRadiation therapy\nRecent or current infection\nSteroid therapy\nStress\nSurgery\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain, while others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order this test if you have signs of certain diseases that weaken the immune system."}

It may also be used to distinguish between cancerous and noncancerous disease, particularly\ncancers\nthat involve the blood and bone marrow.\nAlso, the test may be used to determine how well treatment for certain conditions such as HIV/AIDS is working.\nNormal Results\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal B and T cell counts may suggest a possible disease."}
