Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nInfant of diabetic mother\nInfant of diabetic mother\nA fetus (baby) of a mother with diabetes may be exposed to high blood sugar (glucose) levels throughout the pregnancy.\nCauses\nThere are two forms of diabetes during pregnancy:\nGestational diabetes --\nhigh blood sugar (diabetes) that starts or is first detected during pregnancy\nPre-existing or pre-gestational diabetes -- already having diabetes before becoming pregnant\nIf diabetes is not well controlled during pregnancy, the baby is exposed to high blood sugar levels. This can affect the baby and mother during pregnancy, at the time of birth, and after birth.\nInfants of diabetic mothers (IDM) are often larger than other babies, especially if diabetes is not well-controlled. This may make vaginal birth harder and may increase the risk for nerve injuries and other trauma during birth. Also, cesarean births are more likely.\nAn IDM is more likely to have periods of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) shortly after birth, and during the first few days of life."}

Also, cesarean births are more likely.\nAn IDM is more likely to have periods of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) shortly after birth, and during the first few days of life. This is because the baby has been used to getting more sugar than needed from the mother. They have a higher insulin level than needed after birth. Insulin lowers the blood sugar. It can take days for babies' insulin levels to adjust after birth.\nIDMs are more likely to have:\nBreathing difficulty due to less mature lungs\nHigh red blood cell count (polycythemia)\nHigh bilirubin level (newborn jaundice)\nThickening of the heart muscle between the large chambers (ventricles)\nIf diabetes is not well-controlled, chances of miscarriage or\nstillbirth\nare higher.\nAn IDM has a higher risk of birth defects if the mother has pre-existing diabetes that is not well controlled from the very beginning.\nSymptoms\nThe infant is often\nlarger than usual for babies born\nafter the same length of time in the mother's womb (large for gestational age)."}

In some cases, especially if mothers have more longstanding illness, the baby may be smaller (small for gestational age).\nOther symptoms may include:\nBlue skin color, rapid heart rate, rapid breathing (signs of immature lungs or heart failure)\nPoor sucking, lethargy, weak cry\nSeizures\n(sign of severe low blood sugar)\nPoor feeding\nPuffy face\nTremors or shaking shortly after birth\nJaundice (yellow skin color)\nExams and Tests\nBefore the baby is born:\nUltrasound in the last few months of pregnancy can monitor the size of the baby.\nLung maturity testing may be done on the amniotic fluid. This is VERY rarely done but may be helpful if the due date was not determined early in the pregnancy. Delivery before 39 weeks is not generally recommended for IDMs.\nAfter the baby is born:\nThe baby's blood sugar will be checked within the first hour or two after birth, and rechecked regularly until it is consistently normal."}

High bilirubin levels are treated with light therapy (phototherapy).\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn most cases, an infant's symptoms go away within hours, days, or a few weeks."}
