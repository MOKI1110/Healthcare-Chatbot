Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAspirin overdose\nAspirin overdose\nAspirin is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) used to relieve mild to moderate aches and pains, swelling, and fever.\nAspirin overdose occurs when someone accidentally or intentionally takes more than the recommended amount of this medicine. This can happen in two ways:\nIf a person takes a very large dose of aspirin at one time, it is called an acute overdose.\nIf a normal daily dose of aspirin builds up in the body over time and causes symptoms, it is called a chronic overdose. This may happen if your kidneys do not work correctly or when you are dehydrated. Chronic overdoses are usually seen in older people during hot weather.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual\noverdose\n."}

In chronic overdose a lower level of aspirin in the body can result in serious illness. Much lower levels can affect children.\nIf treatment is delayed or the overdose is large enough, symptoms will continue to get worse. Breathing becomes extremely fast or may stop. Seizures, high fevers, or death may occur.\nHow well you do depends greatly on how much aspirin your body has absorbed and how much is flowing through your blood. If you take a large amount of aspirin but come quickly to the emergency room, treatments may help keep your blood levels of aspirin very low. If you do not get to the emergency room fast enough, the level of aspirin in your blood can become dangerously high.\nAlternative Names\nAcetylsalicylic acid overdose\nReferences\nAronson JK.
