It may involve one or many of the triangle-shaped areas of gum between teeth. These sections are called papillae.\nOccasionally, the gums swell enough to block the teeth completely.\nCauses\nSwollen gums may be caused by:\nInflamed gums (\ngingivitis\n)\nInfection by a virus or fungus\nMalnutrition\nPoorly fitting dentures or other dental appliances\nPregnancy\nSensitivity to toothpaste or mouthwash\nScurvy\nSide effect of a medicine\nFood debris\nHome Care\nEat a well-balanced diet that includes fruits and vegetables. Avoid sugary foods and drinks.\nAvoid foods such as popcorn and chips that can lodge under the gums and cause swelling.\nAvoid things that can irritate your gums such as mouthwashes, alcohol, and tobacco. Change your toothpaste brand and stop using mouthwashes if sensitivity to these dental products is causing your swollen gums.\nBrush and floss your teeth regularly."}
