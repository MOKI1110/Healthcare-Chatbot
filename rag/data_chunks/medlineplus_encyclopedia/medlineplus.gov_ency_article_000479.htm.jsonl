The medical name of this condition is hypokalemia.\nCauses\nPotassium is an\nelectrolyte\n(mineral). It is needed for cells to function properly. You get potassium through food. The kidneys remove excess potassium through the urinary system to keep a proper balance of the mineral in the body.\nCommon causes of low blood potassium include:\nMedicines, such as diuretics (water pills), certain antibiotics (amphotericin B, chloroquine at toxic levels)\nDiarrhea or vomiting\nEating disorders (such as\nbulimia\n)\nHyperaldosteronism\nLaxative overuse, which can cause diarrhea\nChronic kidney disease\nLow magnesium level\nSweating\nGenetic disorders, such as\nhypokalemic periodic paralysis\n,\nBartter syndrome\nSymptoms\nA small drop in the blood potassium level often does not cause symptoms or causes mild to moderate symptoms, which may include:\nConstipation\nFeeling of skipped heart beats or\npalpitations\nFatigue\nMuscle damage\nMuscle we"}

This can cause you to feel lightheaded or faint. A very low blood potassium level can even cause your heart to stop.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will order a blood test to check your\npotassium level\n. Normal range is 3.7 to 5.2 mEq/L (3.7 to 5.2 mmol/L).\nOther blood tests may be ordered to check levels of:\nGlucose, magnesium, calcium, sodium, phosphorous\nThyroid hormone\nAldosterone\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) to check the heart may also be done.\nTreatment\nIf your condition is mild, your provider will likely prescribe oral potassium pills. If your condition is severe, you may need to get potassium through a vein (IV).\nIf you need diuretics, your provider may:\nSwitch you to a form that keeps potassium in the body."}

In severe cases, without proper treatment, a severe drop in the blood potassium level can lead to serious heart rhythm problems that can be fatal.\nPossible Complications\nIn severe cases, life-threatening paralysis may develop, such as with hypokalemic periodic paralysis.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall your provider right away if you have been vomiting or have had excessive diarrhea, or if you are taking diuretics and have symptoms of hypokalemia.\nAlternative Names\nPotassium - low; Low blood potassium; Hypokalemia\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nMount DB.
