An active lifestyle and exercise routine, along with eating well, is the best way to stay healthy.\nEating a good diet can help provide the energy you need to finish a race, or just enjoy a casual sport or activity. You are more likely to be tired and perform poorly during sports when you do not get enough:\nCalories\nCarbohydrates\nFluids\nIron, vitamins, and other minerals\nProtein\nRecommendations\nThe ideal diet for an athlete is not very different from the diet recommended for any healthy person.\nHowever, the amount of each food group you need will depend on:\nThe type of sport\nThe amount of training you do\nThe amount of time you spend doing the activity or exercise\nPeople tend to overestimate the amount of calories they burn per workout so it is important to avoid taking in more energy than you expend exercising.\nTo help you perform better, avoid exercising on an empty stomach."}

Everyone is different, so you will need to learn:\nHow long before exercising is best for you to eat\nHow much food is the right amount for you\nCARBOHYDRATES\nCarbohydrates are needed to provide energy during exercise. Carbohydrates are stored mostly in the muscles and liver.\nComplex carbohydrates are found in foods such as pasta, bagels, whole grain breads, and rice. They provide energy,\nfiber\n, vitamins, and minerals. These foods are low in fat.\nSimple sugars\n, such as soft drinks, jams and jellies, and candy provide a lot of calories, but they do not provide vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients.\nWhat matters most is the total amount of carbohydrates you eat each day. Approximately half of your calories should come from carbohydrates.\nIt's beneficial to eat carbohydrates before you exercise if you will be exercising for more than 1 hour. You might have a glass of fruit juice, a cup (245 grams) of yogurt, or an English muffin with jelly."}

You might have a glass of fruit juice, a cup (245 grams) of yogurt, or an English muffin with jelly. Limit the amount of fat you consume in the hour before an athletic event.\nYou also need carbohydrates during exercise if you will be doing more than an hour of intense aerobic exercise. You can satisfy this need by having:\nFive to ten ounces (150 to 300 milliliters) of a sports drink every 15 to 20 minutes\nTwo to three handfuls of pretzels\nOne-half to two-thirds cup (40 to 55 grams) of low-fat granola\nAfter exercise, you need to eat carbohydrates to rebuild the stores of energy in your muscles if you are working out heavily.\nPeople who exercise or train for more than 90 minutes should eat or drink more carbohydrates, possibly with protein, 2 hours later. Try a sports bar, trail mix with nuts, or yogurt and granola\nFor workouts lasting less than 60 minutes, water is most often all that is needed.\nPROTEIN\nProtein is important for muscle growth and to repair body tissues."}

Protein can also be used by the body for energy, but only after carbohydrate stores have been used up.\nBut it is also a myth that a high-protein diet will promote muscle growth.\nOnly strength training and exercise will change muscle.\nAthletes, even body builders, need only a little bit of extra protein to support muscle growth. Athletes can easily meet this increased need by eating more total calories (eating more food).\nMost Americans already eat almost twice as much protein as they need for muscle development."}

Too much protein in the diet:\nWill be stored as increased body fat\nCan increase the chance for\ndehydration\n(not enough fluids in the body)\nCan lead to loss of calcium\nCan put an added burden on the kidneys\nOften, people who focus on eating extra protein may not get enough carbohydrates, which are the most important source of energy during exercise.\nAmino acid supplements and eating a lot of protein are not recommended.\nWATER AND OTHER FLUIDS\nWater is the most important, yet overlooked, nutrient for athletes. Water and fluids are essential to keep the body hydrated and at the right temperature. Your body can lose several liters of sweat in an hour of vigorous exercise.\nClear urine is a good sign that you have fully rehydrated. Some ideas for keeping enough fluids in the body include:\nMake sure you drink plenty of fluids with every meal, whether or not you will be exercising.\nDrink about 16 ounces (2 cups) or 480 milliliters of water 2 hours before a workout."}

Water is best for the first hour. Switching to an energy drink after the first hour will help you get enough\nelectrolytes\n.\nDrink even when you no longer feel thirsty.\nPouring water over your head might feel good, but it will not get fluids into your body.\nOffer children water often during sports activities. They do not respond to\nthirst\nas well as adults.\nTeenagers and adults should replace any body weight lost during exercise with an equal amount of fluids. For every pound (450 grams) you lose while exercising, you should drink 16 to 24 ounces (480 to 720 milliliters) or 2 to 3 cups of fluid within the next 6 hours.\nACHIEVING DESIRED WEIGHTS FOR COMPETITIVE PURPOSES\nChanging your body weight to improve performance must be done safely, or it may do more harm than good."}

It is important to set\nrealistic body weight goals\n.\nYoung athletes who are trying to lose weight should work with a registered dietitian.
