Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBicuspid aortic valve\nBicuspid aortic valve\nA bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is an aortic valve that only has two leaflets, instead of three.\nThe aortic valve regulates blood flow from the heart into the aorta. The aorta is the major blood vessel that brings oxygen-rich blood to the body.\nCauses\nThe aortic valve allows oxygen-rich blood to flow from the heart to the aorta. It prevents the blood from flowing back from the aorta into the heart when the pumping chamber relaxes.\nBAV is present at birth (congenital). An abnormal aortic valve develops during the early weeks of pregnancy, when the baby's heart is developing. The cause of this problem is unclear, but it is the most common\ncongenital heart defect\n. BAV often runs in families.\nA BAV may not be completely effective at stopping blood from leaking back into the heart. This leakage is called\naortic regurgitation\n. The aortic valve may also become stiff and not open up. This is called\naortic stenosis\n, which causes the heart to pump harder than usual to get blood through the valve."}

The aortic valve may also become stiff and not open up. This is called\naortic stenosis\n, which causes the heart to pump harder than usual to get blood through the valve. The aorta may become enlarged with this condition.\nBAV is more common among males than females.\nA BAV often exists in babies with\ncoarctation of the aorta\n(narrowing of the aorta). BAV is also seen in diseases in which there is a blockage to blood flow on the left side of the heart.\nSymptoms\nMost of the time, BAV is not diagnosed in infants or children because it causes no symptoms. However, the abnormal valve can leak or become narrow over time.\nSymptoms of such complications may include:\nBaby or child tires easily\nChest pain\nDifficulty breathing\nRapid and irregular heartbeat (\npalpitations\n)\nLoss of consciousness (\nfainting\n)\nPale skin (\npallor\n)\nIf a baby has other congenital heart problems, they may cause symptoms that will lead to the discovery of a BAV.\nExams and Tests\nDuring an exam, your health care provider may find signs of a BAV including:\nEnlarged heart\nHeart murmur\nWeak pulse in the wrists and ankles\nTests that may be ordered include:\nMRI\n, which provides a detailed image"}

A fine tube (catheter) is directed to the heart and into the narrow opening of the aortic valve. A balloon attached to the end of the tube is inflated to make the opening of the valve larger.\nIn adults, when a bicuspid valve becomes very leaky or very narrowed, it may need to be replaced. This used to be possible only with open heart surgery, but can now sometimes be done via catheters.\nSometimes the aorta may also need to be repaired if it has become too wide or is too narrow.\nMedicine may be needed to relieve symptoms or prevent complications. Medicines may include:\nMedicines that lower the workload on the heart (beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors)\nMedicines that make the heart muscle pump harder (inotropic agents)\nWater pills (diuretics)\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well the person does depends on the presence and severity of complications of BAV.\nThe presence of other physical problems at birth also can affect how well a person does.\nMost babies with this condition have no symptoms, and the problem is not diagnosed until they are adults."}
