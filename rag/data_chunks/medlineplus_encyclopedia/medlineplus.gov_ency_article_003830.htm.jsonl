Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMIBG scintiscan\nMIBG scintiscan\nAn MIBG scintiscan is a type of imaging test. It uses a radioactive substance called a tracer injected into your body. A subsequent scan can find or confirm the presence of\npheochromocytoma\nand\nneuroblastoma\n. These are types of tumors that affect nerve tissue.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA radioisotope (MIBG, iodine-131-meta-iodobenzylguanidine, or iodine-123-meta-iodobenzylguanidine) is injected into a vein. This compound attaches to specific tumor cells.\nYou will have the scan later that day or the next day. For this part of the test, you lie on a table under the arm of the scanner. Your abdomen is scanned. You may need to return for repeated scans for 1 to 3 days. Each scan takes 1 to 2 hours.\nBefore or during the test, you may be given an iodine mixture. This prevents your thyroid gland from absorbing too much of the radioactive substance.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will need to sign an informed consent form. You will be asked to wear a hospital gown or loose-fitting clothes."}

You will be asked to wear a hospital gown or loose-fitting clothes. You will need to remove jewelry or metal objects before each scan. Many drugs interfere with the test. Ask your health care provider which of your regular medicines you may need to stop taking before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will feel a sharp needle prick when the material is injected. The table may be cold or hard. You must lie still during the scan.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to help diagnose pheochromocytoma. It is done when an\nabdominal CT scan\nor an\nabdominal MRI scan\ndoes not give a definite answer. It is also used to help diagnose neuroblastoma and can be used for carcinoid tumors.\nNormal Results\nThere are no signs of a tumor.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may indicate:\nPheochromocytoma\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) II\nCarcinoid tumor\nNeuroblastoma\nRisks\nThere is some exposure to radiation from the radioisotope. The radiation from this radioisotope is higher than from many others."}

The radiation from this radioisotope is higher than from many others. You may need to take extra precautions for a few days after the test. Your provider will tell you what actions to take.\nBefore or during the test, you may be given an iodine solution. This will keep your thyroid gland from absorbing too much iodine. Usually people take potassium iodide for 1 day prior and 6 days after. This blocks the thyroid from taking up the MIBG.\nThis test should not be done on pregnant women. The radiation can pose danger to the unborn baby.\nAlternative Names\nAdrenal medullary imaging; Meta-iodobenzylguanidine scintiscan; Pheochromocytoma - MIBG; Neuroblastoma - MIBG; Carcinoid MIBG\nImages\nMIBG injection\nReferences\nCohen DL, Fishbein L.
