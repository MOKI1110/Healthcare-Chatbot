Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPleural needle biopsy\nPleural needle biopsy\nPleural biopsy is a procedure to remove a sample of the pleura. This is the thin tissue that lines the chest cavity and surrounds the lungs. The biopsy is done to check the pleura for disease or infection.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis test may be done in the hospital. It may also be done at a clinic or health care provider's office.\nThe procedure involves the following:\nYou will be sitting up during the procedure.\nYour provider cleanses the skin at the biopsy site.\nA numbing drug (anesthetic) is injected through the skin and into the lining of the lungs and chest wall (pleural membrane).\nA larger, hollow needle is then placed gently through the skin into the chest cavity. Sometimes, your provider uses\nultrasound\nor\nCT\nimaging to guide the needle.\nA smaller cutting needle inside the hollow one is used to collect tissue samples."}

Sometimes, your provider uses\nultrasound\nor\nCT\nimaging to guide the needle.\nA smaller cutting needle inside the hollow one is used to collect tissue samples. During this part of the procedure, you are asked to sing, hum, or say \"eee.\" This helps prevent air from getting into the chest cavity, which can cause the lung to collapse (\npneumothorax\n). Usually, 3 or more biopsy samples are taken.\nWhen the test is finished, a bandage is placed over the biopsy site.\nIn recent years, pleural biopsy is most often done using a fiberoptic scope. The scope allows your provider to view the area of the pleura from which the biopsies are taken.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will have blood tests before the biopsy. You will likely have a\nchest x-ray\n.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the local anesthetic is injected, you may feel a brief prick and a burning sensation. When the biopsy needle is inserted, you may feel pressure. As the needle is being removed, you may feel tugging.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nPleural biopsy is often done to find the cause of a collection of fluid around the lung (\npleural effusion\n) or other abnormality of the pleural membrane."}

This usually gets better on its own. Sometimes, a chest tube is needed to drain the air and expand the lung.\nThere is also a chance of excessive blood loss.\nConsiderations\nIf a closed pleural biopsy is not enough to make a diagnosis, you may need a surgical biopsy of the pleura."}
