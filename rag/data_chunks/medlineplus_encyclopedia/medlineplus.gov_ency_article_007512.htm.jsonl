Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nVertebroplasty\nVertebroplasty\nVertebroplasty is often an outpatient procedure used to treat painful compression fractures in the spine. In a compression fracture, all or part of a spine bone collapses.\nDescription\nVertebroplasty is done in a hospital or outpatient surgery center.\nYou may have local anesthesia (awake and unable to feel pain). You will likely also receive medicine to help you relax and feel sleepy.\nYou may receive general anesthesia. You will be asleep and unable to feel pain.\nYou will lie face down on a table. The surgeon cleans the area of your back and applies medicine to numb the area.\nA needle is placed through the skin and into the spine bone. Real-time x-ray images are used to guide the surgeon to the correct area in your lower back.\nCement is then injected into the broken spine bone to make sure it does not collapse again.\nThis procedure is similar to\nkyphoplasty\n."}

However, kyphoplasty involves the use of a balloon that is inflated at the end of the needle to create space between the vertebrae.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nA common cause of compression fractures of the spine is thinning of your bones, or osteoporosis. Your health care provider may recommend this procedure if you have severe and disabling pain for 2 months or more after a compression fracture that does not get better with bed rest, pain medicines, and physical therapy.\nYour provider may also recommend this procedure if you have a painful compression fracture of the spine due to:\nCancer, including multiple myeloma\nInjury that caused broken bones in the spine\nRisks\nVertebroplasty is generally safe. Complications may include:\nBleeding.\nInfection.\nBlood clots.\nAllergic reactions to medicines.\nBreathing or heart problems if you have general anesthesia.\nNerve injuries.\nLeakage of the bone cement into surrounding areas (this can cause pain if it affects the spinal cord or nerves)."}

This problem is more common with this procedure than kyphoplasty. You may need spine surgery to remove the leakage if it occurs.\nBefore the Procedure\nAlways tell your surgeon:\nIf you could be pregnant\nWhat medicines you are taking, including those you bought without a prescription\nIf you have been drinking a lot of alcohol\nDuring the days before the surgery:\nYou may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, coumadin (Warfarin), and any other medicines that make it hard for your blood to clot several days before.\nAsk which medicines you should still take on the day of the surgery.\nIf you smoke, try to stop.\nOn the day of the surgery:\nYou will most often be told not to drink or eat anything for several hours before surgery.\nTake the medicines your provider told you to take with a small sip of water.\nYou will be told when to arrive.\nAfter the Procedure\nYou will probably go home on the same day of surgery."}

You should not drive, unless your surgeon says it is OK.\nAfter the procedure:\nYou should be able to walk. However, it's best to stay in bed for the first 24 hours, except to use the bathroom.\nAfter 24 hours, slowly return to your regular activities.\nAvoid heavy lifting and strenuous activities for at least 6 weeks.\nApply ice to the wound area if you have pain where the needle was inserted.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPeople who have this procedure often have less pain and a better quality of life after the surgery.\nThey most often need fewer pain medicines, and can move better than before.\nAlternative Names\nOsteoporosis - vertebroplasty\nImages\nVertebroplasty - series\nReferences\nSavage JW, Anderson PA.
