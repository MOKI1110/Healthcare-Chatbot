This type of infection is known as sexually transmitted infection (STI).\nCauses\nChlamydia is caused by the bacteria\nChlamydia trachomatis.\nBoth males and females may have this infection. However, they may not have symptoms. As a result, you may become infected or pass the infection to your partner without knowing it.\nYou are more likely to become infected with chlamydia if you:\nHave sex without wearing a male or female condom\nHave more than one sexual partner\nUse drugs or alcohol and then have sex\nHave been infected with chlamydia before\nSymptoms\nMany women do not have symptoms."}

But some have:\nBurning when they urinate\nPain in the lower part of the belly, possibly with fever\nPainful intercourse\nVaginal discharge\nor bleeding after intercourse\nRectal pain\nExam and Tests\nIf you have symptoms of a chlamydia infection, your health care provider will collect a sample for culture or a test called nucleic acid amplification.\nIn the past, testing required a pelvic exam by a health care provider. Today, very accurate tests can be done on urine samples. Vaginal swabs, which a woman collects herself, can also be tested. Results take 1 to 2 days to come back. Your provider may also check you for other types of STIs. The most common STIs are:\nGonorrhea\nHIV/AIDS\nSyphilis\nHepatitis\nHerpes\nEven if you have no symptoms, you may need a chlamydia test if you:\nAre 24 years old or younger and are sexually active (get tested every year)\nHave a new sexual partner, more than one partner or a partner with an STI\nTreatment\nChlamydia can be treated with an antibiotic."}

Some of these are safe to take if you are pregnant. Common side effects include:\nNausea\nUpset stomach\nDiarrhea\nBoth you and your partner need to take the antibiotics.\nFinish all of them, even if you feel better and still have some left.\nAll of your sexual partners should be treated. Have them take the medicines even if they do not have symptoms. This will prevent you from passing the STIs back and forth.\nYou and your partner are asked to abstain from sexual intercourse during the time of treatment.\nGonorrhea\noften occurs with chlamydia. Therefore, treatment for gonorrhea is often given at the same time.\nSafer sex practices are needed to prevent becoming infected with chlamydia or spreading it to others.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAntibiotic treatment almost always works. You and your partner should take the medicines as directed.\nIf chlamydia spreads into your uterus and fallopian tubes, it can cause scarring. Scarring can make it harder for you to get pregnant."}
