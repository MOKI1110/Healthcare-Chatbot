They may occur with:\nAn abnormal response to increased levels of the female hormone estrogen\nChronic\ninflammation\nClogged blood vessels in the cervix\nCervical polyps are common. They are often found in women over age 40 who have had many children. Polyps are rare in young women who have not started having their period (menstruation).\nSymptoms\nPolyps do not always cause symptoms. When symptoms are present, they may include:\nVery heavy menstrual periods\nVaginal bleeding after douching or intercourse\nAbnormal vaginal bleeding\nafter\nmenopause\nor between periods\nWhite or yellow mucus (leukorrhea)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a pelvic exam. Some smooth, red or purple fingerlike growths will be seen on the cervix.\nMost often, the provider will remove the polyp with a gentle tug and send it for testing (biopsy)."}

Most of the time, the biopsy will show cells that are consistent with a benign polyp. Rarely, there may be abnormal, precancerous, or cancer cells in a polyp.\nTreatment\nThe provider can remove polyps during a simple outpatient procedure.\nSmaller polyps may be removed with gentle twisting.\nElectrocautery may be needed to remove larger polyps.\nThe removed polyp tissue should be sent to a lab for further tests.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost polyps are not cancerous (benign) and are easy to remove. Polyps do not grow back most of the time. Women who have polyps are at risk of growing more polyps.\nPossible Complications\nThere may be bleeding and slight cramping for a few days after removal of a polyp. Some cervical cancers may first appear as a polyp."}
