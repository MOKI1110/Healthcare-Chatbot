Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLung needle biopsy\nLung needle biopsy\nA lung needle biopsy is a method to remove a piece of lung tissue for examination. If it is done through the wall of your chest, it is called a transthoracic lung biopsy.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe procedure usually takes 30 to 60 minutes. The biopsy is done in the following way:\nchest x-ray\nor\nchest CT scan\nmay be used to find the exact spot for the biopsy. If the biopsy is done using a CT scan, you may be lying down during the exam.\nYou may be given a sedative to relax you.\nYou sit with your arms resting forward on a table. Your skin where the biopsy needle is inserted is scrubbed.\nA local painkilling medicine (anesthetic) is injected.\nYour surgeon makes a small cut in your skin.\nThe biopsy needle is inserted into the abnormal tissue,\ntumor\n, or lung tissue. A small piece of tissue is removed with the needle.\nThe needle is removed. Pressure is placed on the site. Once bleeding has stopped, a bandage is applied.\nA chest x-ray is taken right after the biopsy.\nThe biopsy sample is sent to the lab."}

Pressure is placed on the site. Once bleeding has stopped, a bandage is applied.\nA chest x-ray is taken right after the biopsy.\nThe biopsy sample is sent to the lab. Analysis usually takes a few days.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou should not eat for 6 to 12 hours before the test. Follow instructions about not taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as aspirin, ibuprofen, or blood thinners such as warfarin for a period of time before the procedure. Check with your health care provider before changing or stopping any medicines.\nBefore a needle biopsy of the lung, a chest x-ray or chest CT scan may be performed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will receive an injection of anesthetic before the biopsy. This injection will sting for a moment. You will feel pressure and a brief, sharp pain when the biopsy needle touches the lung.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA lung needle biopsy is done when there is an abnormal condition near the surface of the lung, in the lung itself, or on the chest wall. Most often, it is done to check for cancer. The biopsy is usually done after abnormalities appear on a chest x-ray or CT scan."}

Most often, it is done to check for cancer. The biopsy is usually done after abnormalities appear on a chest x-ray or CT scan. Sometimes your provider might recommend a\nbronchoscopy\ninstead of lung needle biopsy depending on the location of the abnormality.\nNormal Results\nIn a normal test, the tissues are normal and there is no cancer or growth of bacteria, viruses, or fungi if a culture is performed.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result may be due to any of the following:\nBacterial, viral, or fungal lung infection\nCancerous cells (\nlung cancer\n,\nmesothelioma\n)\nPneumonia\nBenign growth\nRisks\nSometimes, a collapsed lung (\npneumothorax\n) occurs after this test. A chest x-ray will be done after the biopsy to check for this. The risk is higher if you have certain lung diseases such as\nemphysema\n. Usually, a collapsed lung after a biopsy does not need treatment."}

But if the pneumothorax is large, there is preexisting lung disease or it does not improve, a chest tube is inserted to expand your lung.\nIn rare cases, pneumothorax can be life threatening if air escapes from the lung, gets trapped in the chest, and presses on the rest of your lungs or heart.\nWhenever a biopsy is done, there is a risk of too much bleeding (hemorrhage). Some bleeding is common, and a provider will monitor the amount of bleeding."}
