Blood sugar at or below this level can be harmful.\nThe medical name of low blood sugar is hypoglycemia.\nCauses\nInsulin is a hormone made by the pancreas. Insulin is needed to move glucose into cells where it is stored or used for energy. Without enough insulin, glucose builds up in the blood instead of going into the cells. This leads to symptoms of\ndiabetes\n.\nLow blood sugar occurs due to any of the following:\nYour body's glucose is used up too quickly\nGlucose production by the body is too low or it is released into the bloodstream too slowly\nToo much insulin is in the bloodstream\nLow blood sugar is common in people with diabetes who are taking insulin or certain other medicines to control their diabetes."}

However, many other diabetes medicines do not cause low blood sugar.\nExercise can also lead to low blood sugar in people taking insulin to treat their diabetes.\nBabies born to mothers with diabetes may have severe drops in blood sugar right after birth.\nIn people who do not have diabetes, low blood sugar may be caused by:\nDrinking alcohol\nInsulinoma\n, which is a rare tumor in the pancreas that produces too much insulin\nLack of a hormone, such as cortisol, growth hormone, or thyroid hormone\nSevere heart, kidney, or liver failure\nInfection that affects the whole body (\nsepsis\n)\nSome types of weight-loss surgery (usually 5 or more years after the surgery)\nMedicines not used to treat diabetes (certain antibiotics or heart medicines)\nSymptoms\nSymptoms you may have when your blood sugar gets too low include:\nDouble vision\nor blurry vision\nFast or pounding heartbeat\nFeeling cranky or acting aggressive\nFeeling nervous\nHeadache\nHunger\nSeizures\nShaking or trembling\nSweating\nTingling or numbness"}

Not everybody feels low blood sugar symptoms the same way.\nSome symptoms, like hunger or sweating, occur when blood sugar is only slightly low. More severe symptoms, such as unclear thinking or seizure, may occur when the blood sugar is much lower (less than 54 mg/dL or 3.0 mmol/L).\nEven if you do not have symptoms, your blood sugar could still be too low (called hypoglycemic unawareness). You may not even know you have low blood sugar until you faint, have a seizure, or go into a\ncoma\n. If you have diabetes, ask your health care provider if wearing a continuous glucose monitor can help you detect when your blood sugar is getting too low to help prevent a medical emergency."}

Talk to your provider if you're not sure about the causes and symptoms of low blood sugar.\nExams and Tests\nWhen you have low blood sugar, the reading will be lower than 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) on your glucose monitor.\nYour provider may ask you to wear a small monitor that measures your blood sugar every 5 minutes (continuous glucose monitor). The device is typically worn for 3 to 14 days."}

It is also important to try and identify the reason why the blood sugar was low to prevent another low blood sugar episode from happening.\nIf you have diabetes, it is important that your provider teaches you how to\ntreat yourself for low blood sugar\n. Treatment may include:\nDrinking juice\nEating food\nTaking glucose tablets\nOr you may have been told to give yourself a shot of glucagon."}

It can cause seizures and brain damage. Severe low blood sugar that causes you to become unconscious is called hypoglycemic or insulin shock.\nEven one episode of severe low blood sugar may make it less likely for you to have symptoms that allow you to recognize another episode of low blood sugar.
