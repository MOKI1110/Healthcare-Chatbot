The medical name for polio is poliomyelitis.\nCauses\nPolio is a disease caused by infection with the poliovirus. The virus spreads by:\nDirect person-to-person contact\nContact with infected mucus or phlegm from the nose or mouth\nContact with infected feces\nThe virus enters through the mouth and nose, multiplies in the throat and intestinal tract, and then is absorbed and spread through the blood and\nlymph system\n. The time from being infected with the virus to developing symptoms of disease (incubation) ranges from 5 to 35 days (average 7 to 14 days). Most people do not develop symptoms.\nRisks factors include:\nLack of immunization against polio\nTravel to an area that has had a polio outbreak\nAs a result of a global vaccination campaign over the past 25 years, polio has largely been eliminated. The disease still exists in some countries (such as Pakistan and Afghanistan), with outbreaks occurring in groups of people who have not been vaccinated."}

The disease still exists in some countries (such as Pakistan and Afghanistan), with outbreaks occurring in groups of people who have not been vaccinated. For an updated list of these countries, visit the website:\nwww.polioeradication.org\n.\nSymptoms\nThere are four basic patterns of polio infection:\nInapparent infection\nAbortive disease\nNonparalytic\nParalytic\nINAPPARENT INFECTION\nMost people infected with poliovirus have inapparent infections. They usually do not have symptoms. The only way to know if someone has the infection is by performing a blood test or other tests to find the virus in the stool or throat.\nABORTIVE DISEASE\nPeople who have abortive disease develop symptoms about 1 to 2 weeks after getting infected with the virus. Symptoms may include:\nFever\nfor 2 to 3 days\nGeneral discomfort or uneasiness (\nmalaise\n)\nHeadache\nSore throat\nVomiting\nLoss of appetite\nBelly pain\nThese symptoms last up to 5 days and people recover completely. They have no signs of\nnervous system\nproblems.\nNONPARALYTIC POLIO\nPeople with this form of polio have signs of abortive polio and their symptoms are more intense."}

Symptoms include those of abortive and nonparalytic polio. Other symptoms may include:\nMuscle weakness, paralysis, loss of muscle tissue\nBreathing that is weak\nDifficulty swallowing\nDrooling\nHoarse voice\nSevere constipation and urinary problems\nExams and Tests\nDuring a physical examination, your health care provider may find:\nAbnormal reflexes\nBack stiffness\nDifficulty lifting your head or legs when lying flat on your back\nStiff neck\nTrouble bending your neck\nTests that may be done include:\nCultures of throat washings, stools, or spinal fluid\nSpinal tap and examination of the spinal fluid (\nCSF examination\n) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\nTest for levels of\nantibodies\nto"}

There is no specific treatment for this infection.\nPeople with severe cases may need lifesaving measures, such as help with breathing.\nSymptoms are treated based on how severe they are. Treatment may include:\nAntibiotics for\nurinary tract infections\nMoist heat (heating pads, warm towels) to reduce muscle pain and spasms\nPainkillers to reduce headache, muscle pain, and spasms (narcotics are not usually given because they increase the risk of breathing trouble)\nPhysical therapy, braces or corrective shoes, or orthopedic surgery to help recover muscle strength and function\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook depends on the form of the disease and the body area affected."}

Infection that is located high in the spinal cord or in the brain increases the risk of breathing problems.\nPossible Complications\nHealth problems that may result from polio include:\nAspiration pneumonia\nCor pulmonale\n(a form of heart failure found on the right side of the circulation system)\nLack of movement\nLung problems\nMyocarditis\n(inflammation of the heart muscle)\nParalytic ileus\n(loss of intestinal function)\nPermanent muscle paralysis, disability, deformity\nPulmonary edema\n(abnormal buildup of fluid in the lungs)\nShock\nUrinary tract infections\nPost-polio syndrome is a complication that develops in some people, usually 30 or more years after they are first infected.
