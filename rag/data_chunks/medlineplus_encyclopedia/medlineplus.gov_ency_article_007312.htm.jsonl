Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPneumothorax - infants\nPneumothorax - infants\nPneumothorax\nis the collection of air or gas in the space inside the chest around the lungs. This leads to lung collapse.\nThis article discusses pneumothorax in infants.\nCauses\nA pneumothorax occurs when some of the tiny air sacs (alveoli) in a baby's lung become overinflated and burst. This causes air to leak into the space between the lung and chest wall (pleural space).\nThe most common cause of pneumothorax is\nrespiratory distress syndrome\n. This is a condition that occurs in babies who are born too early (premature).\nThe baby's lungs lack the slippery substance (surfactant) that helps them stay open (inflated). Therefore, the tiny air sacs are not able to expand as easily.\nIf the baby needs a breathing machine (mechanical ventilator), extra pressure on the baby's lungs, from the machine can sometimes burst the air sacs.\nMeconium aspiration syndrome\nis another cause of pneumothorax in newborns.\nBefore or during birth, the baby may breathe in the first bowel movement, called meconium."}

This may obstruct the airways and cause breathing problems.\nOther causes include pneumonia (infection of the lung) or underdeveloped lung tissue.\nLess commonly, otherwise healthy infants can develop an air leak when they take the first few breaths after birth. This occurs because of the pressure needed to expand the lungs for the first time. There may be genetic factors which contribute to this problem.\nSymptoms\nMany infants with pneumothorax do not have symptoms. When symptoms do occur, they can include:\nBluish skin color (\ncyanosis\n)\nFast breathing\nFlaring of the nostrils\nGrunting with breathing\nIrritability\nRestlessness\nUse of additional chest and abdominal muscles to aid breathing (retractions)\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider may have difficulty hearing breath sounds when listening to the infant's lungs with a stethoscope."}

The heart or lung sounds may seem as if they are coming from a different part of the chest than is normal.\nTests for pneumothorax include:\nChest x-ray\nLight probe placed against the baby's chest, also known as \"transillumination\" (pockets of air may show up as lighter areas)\nTreatment\nBabies without symptoms may not need treatment. The health care team will monitor your baby's breathing, heart rate, oxygen level, and skin color. Supplemental oxygen will be provided if needed.\nIf your baby is having symptoms, the provider will place a needle and/or a thin tube called a catheter into the baby's chest to remove the air that has leaked into the chest space.\nSince treatment will also depend on the lung issues that led to the pneumothorax, it may last for days to weeks.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSome air leaks will go away within a few days without treatment."}

Infants who have the air removed with a needle or catheter often do well after treatment if there are no other lung problems.\nPossible Complications\nAs air builds up in the chest, it can push the heart toward the other side of the chest. This puts pressure on both the lung that hasn't collapsed and the heart. This condition is called tension pneumothorax. It is a medical emergency because it can affect heart and lung function.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nA pneumothorax is often discovered shortly after birth. Contact your provider if your infant has symptoms of pneumothorax.\nPrevention\nThe providers in the newborn intensive care unit (NICU) should watch your infant carefully for signs of an air leak.\nAlternative Names\nPulmonary air leak; Pneumothorax - neonatal\nImages\nPneumothorax\nReferences\nCrowley MA.
