The thyroid gland is located  at the front of  the neck, just above where your collarbones meet in the middle.\nCauses\nThyroid nodules are caused by an overgrowth of cells in the thyroid gland. These growths can be:\nNot cancer (\nbenign\n), thyroid cancer (malignant), or very rarely, other cancers or infections\nFluid-filled (cysts)\nOne nodule or a group of small nodules\nProducing thyroid hormones (hot nodule) or not making thyroid hormones (cold nodule)\nThyroid nodules are very common. They occur more often in women than in men. A person's chance of getting  a thyroid nodule increases with age.\nOnly a few thyroid nodules are due to\nthyroid cancer\n."}

Health care providers often find thyroid nodules during a routine physical exam or imaging tests that are done for another reason.

This reduces the size and activity of the nodule. Pregnant women or women who are still breastfeeding are not given this treatment.\nBoth surgery to remove thyroid gland tissue and radioactive iodine treatment can cause lifelong\nhypothyroidism\n(underactive thyroid). This condition needs to be treated with thyroid hormone replacement (a daily medicine).\nFor noncancerous nodules that do not cause symptoms and are not growing, the best treatment may be:\nCareful follow-up with a physical exam and\nultrasound\nA thyroid biopsy repeated 6 to 12 months after diagnosis, especially if the nodule has grown\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nNoncancerous thyroid nodules are not life threatening.
