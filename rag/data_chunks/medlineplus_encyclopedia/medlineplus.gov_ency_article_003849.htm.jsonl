Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTongue biopsy\nTongue biopsy\nA tongue biopsy is a minor surgery that is done to remove a small piece of the tongue. The tissue is then examined under a microscope.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA tongue biopsy can be done using a needle.\nYou will get numbing medicine at the place where the biopsy is to be done.\nThe health care provider will gently insert the needle into the tongue and remove a tiny piece of tissue.\nSome types of tongue biopsies remove a thin slice of tissue. Medicine to numb the area (local anesthetic) will be used. Others are done under general anesthesia, (allowing you to be asleep and pain-free) so that a larger area may be removed and examined.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be told not to eat or drink anything for several hours before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYour tongue is very sensitive so a needle biopsy may be uncomfortable even when numbing medicine is used.\nYour tongue can be tender or sore, and it may feel slightly swollen after the biopsy."}
