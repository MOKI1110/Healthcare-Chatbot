It is caused by an infectious protein (prion) found in contaminated human brain tissue.\nKuru is found among people from New Guinea who practiced a form of cannibalism in which they ate the brains of dead people as part of a funeral ritual. This practice stopped in 1960, but cases of kuru were reported for many years afterward because the disease has a long incubation period. The incubation period is the time it takes for symptoms to appear after being exposed to the agent that causes disease.\nKuru causes brain and nervous system changes similar to\nCreutzfeldt-Jakob disease\n."}

Similar diseases appear in cows as bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), also called mad cow disease.\nThe main risk factor for kuru is eating human brain tissue, which can contain the infectious particles.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of kuru include:\nArm and leg pain\nCoordination problems\nthat become severe\nDifficulty walking\nHeadache\nSwallowing difficulty\nTremors\nand muscle jerks\nDifficulty swallowing and being unable to feed oneself can lead to\nmalnutrition\nor starvation.\nThe average incubation period is 10 to 13 years, but an incubation period of 50 years or longer has also been reported.\nExams and Tests\nA neurologic exam may show changes in coordination and walking ability.\nTreatment\nThere is no known treatment for kuru.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nDeath usually occurs within 1 year after the first sign of symptoms.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nSee your health care provider if you have any walking, swallowing, or coordination problems.
