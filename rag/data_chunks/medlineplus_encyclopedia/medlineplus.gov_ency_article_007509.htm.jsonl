Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBrain natriuretic peptide test\nBrain natriuretic peptide test\nBrain natriuretic peptide (BNP) test is a blood test that measures levels of the protein BNP that is made by your heart and blood vessels. BNP levels are higher than normal when you have heart failure.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. The blood is taken from a vein (\nvenipuncture\n).\nThis test is most often done in the emergency room or hospital. Results take up to 15 minutes. In some hospitals, a finger prick test with rapid results is available.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, you may feel a little pain. Most people feel only a prick or a stinging sensation. Afterward there may be some throbbing or bruising.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou may need this test if you have signs of heart failure. Symptoms include shortness of breath and swelling of your legs or abdomen."}

Symptoms include shortness of breath and swelling of your legs or abdomen. The test helps make sure your symptoms are due to your heart and not your lungs, kidneys, or liver.\nIt is unclear if repeated BNP tests are helpful in guiding treatment in those already diagnosed with heart failure.\nNormal Results\nIn general, results of less than 100 picograms/milliliter (pg/mL) suggest a person does not have heart failure.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nBNP levels go up when the heart cannot pump the way it should.\nA result greater than 100 pg/mL is abnormal. The higher the number, the more likely heart failure is present and the more severe it is.\nSometimes other conditions can cause  high BNP levels."}

These include:\nKidney failure\nPulmonary embolism\nPulmonary hypertension\nSevere infection (sepsis)\nLung problems\nRisks\nRisks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nConsiderations\nA related test, called the N-terminal pro-BNP test, is done in the same way. It provides similar information, but the normal range is different.\nImages\nBlood test\nHeart - front view\nReferences\nBock JL. Cardiac injury, atherosclerosis, and thrombotic disease.
