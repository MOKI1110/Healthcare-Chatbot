It can be caused by many different problems, including:\nChondromalacia of the patella -- the softening and breakdown of the tissue (cartilage) on the underside of the kneecap (patella)\nRunner's knee -- sometimes called patellar tendinitis\nLateral compression syndrome -- the patella tracks more to the outside part of the knee\nQuadriceps tendinitis -- pain and tenderness at the quadriceps tendon attachment to the patella\nPatella maltracking -- instability of the patella on the knee\nPatella arthritis -- cartilage breakdown underneath your kneecap\nCauses\nYour kneecap (patella) sits over the front of your knee joint. As you bend or straighten your knee, the underside of the patella glides over the bones that make up the knee.\nStrong tendons help attach the kneecap to the bones and muscles that surround the knee."}

These tendons are called:\nThe patellar tendon (where the kneecap attaches to the shin bone)\nThe quadriceps tendon (where the thigh muscles attach to the top of the kneecap)\nAnterior knee pain may occur when the kneecap does not move properly and rubs against the lower part of the thigh bone. This may occur because:\nThe kneecap is in an abnormal position (also called poor alignment of the patellofemoral joint).\nThere is tightness or weakness of the muscles on the front and back of your thigh.\nYou are doing too much activity that places extra stress on the kneecap (such as running, jumping or twisting, skiing, or playing soccer).\nYour muscles are not balanced and your core muscles maybe weaker.\nThe groove in the thighbone where the kneecap normally rests is too shallow.\nYou have flat feet.\nYour lower leg alignment is abnormal.\nYour core stability is weak and causes knee malalignment.\nExcess body weight or over activity increases the stress on your kneecap.\nAnterior knee pain is more comm"}

However, a special x-ray view of the kneecap may show signs of arthritis or tilting.\nMRI scans are rarely needed.\nTreatment\nResting the knee for a short period of time and taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin may help relieve pain.\nOther things you can do to relieve anterior knee pain include:\nChange the way you exercise.\nLearn exercises to both strengthen and stretch the quadriceps and hamstring muscles.\nLearn exercises to strengthen your core.\nLose weight (if you are overweight).\nUse special shoe inserts and support devices (orthotics) if you have flat feet.\nTape your knee to"}

During the surgery:\nKneecap cartilage that has been damaged may be removed.\nChanges may be made to the tendons to help the kneecap move more evenly.\nKneecap may be realigned to allow for better joint movement.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAnterior knee pain often improves with a change in activity, exercise therapy, and the use of NSAIDs. Surgery is rarely needed. However, if your knee has symptoms like instability or swelling, then you should see your provider earlier.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of this disorder.\nAlternative Names\nPatellofemoral syndrome; Chondromalacia patella; Runner's knee; Patellar tendinitis; Jumper's knee\nImages\nChondromalacia of the patella\nRunners knee\nReferences\nDeJour D, Saggin PRF, Kuhn VC.
