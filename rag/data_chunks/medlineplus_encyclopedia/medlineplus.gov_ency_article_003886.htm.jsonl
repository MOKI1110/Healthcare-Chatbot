Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nColonoscopy\nColonoscopy\nA colonoscopy is an exam that views the inside of the colon (large intestine) and rectum, using a tool called a colonoscope.\nThe colonoscope has a small camera attached to a flexible tube that can reach the entire length of the colon.\nHow the Test is Performed\nColonoscopy is done most often in a procedure room either at a surgical center or in the outpatient department of a hospital or medical center. This procedure is most often done by a specially trained doctor called a gastroenterologist.\nYou will be asked to change out of your street clothes and wear a hospital gown for the procedure.\nYou will likely be given\nmedicine into a vein (IV) to help you relax\n. You should not feel any pain. You may be awake during the test and may even be able to speak. You will probably not remember anything.\nYou will lie on your left side with your knees drawn up toward your chest.\nThe scope is gently inserted through the anus. It is carefully moved into the lowest part of the large intestine."}

It is carefully moved into the lowest part of the large intestine. The scope is slowly advanced as far as the lowest part of the small intestine.\nAir or carbon dioxide is inserted through the scope to provide a better view. Suction may be used to remove fluid or stool.\nThe doctor gets a better view as the scope is moved back out. So, a more careful exam is done while the scope is being pulled back.\nTissue samples (\nbiopsy\npolyps\nmay be removed using tiny tools inserted through the scope. Photos may be taken using the camera at the end of the scope. If needed, procedures, such as injection, bleeding control, or other techniques, are also done.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour bowel needs to be completely empty and clean for the exam. A problem in your large intestine that needs to be treated may be missed if your intestines are not cleaned out.\nYour provider will give you the steps for cleansing your bowel. This is called bowel preparation."}

This is called bowel preparation. Steps may include:\nUsing enemas\nEating clear liquids only for the day before the test\nTaking laxatives\nYou need to drink plenty of clear liquids for 1 to 3 days before the test. Examples of clear liquids are:\nClear coffee or tea\nFat-free bouillon or broth\nGelatin\nSports drinks without added color\nStrained fruit juices\nWater\nYou may be told to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other blood-thinning medicines for several days before the test. Do not stop without talking to your provider, especially if you've had a heart problem. Many times, aspirin or blood thinners may be continued.\nYou will need to stop taking iron pills or liquids a few days before the test, unless your provider tells you it is OK to continue. Iron can make your stool dark black."}

You may feel brief cramping and gas pains as air is inserted or the scope advances. Passing gas is necessary and should be expected.\nAfter the exam, you may have mild\nabdominal cramping\nand pass a lot of gas. You may also feel bloated and sick to your stomach. These feelings will soon go away.\nYou should be able to go home about one hour after the test. You must plan to have someone take you home after the test because you will be woozy and unable to drive. Your providers will not let you leave until someone arrives to help you.\nWhen you are home, follow\ninstructions\non recovering from the procedure. These may include:\nDrink plenty of liquids."}
