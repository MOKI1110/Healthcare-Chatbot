The urine of people with this condition can smell like maple syrup.\nCauses\nMaple syrup urine disease (MSUD) is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. It is caused by a variant in 1 of 3 genes. People with this condition cannot break down the\namino acids\nleucine, isoleucine, and valine. This leads to a buildup of these chemicals in the blood.\nIn the most severe form, MSUD can damage the brain during times of physical stress (such as infection, fever, or not eating for a long time).\nSome types of MSUD are mild or come and go."}

Even in the mildest form, repeated periods of physical stress can cause\nintellectual  disability\nand high levels of leucine to build up.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of this disorder include:\nComa\nFeeding difficulties\nLethargy\nSeizures\nUrine that smells like maple syrup\nVomiting\nExams and Tests\nThese tests may be done to check for this disorder:\nPlasma amino acid test\nUrine organic acid test\nGenetic testing\nThere will be signs of\nketosis\n(buildup of ketones, a by-product of burning fat for energy) and excess acid in the blood (acidosis).\nTreatment\nWhen the condition is diagnosed, and during episodes, treatment involves eating a protein-free diet. Fluids, sugars, and sometimes fats are given through a vein (IV). Dialysis through your belly or a vein can be done to reduce the level of abnormal substances in your blood.\nLong-term treatment requires a special diet. For infants, the diet includes a formula with low levels of the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine."}

For infants, the diet includes a formula with low levels of the amino acids leucine, isoleucine, and valine. People with this condition must remain on a diet low in these amino acids for life.\nIt is very important to always follow this diet to prevent nervous system (neurological) damage. This requires frequent blood tests and close supervision by a registered dietitian and health care provider, as well as cooperation by parents of children with the condition.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThis disease can be life threatening if untreated.\nEven with dietary treatment, stressful situations and illness can still cause high levels of certain amino acids. Death may occur during these episodes. With strict dietary treatment, children have grown into adulthood and can remain healthy.\nPossible Complications\nThese complications can occur:\nNeurological damage\nComa\nDeath\nIntellectual disability\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have a family history of MSUD and are planning to start a family."}

Also contact your provider right away if you have a newborn who has symptoms of maple syrup urine disease.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling\nis suggested for people who want to have children and who have a family history of maple syrup urine disease. Many states now screen all newborns with blood testing for MSUD.\nIf a screening test shows that your baby may have MSUD, a follow-up blood test for amino acid levels should be done right away to confirm the disease.\nAlternative Names\nMSUD\nReferences\nDietzen DJ, Willrich MAV.
