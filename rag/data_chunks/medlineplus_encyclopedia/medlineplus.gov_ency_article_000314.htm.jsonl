Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSyndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion\nSyndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion\nSyndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) is a condition in which the body makes too much antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is also called vasopressin. This hormone helps the kidneys control the amount of water your body loses through the urine. SIADH causes your body to retain too much water.\nADH is a substance produced naturally in an area of the brain called the\nhypothalamus\n. It is then released by the pituitary gland at the base of the brain.\nCauses\nThere are many reasons why your body may make a lot of ADH."}

Common situations when ADH is released into the blood when it should not be produced (inappropriate) include:\nMedicines, such as certain seizure medicines, antidepressants, cancer medicines, opiates (less often), and heart, diabetes, and blood pressure medicines\nSurgery under general anesthesia\nDisorders of the brain, such as injury, infections, and stroke\nBrain surgery in the region of the hypothalamus\nTuberculosis, cancer, chronic infections, and lung disease, such as pneumonia\nSubstance use disorder\nRare causes include:\nRare diseases of the hypothalamus or pituitary\nLeukemia\nand cancer of the small intestine, pancreas, and brain\nMental disorders\nSymptoms\nWith SIADH, the urine is very concentrated. Not enough water is excreted and there is too much water in the blood. This dilutes many substances in the blood such as sodium. A\nlow blood sodium level\nis the most common cause of symptoms of too much ADH."}

It is also the most common clue that a person may have SIADH.\nOften, there are no symptoms from a mildly low sodium level. More symptoms occur the lower the level of the sodium.\nWhen symptoms do occur, they may include any of the following:\nNausea and vomiting\nHeadache\nProblems with balance that may result in falls\nMental changes, such as confusion, memory problems, strange behavior\nSeizures\nor coma, in severe cases\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a complete physical examination to help determine the cause of your symptoms."}

Establishing fluid status (dehydrated, volume overload, normal volume) is an important part of making the correct diagnosis.\nLab tests that can confirm and help diagnose low sodium include:\nComprehensive metabolic panel\n(includes blood sodium)\nOsmolality blood test\nUrine osmolality\nUrine sodium\nand potassium\nToxicology screens for certain medicines\nLung and brain imaging tests in children suspected of having SIADH\nADH can be measured in the blood, but is difficult to process for many labs and takes up to two weeks to get a result. Serum co-peptin can be used to estimate the ADH level in the blood.\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the cause of the problem. For example, surgery is done to remove a tumor producing ADH. Or, if a medicine is the cause, its dosage may be changed or another medicine may be tried.\nIn all cases, the first step is to limit fluid intake. This helps prevent excess fluid from building up in the body."}

This helps prevent excess fluid from building up in the body. Your provider will tell you what your total daily fluid intake should be. The restriction is not just for water, but for almost all fluids (coffee, tea, juice, soda, etc.).\nIf you have severe symptoms, it is a medical emergency. This is usually treated with salt solution (3% saline) given through an IV into the veins (intravenous) in the hospital.\nMedicines may be needed to block the effects of ADH on the kidneys so that excess water is excreted by the kidneys. These medicines may be given as pills or as injections given into the veins.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nOutcome depends on the condition that is causing the problem. Low sodium that occurs rapidly, in less than 48 hours (acute hyponatremia), is more dangerous than low sodium that develops slowly over time. When the sodium level falls slowly over days or weeks (chronic hyponatremia), the brain cells have time to adjust and the acute symptoms such as brain swelling don't occur."}

Chronic hyponatremia is associated with nervous system problems such as poor balance and poor memory. Many causes of SIADH are reversible. Rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia can also cause dangerous complications (\nosmotic demyelination\n).\nPossible Complications\nIn severe cases, low sodium can lead to:\nDecreased consciousness, hallucinations or coma\nBrain herniation\nDeath\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nWhen your body's sodium level drops too much, it can be a life-threatening emergency.
