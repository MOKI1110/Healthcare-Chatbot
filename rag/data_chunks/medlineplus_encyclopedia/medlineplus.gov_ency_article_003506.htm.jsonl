These include:\nAlcohol\nAcetazolamide\nBarbiturates\nDiuretics\nNarcotics\nValproic acid\nYou should not smoke before your blood is drawn.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nAmmonia (NH\n3\n) is produced by cells throughout the body, especially the intestines, liver, and kidneys. Most of the ammonia produced in the body is used by the liver to produce urea. Urea is also a waste product, but it is much less toxic than ammonia. Ammonia is especially toxic to the brain."}

It is most commonly used to diagnose and monitor\nhepatic encephalopathy\n, a severe liver disease.\nNormal Results\nThe normal range is 15 to 45  µ/dL (10.7 to 32  µmol/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may mean you have increased ammonia levels in your blood."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may mean you have increased ammonia levels in your blood. This may be due to any of the following:\nGastrointestinal (GI) bleeding\n, usually in the upper GI tract\nGenetic diseases of the urea cycle\nHigh body temperature (\nhyperthermia\n)\nKidney disease\nLiver failure\nLow blood potassium level\n(in people with liver disease)\nParenteral nutrition (nutrition by vein)\nReye syndrome\nSalicylate poisoning\nSevere muscle exertion\nA procedure to reconstruct the urinary tract in certain illnesses (ureterosigmoidostomy)\nUrinary tract infection with a bacteria called\nProteus mirabilis\nA high-protein diet or bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract can also raise the blood ammonia level.\nRisks\nThere is little risk in having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
