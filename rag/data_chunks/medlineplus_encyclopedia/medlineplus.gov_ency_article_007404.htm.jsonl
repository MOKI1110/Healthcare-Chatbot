Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBreast reconstruction - natural tissue\nBreast reconstruction - natural tissue\nAfter a\nmastectomy\n, some women choose to have surgery to rebuild their breast. This type of surgery is called breast reconstruction. It can be performed at the same time as a mastectomy (immediate reconstruction) or later (delayed reconstruction).\nDuring breast reconstruction that uses natural tissue, the breast is reshaped using muscle, skin, or fat from another part of your body. Sometimes a combination of the different types of tissue is used. An implant may also be used with the tissue to add volume.\nDescription\nIf you are having breast reconstruction at the same time as your mastectomy, the surgeon may do either of the following:\nSkin-sparing mastectomy. This means that the nipple and areola and a small area of skin around it is removed.\nNipple-sparing mastectomy."}

This means that the nipple and areola and a small area of skin around it is removed.\nNipple-sparing mastectomy. This means all of the skin, nipple, and areola (the pigmented skin around the nipple) are left in place when the breast is removed.\nIn either case, skin is left to make reconstruction easier.\nIf you will have breast reconstruction later, the surgeon can still do skin- or nipple-sparing mastectomy. If you are not sure about having reconstruction, the surgeon may remove the nipple and enough skin to make the chest wall as smooth and flat as possible.\nTypes of breast reconstruction include the following:\nDeep inferior epigastric artery perforator flap (DIEP or DIEAP)\nLatissimus muscle flap\nGluteal flap\nTransverse upper gracilis flap (TUG)\nTransverse rectus abdominus myocutaneous flap (TRAM)\nFor any of these procedures, you will have\ngeneral anesthesia\n. This uses medicines that keep you asleep and pain-free.\nFor TRAM surgery:\nThe surgeon makes a cut (incision) across your lower belly, from one hip to the other."}

Your scar will be hidden later by most clothing and bathing suits.\nThe surgeon loosens skin, fat, and muscle in this area. This tissue is then tunneled under the skin of your abdomen up to the breast area to create your new breast. Blood vessels remain connected to the area from where the tissue is taken.\nIn another method called the free flap procedure, skin, fat, and muscle tissue are removed from your lower belly. This tissue is placed in your breast area to create your new breast. The arteries and veins are cut and reattached to blood vessels under your arm or behind your breastbone.\nThis tissue is then shaped into a new breast. The surgeon matches the size and shape of your remaining natural breast as closely as possible. Sometimes the tissue is used to reconstruct both breasts.\nThe incisions on your belly are closed with stitches.\nIf a skin sparing mastectomy has been done and you would like a new nipple and areola created, you will need a second, much smaller surgery later."}

When it is done as a second surgery, it may take up to 12 hours.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nYou and your surgeon will decide together about whether to have breast reconstruction and when. The decision depends on many different factors.\nHaving breast reconstruction does not make it harder to find a tumor if your\nbreast cancer\ncomes back.\nThe advantage of breast reconstruction with natural tissue is that the remade breast is softer and more natural than\nbreast implants\n."}

You may need blood transfusions during the procedure. You will usually spend 2 or 3 more days in the hospital after this surgery compared to other reconstruction procedures. Also, your recovery time at home will be much longer.\nSome women choose not to have breast reconstruction or implants.
