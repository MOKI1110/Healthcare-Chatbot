It develops during the last month of pregnancy, or within 5 months after the baby is born.\nCauses\nCardiomyopathy\noccurs when there is damage to the heart muscle. As a result, the heart muscle becomes weak and does not pump well. This affects the lungs, liver, and other body systems.\nPeripartum cardiomyopathy is a form of\ndilated cardiomyopathy\nin which no other cause of heart weakening can be found.\nIt may occur in pregnant women of any age, but it is most common after age 30.\nRisk factors for the condition include:\nObesity\nPersonal history of cardiac disorders such as\nmyocarditis\nUse of certain medicines\nSmoking\nAlcoholism\nMultiple pregnancies\nOld age\nPreeclampsia\nAfrican American descent\nPoor nourishment\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nFatigue\nFeeling of heart racing  or skipping beats (palpitations)\nIncreased nighttime urination (nocturia)\nShortness of breath with activity and when lying"}

A stethoscope will be used to listen for lung crackles, a rapid heart rate, or abnormal heart sounds.\nThe liver may be enlarged and neck veins may be swollen. Blood pressure may be low or may drop when standing up.\nHeart enlargement, congestion of the lungs or the veins in the lungs, decreased cardiac output, decreased movement or functioning of the heart, or\nheart failure\nmay show up on:\nChest x-ray\nChest CT scan\nCoronary angiography\nEchocardiogram\nNuclear heart scan\nCardiac MRI\nheart biopsy\nmay help determine if the underlying cause of cardiomyopathy is a heart muscle infection (myocarditis)."}

However, this procedure is not done very often.\nTreatment\nA woman may need to stay in the hospital until\nacute\nsymptoms subside.\nBecause it is very often possible to restore heart function, and the women who have this condition are often young and otherwise healthy, care is often aggressive.\nWhen severe symptoms occur, this may include extreme steps such as:\nUse of an assistive heart pump (aortic counterpulsation balloon or left ventricular assist device)\nImmunosuppressive therapy (such as medicines used to treat cancer or prevent rejection of a transplanted organ)\nHeart transplant\nif severe congestive heart failure persists\nFor most women, however, treatment mainly focuses on relieving the symptoms. Some symptoms go away on their own without treatment.\nMedicines that are often used include:\nDigitalis to strengthen the heart's pumping ability\nDiuretics (\"water pills\") to remove excess fluid\nLow-dose beta-blockers\nOther blood pressure medicines\nA low-salt diet may be recommended."}

Fluid may be restricted in some cases. Activities, including nursing the baby, may be limited when symptoms develop.\nDaily weighing may be recommended. A weight gain of 3 to 4 pounds (1.5 to 2 kilograms) or more over 1 or 2 days may be a sign of fluid buildup.\nWomen who smoke and drink alcohol will be advised to stop, since these habits may make the symptoms worse.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThere are several possible outcomes in peripartum cardiomyopathy. Some women remain stable for long periods, while others get worse slowly.\nOthers get worse very quickly and may be candidates for a heart transplant. About 4% of people will require heart transplantation and 9% may die suddenly or die from complications of the procedure.\nThe outlook is good when a woman's heart returns to normal after the baby is born. If the heart remains abnormal, future pregnancies may result in heart failure. It is not known how to predict who will recover and who will develop severe heart failure."}

If the heart remains abnormal, future pregnancies may result in heart failure. It is not known how to predict who will recover and who will develop severe heart failure. Up to about one half of  women will recover completely.\nWomen who develop peripartum cardiomyopathy are at high risk of developing the same problem with future pregnancies. The rate of recurrence is about 30%. Therefore, women who have had this condition should discuss birth control methods with their provider.\nPossible Complications\nComplications include:\nCardiac\narrhythmias\n(can be deadly)\nCongestive heart failure\nClot formation in the heart which can embolize (travel to other parts of the body)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you are currently pregnant or have recently delivered a baby and think you may have signs of cardiomyopathy.\nGet medical help right away if you develop chest pain, palpitations, faintness, or other new or unexplained symptoms.\nPrevention\nEat a well-balanced diet and get regular exercise to help keep your heart strong. Avoid cigarettes and alcohol."}
