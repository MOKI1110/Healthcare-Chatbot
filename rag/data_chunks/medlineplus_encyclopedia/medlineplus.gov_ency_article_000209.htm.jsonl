This prevents the small intestine from allowing nutrients to pass into the rest of the body. This is called\nmalabsorption\n.\nCauses\nWhipple disease is caused by infection with a bacterium called\nTropheryma whipplei\n. The disorder mainly affects white men of middle-age.\nWhipple disease is rare. Risk factors are not known.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms most often start slowly. Joint pain is the most common early symptom. Symptoms of gastrointestinal (GI) infection often occur several years later. Other symptoms may include:\nAbdominal pain\nDiarrhea\nFever\nDarkening of skin in light-exposed areas of the body\nJoint pain\nin the ankles, knees, elbows, fingers, or other areas\nMemory loss\nMental changes\nWeight loss\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

This may show:\nEnlarged lymph glands\nHeart murmur\nSwelling in body tissues (\nedema\n)\nTests to diagnose Whipple disease may include:\nComplete blood count (\nCBC\n)\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to check for the bacteria that cause the disease\nSmall bowel\nbiopsy\nUpper GI\nendoscopy\nSmall bowel\nenteroscopy\nThis disease may also change the results of the following tests:\nAlbumin\nlevels in the blood\nUnabsorbed fat in the stools (\nfecal fat\n)\nIntestinal absorption of a type of sugar (\nd-xylose absorption\n)\nTreatment\nPeople with Whipple disease need to take long-term antibiotics to cure the infection that may include sites in the brain and central nervous system. An antibiotic called ceftriaxone is given through a vein (IV). It is followed by another antibiotic (such as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) taken by mouth for up to 1 year.\nIf symptoms come back during antibiotic use, the medicines may be changed.\nYour provider should closely follow your progress."}
