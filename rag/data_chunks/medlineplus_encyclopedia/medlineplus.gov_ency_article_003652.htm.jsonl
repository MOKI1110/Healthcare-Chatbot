Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nProthrombin time (PT)\nProthrombin time (PT)\nProthrombin time (PT) is a blood test that measures the time it takes for the liquid portion (plasma) of your blood to clot. It measures the function of a part of the clotting system.\nA related blood test is\npartial thromboplastin time (PTT)\n, which measures the function of a different part of the clotting system.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample is needed\n. If you are taking blood-thinning medicines, you will be watched for signs of bleeding.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nCertain medicines can change blood test results.\nYour health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test. This may include aspirin, heparin, antihistamines, and vitamin C.\nDo not stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.\nAlso, tell your provider if you're taking any herbal remedies.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA common reason to perform this test is to monitor your levels when you are taking a blood-thinning medicine called\nwarfarin\n(Coumadin). You are likely taking this medicine to prevent blood clots.\nYour provider will check your PT regularly to monitor and adjust the dose of warfarin.\nYou may also need this test to:\nFind the cause of abnormal bleeding or bruising\nCheck how well your liver is working\nLook for signs of a blood clotting or\nbleeding disorder\nNormal Results\nPT is measured in seconds."}

Some labs use different measurements or test different samples.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf you\nare not\ntaking blood thinning medicines, such as warfarin, an INR result above 1.1 means your blood is clotting more slowly than normal."}

Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nThis test is often done on people who may have bleeding problems."}
