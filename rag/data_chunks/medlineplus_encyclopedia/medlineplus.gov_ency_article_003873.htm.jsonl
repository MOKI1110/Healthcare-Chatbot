Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMyocardial biopsy\nMyocardial biopsy\nMyocardial biopsy is the removal of a small piece of heart muscle for examination.\nHow the Test is Performed\nMyocardial biopsy is done through a catheter that is threaded into your heart (\ncardiac catheterization\n). The procedure will take place in a hospital radiology department, special procedures room, or cardiac diagnostics laboratory.\nTo have the procedure:\nYou may be given medicine to help you relax (sedative) before the procedure. However, you will remain awake and able to follow instructions during the test.\nYou will lie flat on a stretcher or table while the test is being done.\nThe skin is scrubbed and a local numbing medicine (anesthetic) is given.\nThe doctor inserts a thin tube (catheter) through a vein or artery, depending on whether tissue will be taken from the right or left side of the heart.\nIf the biopsy is done without another procedure, the catheter is most often placed through a vein in the neck and then carefully threaded into the heart."}

The doctor will use moving\nx-ray\nimages (fluoroscopy) or echocardiography (ultrasound) to guide the catheter to the correct area.\nOnce the catheter is in position, a special device with small jaws on the tip is used to remove small pieces of tissue from the heart muscle.\nThe procedure may last 1 or more hours.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will be told not to eat or drink anything for 6 to 8 hours before the test. The procedure takes place in the hospital. Most often, you will be admitted the morning of the procedure, but in some cases, you may need to be admitted the night before.\nA health care provider will explain the procedure and its risks. You must sign a consent form.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel some pressure at the biopsy site."}

You must sign a consent form.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel some pressure at the biopsy site. You may have some discomfort due to lying still for a long period of time.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis procedure is routinely done after heart transplantation to watch for signs of rejection.\nYour provider may also order this procedure if you have signs of:\nAlcoholic cardiomyopathy\nCardiac amyloidosis\nCardiomyopathy\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nIdiopathic cardiomyopathy\nIschemic cardiomyopathy\nMyocarditis\nPeripartum cardiomyopathy\nRestrictive cardiomyopathy\nNormal Results\nA normal result means no abnormal heart muscle tissue was discovered. However, it does not necessarily mean your heart is normal because sometimes the biopsy can miss abnormal tissue.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result means abnormal tissue was found. This test may reveal the cause of cardiomyopathy."}
