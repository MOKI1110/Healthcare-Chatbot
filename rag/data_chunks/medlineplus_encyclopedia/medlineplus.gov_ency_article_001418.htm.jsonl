Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBrachial plexopathy\nBrachial plexopathy\nBrachial plexopathy is a form of\nperipheral neuropathy\n. It occurs when there is damage to the brachial plexus. This is a group of nerves that run from the lower neck through the upper shoulder area. These nerves provide the shoulder, arm, and hand with movement and sensation through the radial, median, and ulnar nerves.\nDamage to the nerves of the brachial plexus results in pain, decreased movement, or decreased feeling in the arm and shoulder.\nCauses\nDamage to the brachial plexus may occur due to:\nDirect injury to the nerve\nStretching injuries (including\nbirth trauma\n)\nPressure from tumors in the area (especially from lung tumors)\nDamage from\nradiation therapy\nBrachial plexus dysfunction may also be associated with:\nBirth defects that put pressure on the neck area\nExposure to toxins, chemicals, or medicines and illegal drugs\nGeneral anesthesia, used during surgery\nInflammatory conditions, such as those due to a virus or immune system problem\nHereditary causes, such as hereditary neuralgic amyotrophy\nIn some cases,"}

Signs may include:\nDeformity of the arm or hand\nDifficulty moving the shoulder, arm, hand, or fingers\nDiminished arm reflexes\nWasting of the muscles\nWeakness of hand flexing\nA detailed history may help determine the cause of the brachial plexopathy. Age and sex are important, because some brachial plexus problems are more common in certain groups."}

Age and sex are important, because some brachial plexus problems are more common in certain groups. For example, young men more often have inflammatory or post-viral brachial plexus disease called Parsonage-Turner syndrome.\nTests that may be done to diagnose this condition include:\nBlood tests\nChest x-ray\nElectromyography\n(EMG) to check the muscles and nerves that control the muscles\nMRI\nof the head, neck, and shoulder\nNerve conduction\nto check how fast electrical signals move through a nerve\nNerve biopsy\nto examine a piece of nerve under the microscope (rarely needed)\nUltrasound\nGenetic tests to look for hereditary causes of neuropathy\nTreatment\nTreatment is aimed at correcting the underlying cause and allowing you to use your hand and arm as much as possible."}
