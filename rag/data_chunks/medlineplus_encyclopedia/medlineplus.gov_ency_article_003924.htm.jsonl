Your health care provider will apply a numbing medicine (local anesthesia) to the biopsy area.\nThere are two types of muscle biopsy:\nA needle biopsy involves inserting a needle into the muscle. When the needle is removed, a small piece of tissue remains in the needle. More than one needle stick may be needed to get a large enough sample.\nAn open biopsy involves making a small cut in the skin and into the muscle. The muscle tissue is then removed.\nAfter either type of biopsy, the tissue is sent to a lab for examination.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is usually needed. If you will have anesthesia, follow instructions on not eating or drinking anything before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nDuring the biopsy, there is usually little or no discomfort."}

If you will have anesthesia, follow instructions on not eating or drinking anything before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nDuring the biopsy, there is usually little or no discomfort. You may feel some pressure or tugging.\nThe anesthetic may burn or sting when injected (before the area becomes numb). After the anesthetic wears off, the area may be sore for about a week.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA muscle biopsy is done to find out why you have muscle weakness or your muscle enzyme lab tests are elevated and your provider suspects you have a muscle disease.\nA muscle biopsy may be done to help identify or detect:\nInflammatory diseases of muscle (such as\npolymyositis or dermatomyositis\n)\nDiseases of the connective tissue and blood vessels (such as\npolyarteritis nodosa\n)\nInfections that affect the muscles (such as\ntrichinosis\nor\ntoxoplasmosis\n)\nInherited muscle disorders such as\nmuscular dystrophy\nor congenital\nmyopathy\nMetabolic defects of the muscle\nEffects of medicines, toxins, or\nelectrolyte\ndisorders\nA muscle biopsy may also be done to tell the difference between nerve and muscle disorders.\nA muscle that has recently been injured, such as by an\nelectromyography\n(EM"}
