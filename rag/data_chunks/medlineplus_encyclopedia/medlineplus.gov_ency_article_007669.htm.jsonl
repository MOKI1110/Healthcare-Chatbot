It is used with children to help diagnose defects of the heart that are present at birth (congenital). The picture is more detailed than a regular\nx-ray\nimage. An echocardiogram also does not expose children to radiation.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYour child's health care provider may do the test in a clinic, in a hospital, or at an outpatient center. Echocardiography in children is done either with the child lying down or lying in their parent's lap. This approach can help comfort them and keep them still.\nFor each of these tests, a trained sonographer performs the test. A cardiologist interprets the results.\nTRANSTHORACIC ECHOCARDIOGRAM (TTE)\nTTE is the type of echocardiogram that most children will have.\nThe sonographer puts gel on the child's ribs near the breastbone in the area around the heart."}

A hand-held instrument, called a transducer, is pressed on the gel on the child's chest and directed toward the heart. This device releases high-frequency sound waves.\nThe transducer picks up the echo of sound waves coming back from the heart and blood vessels.\nThe echocardiography machine converts these impulses into moving pictures of the heart. Still pictures are also taken.\nPictures can be two-dimensional or three-dimensional.\nThe entire procedure takes 20 to 40 minutes.\nThe test allows the provider to see the heart beating. It also shows the heart valves and other structures.\nSometimes, the lungs, ribs, or body tissues may prevent the sound waves from producing a clear picture of the heart. In this case, the sonographer may inject a small amount of liquid (contrast dye) through an IV to better see the inside of the heart.\nTRANSESOPHAGEAL ECHOCARDIOGRAM (TEE)\nTEE is another type of echocardiogram that children can have."}

The test is done with the child lying down and under\nsedation\n.\nThe sonographer will numb the back of your child's throat and insert a small tube into the child's food pipe (esophagus). The end of the tube contains a device to send out sound waves.\nThe sound waves reflect off the structures in the heart and are displayed on a screen as images of the heart and blood vessels.\nBecause the esophagus is right behind the heart, this method is used to get clearer pictures of the heart.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou can take these steps to prepare your child before the procedure:\nDo not allow your child to eat or drink anything prior to having a TEE.\nDo not use any skin cream or oil on your child before the exam.\nExplain the test in detail to older children so they understand that they should remain still during the test.\nYounger children less than 4 years of age may need medicine (sedation) to help them stay still for clearer pictures.\nGive children older than 4 a toy to hold or have them w"}
