Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFocal seizure\nFocal seizure\nAll seizures are caused by abnormal electrical disturbances in the brain. Focal seizures occur when this electrical activity is in a limited area of the brain. Sometimes the seizures stay only in one part of the brain, while at other times, the seizures can turn into\nbilateral tonic-clonic seizures\n, which affect the whole brain. This is called secondary generalization.\nFocal seizures can be divided into whether they affect awareness or not:\nFocal, aware\nFocal, awareness impaired\nFocal seizures are also classified by whether they are motor (movements with the seizures) or not.\nCauses\nFocal seizures are the most common type of seizure in people 1 year and older. In people older than 65 who have blood vessel disease of the brain or brain tumors, focal seizures are very common. Focal seizures are usually associated with an area of the brain in which nerve cells are easily excitable."}

Focal seizures are usually associated with an area of the brain in which nerve cells are easily excitable. This is often due to brain injury that can result from conditions such as stroke, infection, trauma, or from problems present at birth.\nSymptoms\nPeople with focal, awareness impaired seizures may or may not remember any or all of the symptoms or events during the seizure.\nDepending on where in the brain the seizure starts, symptoms may include:\nAbnormal\nmuscle contraction\n, such as abnormal head or limb movements\nStaring spells, sometimes with repetitive movements such as picking at clothes or lip smacking\nEyes moving from side to side\nAbnormal sensations, such as\nnumbness\n, tingling, crawling sensation (like ants crawling on the skin)\nSeeing, smelling, or sometimes hearing things that are not there (\nhallucinations\n)\nAbdominal pain or discomfort\nNausea\nSweating\nFlushed face\nDilated pupils\nRapid heart rate/pulse\nOther symptoms may include:\nBlackout spells, periods of time lost from memory\nChanges in vision\nSensation of dÃ©jÃ  vu (feeling like current place and time have been experience"}

This will include a detailed look at the brain and nervous system.\nAn\nelectroencephalogram\n(EEG)  will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain. People with seizures often have abnormal electrical activity seen on this test. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures.\nBlood and urine tests may also be ordered to check for other health problems that may be causing the seizures.\nHead CT\nor\nMRI scan\nmay be done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain.\nTreatment\nTreatment\nfor focal seizures includes medicines, changes in lifestyle for\nadults\nand\nchildren\n, such as activity and diet, and sometimes surgery."}
