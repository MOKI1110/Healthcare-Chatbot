Doctors that specialize in the interpretation of these images are called diagnostic radiologists. Using the diagnostic images, the radiologist or other providers can often:\nDiagnose the cause of your symptoms\nMonitor how well your body is responding to a treatment you are receiving for your disease or condition\nScreen for different illnesses, such as breast cancer, colon cancer, or heart disease\nThe most common types of diagnostic radiology exams include:\nComputed tomography\n(CT), also known as a computerized axial tomography (CAT) scan, including CT angiography\nFluoroscopy, including upper GI and barium enema\nMagnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) and\nmagnetic resonance angiography\n(MRA)\nMammography\nNuclear medicine, which includes such tests as a\nbone scan\n,\nthyroid scan\n, and\nthallium cardiac stress test\nPlain\nx-rays\n, which includes chest x-ray\nPositron emission tomography\n, also called PET imaging, PET scan, or PET-CT when it is combined with CT\nUltrasound\nINTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY\nInterventional radiologists are doctors that use imaging such as CT, ultrasound, MRI, and fluoroscopy t"}

The imaging is helpful to the doctor when inserting catheters, wires, and other small instruments and tools into your body. This typically allows for smaller incisions (cuts).\nProviders can use this technology to detect or treat conditions in almost any part of the body instead of using larger incisions and directly looking inside of your body through a scope (camera) or with open surgery.\nInterventional radiologists often are involved in treating cancers or tumors, blockages in the arteries and veins, fibroids in the uterus, back pain, liver problems, and kidney problems.\nThe  interventional radiologist will make no incision or only a very small one. You rarely need to stay in the hospital after the procedure."}
