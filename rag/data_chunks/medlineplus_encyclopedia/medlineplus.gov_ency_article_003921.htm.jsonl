Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAmniocentesis\nAmniocentesis\nAmniocentesis is a test that can be done during pregnancy to look for certain problems in the developing baby. These problems include:\nBirth defects\nGenetic problems\nInfection\nLung development\nHow the Test is Performed\nAmniocentesis removes a small amount of fluid from the sac around the baby in the womb (uterus). It is most often done in a doctor's office or medical center. You do not need to stay in the hospital.\nYou will have a\npregnancy ultrasound\nfirst. This helps your health care provider see where the baby is in your womb.\nNumbing medicine is then rubbed onto part of your belly. Sometimes, the medicine is given through a shot in the skin on the belly area. The skin is cleaned with a disinfecting liquid.\nYour provider inserts a long, thin needle through your belly and into your womb. A small amount of fluid (about 4 teaspoons or 20 milliliters) is removed from the sac surrounding the baby. In most cases, the baby is watched by ultrasound during the procedure.\nThe fluid is sent to a laboratory."}

In most cases, the baby is watched by ultrasound during the procedure.\nThe fluid is sent to a laboratory. Testing may include:\nGenetic studies\nMeasurement of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels (a substance produced in the liver of the developing baby)\nCulture for infection\nResults of genetic testing usually take about 2 weeks. Other test results come back in 1 to 3 days.\nSometimes amniocentesis is also used later in pregnancy to:\nDiagnose infection\nCheck whether the baby's lungs are developed and ready for delivery\nRemove excess fluid from around the baby if there is too much amniotic fluid (\npolyhydramnios\n)\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour bladder may need to be full for the ultrasound. Check with your provider about this.\nBefore the test, blood may be taken to find out your\nblood type\nand Rh factor. You may get a shot of medicine called Rho(D) Immune Globulin (RhoGAM and other brands) if you are Rh negative.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nAmniocentesis is usually offered to women who are at increased risk of having a child with birth defects."}

This includes women who:\nWill be 35 or older when they give birth\nHad a screening test that shows there may be a birth defect or other problem\nHave had babies with birth defects in other pregnancies\nHave a family history of genetic disorders\nGenetic counseling is recommended before the procedure. This will allow you to:\nLearn about other prenatal tests\nMake an informed decision about options for prenatal diagnosis\nThis test:\nIs a diagnostic test, not a screening test\nIs most often done between 15 to 20 weeks of your pregnancy, but can be performed at any time between 15 to 40 weeks\nAmniocentesis can be used to diagnose many different gene and chromosome problems in the baby, including:\nAnencephaly\n(when the baby is missing a large portion of the brain)\nDown syndrome\nRare metabolic disorders that are passed down through families\nOther genetic problems, like trisomy 18 (also known as Edwards syndrome)\nInfections in the amniotic fluid\nNormal Results\nA normal result means:\nNo genetic or ch"}
