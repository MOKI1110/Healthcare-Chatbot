The muscles are tightened and held rigidly. This type of posturing usually means there has been severe damage to the brain. People who have this condition should get medical attention right away.\nConsiderations\nA severe injury to the brain is the usual cause of decerebrate posture.\nOpisthotonos\n(a severe muscle spasm of the neck and back) may appear the same as decerebrate posture.\nDecerebrate posture can occur on one side, on both sides, or in just the arms. It may alternate with another type of abnormal posture called\ndecorticate posture\n."}

This includes breathing assistance and placement of a breathing tube. The person will be admitted to intensive care.\nOnce the person is stable, the provider will obtain a complete medical history from family members or friends and do a more complete physical exam. This will include a careful exam of the brain and nervous system.\nFamily members will be asked questions about the person's medical history, including:\nWhen did the symptoms start?\nIs there a pattern to the episodes?\nIs the body posturing always the same?\nIs there any history of illicit drug use, or a head injury, or other condition?\nWhat other symptoms came before or with the abnormal posturing?\nTests may include:\nBlood and urine tests to check blood counts, screen for illicit drugs and toxic substances, and measure body chemicals and minerals\nCerebral angiography\n(dye and x-ray study of blood vessels in the brain)\nCT\nor\nMRI of the head\nElectroencephalogram\n(EEG) -- brain wave testing\nIntracranial pressure\n(ICP) monitoring\nL"}
