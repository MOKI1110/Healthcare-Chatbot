The medical name of the condition is cutaneous candidiasis.\nCauses\nThe body normally hosts a variety of germs, including bacteria and fungi. Some of these are useful to the body, some produce no harm or benefit, and some can cause harmful infections.\nSome fungal infections are caused by fungi that often live on the hair, nails, and outer skin layers. They include yeast-like fungi such as candida. Sometimes, these yeast penetrate beneath the surface of the skin and cause an infection.\nIn cutaneous candidiasis, the skin is infected with candida fungi. This type of infection is fairly common. It can involve almost any area of skin on the body, but most often it occurs in warm, moist, creased areas such as the armpits and groin. The fungus that most often causes cutaneous candidiasis is\nCandida albicans\n.\nCandida is the most common cause of\ndiaper rash\nin infants."}

The fungi take advantage of the warm, moist conditions inside the diaper. Candida infection is also particularly common in people with\ndiabetes\nand in those who are obese. Antibiotics, steroid therapy, and chemotherapy increase the risk of cutaneous candidiasis. Candida can also cause infections of the nails, edges of the nails, and corners of the mouth.\nOral thrush, a form of candida infection of the moist lining of the mouth, usually occurs when people take antibiotics though only a small number of people who take antibiotics get thrush. It may also be a sign of an HIV infection or other weakened immune system disorders when it occurs in adults. Individuals with candida infections are not usually contagious, though in some settings people with weakened immune systems may catch the infection. When it occurs in the mouth or vagina, it is sometimes called mucocutaneous candidiasis.\nCandida is also the most frequent cause of vaginal yeast infections."}

Your provider may gently scrape off a sample of skin for testing.\nOlder children and adults with a yeast skin infection should be tested for diabetes. High blood sugar levels, seen in people with diabetes, act as food for the yeast fungus and help it grow.\nTreatment\nGood general health and hygiene are very important for treating candida infections of the skin. Keeping the skin dry and exposed to air is helpful."}

You may need to take antifungal medicine by mouth for severe candida infections in the mouth, throat, or vagina.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nCutaneous candidiasis often goes away with treatment, especially if the underlying cause is corrected."}
