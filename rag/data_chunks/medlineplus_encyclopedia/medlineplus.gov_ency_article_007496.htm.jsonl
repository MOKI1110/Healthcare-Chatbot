It usually lasts 4 to 7 days in most cases.\nYoung girls may get their periods anywhere from 21 to 45 days or more apart.\nWomen in their 40s will often notice their period occurring less often.\nMany women have abnormal bleeding between their periods at some point in their lives. Abnormal bleeding means you have:\nHeavier bleeding than usual\nBleeding for more days than normal (menorrhagia)\nSpotting or bleeding between periods\nBleeding after sex\nBleeding after\nmenopause\nBleeding while pregnant\nBleeding before age 9\nMenstrual cycles longer than 35 days or shorter than 21 days\nNo period for 3 to 6 months (amenorrhea)\nCauses\nThere are many causes of abnormal vaginal bleeding.\nHORMONES\nAbnormal bleeding is often linked to failure of regular ovulation (anovulation)."}

AUB is more common in teenagers and in women who are approaching menopause.\nWomen who take oral contraceptives may experience episodes of abnormal vaginal bleeding. Often this is called \"breakthrough bleeding.\" This problem often goes away on its own. However, talk to your provider if you have concerns about the bleeding.\nPREGNANCY\nPregnancy complications such as:\nEctopic pregnancy\nMiscarriage\nThreatened miscarriage\nPROBLEMS WITH REPRODUCTIVE ORGANS\nProblems with reproductive organs may include:\nInfection in the uterus (pelvic inflammatory disease)\nRecent injury or surgery to the uterus\nNoncancerous growths in the uterus, including\nuterine fibroids\n, uterine or\ncervical polyps\n, and\nadenomyosis\nInflammation or infection of the cervix (\ncervicitis\n)\nInjury or disease of the vaginal opening (caused by intercourse, infection, polyp,\ngenital warts\n, ulcer, or varicose veins)\nEndometrial"}
