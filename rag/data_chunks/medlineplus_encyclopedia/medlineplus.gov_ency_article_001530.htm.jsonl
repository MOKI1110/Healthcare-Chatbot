It is most often an unhappy and painful emotion.\nCauses\nGrief may be triggered by the death of a loved one. People also can experience grief if they have an illness for which there is no cure, or a chronic condition that affects their quality of life. The end of a significant relationship may also cause grieving.\nEveryone feels grief in their own way. But there are common stages to the process of mourning. It starts with recognizing a loss and continues until a person eventually accepts that loss.\nPeople's responses to grief will be different, depending on the circumstances of the event. For example, if the person who died had a\nchronic\nillness, the death may have been expected. The end of the person's suffering might even have come as a relief. If the death was accidental or violent, coming to a stage of acceptance might take longer.\nSymptoms\nOne way to describe grief is in five stages. These reactions might not occur in a specific order, and can occur together."}

Symptoms that last for a while may lead to clinical\ndepression\n.\nTreatment\nFamily and friends can offer emotional support during the grieving process. Sometimes, outside factors can affect the normal grieving process, and people might need help from:\nClergy\nMental health specialists\nSocial workers\nSupport groups\nThe acute phase of grief may last up to 2 months. Milder symptoms may last for a year or longer."}

Milder symptoms may last for a year or longer. Psychological counseling may help a person who is unable to face the loss (absent grief reaction), or who has depression with grieving. Some people with depression will benefit from taking an antidepressant medicine.\nSupport Groups\nJoining a support group where members share common experiences and problems, helps relieve the\nstress\nfrom grieving especially if you have\nlost a child\nor\nspouse\n.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIt may take a year or longer to overcome strong feelings of grief and to accept the loss.\nPossible Complications\nComplications that may result from ongoing grief include:\nIllegal drug or excessive alcohol use\nDepression\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nYou can't deal with grief\nYou are using excessive amounts of illegal drugs or alcohol\nYou become very depressed\nYou have long-term depression that interferes with your daily life\nYou have suicidal thoughts\nIf you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat\n988lifeline.or"}
