It may be due to conditions in the woman, man, or both.\nFEMALE INFERTILITY\nFemale infertility may occur when:\nA fertilized egg or embryo does not survive once it attaches to the lining of the womb (uterus).\nThe fertilized egg does not attach to the lining of the uterus.\nThe eggs cannot move from the ovaries to the womb.\nThe ovaries have problems producing healthy eggs.\nFemale infertility may be caused by:\nAutoimmune disorders\n, such as antiphospholipid syndrome (APS)\nBirth defects that affect the reproductive tract\nCancer or tumor\nClotting disorders\nDiabetes\nDrinking too much alcohol\nExercising too much\nEating disorders or poor nutrition\nGrowths (su"}

The chance a woman can get pregnant begins to decrease around age 35 (and especially after age 40). The age when fertility starts to decline varies from woman to woman.\nInfertility problems and miscarriage rates increase significantly after 35 years of age. There are now options for early egg retrieval and storage for women in their 20's. This may help ensure a successful pregnancy if childbearing is delayed until after age 35. This is an expensive option."}

However, women who know they will need to delay childbearing may consider it.\nExams and Tests\nDeciding when to get evaluated and treated for infertility depends on your age. Health care providers suggest that women under 30 try to get pregnant on their own for 1 year before getting tested for conditions that may cause infertility.\nWomen over 35 should try to get pregnant for 6 months. If it does not occur within that time, they should talk to their provider.\nInfertility testing involves a medical history and physical exam for both partners.\nBlood and imaging tests are most often needed."}
