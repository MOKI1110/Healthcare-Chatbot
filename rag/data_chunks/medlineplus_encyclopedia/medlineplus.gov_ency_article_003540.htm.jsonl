Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nProtein electrophoresis - serum\nProtein electrophoresis - serum\nThis lab test measures the types of protein in the fluid (serum) part of a blood sample. This fluid is called serum.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nIn the lab, the technician places the blood sample on special paper and applies an electric current. The proteins move on the paper and form bands that show the amount of each protein.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked to not eat or drink for 12 hours before this test.\nCertain medicines may affect the results of this test. Your health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines. Do not stop any medicine before talking to your provider.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nProteins are made from\namino acids\nand are important parts of all cells and tissues."}

Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nProteins are made from\namino acids\nand are important parts of all cells and tissues. There are many different kinds of proteins in the body, and they have many different functions. Examples of proteins include enzymes, certain hormones,\nhemoglobin\n, low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or bad cholesterol), and others.\nSerum proteins are classified as albumin or globulins. Albumin is the most abundant protein in the serum. It carries many small molecules. It is also important for keeping fluid from leaking out from the blood vessels into the tissues.\nGlobulins are divided into alpha-1, alpha-2, beta, and gamma globulins."}

It is also important for keeping fluid from leaking out from the blood vessels into the tissues.\nGlobulins are divided into alpha-1, alpha-2, beta, and gamma globulins. In general, alpha and gamma globulin protein levels increase when there is inflammation in the body.\nLipoprotein electrophoresis determines the amount of proteins made up of protein and fat, called lipoproteins (such as LDL cholesterol).\nNormal Results\nNormal value ranges are:\nTotal protein: 6.4 to 8.3 grams per deciliter (g/dL) or 64 to 83 grams per liter (g/L)\nAlbumin: 3.5 to 5.0 g/dL or 35 to 50 g/L\nAlpha-1 globulin: 0.1 to 0.3 g/dL or 1 to 3 g/L\nAlpha-2 globulin: 0.6 to 1.0 g/dL or 6 to 10 g/L\nBeta globulin: 0.7 to 1.2 g/dL or 7 to 12 g/L\nGamma globulin: 0.7 to 1.6 g/dL or 7 to 16 g/L\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}
