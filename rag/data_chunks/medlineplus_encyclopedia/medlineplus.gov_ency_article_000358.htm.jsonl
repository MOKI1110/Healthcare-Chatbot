Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nGraves disease\nGraves disease\nGraves disease is an autoimmune disorder that leads to an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism). An\nautoimmune disorder\nis a condition that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.\nCauses\nThe thyroid gland is an important organ of the\nendocrine system\n. The gland is located at the front of the neck above where the collarbones meet. This gland releases the hormones\nthyroxine\n(T4) and\ntriiodothyronine\n(T3), which control body\nmetabolism\n. Controlling metabolism is important for regulating mood, weight, and mental and physical energy levels.\nWhen the body makes too much thyroid hormone, the condition is called\nhyperthyroidism\n. (An underactive thyroid leads to\nhypothyroidism\n.)\nGraves disease is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. It is due to an abnormal immune system response that causes the thyroid gland to produce too much thyroid hormone. Graves disease is most common in women over age 20."}

You may receive one or more types of treatment.\nBeta-blocker medicines may help treat:\nRapid heart rate\nSweating\nAnxiety\nThey may be given until the hyperthyroidism is controlled.\nAntithyroid medicines:\nBlock or change how the thyroid gland uses iodine\nMay be used to control the overactive thyroid gland before surgery or radioiodine therapy\nMay be used as a long-term treatment\nRadioactive iodine is given by mouth. It then concentrates in the overactive thyroid tissue and causes damage.\nSurgery may be done to remove the thyroid.\nIf you have had radioactive iodine treatment or surgery, you will need to take replacement thyroid hormones for the rest of your life. This is because these treatments destroy or remove the gland.\nTREATMENT OF THE EYES\nSome of the eye problems related to Graves disease often improve after treatment with medicines (including selenium),  radiation, or surgery. Radioiodine therapy can sometimes make eye problems worse."}

Radioiodine therapy can sometimes make eye problems worse. Eye problems are worse in people who smoke, even after the hyperthyroidism is treated.\nSometimes, prednisone is needed to reduce eye irritation and swelling. Prednisone is a steroid medicine that suppresses the immune system. Other treatments to suppress the immune system may be needed. Ask your provider if these would help you.\nSunglasses, cool compresses, and eye drops may reduce eye irritation. In rare cases, surgery or radiation therapy (different from radioactive iodine) may be needed to prevent further damage to the eye and loss of vision.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nGraves disease often responds well to treatment. Thyroid surgery or radioactive iodine often will cause an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism)."}
