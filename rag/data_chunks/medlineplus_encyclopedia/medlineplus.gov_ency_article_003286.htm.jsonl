This most often occurs in the skin covering the chest or neck, but can also occur in other parts of the body.\nConsiderations\nSubcutaneous emphysema can often be seen as a smooth bulging of the skin. When a health care provider feels (palpates) the skin, it produces an unusual crackling sensation (crepitus) as the gas is pushed through the tissue.\nCauses\nThis is a rare condition."}

These include endoscopy (tube into the esophagus and the stomach through the mouth), a central venous line (thin catheter into a vein close to the heart), endotracheal intubation (tube into the throat and trachea through the mouth or nose), and bronchoscopy (tube into the bronchial tubes through the mouth).\nAir can also be found in between skin layers on the arms and legs or torso after certain infections, including\ngas gangrene\n, or after scuba diving. Scuba divers with asthma are more likely to have this problem than other scuba divers.\nWhen caused by surgery, subcutaneous emphysema is sometimes referred to as \"surgical emphysema.\"\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nMost of the conditions that cause subcutaneous emphysema are severe, and you are likely already being treated by a provider.
