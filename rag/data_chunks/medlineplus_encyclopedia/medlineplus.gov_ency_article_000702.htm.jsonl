These tubes, along with a nerve in your skull, help you know the position of your body and help maintain your balance.\nThe exact cause of MÃ©niÃ¨re disease is unknown. It may occur when the pressure of the fluid in part of the inner ear gets too high.\nIn some cases, MÃ©niÃ¨re disease may be related to:\nHead injury\nMiddle or inner\near infection\nOther risk factors include:\nAlcohol use\nAllergies\nFamily history\nRecent cold or viral illness\nSmoking\nStress\nUse of certain medicines\nMÃ©niÃ¨re disease is a fairly common disorder.\nSymptoms\nAttacks of MÃ©niÃ¨re disease often start without warning. They may occur daily or as rarely as once a year. The severity of each attack can vary."}

Some attacks may be severe and interfere with daily living activities.\nMÃ©niÃ¨re disease usually has four main symptoms:\nHearing loss\nthat varies over time\nPressure in the ear\nRinging or roaring in the affected ear, called\ntinnitus\nVertigo, or dizziness\nSevere vertigo is the symptom that causes the most problems. With vertigo, you feel as though you are spinning or moving, or that the world is spinning around you.\nNausea, vomiting, and sweating often occur.\nSymptoms get worse with sudden movement.\nOften, you will need to lie down and close your eyes.\nYou may feel dizzy and off-balance for anywhere from 20 minutes to 24 hours.\nHearing loss is often only in one ear, but it may affect both ears.\nHearing tends to improve between attacks, but gets worse over time.\nLow frequency hearing is lost first.\nYou also may have roaring or ringing in the ear (tinnitus), along with a sense of pressure in your ear.\nOther symptoms include:\nHeadaches\nPain or discomfort in the abdomen\nNausea and vomiting\nU"}

Hearing may be near normal after an attack.\ncaloric stimulation\ntest checks your eye reflexes by warming and cooling the inner ear with water. Test results that are not in the normal range can be a sign of MÃ©niÃ¨re disease.\nThese tests may also be done to check for other causes of vertigo:\nElectrocochleography (ECOG)\nElectronystagmography\n(ENG) or videonystagmography (VNG)\nHead MRI scan\nTreatment\nThere is no known cure for MÃ©niÃ¨re disease.
