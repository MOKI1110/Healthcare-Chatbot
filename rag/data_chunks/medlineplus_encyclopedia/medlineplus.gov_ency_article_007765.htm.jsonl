They connect your breastbone to your spine.\nCauses\nThis syndrome usually occurs in the 8th to 10th ribs (also known as false ribs) at the lower part of your rib cage. These ribs are not connected to the chest bone (sternum). Fibrous tissue (ligaments), connect these ribs to each other to help keep them stable. The relative weakness in the ligaments can allow the ribs to move a little more than normal and cause pain.\nThe condition can occur as a result of:\nInjury to the chest while playing contact sports such as football, ice hockey, wrestling, and rugby\nA fall or direct trauma to your chest\nRapid twisting, pushing, or lifting motions, such as throwing a baseball or swimming\nWhen the ribs shift, they press on the surrounding muscles, nerves, and other tissues."}

This causes pain and inflammation in the area.\nSlipping rib syndrome can occur at any age, but it is more common in middle-aged adults. Females may be more affected than males.\nSymptoms\nThe condition usually occurs on one side. Rarely, it may occur on both sides. Symptoms include:\nSevere pain in the lower chest or upper abdomen. The pain may come and go and get better with time.\nA popping, clicking, or slipping sensation.\nPain when applying pressure to the affected area.\nCoughing, laughing, lifting, twisting, and bending may make the pain worse.\nExams and Tests\nThe symptoms of slipping rib syndrome are similar to other medical conditions. This makes the condition difficult to diagnose.\nYour health care provider will take your medical history and ask about your symptoms. You will be asked questions such as:\nHow did the pain start?\nWas there an injury?\nWhat makes your pain worse?\nDoes anything help relieve the pain?\nYour provider will perform a physical exam."}
