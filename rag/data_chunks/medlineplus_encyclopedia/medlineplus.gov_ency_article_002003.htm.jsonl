Breasts develop fully between ages 12 and 18.\nPubic hair, armpit and leg hair usually begin to grow at about age 9 or 10, and reach adult patterns at about 13 to 14 years.\nMenarche (the beginning of menstrual periods) typically occurs about 2 years after early breast and pubic hair appear. It may occur as early as age 9, or as late as age 16. The average age of starting menstruation in the United States is about 12 years.\nGirls growth spurt peaks around age 11.5 and slows around age 16.\nBoys:\nBoys\nmay begin to notice that their testicles and scrotum grow as early as age 9. Soon, the penis begins to lengthen. By age 17 or 18, their genitals are usually at their adult size and shape.\nPubic hair growth, as well as armpit, leg, chest, and facial hair, begins in boys at about age 12, and reaches adult patterns at about 17 to 18 years.\nBoys do not start puberty with a sudden incident, like the beginning of menstrual periods in girls."}

The average age is about 14 and a half years.\nBoys' voices change at the same time as the penis grows. Nocturnal emissions occur with the peak of the height spurt.\nBoys' growth spurt peaks around age 13 and a half and slows around age 18.\nBEHAVIOR\nThe sudden and rapid physical changes that adolescents go through make adolescents very self-conscious. They are sensitive, and worried about their own body changes. They may make painful comparisons about themselves with their peers.\nPhysical changes may not occur in a smooth, regular schedule. Therefore, adolescents may go through awkward stages, both in their appearance and physical coordination. Girls may be anxious if they are not ready for the beginning of their menstrual periods."}

Boys may worry if they do not know about nocturnal emissions.\nDuring adolescence, it is normal for young people to begin to separate from their parents and make their own identity. In some cases, this may occur without a problem from their parents and other family members. However, this may lead to conflict in some families as the parents try to keep control.\nFriends become more important as adolescents pull away from their parents in a search for their own identity.\nTheir peer group may become a safe haven. This allows the adolescent to test new ideas.\nIn early adolescence, the peer group most often consists of non-romantic friendships. These often include cliques, gangs, or clubs."}

Members of the peer group often try to act alike, dress alike, have secret codes or rituals, and participate in the same activities.\nAs the youth moves into mid-adolescence (14 to 16 years) and beyond, the peer group expands to include romantic friendships.\nIn mid- to late adolescence, young people often feel the need to establish their sexual identity. They need to become comfortable with their body and sexual feelings. Adolescents learn to express and receive intimate or sexual advances. Young people who do not have the chance for such experiences may have a harder time with intimate relationships when they are adults.\nAdolescents very often have behaviors that are consistent with several myths of adolescence:\nThe first myth is that they are \"on stage\" and other people's attention is constantly centered on their appearance or actions. This is normal self-centeredness."}

A strong need for peer approval may tempt a young person to take part in risky behaviors.\nMotor vehicle safety should be stressed. It should focus on the role of the driver/passenger/pedestrian, the risks of\nsubstance use\n, and the importance of using seat belts."}

They should be taught the rules of safe play and how to approach more advanced activities.\nYoung people need to be very aware of possible dangers including sudden death. These threats can occur with one time or, especially regular substance use, such as drugs and\nalcohol\n.\nAdolescents who are allowed to use or have access to firearms need to learn how to use them properly.\nAdolescents may need to be evaluated if they appear to be isolated from their peers, uninterested in school or social activities, or doing poorly at school, work, or sports.\nMany adolescents are at increased risk for\ndepression\nand potential suicide attempts."}

If this is not possible, they should have at least some private space.\nTeasing an adolescent child about physical changes is inappropriate."}

It may lead to self-consciousness and embarrassment.\nParents need to remember that it is natural and normal for their adolescent to be interested in body changes and sexual topics. It does not mean that their adolescent is involved in sexual activity.\nAdolescents may experiment with a wide range of sexual orientations or behaviors before feeling comfortable with their own sexual identity. Parents must be careful not to call new behaviors wrong, sick, or immoral.\nThe Oedipal complex (a child's attraction to the parent of the opposite sex) is common during the adolescent years. Parents can deal with this by acknowledging the child's physical changes and attractiveness without crossing parent-child boundaries. Parents can also take pride in the youth's growth into maturity.\nIt is normal for the parent to find the adolescent attractive. This often happens because the teen often looks very much like the other (same-sex) parent did at a younger age."}

It is inappropriate for a parent's attraction to a child to be anything more than an attraction as a parent. Attraction that crosses the parent-child boundaries may lead to inappropriately intimate behavior with the adolescent. This is known as incest.\nINDEPENDENCE AND POWER STRUGGLES\nThe teenager's quest to become independent is a normal part of development. The parent should not see it as a rejection or loss of control. Parents need to be constant and consistent. They should be available to listen to the teen's ideas without dominating the child's independent identity.\nAlthough adolescents always challenge authority figures, they need or want limits. Limits provide a safe boundary for them to grow and function."}

These situations should be avoided, if possible. One of the parties (typically the teen) will be overpowered. This will cause the youth to lose face. The adolescent may feel embarrassed, inadequate, resentful, and bitter as a result.\nParents should be ready for and recognize common conflicts that may develop while parenting adolescents. The experience may be affected by unresolved issues from the parent's own childhood, or from the adolescent's early years.\nParents should know that their adolescents will repeatedly challenge their authority."}
