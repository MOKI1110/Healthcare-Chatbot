Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEar emergencies\nEar emergencies\nEar emergencies include objects in the ear canal, ruptured eardrums, sudden hearing loss, and severe infections.\nConsiderations\nChildren often put objects into their ears. These objects can be hard to remove. The deep portion of the ear canal is a tube of solid bone that is lined with thin, sensitive skin. Any object pressing against the skin can be very painful. In many cases, a health care provider will need to use special instruments to examine the ear and safely remove the object.\nCauses\nPain, hearing loss, dizziness, ringing in the ear, and\nruptured eardrums\ncan be caused by:\nInserting cotton swabs, toothpicks, pins, pens, or other objects into the ear\nSudden changes in pressure, as from an explosion, blow to the head, flying, scuba diving, falling while water skiing, or being slapped on the head or ear\nLoud sounds\n, such as a gun firing\nInflammation of the inner or middle ear\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nBleeding from the ear\nBruising or redness\nClear liquid coming out of the ear (brain fluid also called cerebrospinal fluid"}

Then, get medical help to make sure the entire object has been removed.\nIf you think a small object may be lodged inside the ear, but you cannot see it, DO NOT reach inside the ear canal with tweezers. You can do more harm than good.\nTry using gravity to get the object out by tilting the head to the affected side. DO NOT strike the person's head. Shake it gently in the direction of the ground to try to dislodge the object.\nIf the object does not come out, get medical help.\nINSECT IN THE EAR\nDO NOT let the person put a finger in the ear."}

This may make the insect sting.\nTurn the person's head so that the affected side is up and wait to see if the insect flies or crawls out.\nIf this does not work, try pouring mineral oil, olive oil, or baby oil into the ear. For an adult, pull the ear lobe gently backward and upward as you pour the oil. For a child, pull the ear lobe backward and downward as you pour. The insect should suffocate and may float out in the oil. AVOID using oil to remove any object other than an insect, since oil can cause other types of foreign objects to swell.\nEven if an insect appears to come out, get medical attention."}

Get medical help right away.\nPlace the part in a clean cloth and keep it on ice.\nDRAINAGE FROM INSIDE THE EAR\nCover the outside of the ear with a sterile dressing shaped to the contour of the ear, and tape it loosely in place.\nHave the person lie down on the side with the affected ear down so that it can drain."}
