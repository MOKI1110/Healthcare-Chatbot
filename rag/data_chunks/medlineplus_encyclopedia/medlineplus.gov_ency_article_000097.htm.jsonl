They then spread through the bloodstream or lymphatic system to the lungs. It is different than lung cancer that starts in the lungs.\nNearly any cancer can spread to the lungs. Common cancers include:\nBladder cancer\nBreast cancer\nLung cancer\nColorectal cancer\nKidney cancer\nMelanoma\nOvarian cancer\nSarcoma\nThyroid cancer\nPancreatic cancer\nTesticular cancer\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nBloody sputum\nChest pain\nCough\nShortness of breath\nWeakness\nWeight loss\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you and ask about your medical history and symptoms."}

Surgery to remove the tumors may be done when any of the following occurs:\nThe cancer has spread to only limited areas of the lung\nThe lung tumors can be completely removed with surgery\nHowever, the main tumor must be curable, and the person must be strong enough to go through the surgery and recovery.\nOther treatments include:\nRadiation therapy\nImmunotherapy\nTargeted systemic therapy\nThe placement of\nstents\ninside the airways\nLaser therapy\nUsing local heat probes to destroy the cancer\nUsing very cold temperature to destroy the cancer\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\nsupport group\nwhere members share common ex"}

But the outlook depends on the main cancer. In some cases, a person can live more than 5 years with metastatic cancer to the lungs.\nPossible Complications\nComplications of metastatic tumors in the lungs may include:\nFluid between the lung and chest wall (\npleural effusion\n), which can cause shortness of breath or pain when taking a deep breath\nFurther spread of the cancer\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have a history of cancer and you develop:\nCoughing up blood\nPersistent cough\nShortness of breath\nUnexplained weight loss\nPrevention\nNot all cancers can be prevented."}
