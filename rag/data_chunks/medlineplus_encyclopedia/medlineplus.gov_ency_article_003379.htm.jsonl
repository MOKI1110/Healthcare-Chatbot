You will be given a gown to wear.\nDuring the test, you will lie on your back on an examining table.\nYour health care provider will place a gel on the skin of your breast. A handheld device, called a transducer, is moved over the breast area. You may be asked to raise your arms above your head and turn to the left or right.\nThe device sends sound waves to the breast tissue. The sound waves help create a picture that can be seen on a computer screen on the ultrasound machine.\nThe number of people involved in the test will be limited to protect your privacy.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may want to wear a two-piece outfit, so you do not have to completely undress.\nA mammogram may be needed either before or after the exam. Do not use any lotion or powder on your breasts on the day of the exam. Do not use deodorant under your arms."}
