The left coronary artery (LCA), which carries blood to the heart muscle, begins from the pulmonary artery instead of the aorta.\nALCAPA is\npresent at birth (congenital)\n.\nCauses\nALCAPA is a problem that occurs when the baby's heart is developing early in the pregnancy. The developing blood vessel does not attach correctly to the heart muscle.\nIn the normal heart, the LCA originates from the aorta. It supplies oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle on the left side of the heart as well as the mitral valve (the heart valve between the upper and lower chambers of the heart on the left side). The aorta is the major blood vessel that takes oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body.\nIn children with ALCAPA, the LCA originates from the pulmonary artery."}

The aorta is the major blood vessel that takes oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the rest of the body.\nIn children with ALCAPA, the LCA originates from the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery is the major blood vessel that takes oxygen-poor blood from the heart to the lungs to pick up oxygen.\nWhen ALCAPA occurs, blood that is lacking in oxygen is carried to the heart muscle on the left side of the heart. Therefore, the heart muscle does not get enough oxygen. The tissue begins to die due to lack of oxygen. This can cause a heart attack in a baby.\nA condition known as coronary steal further damages the heart in babies with ALCAPA. The low blood pressure in the pulmonary artery causes blood from the abnormally connected LCA to flow back toward the pulmonary artery instead of toward the heart muscle. This results in less blood and oxygen to the heart muscle. This problem can also lead to a heart attack in a baby."}

Coronary steal develops over time in babies with ALCAPA if the condition is not treated early.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of ALCAPA in an infant include:\nCrying or sweating during feeding\nIrritability\nPale skin\nPoor feeding\nRapid breathing\nSymptoms of pain or distress in the baby (often mistaken for colic)\nSymptoms can appear within the first 2 months of the baby's life.\nExams and Tests\nTypically, ALCAPA is diagnosed during infancy."}

Only  one surgery is needed in most cases. However, the surgery will depend on the baby's condition and the size of the involved blood vessels.\nIf the heart muscle supporting the mitral valve is seriously damaged from decreased oxygen, the baby may also need surgery to repair or replace the valve. The mitral valve controls blood flow between the chambers on the left side of the heart.\nheart transplant\ncan be done in case the baby's heart is severely damaged due to lack of oxygen.\nMedicines used include:\nWater pills (diuretics)\nMedicines that make the heart muscle pump harder (inotropic agents)\nMedicines that lower the workload on the heart (beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors)\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWithout treatment, most babies do not survive their first year. Children who do survive without treatment may have serious heart problems. Babies with this problem who aren't treated could die suddenly during the following years.\nWith early treatment such as surgery, most babies do well and can expect a normal life."}
