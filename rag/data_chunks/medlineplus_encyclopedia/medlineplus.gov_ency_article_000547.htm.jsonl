Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAntiphospholipid syndrome - APS\nAntiphospholipid syndrome - APS\nAntiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is an autoimmune disorder that involves frequent blood clots (thromboses). When you have this condition, your body's immune system makes abnormal proteins that attack the blood cells and lining of the blood vessels. The presence of these\nantibodies\ncan cause problems with blood flow and lead to dangerous clots in blood vessels throughout the body.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of APS is not known. Both certain gene changes and other factors (such as an infection) may cause the problem to develop.\nIt is often found in people with other autoimmune diseases, such as\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\n(SLE). The condition is more common in women than in men. It is often found in women who have a history of repeated miscarriages.\nSome people carry the antibodies mentioned above, but do not have APS."}

Certain triggers may cause these people to have a blood clot, including:\nInfection\nSmoking\nProlonged bed rest\nPregnancy\nHormone therapy or birth control pills\nCancer\nKidney disease\nSymptoms\nYou may not have any symptoms, even though you have the antibodies. Symptoms that may occur include:\nBlood clots in the legs\n, arms or\nthe lungs\n. The clots can be in either the veins or in the arteries.\nRecurrent\nmiscarriages\nor\nstill birth\n.\nRash\n, in some people.\nIn rare cases, clots suddenly develop in many arteries over a period of days. This is called catastrophic anti-phospholipid syndrome (CAPS). It can lead to stroke as well as the clots in the kidney, liver, and other organs throughout the body, and gangrene in the limbs."}

The antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) cause the test to be abnormal in the laboratory.\nTypes of clotting tests may include:\nActivated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT)\nRussell viper venom time\nThromboplastin inhibition test\nTests for antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) will also be done. They include:\nAnticardiolipin antibody tests\nAntibodies to beta-2-glypoprotein I (Beta2-GPI)\nYour health care provider will diagnose APS if you have positive test for aPL or the lupus anticoagulant, and one or more of the following events:\nA blood clot\nRepeated miscarriages\nThe positive tests need to be confirmed after 12 weeks."}

If you have a positive test without other features of the disease, you will not have the diagnosis of APS.\nTreatment\nThe treatment for APS is directed at preventing complications from new blood clots forming or existing clots getting larger. You will need to take some form of blood-thinning medicine. If you also have an autoimmune disease, such as lupus, you will need to keep that condition under control as well.\nThe exact treatment will depend on how severe your condition is and the complications it is causing.\nANTIPHOSPHOLIPID ANTIBODY SYNDROME (APS)\nIn general, you will need treatment with a blood thinner for a long time if you have APS. Initial treatment may be heparin. This medicine is given by injection.\nIn most cases, warfarin (Coumadin), which is given by mouth, is then started. It is necessary to frequently monitor the level of anticoagulation."}

You will not take warfarin during pregnancy, but will be given heparin shots instead.\nIf you have SLE and APS, your provider may also recommend that you take hydroxychloroquine.\nCurrently, other types of blood thinning medicines are not recommended.\nCATASTROPHIC ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID SYNDROME (CAPS)\nTreatment for CAPS that involves a combination of anticoagulation therapy, high doses of corticosteroids, and plasma exchange has been effective in most people."}
