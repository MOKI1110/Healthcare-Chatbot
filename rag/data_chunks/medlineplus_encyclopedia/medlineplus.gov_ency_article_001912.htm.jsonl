Whether they measure actual intelligence or simply certain abilities  is controversial. IQ tests measure a specific functioning ability and may not accurately assess a person's talents or future potential. Results of any intelligence test may be culturally biased.\nThe more widely used tests include:\nWechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence\nStanford-Binet Intelligence Scales\nDifferential Ability Scales\nKaufman Assessment Battery for Children\nFunctioning abilities that are measured by these tests include language, mathematical, analytical, spatial (for example, reading a map), among others. Each test has its own scoring system.\nIn general, IQ tests are only one way to measure how well a person functions."}
