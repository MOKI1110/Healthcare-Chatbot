This is also called an allergic contact dermatitis. The result is most often an itchy, red\nrash\nwith bumps or blisters.\nCauses\nThe rash is caused by skin contact with the oils (resin) of certain plants. The oils most often enter the skin rapidly.\nPOISON IVY\nThis is one of the most frequent causes of skin rash among children and adults who spend time outdoors.\nThe plant has 3 shiny green leaves and a red stem.\nPoison ivy typically grows in the form of a vine, often along riverbanks. It can be found throughout much of the United States.\nPOISON OAK\nThis plant grows in the form of a shrub and has 3 leaves similar to poison ivy. Poison oak is mostly found on the West Coast.\nPOISON SUMAC\nThis plant grows as a woody shrub. Each stem contains 7 to 13 leaves arranged in pairs."}

Poison oak is mostly found on the West Coast.\nPOISON SUMAC\nThis plant grows as a woody shrub. Each stem contains 7 to 13 leaves arranged in pairs. Poison sumac grows abundantly along the Mississippi River.\nAFTER CONTACT WITH THESE PLANTS\nThe rash does not spread by the fluid from the blisters. Therefore, once a person has washed the oil off the skin, the rash does not often spread from person to person.\nThe plant oils may remain for a long time on clothing, pets, tools, shoes, and other surfaces. Contact with these items can cause rashes in the future if they are not cleaned well.\nSmoke from burning these plants can cause the same reaction.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nExtreme\nitching\nRed, streaky, patchy rash where the plant touched the skin\nRed bumps, which may form large, weeping blisters\nThe reaction can vary from mild to severe. In rare cases, the person with the rash needs to be treated in the hospital. The worst symptoms are often seen during days 4 to 7 after coming in contact with the plant. The rash may last for 1 to 3 weeks.\nFirst Aid\nFirst aid includes:\nWash the skin thoroughly with soap and warm water."}

Because the plant oil enters skin quickly, try to wash it off within 30 minutes.\nScrub under the fingernails with a brush to prevent the plant oil from spreading to other parts of the body.\nWash clothing and shoes with soap and hot water. The plant oils can linger on them.\nImmediately bathe animals to remove the oils from their fur.\nBody heat and sweating can aggravate the itching. Stay cool and apply cool compresses to your skin.\nCalamine lotion and hydrocortisone cream can be applied to the skin to reduce itching and blistering.\nBathing in lukewarm water with an oatmeal bath product, available in drugstores, may soothe itchy skin."}
