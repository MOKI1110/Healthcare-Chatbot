The main job of the kidneys is to remove wastes and excess water from the body.\nCauses\nChronic kidney disease (CKD) slowly gets worse over months or years. You may not notice any symptoms for some time. The loss of function may be so slow that you do not have symptoms until your kidneys have almost stopped working.\nThe final stage of CKD is called\nend-stage renal disease\n(ESRD). At this stage, the kidneys are no longer able to remove enough wastes and excess fluids from the body."}
