The small and medium-sized arteries become swollen and damaged.\nCauses\nArteries are the blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood to organs and tissues. The cause of polyarteritis nodosa is unknown. The condition occurs when certain immune cells attack the affected arteries. The tissues that are fed by the affected arteries do not get the oxygen and nourishment they need. Damage occurs as a result.\nMore adults than children get this disease.\nPeople with active\nhepatitis B\nor\nhepatitis C\nmay develop this disease.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms are caused by damage to affected organs. The skin, joints, muscles, gastrointestinal tract, heart, kidneys, and nervous system are often affected.\nSymptoms include:\nAbdominal pain\nDecreased appetite\nFatigue\nFever\nJoint aches\nMuscle aches\nUnintentional weight loss\nWeakness\nIf nerves are affected, you may have numbness, pain, burning, and weakness."}

Damage to the nervous system may cause\nstrokes\nor\nseizures\n.\nExams and Tests\nNo specific lab tests are available to diagnose polyarteritis nodosa. There are a number of disorders that have features similar to polyarteritis nodosa. These are known as \"mimics.\"\nYou will have a complete physical exam.\nLab tests that can help make the diagnosis and check for disease mimics include:\nComplete blood count\n(CBC) with differential, creatinine, tests for hepatitis B and C, and urinalysis\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate\n(ESR) or\nC-reactive protein\n(CRP)\nSerum protein electrophoresis\nSerum complement levels\nHIV test\nHepatitis B and hepatitis C tests\nCryoglobulins\nAnti-phospholipid antibodies\nBlood cultures\nOther blood tests will be done to check for similar conditions, such as\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\n(ANA) or\ngranulomatosis with polyangiitis\n(ANCA)\nArteriogram\nTissue biopsy\nTreatment\nTreatment involves medicines to suppress inflammation and the immune system."}

These may include steroids, such as prednisone. Similar medicines, such as azathioprine, methotrexate or mycophenolate that allow for reducing the dose of steroids are often used as well. Cyclophosphamide is used in severe cases.\nFor polyarteritis nodosa related to hepatitis, treatment may involve plasmapheresis and antiviral medicines.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nCurrent treatments with steroids and other medicines that suppress the immune system (such as azathioprine or cyclophosphamide) can improve symptoms and the chance of long-term survival.\nThe most serious complications most often involve the kidneys and gastrointestinal tract.\nWithout treatment, the outlook is poor.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nHeart attack\nIntestinal necrosis\nand perforation\nKidney failure\nStroke\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you develop symptoms of this disorder."}
