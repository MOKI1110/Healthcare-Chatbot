This bacterium causes infection when it gets into broken skin or mucus membranes, usually of the genitals. Syphilis is most often transmitted through sexual contact, although it also can be transmitted in other ways.\nSyphilis occurs worldwide, most commonly in urban areas. The number of cases is rising fastest in men who have sex with men (MSM). Young adults ages 20 to 35 are the highest-risk population. Because people may be unaware that they are infected with syphilis, many states require tests for syphilis before marriage. All pregnant women who receive prenatal care should be screened for syphilis to prevent the infection from passing to their newborn (congenital syphilis)."}

Symptoms of primary syphilis are:\nSmall, painless open sore or\nulcer\n(called a chancre) on the genitals, mouth, skin, or rectum that heals by itself in 3 to 6 weeks\nEnlarged lymph nodes\nin the area of the sore\nThe bacteria continue to grow in the body, but there are few symptoms until the second stage.\nThe symptoms of secondary syphilis start 4 to 8 weeks after the primary syphilis."}

At that point, syphilis becomes latent and may have no symptoms for many years. But, during this time, it may be damaging organs leading to tertiary syphilis.\nTertiary syphilis develops in untreated people. The symptoms depend on which organs have been affected.

Tetracycline cannot be used for treatment because it is dangerous to the unborn baby. Erythromycin may not prevent congenital syphilis in the baby. People who are allergic to penicillin should ideally be desensitized to it, and then treated with penicillin.\nSeveral hours after getting treatment for the early stages of syphilis, people may experience the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. This process is caused by an immune reaction to the breakdown products of the infection and not an allergic reaction to the antibiotic.\nSymptoms and signs of this reaction include:\nChills\nFever\nGeneral ill feeling (\nmalaise\n)\nHeadache\nMuscle and joint pain\nNausea\nRash\nThese symptoms usually disappear within 24 hours.\nFollow-up blood tests must be done at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months to ensure that the infection is gone.
