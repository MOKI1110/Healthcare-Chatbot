This can lead to loss of blood flow if left untreated.\nEmbolus --\nBlood clots\ncan block one of the arteries supplying the intestine. People who have had a heart attack or who have heart\narrhythmias\n, such as\natrial fibrillation\n, are at risk for this problem.\nNarrowing of the arteries -- The arteries that supply blood to the intestine may become narrowed or blocked from cholesterol buildup. When this happens in the arteries to the heart, it causes a heart attack."}

When this happens in the arteries to the heart, it causes a heart attack. When it happens in the arteries to the intestine, it causes intestinal ischemia.\nNarrowing of the veins -- The veins carrying blood away from the intestine may become blocked by blood clots. This blocks blood flow in the intestine. This is more common in people with liver disease, cancer, or blood clotting disorders.\nLow blood pressure -- Very low blood pressure in people who already have narrowing of the intestinal arteries may also cause loss of blood flow to the intestine. This often occurs in people with other serious medical problems.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom of intestinal ischemia is pain in abdomen. The pain is severe, even though the area is not very tender when touched. Other symptoms include:\nDiarrhea\nFever\nVomiting\nBlood in the stool\nExams and Tests\nLaboratory tests may show a high\nwhite blood cell (WBC) count\n(a marker of infection)."}

Sometimes, the only way to detect intestinal ischemia is with a surgical procedure.\nTreatment\nIn most cases, the condition needs to be treated with surgery. The section of intestine that has died is removed. The healthy remaining ends of the bowel are reconnected.\nIn some cases, a jejunostomy or\nileostomy\nis needed. The blockage of arteries to the intestine is corrected, if possible.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nDamage or death of the bowel tissue is a serious condition. This can result in death if not treated right away. The outlook depends on the cause. Prompt treatment can lead to a good outcome.\nPossible Complications\nDamage or death of the bowel tissue may require a jejunostomy or ileostomy."}

This may be short-term or permanent.\nPeritonitis\nis common in these cases. People who have a large amount of tissue death in the intestine can have problems absorbing nutrients. They can become dependent on getting nutrition through their veins.\nSome people may become severely ill with fever and a bloodstream infection (\nsepsis\n).\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have any severe abdominal pain.\nPrevention\nPreventive measures include:\nControlling risk factors, such as irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol\nNot smoking\nEating a nutritious diet\nQuickly treating hernias\nAlternative Names\nIntestinal necrosis; Ischemic bowel - small intestine; Dead bowel - small intestine; Dead gut - small intestine; Infarcted bowel - small intestine; Atherosclerosis - small intestine; Hardening of the arteries - small intestine\nImages\nMesenteric artery ischemia and infarction\nDigestive system\nSmall intestine\nReferences\nCameron J."}
