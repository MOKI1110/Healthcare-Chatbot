It affects the skin, hair, eyes, teeth, and nervous system.\nCauses\nIP is caused by an\nX-linked dominant\ngenetic defect that occurs on a gene known as IKBKG.\nBecause the gene defect occurs on the X chromosome, the condition is most often seen in females. When it occurs in males, it is usually lethal in the fetus and results in miscarriage.\nSymptoms\nWith the skin symptoms, there are 4 stages. Infants with IP are born with streaky,\nblistering\nareas. In stage 2, when the areas heal, they turn into rough bumps. In stage 3, the bumps go away, but leave behind darkened skin, called\nhyperpigmentation\n. After several years, the skin returns to normal."}

In stage 4, there may be areas of lighter-colored skin (\nhypopigmentation\n) that are thinner.\nIP is associated with\ncentral nervous system\nproblems, including:\nDelayed development\nLoss of movement (paralysis)\nIntellectual disability\nMuscle spasms\nSeizures\nPeople with IP may also have abnormal teeth,\nhair loss\n, and\nvision problems\n.\nExams and Tests\nYour child's health care provider will perform a physical exam, look at the eyes, and test muscle movement.\nThere may be unusual patterns and blisters on the skin, as well as bone abnormalities. An eye exam may reveal\ncataracts\n,\nstrabismus\n(crossed eyes), or other problems.\nTo confirm the diagnosis, these tests may be done:\nBlood tests\nSkin biopsy\nCT\nor\nMRI\nscan of the brain\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for IP. Treatment is aimed at the individual symptoms. For example, glasses may be needed to improve vision."}
