Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nGastrointestinal bleeding\nGastrointestinal bleeding\nGastrointestinal (GI) bleeding refers to any bleeding that starts in the GI tract.\nBleeding may come from any site along the GI tract, but is often divided into:\nUpper GI bleeding: The upper GI tract includes the esophagus (the tube from the mouth to the stomach), stomach, and first part of the small intestine (duodenum).\nLower GI bleeding: The lower GI tract includes most of the small intestine, and the entire large intestine, rectum, and anus.\nConsiderations\nThe amount of GI bleeding may be so small that it can only be detected on a lab test, such as the fecal occult blood test or fecal immunochemical test. Other signs of GI bleeding include:\nDark, tarry stools\nLarger amounts of blood passed from the rectum\nSmall amounts of blood in the toilet bowl, on toilet paper, or in streaks on stool (feces)\nVomiting blood\nMassive bleeding from the GI tract can be dangerous or even life threatening."}
