One gland is located on top of each kidney.\nInformation\nEach adrenal gland is about the size of the top part of the thumb. The outer part of the gland is called the cortex. It produces steroid hormones such as cortisol, aldosterone, and hormones that can be changed into testosterone. The inner part of the gland is called the medulla. It produces epinephrine and norepinephrine. These hormones are also called adrenaline and noradrenaline.\nWhen the glands produce more or less hormones than normal, you can become sick. This might happen at birth or later in life.\nThe adrenal glands can be affected by many diseases, such as\nautoimmune disorders\n, infections,\ntumors\n, and bleeding. Some are permanent and some go away over time. Medicines can also affect the adrenal glands.\nThe pituitary, a small gland at the bottom of the brain, releases a hormone called ACTH that stimulates the adrenal cortex to make its hormones."}
