Your team may include a doctor, a non-doctor specialist as well as others. Non-doctor specialists are professionals such as a physician assistant, nurse practitioner, or physical therapist.\nOrthopedic surgeons receive 5 or more extra years of training after medical school. They specialize in the care of disorders of the bones, muscles, tendons, and ligaments. They are trained to manage joint problems with both operative and non-operative techniques.\nPhysical medicine and rehabilitation doctors have 4 or more extra years of training after medical school. They specialize in this type of care. They are also referred to as physiatrists. They do not perform surgery, although they can give joint and soft tissue injections.\nSports medicine physicians are doctors with experience in sports medicine. They have a primary specialty in family practice, internal medicine, emergency medicine, pediatrics, or physical medicine and rehabilitation."}
