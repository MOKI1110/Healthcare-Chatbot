Therefore, your diet may influence your weight, appetite, and the amounts of vitamins in your body. DO NOT limit protein too much, because it can result in a lack of certain\namino acids\n.\nRecommendations\nThe changes you will need to make will depend on how well your liver is working. Talk to your provider about the kind of diet that is best for you so that you get the right amount of nutrition.\nGeneral recommendations for people with severe liver disease include:\nEat large amounts of carbohydrate foods. Carbohydrates should be the major source of calories in this diet.\nEat a moderate intake of fat, as prescribed by the provider. The increased carbohydrates and fat help prevent protein breakdown in the liver.\nHave about 1.2 to 1.5 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight."}

Ask your provider if you should take vitamin D supplements.\nLimit the amount of sodium you eat to 2000 milligrams per day or less to reduce fluid retention.\nSAMPLE MENU\nBreakfast\n1 orange\nCooked oatmeal with milk and sugar\n1 slice of whole-wheat toast\nStrawberry jam\nCoffee or tea\nMid-morning snack\n4 to 8 ounces (240 milliliters) of milk or piece of fruit\nLunch\n4 ounces (110 grams) of cooked lean fish, poultry, or meat\nA starch item (such as potatoes)\nA cooked vegetable\nSalad\n2 slices of whole-grain bread\n1 tablespoon (20 grams) of jelly\nFresh fruit\n8 ounces of milk\nMid-afternoon snack\n4 to 8 ounces of milk with graham crackers\nDinner\n4 ounces (110"}
