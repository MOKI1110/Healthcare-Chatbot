Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTranscranial Doppler ultrasound\nTranscranial Doppler ultrasound\nTranscranial doppler ultrasound (TCD) is a diagnostic test. It measures blood flow to and within the brain.\nHow the Test is Performed\nTCD uses sound waves to create images of the blood flow inside the brain.\nThis is how the test is performed:\nYou lie on your back on a padded table with your head and neck on a pillow. Your neck is stretched slightly. Or you may sit on a chair.\nThe technician applies a water-based gel on your temples and eyelids, under your jaw, and at the base of your neck. The gel helps the sound waves get into your tissues.\nA wand, called a transducer, is moved over the area being tested. The wand sends out sound waves. The sound waves go through your body and bounce off the area being studied (in this case, your brain and blood vessels).\nA computer looks at the pattern that the sound waves create when they bounce back. It creates a picture from the sound waves."}

It creates a picture from the sound waves. The Doppler creates a \"whooshing\" sound, which is the sound of your blood moving through the arteries and veins.\nThe test can take 30 minutes to 1 hour to complete.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed for this test. You do not need to change into a medical gown.\nRemember to:\nRemove contact lenses before the test if you wear them.\nKeep your eyes closed when gel is applied to your eyelids so you don't get it in your eyes.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe gel may feel cold on your skin. You may feel some pressure as the transducer is moved around your head and neck. The pressure should not cause any pain. You may also hear a \"whooshing\" sound."}
