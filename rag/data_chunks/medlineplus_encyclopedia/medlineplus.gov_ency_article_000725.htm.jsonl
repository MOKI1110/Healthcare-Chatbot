Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood from the heart to other places in your body.\nCauses\nOne of the most common causes of arterial insufficiency is\natherosclerosis\nor \"hardening of the arteries.\" Fatty material (called plaque) builds up on the walls of your arteries. This causes them to become narrow and stiff. As a result, it is hard for blood to flow through your arteries.\nBlood flow may be suddenly stopped due to a\nblood clot\n."}

Clots can form on the plaque or less often travel from another place such as the heart or other artery (also called embolus).\nSymptoms\nSymptoms depend on where your arteries become narrowed:\nIf it affects your heart arteries, you may have\nchest pain\n(angina pectoris) or a\nheart attack\n.\nIf it affects your brain arteries, you may have a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or\nstroke\n.\nIf it affects the arteries that bring blood to your legs, you may have frequent\nleg cramping when you walk\ncalled claudication.\nIf it affects the arteries in your belly area, you may have\npain after you eat\ncalled abdominal angina (due to mesenteric ischemia).\nImages\nArteries of the brain\nDevelopmental process of atherosclerosis\nReferences\nGoodney PP.
