The condition is also called Volkmann ischemic contracture.\nCauses\nVolkmann contracture occurs when there is a lack of blood flow (ischemia) to the forearm. This occurs when there is increased pressure due to swelling, a condition called\ncompartment syndrome\n.\nInjury to the arm, including a crush injury or\nfracture\n, can lead to swelling that presses on blood vessels and decreases blood flow to the arm. A prolonged decrease in blood flow injures the nerves and muscles, causing them to become stiff (scarred) and shortened.\nWhen the muscle shortens, it pulls on the joint at the end of the muscle just as it would if it were normally contracted. But because it is not elastic, the joint remains bent and stuck. This condition is called a\ncontracture\n.\nIn Volkmann contracture, the muscles of the forearm are severely injured."}

But because it is not elastic, the joint remains bent and stuck. This condition is called a\ncontracture\n.\nIn Volkmann contracture, the muscles of the forearm are severely injured. This leads to contracture deformities of the fingers, hand, and wrist.\nThere are three levels of severity in Volkmann contracture:\nMild -- contracture of 2 or 3 fingers only, with no or limited loss of feeling.\nModerate -- all fingers are bent (flexed) and the thumb is stuck in the palm; the wrist may be stuck in a bent position, and there is usually loss of some feeling in the hand.\nSevere -- all muscles in the forearm that both flex and extend the wrist and fingers are involved; this is a severely disabling condition. There is minimal movement of the fingers and wrist.\nConditions that can cause increased pressure in the forearm include:\nAnimal bites\nA forearm or elbow fracture\nBleeding disorders\nBurns\nInjection of certain medicines into the forearm\nInjury of the blood vessels in the forearm\nSurgery on the forearm\nExcessive exercise -- this would not cause severe contractures\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of Volkmann contracture affect the forearm, wrist, and hand."}

If your provider suspects Volkmann contracture, detailed questions will be asked about past injury or conditions that affected the arm.\nTests that may be done include:\nX-ray of the arm\nTests of the muscles and nerves to check their function\nTreatment\nThe first goal is to prevent the injury that can lead to the contracture. This can be treatment to reduce and fix any fracture and correct any circulation problem. The compartments may need to be released to avoid any excessive swelling that can lead to muscle injury and contractures.\nThe second goal of treatment is to help people regain some or full use of the arm and hand."}

Treatment depends on the severity of the contracture:\nFor mild contracture, muscle stretching exercises and splinting the affected fingers may be done. Surgery may be needed to make the\ntendons longer\n.\nFor moderate contracture, surgery is done to repair the muscles, tendons, and nerves. If needed, the arm bones are shortened.\nFor severe contracture, surgery is done to remove muscles, tendons, or nerves that are thickened, scarred, or dead. These are replaced by muscles, tendons, or nerves transferred from other body areas. Tendons that are still working may need to be made longer.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well a person does depends on the severity and stage of disease at the time treatment is started.\nThe outcome is usually good for people with mild contracture. They may regain normal function of their arm and hand."}
