Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nWhole breast radiation therapy\nWhole breast radiation therapy\nWhole breast radiation therapy uses high-powered x-rays to kill\nbreast cancer\ncells. With this type of directed radiation therapy, the whole breast (or chest wall if the breast was removed) receives the radiation treatment.\nCancer cells multiply faster than normal cells in the body. Because radiation is most harmful to quickly growing cells, radiation therapy damages cancer cells more than it damages the slower growing normal cells. This prevents the cancer cells from growing and dividing, and leads to cancer cell death.\nDescription\nThis type of radiation is delivered by an x-ray machine that delivers a precise area of radiation either to the whole breast, or the chest wall (if done after\nmastectomy\n). Sometimes, radiation will also target the lymph nodes in the armpit or neck area or under the breast bone.\nYou may receive radiation treatment either in a hospital or in a private outpatient radiation center. You will go home after each treatment."}

You will go home after each treatment. A typical course of treatment is given 5 days a week for 3 to 6 weeks. During treatment, the treatment beam is on for only a few minutes. Often each treatment is scheduled the same time each day for your convenience. You are not radioactive after treatment.\nBefore you have any radiation treatment, you will meet with the radiation oncologist. This is a doctor who specializes in radiation therapy.\nBefore radiation is delivered there is a planning process called a \"simulation\" where the cancer and normal tissues are mapped. Sometimes the doctor will recommend small skin marks called \"tattoos\" to help line you up and improve the accuracy of the radiation therapy.\nSome centers use ink tattoos. These marks are permanent, but are most often smaller than a mole. These cannot be washed off, and you can bathe and shower normally. After treatment, if you want the marks removed, laser or surgery can be used.\nSome centers use marks that can be washed off."}

This can help limit radiation to the heart and lungs. You may be asked to hold your breath while the radiation is being delivered. You may  have a mouthpiece to help regulate your breathing.\nMost often, you will receive radiation treatment for between 1 and 5 minutes."}

Each day you will be in and out of the treatment center in less than 20 minutes on average.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nAfter surgery, cancer cells may remain in the breast tissue or lymph nodes. Radiation can help kill the remaining cancer cells. When radiation is delivered after surgery is performed, it is called adjuvant (additional) treatment.\nAdding radiation therapy can kill the remaining cancer cells and lower the risk of the cancer growing back.\nWhole breast radiation therapy may be given for several different cancer types:\nFor\nductal carcinoma in situ\n(DCIS)\nFor stage I or II breast cancer, after\nlumpectomy\nor partial mastectomy (breast-conserving surgery)\nFor more advanced breast cancer, sometimes even after full mastectomy  to reduce risk of recurrence\nFor cancer that has spread to local lymph nodes (in the neck or armpit or chest)\nFor widespread breast cancer, as a palliative treatment to relieve symptoms\nBefore the Procedure\nTell your health care provider what medicines"}

You may be asked to wear a special bra.\nAfter the Procedure\nYou are not radioactive after radiation treatments. It is safe to be around others, including babies or children. As soon as the machine stops, there is no more radiation in the room.\nRadiation therapy, like any cancer therapy, can also damage or kill healthy cells. The death of healthy cells can lead to side effects. These side effects depend on the dose of radiation and how often you have the therapy.\nSide effects can develop early during treatment (within a few weeks) and be short-lived, or they may be more lasting long-term side effects."}
