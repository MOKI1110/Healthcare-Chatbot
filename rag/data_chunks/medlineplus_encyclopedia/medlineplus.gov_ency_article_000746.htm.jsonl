It affects one or more brain functions such as memory, thinking, language, judgment, or behavior.\nVascular dementia is caused by a series of small strokes over time.\nDementia may also be referred to as major\nneurocognitive disorder\n.\nCauses\nVascular dementia is the second most common cause of\ndementia\nafter\nAlzheimer disease\nin people over age 65.\nVascular dementia is caused by a series of small strokes.\nstroke\nis brain damage due to a blockage of the blood supply to any part of the brain. A stroke is also called an infarct. Multi-infarct means that more than one area in the brain has been injured due to a lack of blood.\nIf blood flow is stopped for longer than a few seconds, the brain cannot get oxygen. Brain cells can die, causing permanent damage.\nWhen strokes affect a small area, there may be no symptoms. These are called silent strokes."}

Brain cells can die, causing permanent damage.\nWhen strokes affect a small area, there may be no symptoms. These are called silent strokes. Over time, as more areas of the brain are damaged, the symptoms of dementia appear.\nNot all strokes are silent. Larger strokes that affect strength, sensation, or other brain and nervous system (neurologic) function can also lead to dementia.\nRisk factors for vascular dementia include:\nDiabetes\nHardening of the arteries (\natherosclerosis\n)\nHeart disease\nHigh blood pressure (\nhypertension\n)\nSmoking\nStroke or other vascular disease\nSymptoms of dementia may also be caused by other types of disorders of the brain. One such disorder is Alzheimer disease. Symptoms of Alzheimer disease can be similar to those of vascular dementia. Vascular dementia and Alzheimer disease are the most common causes of dementia, and may occur together.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of vascular dementia may develop gradually or may progress after each small stroke.\nSymptoms may begin suddenly after each stroke. Some people with vascular dementia may improve for short periods, but decline after having more silent strokes."}

Symptoms of vascular dementia will depend on the areas of the brain that are injured due to the stroke.\nEarly symptoms of vascular dementia can include:\nDifficulty performing cognitive tasks that used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing games (such as bridge), and learning new information or routines\nGetting lost on familiar routes\nLanguage problems, such as trouble finding the name of familiar objects\nLosing interest in things you previously enjoyed, flat mood\nMisplacing items\nMood changes leading to aggressive behavior\nPersonality changes and loss of social skills as well as behavioral changes\nPoor performance of job duties\nAs dementia worsens, symptoms are more obvious and the ability to take care of oneself declines."}
