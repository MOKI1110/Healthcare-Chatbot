Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLeg MRI scan\nLeg MRI scan\nA leg MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan of the leg uses strong magnets to create pictures of the leg. This may include the ankle, foot, and surrounding tissues.\nA leg MRI also creates\npictures of the knee.\nMRI does not use radiation (x-rays).\nSingle MRI images are called slices. The images can be stored on a computer or printed on film. One exam produces many slices.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will be asked to wear a hospital gown or clothes without metal zippers or snaps (such as sweatpants and a t-shirt). Make sure you take off your watch, jewelry and wallet. MRI can pull on any metallic objects. Some types of metal can cause blurry images.\nYou will lie on a narrow table that slides into a tunnel-like scanner.\nSome exams use a special dye (contrast). Most of the time, you will get the dye through a vein in your arm or hand before the test. Sometimes, the dye is given into a joint. The dye helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly.\nDuring the MRI, the person who operates the machine will watch you from another room."}

The test most often lasts 30 to 60 minutes, but may take longer.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan.\nTell your health care provider if you are afraid of closed spaces (have claustrophobia). You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious. Your provider may suggest an \"open\" MRI, in which the machine is not as close to the body.\nBefore the test, tell your provider if you have:\nBrain aneurysm clips\nCertain types of artificial heart valves\nHeart defibrillator or pacemaker\nInner ear (cochlear) implants\nKidney disease or dialysis (you may not be able to receive contrast)\nRecently placed artificial joints or surgery with metal plates and screws\nCertain types of vascular\nstents\nWorked with sheet metal (you may need tests to check for metal pieces in your eyes)\nBecause the MRI contains strong magnets, metal objects are not allowed into the room with the MRI scanner:\nPens, pocketknives, and eyeglasses m"}

You will need to lie still. Too much movement can blur MRI images and cause errors.\nThe table may be hard or cold, but you can ask for a blanket or pillow. The machine makes loud thumping and humming noises when turned on. You can wear ear plugs to help block out the noise.\nAn intercom in the room allows you to speak to someone at any time. Some MRIs have televisions and special headphones to help the time pass.\nThere is no recovery time, unless you were given a medicine to relax."}

There have been no reported side effects from the magnetic fields and radio waves.\nIt is also safe to have MRI performed during pregnancy. No side effects or complications have been proven.\nThe most common type of contrast (dye) used is gadolinium. It is very safe. Allergic reactions are rare. However, gadolinium can be harmful to people with kidney problems that need dialysis. If you have kidney problems, please tell your provider before the test.\nThe strong magnetic fields created during an MRI can cause heart pacemakers and other implants to not work as well. It can also cause a piece of metal inside your body to move or shift."}
