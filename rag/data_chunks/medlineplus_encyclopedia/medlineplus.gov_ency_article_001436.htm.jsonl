An intermediate tumor is one that is between\nbenign\n(slow-growing and unlikely to spread) and\nmalignant\n(fast-growing, aggressive, and likely to spread).\nCauses\nGanglioneuroblastoma mostly occurs in children ages 2 to 4 years. The tumor affects boys and girls equally. It occurs rarely in adults. Tumors of the nervous system have different degrees of differentiation. This is based on how the tumor cells look under the microscope. It can predict whether or not they are likely to spread.\nBenign tumors are less likely to spread. Malignant tumors are aggressive, grow quickly, and often spread. A\nganglioneuroma\nis less malignant in nature. A\nneuroblastoma\n(occurring in children over 1 year old) is usually malignant.\nA ganglioneuroblastoma may be only in one area or it may be widespread, but it is usually less aggressive than a neuroblastoma."}
