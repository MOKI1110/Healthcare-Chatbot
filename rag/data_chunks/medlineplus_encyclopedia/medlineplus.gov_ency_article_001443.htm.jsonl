It can destroy the muscles, skin, and underlying tissue. The word \"necrotizing\" refers to something that causes body tissue to die.\nCauses\nMany different types of bacteria can cause this infection. A very severe and usually deadly form of necrotizing soft tissue infection is due to the bacteria\nStreptococcus pyogenes\n, which is sometimes called \"flesh-eating bacteria\" or strep.\nNecrotizing soft tissue infection develops when the bacteria enters the body, usually through a minor cut or scrape. The bacteria begin to grow and release harmful substances (toxins) that kill tissue and affect blood flow to the area. With flesh-eating strep, the bacteria also make chemicals that block the body's ability to respond to the organism."}
