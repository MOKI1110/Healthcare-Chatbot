A blood test can be done to see how much of this protein you have in your blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nCertain medicines can change blood test results.\nTell your health care provider about all the medicines you take.\nYour provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test. This may include blood thinners.\nDo not stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou may need this test if you have an unexplained blood clot or a family history of blood clots. Protein C helps control blood clotting."}

This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou may need this test if you have an unexplained blood clot or a family history of blood clots. Protein C helps control blood clotting. A lack of this protein or a problem with the function of this protein may cause blood clots to form in veins abnormally.\nThe test is also used to screen relatives of people who are known to have\nprotein C deficiency\n. It may also be done to find the reason for repeated miscarriages.\nNormal Results\nNormal values are 60% to 150% inhibition.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA lack (deficiency) of protein C can lead to excess clotting. These clots tend to form in veins, not arteries. Clotting can occur in unusual areas such as abdominal veins or veins in the brain.\nProtein C deficiency can be passed down through families (inherited)."}
