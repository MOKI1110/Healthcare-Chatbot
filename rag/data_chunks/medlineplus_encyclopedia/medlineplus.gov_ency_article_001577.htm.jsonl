These rare genetic disorders cause problems with the development of bone, cartilage, and connective tissue.\nAchondroplasia is caused by a change (mutation) in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) gene. This prevents bone growth and mainly affects the long bones in the arms and legs. People with achondroplasia have a short stature, with an average height under 4 feet 6 inches (137 centimeters).\nAchondroplasia may be inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. This means that if a child gets the defective gene from one parent, the child will have the disorder. If one parent has achondroplasia, the infant has a 50% chance of inheriting the disorder. If both parents have the condition, the infant's chance of being affected increases to 75%.\nHowever, most cases (about 80%) appear as spontaneous mutations."}

If both parents have the condition, the infant's chance of being affected increases to 75%.\nHowever, most cases (about 80%) appear as spontaneous mutations. This means that two parents without achondroplasia may give birth to a baby with the condition.\nSymptoms\nAchondroplastic dwarfism results in the following:\nUnusually large head\nLarge forehead\nand flat bridge of the nose\nCrowded or crooked teeth\nShort stature (well below the average height for a person of the same age and sex)\nAverage size trunk with short arms and legs (especially the upper arms and thighs)\nBowed legs\nLimited range of motion of the elbows\nSpine curvatures called\nkyphosis\nand\nlordosis\nShort fingers with an extra space between the ring and middle finger (trident hand)\nDecreased muscle tone in infants\nAlmost all people with achondroplasia have normal intelligence and will have a normal lifespan."}

Children with the disorder may develop at a slower rate than other children the same age.\nExams and Tests\nDuring pregnancy, a prenatal ultrasound may show excessive amniotic fluid surrounding the unborn infant.\nExamination of the infant after birth shows increased front-to-back head size. X-rays of the long bones can reveal achondroplasia in the newborn.\nCT scan or MRI of the brain may be done if there are signs of \"water on the brain\" (\nhydrocephalus\n).\nNeuroimaging is needed to check the base of the head to look for signs of spinal cord compression.\nSleep studies help detect problems with sleep apnea.\nChildren with achondroplasia will need ongoing monitoring as they grow to check for health problems that can develop.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for achondroplasia."}

Even in adulthood, people with dwarfism may be stared at or treated differently. Connecting with others affected by the disorder can help children and their families feel less alone.\nMore information and support for people with achondroplasia and their families can be found at:\nHuman Growth Foundation -\nwww.hgfound.org/support-groups\nLittle People of America -\nwww.lpaonline.org\nMAGIC Foundation -\nwww.magicfoundation.org\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAdult heights typically are 46 to 57 inches (1.18 to 1.45 meters) for men and 44 to 54 inches (1.12 to 1.36 meters) for women.
