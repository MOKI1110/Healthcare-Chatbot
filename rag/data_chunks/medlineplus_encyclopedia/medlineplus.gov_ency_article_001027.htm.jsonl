Light rays that enter the eye are focused by the cornea and lens into images that are formed on the retina.\nThe most common type of retinal detachment is often due to a tear or hole in the retina. This type of detachment is called a rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. Eye fluid may leak through this opening. This causes the retina to separate from the underlying tissues, much like a bubble under wallpaper. This is most often caused by a condition called posterior vitreous detachment. It can also be caused by trauma and severe nearsightedness. A family history of retinal detachment also increases your risk.\nAnother type of retinal detachment is called tractional detachment."}

It can also be caused by trauma and severe nearsightedness. A family history of retinal detachment also increases your risk.\nAnother type of retinal detachment is called tractional detachment. This type occurs in people who have uncontrolled diabetes, had retinal surgery before, or have long-term (chronic) inflammation.\nWhen the retina becomes detached, bleeding from nearby blood vessels can cloud the inside of the eye so that you may not see clearly or at all. Central vision becomes severely affected if the\nmacula\nbecomes detached. The macula is the part of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed vision.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of detached retina can include:\nBright flashes of light, especially in\nperipheral\nvision.\nBlurred vision\n.\nNew floaters in the eye that appear suddenly.\nShadowing or decreased peripheral vision that seems like a curtain or shade across your vision.\nThere is usually no pain in or around the eye.\nExams and Tests\nThe ophthalmologist (eye doctor) will examine your eyes."}

Tests to check the retina and pupil may include:\nUsing special dye and a camera to look at blood flow in the retina (fluorescein angiography)\nChecking pressure inside the eye (\ntonometry\n)\nExamining the back part of the eye, including the retina (\nophthalmoscopy\n)\nChecking eyeglass prescription (\nrefraction test\n)\nChecking\ncolor vision\nChecking the smallest letters that can be read (\nvisual acuity\n)\nChecking structures at the front of the eye (\nslit-lamp examination\n)\nUltrasound\nof the eye\nTreatment\nMost people with a retinal detachment need\nsurgery\n. Surgery may be done right away or within a short time after diagnosis. Some types of surgery can be done in your eye doctor's office.\nLasers may be used to seal tears or holes in the retina before a retinal detachment occurs.\nIf you have a small detachment, your eye doctor may place a gas bubble in the eye. This is called pneumatic retinopexy. It helps the retina float back into place."}

These procedures include:\nScleral buckle to gently push the eye wall up against the retina\nVitrectomy to remove gel or scar tissue pulling on the retina, used for the largest tears and detachments\nTractional retinal detachments may be watched for a while before surgery. If surgery is needed, a vitrectomy is usually done.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well you do after a retinal detachment depends on the location and extent of the detachment and early treatment. If the macula was not damaged, the outlook with treatment can be excellent.\nSuccessful repair of the retina does not always fully restore vision.\nSome detachments cannot be repaired.\nPossible Complications\nA retinal detachment causes loss of vision."}

Surgery to repair it may help restore some or all of your vision.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nA retinal detachment is an urgent problem that requires medical attention within 24 hours of the first symptoms of new flashes of light and floaters.\nPrevention\nUse protective eye wear to prevent eye trauma, especially when playing racquet sports. Control your blood sugar carefully if you have diabetes. See your eye care professional once a year. You may need more frequent visits if you have risk factors for retinal detachment.
