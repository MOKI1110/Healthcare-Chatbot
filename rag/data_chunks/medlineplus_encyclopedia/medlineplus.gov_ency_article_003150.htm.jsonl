Back pain and/or leg pain may also be present.\nSome pain during your period is normal, but a large amount of pain is not. The medical term for painful menstrual periods is dysmenorrhea.\nConsiderations\nMany women have painful periods. Sometimes, the pain makes it hard to do normal household, job, or school-related activities for a few days during each menstrual cycle. Painful menstruation is the leading cause of lost time from school and work among women in their teens and 20s.\nCauses\nPainful menstrual periods fall into two groups, depending on the cause:\nPrimary dysmenorrhea\nSecondary dysmenorrhea\nPrimary dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain that occurs around the time that menstrual periods first begin in otherwise healthy young women. In most cases, this pain is not related to a specific problem with the uterus or other pelvic organs."}

It is often related to problems in the uterus or other pelvic organs, such as:\nEndometriosis\nFibroids\nIntrauterine device\n(IUD) made of copper\nPelvic inflammatory\ndisease\nPremenstrual syndrome\n(PMS)\nSexually transmitted infection\nStress and anxiety\nHome Care\nThe following steps may help you to avoid prescription medicines:\nApply a heating pad to your lower belly area, below your belly button."}
