Tissue is taken (biopsy) from any unusual growth or lymph nodes.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis procedure is done in the hospital. You will be given\ngeneral anesthesia\nso that you are asleep and do not feel any pain. A tube (endotracheal tube) is placed in your nose or mouth to help you breathe.\nA small surgical cut is made just above the breastbone. A device called a mediastinoscope is inserted through this cut and gently passed into the mid-part of the chest.\nTissue samples are taken of the lymph nodes around the airways. The scope is then removed and the surgical cut is closed with stitches.\nA chest x-ray will often be taken at the end of the procedure.\nThe procedure takes about 60 to 90 minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou must sign an informed consent form."}

This is called staging.\nThis procedure is also done for certain infections (tuberculosis, sarcoidosis) and\nautoimmune disorders\n.\nNormal Results\nBiopsies of lymph node tissues are normal and do not show signs of cancer or infection.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal findings may indicate:\nHodgkin disease\nLung cancer\nLymphoma\nor other tumors\nSarcoidosis\nThe spread of disease from one body part to another\nTuberculosis\nRisks\nThere is a risk of puncturing the esophagus, trachea, or blood vessels. In some cases, this can lead to bleeding that can be life threatening. To fix the injury, the breastbone would need to be split and the chest opened.\nImages\nMediastinoscopy\nReferences\nTriplette M, Varghese TK, Cheng G-S. Mediastinal tumors and cysts.
