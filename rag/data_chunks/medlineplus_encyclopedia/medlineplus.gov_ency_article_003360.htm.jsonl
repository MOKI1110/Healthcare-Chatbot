Most of the time blood is\ndrawn from a vein\nlocated on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\nIn infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin.\nThe blood collects in a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip.\nA bandage is put over the spot to stop any bleeding.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed.\nFor children, it may be helpful to explain how the test will feel and why it is done. This may make the child feel less nervous.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is used to screen people at risk for lead poisoning. This may include industrial workers and children who live in urban areas."}

This may include industrial workers and children who live in urban areas. The test is also used to diagnose lead poisoning when a person has symptoms of the condition. It is also used to measure how well treatment for lead poisoning is working. Lead is common in the environment, so it is often found in the body in low levels.\nNormal Results\nSmall amounts of lead in adults are not thought to be harmful. However, even low levels of lead can be dangerous to infants and children. It can cause\nlead poisoning\nthat leads to problems in mental development.\nAdults:\nLess than 10 micrograms per deciliter ( µg/dL) or 0.48 micromoles per liter ( µmol/L) of lead in the blood\nChildren:\nLess than 3.5  µg/dL or 0.17  µmol/L of lead in the blood\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIn adults, a blood lead level of 5  µg/dL or 0.24  µmol/L or above is considered elevated."}
