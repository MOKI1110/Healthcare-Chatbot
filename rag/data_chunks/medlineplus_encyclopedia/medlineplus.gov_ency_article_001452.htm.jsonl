The disorder involves the skin, nervous system, eyes,\nendocrine\nglands, urinary and reproductive systems, and bones.\nIt causes an unusual facial appearance and a higher risk for skin cancers and noncancerous tumors.\nCauses\nNevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome is a rare genetic condition. The main gene linked to the syndrome is known as PTCH (patched). A second gene, called SUFU, has also been associated with this condition.\nVariations in these genes are most commonly passed down through families as an\nautosomal dominant\ntrait. This means you develop the syndrome if either parent passes the gene to you. If either of your parents has this syndrome, you have a 50% chance of having it."}
