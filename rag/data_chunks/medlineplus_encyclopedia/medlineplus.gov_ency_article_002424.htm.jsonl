It is the second most abundant mineral in the body. It is present in every cell of the body. Most of the phosphorus in the body is found in the bones and teeth.\nFunction\nThe main function of phosphorus is in the formation of bones and teeth.\nIt plays an important role in how the body uses\ncarbohydrates\nand fats. It is also needed for the body to make\nprotein\nfor the growth, maintenance, and repair of cells and tissues. Phosphorus also helps the body make ATP, a molecule the body uses to store energy.\nPhosphorus works with the B vitamins. It also helps with the following:\nKidney function\nMuscle contractions\nNormal heartbeat\nNerve signaling\nFood Sources\nThe main food sources are the protein food groups of meat and milk, as well as processed foods that contain sodium phosphate."}

A diet that includes the right amounts of calcium and protein will also provide enough phosphorus.\nWhole-grain breads and cereals contain more phosphorus than cereals and breads made from refined flour. However, the phosphorus is stored in a form that is not absorbed by humans.\nFruits and vegetables contain only small amounts of phosphorus.\nSide Effects\nPhosphorus is so readily available in the food supply that deficiency is rare.\nExcessively high levels of phosphorus in the blood, although rare, can combine with calcium to form deposits in soft tissues, such as muscle. High levels of phosphorus in blood only occur in people with severe kidney disease or severe dysfunction of their calcium regulation.\nRecommendations\nDosages for phosphorus, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine."}

DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA):\nThe average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people. An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence.\nAdequate Intake (AI):\nThis level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA. It is set at a level that is thought to ensure enough nutrition.\nDietary Reference Intakes of phosphorus:\n0 to 6 months: 100 milligrams per day (mg/day)*\n7 to 12 months: 275 mg/day*\n1 to 3 years: 460 mg/day\n4 to 8 years: 500 mg/day\n9 to 18 years: 1,250 mg\nAdults: 700 mg/day\nPregnant or lactating women:\nYounger than 18: 1,250 mg/day\nOlder than 18: 700 mg/day\n*AI or Adequate Intake\nAlternative Names\nDiet - phosphorus\nReferences\nKlemm KM, Klein MJ, Zhang Y."}
