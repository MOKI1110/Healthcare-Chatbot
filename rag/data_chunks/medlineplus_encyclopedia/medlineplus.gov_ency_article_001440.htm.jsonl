Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRed birthmarks\nRed birthmarks\nRed birthmarks are skin markings created by blood vessels close to the skin surface. They develop before or shortly after birth.\nCauses\nThere are two main categories of birthmarks:\nRed birthmarks are made up of blood vessels close to the skin surface. These are called vascular birthmarks.\nPigmented birthmarks\nare areas in which the color of the birthmark is different from the color of the rest of the skin.\nHemangiomas\nare a common type of vascular birthmark. Their cause is unknown. Their color is caused by the growth of blood vessels at the site. Different kinds of hemangiomas include:\nStrawberry hemangiomas (strawberry mark, nevus vascularis, capillary hemangioma, hemangioma simplex) may develop several weeks after birth. They may appear anywhere on the body, but are most often found on the neck and face."}

They may appear anywhere on the body, but are most often found on the neck and face. These areas consist of small blood vessels that are very close together.\nCavernous hemangiomas (angioma cavernosum, cavernoma) are similar to strawberry hemangiomas, but they are deeper and may appear as a red-blue spongy area of tissue filled with blood.\nSalmon patches\n(stork bites) are very common. Up to half of all newborns have them. They are small, pink, flat spots made up of small blood vessels that can be seen through the skin. They are most common on the forehead, eyelids, upper lip, between the eyebrows, and on the back of the neck. Salmon patches may be more noticeable when an infant cries or during temperature changes.\nPort-wine stains\nare flat hemangiomas made of expanded tiny blood vessels (capillaries). Port-wine stains on the face may be associated with\nSturge-Weber\nsyndrome. They are most often located on the face."}

The diagnosis is based on how the birthmark looks.\nTests to confirm deeper birthmarks include:\nSkin biopsy\nCT\nscan\nMRI\nof the area\nTreatment\nMany strawberry hemangiomas, cavernous hemangiomas, and salmon patches are temporary and do not need treatment.\nPort-wine stains may not need treatment unless they:\nAffect your appearance\nCause emotional distress\nAre painful\nChange in size, shape, or color\nMost permanent birthmarks are not treated before a child reaches school age or the birthmark is causing symptoms. Port-wine stains on the face are an exception."}

They should be treated at a young age to prevent emotional and social problems.\nLaser surgery\ncan be used to treat them.\nConcealing cosmetics may hide permanent birthmarks.\nOral or injected steroid medicine may reduce the size of a hemangioma that is growing quickly and affecting vision or vital organs.\nOther treatments for red birthmarks include:\nBeta-blocker medicines\nFreezing (\ncryotherapy\n)\nLaser surgery\nSurgical removal\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nBirthmarks rarely cause problems, other than changes in appearance. Many birthmarks go away on their own by the time a child reaches school age, but some are permanent. The following development patterns are typical for the different types of birthmarks:\nStrawberry hemangiomas usually grow quickly and stay the same size. Then they go away. Most strawberry hemangiomas are gone by the time a child is 9 years old."}

Patches on the back of the neck may not disappear.
