Everyone's spine naturally curves a bit. But people with scoliosis have a spine that curves too much. The spine might look like the letter C or S.\nCauses\nMost of the time, the cause of scoliosis is unknown. This is called idiopathic scoliosis. It is the most common type. It is grouped by age.\nIn children age 3 and younger, it is called infantile scoliosis.\nIn children age 4 through 10, it is called juvenile scoliosis.\nIn children age 11 through 18, it is called adolescent scoliosis.\nScoliosis most often affects girls. Some people are more likely to have curving of the spine. Curving generally gets worse during a growth spurt.\nOther types of scoliosis are:\nCongenital scoliosis: This type of scoliosis is present at birth. It occurs when the baby's ribs or spine bones do not form properly.\nNeuromuscular scoliosis: This type is caused by a nervous system problem that affects the muscles."}

Problems can include\ncerebral palsy\n,\nmuscular dystrophy\n, spina bifida, and\npolio\n.\nSymptoms\nMost often, there are no symptoms.\nIf there are symptoms, they may include:\nBackache or low-back pain that goes down the legs\nWeakness or tired feeling in the spine after sitting or standing for a long time\nUneven hips or shoulders (one shoulder may be higher than the other)\nShoulder pain\nSpine curves more to one side\nDifficulty with breathing or sitting\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. You will be asked to bend forward. This makes your spine easier to see. It may be hard to see changes in the early stages of scoliosis.\nThe exam may show:\nOne shoulder is higher than the other\nThe pelvis is tilted\nX-rays of the spine are done."}

But you should still be checked by your provider about every 6 months.\nIf you are still growing, your provider might recommend a back brace. A back brace prevents further curving. There are many different types of braces. What kind you get depends on the size and location of your curve. Your provider will pick the best one for you and show you how to use it."}

The rods are held down with hooks and screws until the bone heals together.\nAfter surgery, you may need to wear a brace for a while to keep the spine stable.\nScoliosis treatment may also include:\nEmotional support: Some children, especially teens, may be self-conscious when using a back brace.\nPhysical therapy and other specialists to help explain the treatments and make sure the brace fits correctly.\nSupport Groups\nSeek support and more information from\norganizations that specialize in scoliosis\n.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well a person with scoliosis does depends on the type, cause, and severity of the curve. The more severe the curving, the more likely it will get worse after the child stops growing.\nPeople with mild scoliosis do well with braces. They usually do not have long-term problems. Back pain may be more likely when the person gets older.\nThe outlook for those with neuromuscular or congenital scoliosis varies."}
