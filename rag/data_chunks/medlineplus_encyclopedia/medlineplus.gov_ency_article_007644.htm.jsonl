Most often, this involves bones of the legs, arms, or spine.\nAfter your recovery, if you have pain or other problems related to the hardware, you may have surgery to remove the hardware. This is called hardware removal surgery.\nDescription\nFor the procedure, you may be given medicine to numb the area (local anesthesia) while you are awake. Or, you may be put to sleep so you do not feel anything during the surgery (\ngeneral anesthesia\n).\nMonitors will keep track of your blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing during the surgery.\nDuring the surgery, your surgeon may:\nOpen the original incision or use new or longer incisions to remove hardware.\nRemove any scar tissue that has formed over the hardware.\nRemove the old hardware."}
