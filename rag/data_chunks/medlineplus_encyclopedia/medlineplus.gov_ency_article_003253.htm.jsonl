It is thought to be caused by hair growing into the skin in the crease between the buttocks.\nThis problem is more likely to occur in people who:\nAre obese\nExperience trauma or irritation in the area\nHave excess body hair, particularly coarse, curly hair\nHome Care\nWash normally and pat dry. Use a soft bristle scrub brush to prevent the hairs from becoming ingrown. Keep the hairs in this region short (shaving, laser, depilatory) which may decrease the risk of flare-ups and recurrence.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you notice any of the following around a pilonidal cyst:\nDrainage of pus\nRedness\nSwelling\nTenderness\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nYou will be asked for your medical history and given a\nphysical examination\n."}
