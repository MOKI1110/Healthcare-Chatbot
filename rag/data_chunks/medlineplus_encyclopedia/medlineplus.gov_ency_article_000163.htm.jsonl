Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHypertensive heart disease\nHypertensive heart disease\nHypertensive heart disease refers to heart problems that occur because of high blood pressure that is present over a long time.\nCauses\nHigh blood pressure means the pressure inside the blood vessels (called arteries) is too high. As the heart pumps against this pressure, it must work harder. Over time, this causes the heart muscle to thicken.\nBecause there are often no symptoms with high blood pressure, people can have the problem without knowing it. Symptoms most often do not occur until after many years of poor blood pressure control, when damage to the heart has occurred.\nEventually, the muscle may become so thick that it does not get enough oxygen. This can cause\nangina\n(chest pain). Without appropriate blood pressure control, the heart muscle can weaken over time and\nheart failure\nmay develop.\nHigh blood pressure also leads to thickening of the blood vessel walls."}

When combined with cholesterol deposits in the blood vessels, the risk of heart attack and stroke increases.\nHypertensive heart disease is the leading cause of illness and death from high blood pressure.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have high blood pressure and develop any symptoms.\nPrevention\nDiagnosing high blood pressure early can help prevent heart disease, stroke, eye problems, and chronic kidney disease.\nAll people age 18 and older should have their blood pressure checked every year."}

More frequent measurement may be needed for those with a history of high blood pressure readings or those with risk factors for high blood pressure.\nGuidelines can change as new information becomes available, Therefore, your provider may recommend more frequent checks based on your blood pressure levels and other health conditions.\nIf your blood pressure is high, you need to lower it and keep it under control.\nDo not stop or change high blood pressure medicines without talking to your provider.\nCarefully control diabetes and high cholesterol.\nAlternative Names\nHypertension - hypertensive heart; High blood pressure - hypertensive heart\nPatient Instructions\nHeart failure - what to ask your doctor\nHigh blood pressure - what to ask your doctor\nReferences\nBakris GL, Sorrentino MJ.
