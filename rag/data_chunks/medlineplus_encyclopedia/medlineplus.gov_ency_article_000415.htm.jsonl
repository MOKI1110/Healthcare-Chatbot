It involves pain and stiffness in the shoulders and often the hips.\nCauses\nPolymyalgia rheumatica most often occurs in people over 50 years old. The cause is unknown.\nPMR may occur before or with\ngiant cell arteritis\n(GCA; also called temporal arteritis). This is a condition in which blood vessels that supply blood to the head and eye (and rarely other sites) become inflamed.\nPMR can sometimes be hard to tell apart from\nrheumatoid arthritis\n(RA) in an older person. This uncertainty occurs when tests for rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP antibody are negative.\nSymptoms\nThe most common symptom is pain and stiffness in both shoulder regions and the neck. The pain and stiffness are worse in the morning. This pain most often progresses to the hip regions.\nFatigue is also present."}

The pain and stiffness are worse in the morning. This pain most often progresses to the hip regions.\nFatigue is also present. People with this condition find it increasingly hard to get out of bed and to move around.\nOther symptoms include:\nAppetite loss, which leads to\nweight loss\nDepression\nFever\nExams and Tests\nLab tests alone can't diagnose PMR. Most people with this condition have high markers of inflammation, such as the sedimentation rate (\nESR\n) and\nC-reactive protein\n(CRP).\nOther test results for this condition include:\nAbnormal levels of proteins in the blood\nAbnormal level of white blood cells\nAnemia\n(low red blood cell count)\nThese tests may also be used to monitor your condition.\nHowever, imaging tests such as x-rays of the shoulder or hips are not often helpful. These tests may reveal joint damage that is not related to recent symptoms. In difficult cases, ultrasound or MRI of the shoulder may be done. These imaging tests often show bursitis or low levels of joint inflammation.\nTreatment\nWithout treatment, PMR does not get better."}

In difficult cases, ultrasound or MRI of the shoulder may be done. These imaging tests often show bursitis or low levels of joint inflammation.\nTreatment\nWithout treatment, PMR does not get better. However, low doses of corticosteroids (such as prednisone, 10 to 20 mg per day) can markedly ease symptoms, often within a day or two.\nThe dose should then be slowly reduced to a very low level.\nTreatment needs to continue for 1 to 2 years. In some people, even longer treatment with low doses of prednisone is needed.\nCorticosteroids can cause many side effects such as weight gain, development of\ndiabetes\nor\nosteoporosis\n. You need to be watched closely if you are taking these medicines. If you are at risk for osteoporosis, your health care provider may recommend you take medicines to prevent this condition.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nFor most people, PMR goes away with treatment after 1 to 2 years. You might be able to stop taking medicines after this point, but check with your provider first.\nFor some people, symptoms return after they reduce or stop taking corticosteroids. In these cases, another medicine such as Sarilumab can be used."}

In these cases, another medicine such as Sarilumab can be used. Sarilumab is an injectable medication that blocks IL-6. IL-6 is a cytokine that is involved in inflammation.\nGiant cell arteritis may also be present or can develop later. If this is the case, the temporal artery would need to be evaluated and different treatment given.\nMore severe symptoms can make it harder for you to work or take care of yourself at home.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have weakness or stiffness in your shoulder and neck that does not go away. Also contact your provider if you have new symptoms such as fever, headache, and pain with chewing or loss of vision. These symptoms may be from giant cell arteritis.\nPrevention\nThere is no known prevention.\nAlternative Names\nPMR\nReferences\nAmerican College of Rheumatology website.
