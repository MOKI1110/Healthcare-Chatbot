Iron is considered an essential mineral because it is needed to make hemoglobin, a part of blood cells. The body cannot make it, so it must be taken in with the food we eat.\nFunction\nThe human body needs iron to make the oxygen-carrying proteins\nhemoglobin\nand myoglobin. Hemoglobin is found in red blood cells. Myoglobin is found in muscles.\nFood Sources\nThe best sources of iron include:\nDried beans\nDried fruits\nEggs (especially egg yolks)\nIron-fortified cereals\nLiver\nLean red meat (especially beef)\nOysters\nPoultry, dark red meat\nSalmon\nTuna\nWhole grains\nReasonable amounts of iron are also found in lamb, pork, and shellfish.\nIron from vegetables, fruits, grains, and supplements is harder for the body to absorb."}

Foods rich in\nvitamin C\n(such as citrus, strawberries, tomatoes, and potatoes) also increase iron absorption. Cooking foods in a cast-iron skillet can also help to increase the amount of iron provided.\nSome foods reduce iron absorption. For example, black teas contain substances that bind to dietary iron so it cannot be used by the body.\nSide Effects\nLOW IRON LEVEL\nThe human body stores some iron to replace any that is lost. However, a low iron level over a long period of time can lead to iron deficiency anemia."}

However, a low iron level over a long period of time can lead to iron deficiency anemia. Symptoms include lack of energy, shortness of breath, headache, irritability,\ndizziness\n, or weight loss. Physical signs of lack of iron are a pale tongue and spoon-shaped nails.\nThose at risk for a low iron level include:\nWomen who are menstruating, especially if they have heavy periods\nWomen who are pregnant or who have just had a baby\nLong-distance runners\nPeople with any type of bleeding in the digestive tract (for example, a bleeding ulcer)\nPeople who frequently donate blood\nPeople with gastrointestinal conditions that make it hard to absorb nutrients from food\nBabies and young children are at risk for a low iron level if they do not get the right foods. Babies moving to solid foods should eat iron-rich foods. Infants are born with enough iron to last about six months. An infant's extra iron needs are met by breast milk. Infants who are not breastfed should be given an iron supplement or iron-fortified infant formula.\nChildren between age 1 and 4 years grow fast."}

This uses up iron in the body. Children of this age should be given iron-fortified foods or an iron supplement.\nMilk is a very poor source of iron. Children who drink large quantities of milk and avoid other foods may develop \"milk anemia.\" The recommended milk intake is 2 to 3 cups (480 to 720 milliliters) per day for toddlers.\nTOO MUCH IRON\nThe genetic disorder called\nhemochromatosis\naffects the body's ability to control how much iron is absorbed. This leads to too much iron in the body. Treatment consists of a low-iron diet, no iron supplements, and phlebotomy (blood removal) on a regular basis.\nIt is unlikely that a person would take too much iron. However, children can sometimes develop iron poisoning by swallowing too many iron supplement pills or liquid."}

Symptoms of iron poisoning include:\nFatigue\nAnorexia\nDizziness\nNausea\nVomiting\nHeadache\nWeight loss\nShortness of breath\nGrayish color to the skin\nRecommendations\nDosages for iron, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): The average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people. An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence.\nAdequate Intake (AI): This level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA."}
