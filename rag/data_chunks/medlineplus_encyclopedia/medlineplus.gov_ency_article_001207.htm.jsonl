It may or may not involve the nervous system and breathing. Each one can cause different symptoms and may occur at different times throughout life.\nCauses\nNPD types A and B occur when cells in the body do not have an\nenzyme\ncalled acid sphingomyelinase (ASM). This substance helps break down (metabolize) a fatty substance called sphingomyelin, which is found in every cell in the body.\nIf ASM is missing or does not work properly, sphingomyelin builds up inside cells. This kills your cells and makes it hard for organs to work properly.\nType A occurs in all races and ethnicities."}

This kills your cells and makes it hard for organs to work properly.\nType A occurs in all races and ethnicities. It is more common in the Ashkenazi (Eastern European) Jewish population.\nType C occurs when the body cannot properly break down cholesterol and other fats (lipids). This leads to too much cholesterol in the liver and spleen and too much of other lipids in the brain. Type C is most common among Puerto Ricans of Spanish descent.\nType C1 is a variant of type C. It involves a defect that interferes with how cholesterol moves between brain cells. This type has only been seen in French Canadian people in Yarmouth County, Nova Scotia.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms vary. Other health conditions may cause similar symptoms. The early stages of the disease may only cause a few symptoms. A person may never have all the symptoms.\nType A usually begins in the first few months of life."}

Symptoms may include:\nAbdominal (belly area) swelling by 3 to 6 months of age\nCherry red spot at the back of the eye (on the\nretina\n)\nFeeding difficulties\nLoss of early motor skills (gets worse over time)\nType B symptoms are usually milder. They occur in late childhood or the teenage years. Abdominal swelling may occur in young children. There is almost no brain and nervous system involvement, such as loss of motor skills. Some children may have repeated respiratory infections.\nTypes C and C1 usually affects school-age children. However, it may occur any time between early infancy to adulthood."}

Enzyme replacement with olipudase alfa was approved by the FDA in 2022 to treat non-central nervous system symptoms.\nBone marrow transplants may be tried for type B. Enzyme replacement with olipudase alfa is approved by the FDA to treat non-central nervous system symptoms of type B. Researchers continue to study additional possible treatments, such as gene therapy.\nA medicine called miglustat is available for the nervous system symptoms of type C.\nHigh cholesterol may be managed with a healthy, low-cholesterol diet or medicines. However, research does not show that these methods stop the disease from getting worse or change how cells break down cholesterol."}

Genetic counseling and screening is recommended.\nContact your provider if your child has symptoms of this disease, including:\nDevelopmental problems\nFeeding problems\nPoor weight gain\nPrevention\nAll types of Niemann-Pick are\nautosomal recessive\n. This means that both parents are carriers. Each parent has one copy of the variant gene without having any signs of the disease themselves.\nWhen both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance that their child will have the disease and a 50% chance that their child will be a carrier.\nCarrier detection testing is only possible if the genetic defect is identified. The defects involved in types A and B have been well-studied."}
