Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRadionuclide cystogram\nRadionuclide cystogram\nA radionuclide cystogram is a special imaging\nnuclear scan\ntest. It checks how well your bladder and urinary tract work.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe specific procedure may vary slightly depending on the reason for the test.\nYou will lie down on a scanner table. After cleaning the urinary opening, your health care provider will place a thin, flexible tube, called a catheter, through the urethra and into the bladder. A liquid with radioactive material flows into the bladder until the bladder is full or you say that your bladder feels full.\nThe scanner detects radioactivity to check your bladder and urinary tract. When the scan is to be done, depends on the suspected problem. You may be asked to urinate into a urinal, bedpan, or towels while being scanned.\nTo test for incomplete bladder emptying, images may be taken with the bladder full. Then you will be allowed to get up and urinate into the toilet and return to the scanner."}

Then you will be allowed to get up and urinate into the toilet and return to the scanner. Images are taken immediately after emptying the bladder.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no special preparation needed. You will need to sign a consent form. You will be asked to wear a hospital gown. Remove jewelry and metal objects before the scan.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel some discomfort when the catheter is inserted. It may feel difficult or embarrassing to urinate while being observed. You cannot feel the radioisotope or the scanning.\nAfter the scan, you may feel slight discomfort for 1 or 2 days when you urinate. The urine may be slightly pink. Contact your provider if you have ongoing discomfort, a\nfever\n, or bright red urine.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to see how your bladder empties and fills. It can be used to check for urine reflux or a blockage in urine flow."}

It can be used to check for urine reflux or a blockage in urine flow. It is most often done to evaluate people with urinary tract infections, particularly children.\nNormal Results\nA normal value is no reflux or other abnormal urine flow, and no obstruction to the flow of urine. The bladder empties completely.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be due to:\nAbnormal bladder response to pressure. This could be due to a nerve problem or other disorder.\nBack flow of urine from the bladder into the ureters\n(vesicoureteric reflux)\nBlockage of the urethra (\nurethral obstruction\n). This is most commonly due to an enlarged prostate gland.\nRisks\nRisks are the same as for x-rays (radiation) and catheterization of the bladder.\nThere is a small amount of radiation exposure with any nuclear scan (it comes from the radioisotope, not the scanner). The exposure is less than with standard x-rays. The radiation is very mild. Nearly all the radiation is gone from your body in a short time."}
