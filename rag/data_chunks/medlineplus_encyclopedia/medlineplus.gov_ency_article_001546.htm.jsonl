It most often takes place in school or social settings.\nCauses\nSelective mutism is most common in children under age 5. The cause, or causes, are unknown. Most experts believe that children with the condition inherit a tendency to be anxious and inhibited. Most children with selective mutism have some form of extreme social fear (\nphobia\n).\nParents often think that the child is choosing not to speak. However in most cases, the child is truly unable to speak in certain settings.\nSome affected children have a family history of selective mutism, extreme shyness, or anxiety disorders, which may increase their risk for similar problems.\nThis syndrome is not the same as mutism. In selective mutism, the child can understand and speak, but is unable to speak in certain settings or environments."}

In selective mutism, the child can understand and speak, but is unable to speak in certain settings or environments. Children with mutism never speak.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nAbility to speak at home with family\nFear or anxiety around people they do not know well\nInability to speak in certain social situations\nShyness\nThis pattern must be seen for at least 1 month to be called selective mutism. (The first month of school does not count, because shyness is common during this period.)\nExams and Tests\nThere is no test for selective mutism. Diagnosis is based on the person's history of symptoms.\nTeachers and counselors should consider cultural issues, such as recently moving to a new country and speaking another language. Children who are uncertain about speaking a new language may not want to use it outside of a familiar setting. This is not selective mutism.\nThe person's history of mutism should also be considered. People who have been through trauma may show some of the same symptoms seen in selective mutism.\nTreatment\nTreating selective mutism involves behavior changes."}

The child's family and school should be involved. Certain medicines that treat anxiety and social phobia have been used safely and successfully.\nSupport Groups\nYou can find information and resources through\nselective mutism support groups\n.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nChildren with this syndrome can have different outcomes. Some may need to continue therapy for shyness and social anxiety into the teenage years, and possibly into adulthood.\nPossible Complications\nSelective mutism can affect the child's ability to function in school or social settings. Without treatment, symptoms may get worse.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if your child has symptoms of selective mutism, and it is affecting school and social activities.\nReferences\nBang JY, Feldman HM.
