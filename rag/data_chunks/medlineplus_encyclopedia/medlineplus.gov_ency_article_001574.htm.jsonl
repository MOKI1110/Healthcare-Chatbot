Almost everyone who receives the vaccine has immunity to rubella. Immunity means that your body has built a defense to the rubella virus.\nIn some adults, the vaccine may wear off. This means they are not fully protected. Women who may become pregnant and other adults may receive a booster shot.\nChildren and adults who were never vaccinated against rubella may also get this infection.\nSymptoms\nChildren generally have few symptoms."}

Adults may have a fever, headache, general discomfort (\nmalaise\n), and a runny nose before the rash appears. They may not notice the symptoms.\nOther symptoms may include:\nBruising (rare)\nInflammation of the eyes (bloodshot eyes)\nMuscle or joint pain\nExams and Tests\nA nasal or throat swab may be sent for culture.\nA blood test can be done to see if a person is protected against rubella. All women who may become pregnant should have this test. If the test is negative, they will receive the vaccine.\nTreatment\nThere is no treatment for this disease.\nTaking acetaminophen can help reduce fever.\nBirth defects that occur with congenital rubella syndrome can be treated.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nRubella is most often a mild infection.\nAfter an infection, people have immunity to the disease for the rest of their lives.\nPossible Complications\nComplications can occur in the unborn baby if the mother becomes infected during pregnancy. A\nmiscarriage\nor\nstillbirth\nmay occur."}

The rubella vaccine is recommended for all children. It is routinely given when children are 12 to 15 months old, but is sometimes given earlier during epidemics. A second vaccination (booster) is routinely given to children ages 4 to 6. MMR is a combination vaccine that protects against\nmeasles\n,\nmumps\n, and rubella.\nWomen of childbearing age most often have a blood test to see if they have immunity to rubella."}
