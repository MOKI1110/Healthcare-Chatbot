It also occurs in the United States.\nThe African type of BL is closely associated with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), the main cause of\ninfectious mononucleosis\n. The North American form of BL is not commonly linked to EBV.\nPeople with HIV/AIDS have an increased risk for this condition. BL is most often seen in males.\nSymptoms\nBL may first be noticed as a\nswelling of the lymph nodes\n(glands) in the head and neck. These swollen lymph nodes are often painless, but can grow very rapidly.\nIn the types commonly seen in the United States, the\ncancer\noften starts in the belly area (abdomen). The disease can also start in the ovaries, testes, brain, kidneys, liver, and spinal fluid.\nOther general symptoms may include:\nFever\nNight sweats\nUnexplained weight loss\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

If the cancer does not respond to chemotherapy alone, a\nbone marrow transplant\nmay be done.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMore than one half of people with BL can be cured with intensive chemotherapy. The cure rate may be lower if the cancer spreads to the bone marrow or spinal fluid."}
