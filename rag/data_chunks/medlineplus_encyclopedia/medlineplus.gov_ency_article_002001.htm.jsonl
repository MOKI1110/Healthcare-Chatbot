The name comes from the Greek word meaning \"done by hand.\" However, the roots of the profession can be traced back to the beginning of recorded time.\nChiropractic was developed by Daniel David Palmer, a self-taught healer in Davenport, Iowa. Palmer wanted to find a cure for disease and illness that did not use medicines. He studied the structure of the spine and the ancient art of moving the body with the hands (manipulation). Palmer started the Palmer School of Chiropractic, which still exists today.\nEDUCATION\nDoctors of chiropractic must complete 4 to 5 years at an accredited chiropractic college. Their training includes a minimum of 4,200 hours of classroom, laboratory, and clinical experience.\nThis education provides students with an in-depth understanding of the structure and function of the human body in health and disease.\nThe educational program includes training in the basic medical sciences, including anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry."}

These may include physical rehabilitation and exercise recommendations, mechanical or electrical therapies, and hot or cold treatments.\nChiropractors take a medical history in the same way as other health care providers."}
