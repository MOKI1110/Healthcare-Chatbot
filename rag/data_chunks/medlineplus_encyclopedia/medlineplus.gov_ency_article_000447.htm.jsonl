Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEosinophilic fasciitis\nEosinophilic fasciitis\nEosinophilic fasciitis (EF) is a syndrome in which tissue under the skin and over the muscle, called fascia, becomes swollen, inflamed and thick. The skin on the arms, legs, neck, abdomen or feet can swell quickly. The condition is very rare.\nEF may look similar to\nscleroderma\n, but is not related. Unlike scleroderma, in EF, the fingers are not involved.\nCauses\nThe cause of EF is unknown. Rare cases have occurred after taking L-tryptophan supplements. In people with this condition, white blood cells, called eosinophils, build up in the muscles and tissues. Eosinophils are linked to allergic reactions."}

The syndrome is more common in people ages 30 to 60.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nTenderness and swelling of the skin on the arms, legs, or sometimes the joints (most often on both sides of the body)\nArthritis\nCarpal tunnel syndrome\nMuscle pain\nThickened skin that looks puckered\nExams and Tests\nTests that may be done include:\nCBC\nwith differential\nC-reactive protein (CRP)\nGamma globulins (a type of immune system protein)\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate\n(ESR)\nMRI\nMuscle biopsy\nSkin biopsy\n(the biopsy needs to include the deep tissue of the fascia)\nTreatment\nCorticosteroids and other immune-suppressing medicines are used to relieve symptoms. These medicines are more effective when started early in the disease. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also help reduce symptoms.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn most cases, the condition goes away within 1 to 3 years. However, symptoms may last longer or come back.\nPossible Complications\nArthritis is a rare complication of EF."}
