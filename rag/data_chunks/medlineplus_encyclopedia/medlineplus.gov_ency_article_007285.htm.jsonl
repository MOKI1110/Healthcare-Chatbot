Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHydrocodone/oxycodone overdose\nHydrocodone/oxycodone overdose\nHydrocodone and oxycodone are opioids, medicines that are mostly used to treat moderate or severe pain.\nHydrocodone and oxycodone overdose occurs when someone intentionally or accidentally takes too much medicine containing these ingredients. A person may accidentally take too much of the medicine because they are not getting pain relief from their normal doses. There are several reasons why a person may intentionally take too much of this medicine. It may be done to try to hurt oneself or to get high or intoxicated.\nFactors that have led to opioid misuse in the United States are increased marketing by drug companies, development of new opioids, increased supply of opioids, and prescription by health care providers.\nThis article is for information only.
