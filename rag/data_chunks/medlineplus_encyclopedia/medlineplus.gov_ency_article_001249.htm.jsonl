Variations in the genes\nCREBBP\nor\nEP300\nare seen in some people with this condition.\nSome people are missing the gene entirely. This is more typical in people with more severe problems.\nMost cases are sporadic (not passed down through families)."}

Blood tests and x-rays may also be done.\nGenetic tests can be done to determine if the genes involved in this disease are missing or changed.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for RTS. However, the following treatments can be used to manage problems commonly associated with the condition.\nSurgery to repair the bones in the thumbs or toes can sometimes improve grasp or relieve discomfort.\nEarly intervention programs and special education to address developmental disabilities.\nReferral to behavioral specialists and support groups for family members.\nMedical treatment for heart defects, hearing loss, and eye abnormalities.\nTreatment for constipation and gastroesophageal reflux (GERD).\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with RTS and their families can be found at:\nSpecial Friends Foundation --\nspecialfriends.org\nRubinstein-Taybi Syndrome Children's Foundation --\nwww.facebook.com/RTSCF/\nOutlook (Progno"}

The majority of children have delayed motor development, but on average, they learn to walk by 2 1/2 years of age.\nPossible Complications\nComplications depend on what part of the body is affected. Complications may include:\nFeeding problems in infants\nRepeated ear infections and hearing loss\nProblems with the shape of the heart\nAbnormal heartbeat\nScarring of the skin\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nAn appointment with a geneticist is recommended if your provider finds signs of RTS.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling is advised for couples with a family history of this disease who are planning a pregnancy.\nAlternative Names\nRubinstein syndrome, RTS\nReferences\nBurkardt DD, Graham JM.
