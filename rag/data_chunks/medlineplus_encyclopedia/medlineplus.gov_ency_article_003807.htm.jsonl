This area includes the lumbar region and the sacrum, the area that connects the spine to the pelvis.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is done in a hospital x-ray department or your health care provider's office by an x-ray technician. You will be asked to lie on the x-ray table in different positions. You may be asked to lean forward in flexion or lean back and extend your back. If the x-ray is being done to diagnose an injury, care will be taken to prevent further injury.\nThe x-ray machine will be placed over the lower part of your spine. You will be asked to hold your breath as the picture is taken so that the image will not be blurry. In most cases, 3 to 5 pictures are taken.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nTell your provider if you are pregnant."}

X-ray machines are checked often to make sure they are as safe as possible. Most experts feel that the risk is low compared with the benefits.\nPregnant women should not be exposed to radiation, if at all possible. Care should be taken before children receive x-rays.\nConsiderations\nThere are some back problems that an x-ray will not find. That is because they involve the muscles, nerves, and other soft tissues."}
