The borders at which these plates intersect are called\nsutures\nor suture lines. The sutures allow for growth of the skull. They normally close (\"fuse\") by the time the child is 2 or 3 years old.\nEarly closing of a suture causes the baby to have an abnormally shaped head. This may limit brain growth.\nCauses\nThe cause of craniosynostosis is not known. Genes may play a role, but there is usually no family history of the condition. It may be caused by external pressure on a baby's head before birth. Abnormal development of the base of the skull and the membranes around the skull bones is believed to affect the movement and position of the bones as they grow.\nIn cases when this is passed down through families, it may occur with other health problems, such as seizures, decreased intelligence, and blindness."}

Genetic disorders commonly linked to craniosynostosis include Crouzon, Apert, Carpenter, Saethre-Chotzen, and Pfeiffer syndromes.\nHowever, most children with craniosynostosis are otherwise healthy and have normal intelligence.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms depend on the type of craniosynostosis. They may include:\nNo \"soft spot\" (fontanelle) on the newborn's skull\nA raised hard ridge along the affected sutures\nUnusual head shape\nSlow or no increase in the head size over time as the baby grows\nTypes of craniosynostosis are:\nSagittal synostosis (scaphocephaly) is the most common type. It affects the main suture on the very top of the head. The early closing forces the head to grow long and narrow, instead of wide. Babies with this type tend to have a broad forehead. It is more common in boys than girls.\nFrontal plagiocephaly is the next most common type. It affects the suture that runs from ear to ear on the top of the head."}

It is more common in boys than girls.\nFrontal plagiocephaly is the next most common type. It affects the suture that runs from ear to ear on the top of the head. It usually occurs on just one side, causing a flattened forehead, raised eyebrow, and prominent ear on that side. The baby's nose may also appear to be pulled toward that side. This is more common in girls than in boys.\nMetopic synostosis is a rare form that affects the suture close to the forehead. The child's head shape may be described as trigonocephaly, because the top of the head appears triangular, with a narrow or pointed forehead. It may range from mild to severe.\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will feel the infant's head and perform a physical exam.\nThe following tests may be done:\nMeasuring the circumference of the infant's head\nX-rays\nof the skull\nCT scan\nof the head\nWell-child visits are an important part of your child's health care. They allow the provider to regularly check the growth of your infant's head over time. This will help identify any problems early.\nTreatment\nSurgery is usually needed. It is done while the baby is still an infant."}
