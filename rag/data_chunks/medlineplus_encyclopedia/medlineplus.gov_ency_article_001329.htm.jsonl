Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFleas\nFleas\nFleas are small insects that feed on the blood of humans, dogs, cats, and other warm-blooded animals.\nCauses\nFleas prefer to live on dogs and cats. They may also be found on humans and other warm-blooded animals.\nPet owners may not be affected by fleas until their pet has been gone for a period of time. Fleas look for other sources of food and begin to bite humans.\nSymptoms\nBites often occur on the legs and places where clothes fit close to the body, such as the waist, buttocks, thighs, and lower abdomen.\nSymptoms of flea bites include:\nSmall red bumps, often three bumps together, that are very itchy\nBlisters\nif the person has an allergy to flea bites\nExams and Tests\nUsually, a diagnosis can be made when your health care provider examines the skin where the bites are. Questions may be asked about contact with animals such as cats and dogs.\nIn rare cases, a\nskin biopsy\nis done to check for other skin problems.\nTreatment\nYou can use an over-the-counter 1% hydrocortisone cream to relieve itching."}

Antihistamines you can take by mouth may also help with itching.\nPossible Complications\nScratching can lead to a skin infection.\nFleas can carry bacteria that cause diseases in humans, such as\ntyphus\nand\nplague\n. The bacteria can be transmitted to humans by flea bites.\nPrevention\nPrevention may not always be possible. The goal is to get rid of the fleas. This can be done by treating your home, pets, and outside areas with chemicals (pesticides). Small children should not be in the home when pesticides are being used. Birds and fish must be protected when chemicals are sprayed. Home foggers and flea collars do not always work to get rid of fleas. Always consult your veterinarian for help.\nAlternative Names\nPulicosis; Dog fleas; Siphonaptera\nImages\nFlea\nFlea bite - close-up\nReferences\nBurkhart CN, Burkhart CG, Morrell DS. Infestations.
