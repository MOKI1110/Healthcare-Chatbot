Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLithotripsy\nLithotripsy\nLithotripsy is a procedure that uses shock waves to break up stones in the kidney and parts of the ureter (tube that carries urine from your kidneys to your bladder). After the procedure, the tiny pieces of stones pass out of your body in your urine.\nDescription\nExtracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) is the most common type of lithotripsy. \"Extracorporeal\" means outside the body.\nTo get ready for the procedure, you will put on a hospital gown and lie on an exam table on top of a soft, water-filled cushion. You will not get wet.\nYou will be given medicine for pain or to help you relax before the procedure starts. You will also be given antibiotics.\nWhen you have the procedure, you may be given general anesthesia for the procedure. You will be asleep and pain-free.\nHigh-energy shock waves, also called sound waves, guided by x-ray or ultrasound, will pass through your body until they hit the kidney stones. If you are awake, you may feel a tapping feeling when this starts."}

If you are awake, you may feel a tapping feeling when this starts. The waves break the stones into tiny pieces.\nThe lithotripsy procedure should take about 45 minutes to 1 hour.\nA tube called a stent may be placed through your back or bladder into your kidney. This tube will drain urine from your kidney until all the small pieces of stone pass out of your body. This may be done before or after your lithotripsy treatment.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nLithotripsy is used to remove kidney stones that are causing:\nBleeding\nDamage to your kidney\nPain\nUrinary tract infections\nNot all kidney stones can be removed using lithotripsy. The stone may also be removed with:\ntube\n(endoscope) inserted into the kidney through a small surgical cut in the back.\nA small lighted tube (ureteroscope) inserted through the bladder into ureters. Ureters are the tubes that connect the kidneys to the bladder.\nOpen surgery (rarely needed).\nRisks\nLithotripsy is safe most of the time."}

Talk to your health care provider about possible complications such as:\nBleeding around your kidney, which may require you to get a blood transfusion.\nKidney infection.\nPieces of the stone block urine flow from your kidney (this may cause severe pain or damage to your kidney). If this happens, you may need additional procedures.\nPieces of stone are left in your body (you may need more treatments).\nUlcers in your stomach or small intestine.\nProblems with kidney function after the procedure.\nBefore the Procedure\nAlways tell your provider:\nIf you are or could be pregnant\nWhat medicines you are taking, even medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\nDuring the days before the procedure:\nYou will be asked to stop taking blood thinners such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other medicines that make it hard for your blood to clot."}
