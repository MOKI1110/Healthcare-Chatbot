It's also called a long peripheral catheter. This article addresses midline catheters in infants.\nInformation\nWHY IS A MIDLINE VENOUS CATHETER USED?\nA midline venous catheter is used when an infant needs IV fluids or medicine over a long period of time. Regular IVs only last for 1 to 3 days and need to be replaced often. Midline catheters can stay in for 2 to 4 weeks.\nMidline catheters are now often used in place of:\nUmbilical catheters, which may be placed soon after birth, but carry more risks\nCentral venous lines\n, which are placed in a large vein near the heart, but carry more risks\nPercutaneously inserted central catheters (PICCs)\n, which reach closer to the heart, but carry more risks\nBecause midline catheters do not reach beyond the armpit, they are considered safer."}

However, there may be some IV medicines that cannot be delivered through a midline catheter. Also, routine blood draws are not advised from a midline catheter, as opposed to the more central types of venous catheters.\nHOW IS A MIDLINE CATHETER PLACED?\nA midline catheter is inserted into a vein in the arm, leg, or, occasionally, scalp of the infant.\nYour health care provider will:\nPlace the infant on the exam table\nReceive help from other trained staff  who will help calm and comfort the infant\nClean the infant's skin with a germ-killing medicine (antiseptic)\nPlace a hollow needle into a small vein in the arm, leg, or scalp\nPlace the midline catheter through the needle into a larger vein and remove the needle\nBandage the area where catheter has been placed\nWHAT ARE THE RISKS OF HAVING A MIDLINE CATHETER PLACED?\nRisks of midline venous catheterization:\nInfection if the midline catheter stays in place for a long time.\nBleeding and bruising at the site of insertion.\nInflammation of the vei"}
