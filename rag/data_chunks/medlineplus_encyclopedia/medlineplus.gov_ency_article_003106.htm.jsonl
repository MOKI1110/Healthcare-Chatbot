Bleeding most often occurs from one nostril only.\nConsiderations\nNosebleeds are very common. Most nosebleeds occur because of minor irritations of the inside of the nostrils or colds.\nThe nose contains many small blood vessels that bleed easily. Air moving through the nose can dry and irritate the membranes lining the inside of the nose. Crusts can form that bleed when irritated. Nosebleeds occur more often in the winter, when cold viruses are common and indoor air tends to be drier.\nMost nosebleeds occur on the front of the nasal septum. This is the piece of the tissue that separates the two sides of the nose. This type of nosebleed can be easy for a trained professional to stop. Less commonly, nosebleeds may occur higher on the septum or deeper in the nose such as in the sinuses or the base of the skull. Such nosebleeds may be harder to control."}

Blood thinners, such as warfarin (Coumadin), clopidogrel (Plavix), or aspirin, may cause or worsen nosebleeds.\nHome Care\nTo stop a nosebleed:\nSit down and gently squeeze the soft portion of the nose between your thumb and finger (so that the nostrils are closed) for a full 10 minutes.\nLean forward to avoid swallowing the blood and breathe through your mouth.\nWait at least 10 minutes before checking if the bleeding has stopped. Be sure to allow enough time for the bleeding to stop.\nIt may help to apply cold compresses or ice across the bridge of the nose. Do not pack the inside of the nose with gauze.\nLying down with a nosebleed is not recommended. You should avoid sniffing or blowing your nose for several hours after a nosebleed."}

Do not pack the inside of the nose with gauze.\nLying down with a nosebleed is not recommended. You should avoid sniffing or blowing your nose for several hours after a nosebleed. If bleeding persists, a nasal spray decongestant (Afrin, Neo-Synephrine) can sometimes be used to close off small vessels and control bleeding.\nThings you can do to prevent frequent nosebleeds include:\nKeep the home cool and use a vaporizer to add moisture to the inside air.\nUse nasal saline spray and water-soluble jelly (such as Ayr gel) to prevent nasal linings from drying out in the winter.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nGet emergency care if:\nBleeding does not stop after 20 minutes.\nNose bleeding occurs after a head injury."}
