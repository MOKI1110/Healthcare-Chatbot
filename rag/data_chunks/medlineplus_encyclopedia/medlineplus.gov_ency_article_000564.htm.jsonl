People of Eastern and Central European (Ashkenazi) Jewish heritage are more likely to have this disease.\nIt is an\nautosomal recessive\ndisease. This means that the mother and father must both pass  one variant copy of the disease gene to their child in order for the child to develop the disease. A parent who carries one variant copy of the gene, but doesn't have the disease, is called a silent carrier.\nThe lack of GBA causes harmful substances to build up in the liver, spleen, bones, and bone marrow. These substances prevent cells and organs from working properly.\nThere are three main subtypes of Gaucher disease:\nType 1 is most common. It involves bone disease,\nanemia\n, an enlarged spleen and low platelets (\nthrombocytopenia\n). Type 1 affects both children and adults."}

It is most common in the Ashkenazi Jewish population.\nType 2 usually begins in infancy with severe neurologic involvement. This form can lead to rapid, early death.\nType 3 may cause liver, spleen, and brain problems.  People with this type  may live into adulthood.\nSymptoms\nBleeding because of low platelet count is the most common symptom seen in Gaucher disease. Other symptoms may include:\nBone pain\nand fractures\nCognitive impairment (decreased thinking ability)\nEasy bruising\nEnlarged spleen\nEnlarged liver\nFatigue\nHeart valve problems\nLung disease (rare)\nSeizures\nSevere\nswelling\nat birth\nSkin changes\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms.\nThe following tests may be done:\nBlood test to look for enzyme activity\nBone marrow aspiration\nMRI\nCT\nX-ray of the skeleton\nGenetic testing\nTreatment\nGaucher disease can't be cured."}

But treatments can help regulate and may improve symptoms.\nMedicines may be given to:\nReplace the missing GBA (enzyme replacement therapy) to help reduce spleen size, bone pain, and improve thrombocytopenia.\nLimit production of fatty chemicals that build up in the body.\nOther treatments include:\nMedicines for pain\nSurgery for bone and joint problems, or to remove the spleen\nBlood transfusions\n\nSupport Groups\nThese groups can provide more information on Gaucher disease:\nNational Gaucher Foundation --\nwww.gaucherdisease.org\nMedlinePlus - Gaucher disease.--\nmedlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/gaucher-disease/\nNational Organization for Rare Diseases --\nrarediseases.org/rare-diseases/gaucher-disease/\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well a person does depends on their subtype of the disease.

The infantile form of Gaucher disease (Type 2) may lead to early death.

Testing can determine if both parents carry one variant copy of the gene and thus could pass on the Gaucher disease. A prenatal test can also tell if a baby in the womb has Gaucher disease.\nAlternative Names\nGlucocerebrosidase deficiency; Glucosylceramidase deficiency; Lysosomal storage disease - Gaucher; Gaucher's disease\nImages\nGaucher cell - photomicrograph\nGaucher cell - photomicrograph #2\nHepatosplenomegaly\nReferences\nKliegman RM, St. Geme JW, Blum NJ, et al.
