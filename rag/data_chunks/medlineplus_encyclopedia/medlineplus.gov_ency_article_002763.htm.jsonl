DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\nPoisonous Ingredient\nMost bug repellents contain DEET (N,N-diethyl-meta-toluamide) as their active ingredient. DEET is one of the few insect sprays that work to repel bugs. It is recommended for preventing diseases that mosquitos spread. Some of these are malaria, dengue fever, and West Nile virus.\nOther less effective bug sprays contain pyrethrins. Pyrethrins are a pesticide made from the chrysanthemum flower."}

It is generally considered nonpoisonous, but it can cause breathing problems if you breathe in large amounts.\nWhere Found\nBug sprays are sold under various brand names.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of using bug spray vary, depending on what type of spray it is.\nSymptoms of swallowing sprays that contain pyrethrins are:\nBreathing difficulty\nCoughing\nLoss of alertness (stupor), from the blood oxygen level being out of balance\nTremors (if a large amount is swallowed)\nSeizures (if a large amount is swallowed)\nUpset stomach, including cramps, stomach pain, and nausea\nVomiting\nBelow are symptoms of using sprays that contain DEET in different parts of the body.\nEYES, EARS, NOSE, AND THROAT\nTemporary burning and redness, if DEET is sprayed into these parts of the body.

These symptoms may occur with long-term use of large amounts of DEET (over 50% concentration).\nDeath.\nSeizures.\nDEET is especially dangerous for small children. Seizures may occur in small children who regularly have DEET on their skin for long periods of time. Care should be taken to use only products that have smaller amounts of DEET. These products should be used only for short periods of time. Products containing DEET probably should not be used on infants.\nSKIN\nHives or mild skin redness and irritation."}

These symptoms are usually mild and will go away when the product is washed off the skin.\nMore severe skin reactions that include blistering, burning, and permanent scars of the skin. These symptoms may occur when someone uses products that contain a large amount of DEET over a long period of time. Military personnel or game wardens may use these types of products.\nSTOMACH AND INTESTINES (If SOMEONE SWALLOWS A SMALL AMOUNT OF DEET)\nModerate to severe stomach irritation\nNausea and vomiting\nBy far, the most serious complication of DEET poisonings is damage to the nervous system. Death is possible for people who develop nervous system damage from DEET.\nHome Care\nDo not make the person throw up unless poison control or a health care provider tells you to. If the product is on the skin or in the eyes, flush with lots of water for at least 15 minutes.\nIf the person swallowed the product, give them water or milk right away, unless a provider tells you not to."}

It is the preferred bug repellent for preventing diseases that mosquitos spread. It is usually the sensible choice to use DEET to repel mosquitos, compared to the danger of any of those diseases, even for pregnant women.\nSerious problems can occur if someone swallows a large amount of a DEET product that is very strong. How well the person does depends on the amount they swallowed, how strong it is, and how quickly they receive medical treatment. Seizures can lead to permanent brain damage and possibly death.\nReferences\nElston DM. Bites and stings.
