Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHypothalamic dysfunction\nHypothalamic dysfunction\nHypothalamic dysfunction is a problem with part of the brain called the\nhypothalamus\n. The hypothalamus helps control the pituitary gland and regulates many body functions.\nCauses\nThe hypothalamus helps keep the body's internal functions in balance. It helps regulate:\nAppetite and weight\nBody temperature\nChildbirth\nEmotions, behavior, memory\nGrowth\nProduction of breast milk\nSalt and water balance\nSex drive\nSleep-wake cycle and the body clock\nAnother important function of the hypothalamus is to control the pituitary gland. The pituitary is a small gland at the base of the brain. It lies just below the hypothalamus. The pituitary, in turn, controls the:\nAdrenal glands\nOvaries\nTestes\nThyroid gland\nThere are many causes of hypothalamic dysfunction."}

The most common are:\nSurgery\nBrain injury\nBrain tumors\nRadiation treatment to the brain\nOther causes include:\nNutrition problems, such as eating disorders (\nanorexia\n), extreme weight loss\nBlood vessel problems in the brain, such as\naneurysm\n,\npituitary apoplexy\n,\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage\nGenetic disorders, such as\nPrader-Willi syndrome\n, familial\ndiabetes insipidus\n, Kallmann syndrome\nInfections and swelling (inflammation) due to certain immune system diseases\nSymptoms\nSymptoms are usually due to the hormones or brain signals that are missing. In children, there may be growth problems, either too much or too little growth. In other children, puberty occurs too early or too late.\nTumor symptoms may include headache or loss of vision.\nIf the thyroid is affected, there may be symptoms of an underactive thyroid (\nhypothyroidism\n)."}

Symptoms may include fatigue, weakness, poor appetite, weight loss, and lack of interest in activities.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about your symptoms.\nBlood or urine tests may be ordered to determine levels of hormones such as:\nCortisol\nEstrogen\nGrowth hormone\nPituitary hormones\nProlactin\nTestosterone\nThyroid\nSodium\nBlood\nand\nurine\nosmolality\nOther possible tests include:\nHormone injections followed by timed blood samples\nMRI\nor\nCT\nscans of the brain\nVisual field eye exam\n(if there is a tumor)\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the cause of the hypothalamic dysfunction:\nFor tumors, surgery or radiation may be needed.\nFor hormonal deficiencies, missing hormones need to be replaced by taking medicine."}
