There are 4 parathyroid glands, 2 on top of each lobe of the thyroid gland, which is located at the base of the neck.\nParathyroid cancer is a very rare type of cancer. It affects men and women equally. The cancer often occurs in people older than 30.\nThe cause of parathyroid cancer is unknown. People with a genetic conditions called\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia type I\nand hyperparathyroidism-jaw tumor syndrome have an increased risk for this disease. People who had head or neck radiation also may be at increased risk."}

People who had head or neck radiation also may be at increased risk. But this type of radiation is more likely to cause thyroid cancer.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of parathyroid cancer are mainly caused by a high level of calcium in the blood (\nhypercalcemia\n), and may affect different parts of the body.\nSymptoms include:\nBone pain\nConstipation\nFatigue\nFractures\nFrequent thirst\nFrequent urination\nKidney stones\nMuscle weakness\nNausea\nand vomiting\nPoor appetite\nExams and Tests\nParathyroid cancer may be very hard to diagnose.\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history.\nAbout half of the time, a provider finds parathyroid cancer by feeling the neck with their hands (\npalpation\n).\nA cancerous parathyroid tumor tends to produce a very high amount of parathyroid hormone (PTH). Tests for confirming a diagnosis of parathyroid cancer may include:\nBlood calcium\nBlood PTH\nBefore surgery, you will have a special radioactive scan of the parathyroid glands. The scan is called the sestamibi scan."}

These tests are done to confirm which parathyroid gland is abnormal.\nTreatment\nThe following treatments may be used to correct hypercalcemia due to parathyroid cancer:\nFluids through a vein (IV fluids)\nA natural hormone called calcitonin that helps control the blood calcium level\nMedicines that stop the breakdown and reabsorption of bones in the body\nSurgery is the recommended treatment for parathyroid cancer. Sometimes, it is hard to find out if a parathyroid tumor is cancerous. Your provider may recommend surgery even without a confirmed diagnosis. Minimally invasive surgery, using smaller cuts, is becoming more common for parathyroid disease.\nIf tests before the surgery can find the affected gland, surgery may be done on just one side of your neck. If it isn't possible to find the problem gland before surgery, the surgeon will look at both sides of your neck.\nChemotherapy and radiation don't work well to prevent the cancer from coming back."}

Surgery may help extend life even when the cancer spreads.\nPossible Complications\nThe cancer may spread (metastasize) to other places in the body, most often the lungs and bones.\nHypercalcemia is the most serious complication. Most deaths from parathyroid cancer occur due to severe, difficult-to-control hypercalcemia, and not the cancer itself.\nThe cancer often comes back (recurs). Further surgeries may be needed."}
