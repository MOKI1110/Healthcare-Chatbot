The tear may bleed.\nCauses\nMallory-Weiss tears are most often caused by forceful or long-term\nvomiting\nor\ncoughing\n. They may also be caused by epileptic\nseizures\nor other less common situations.\nAny condition that leads to violent and lengthy bouts of coughing or vomiting can cause these tears.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nBloody stools\nVomiting blood\n(bright red)\nExams and Tests\nTests may include:\nCBC\n, possibly showing low\nhematocrit\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy\n(EGD), more likely to be done when there is active bleeding or high-risk for rebleeding.\nTreatment\nThe tear usually heals in a few days without treatment. The tear may also be fixed by clips, electrocoagulation, or epinephrine injection that may be done during an EGD. Surgery is rarely needed."}

Medicines that suppress stomach acid (proton pump inhibitors) are typically given for a short time after to decrease rebleeding.\nIf\nblood loss\nhas been large, blood transfusions may be needed. In most cases, bleeding stops without treatment within a few hours.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nRepeated bleeding is uncommon and the outcome is most often good.\nCirrhosis\nof the liver and problems with blood clotting make future bleeding episodes more likely to occur.\nPossible Complications\nHemorrhage (loss of blood)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you begin vomiting blood or if you pass bloody stools.\nPrevention\nTreatments to relieve vomiting and coughing may reduce risk.
