It can occur anywhere on the skin.\nCauses\nFolliculitis starts when hair follicles are damaged or when the follicle is blocked. For example, this may occur from rubbing against clothing or shaving. Most of the time, the damaged follicles become infected with staphylococci (staph) bacteria.\nBarber's itch is a staph infection of the hair follicles in the beard area, usually the upper lip. Shaving makes it worse. Tinea barbae is similar to barber's itch, but the infection is caused by a fungus.\nPseudofolliculitis barbae is a disorder that occurs mainly in African American men. If curly beard hairs are cut too short, they may curve back into the skin and cause inflammation.\nFolliculitis can affect people of all ages.\nSymptoms\nCommon symptoms include a\nrash\n, itching, and\npimples\nor\npustules\nnear a hair follicle in the neck, groin, or genital area. The pimples may crust over.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can diagnose this condition by looking at your skin."}
