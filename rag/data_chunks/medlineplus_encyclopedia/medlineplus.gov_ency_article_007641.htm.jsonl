The access is where you receive\nhemodialysis\n. Using the access, blood is removed from your body, cleaned by the dialysis machine (called the dialyzer), and then returned to your body.\nUsually the access is put in your arm but it can also go in your leg. It takes a few weeks to a few months to get an access ready for hemodialysis.\nDescription\nA surgeon will put the access in. There are three types of accesses.\nFistula:\nThe surgeon joins an artery and vein under the skin. That is why this is called an arterio-venous or A-V fistula.\nWith the artery and vein connected, more blood flows into the vein. This makes the vein strong."}

That is why this is called an arterio-venous or A-V fistula.\nWith the artery and vein connected, more blood flows into the vein. This makes the vein strong. Needle insertions into this strong vein are easier for hemodialysis.\nA fistula takes 1 to 4 weeks to become ready to use.\nGraft:\nIf you have small veins that cannot develop into a fistula, the surgeon connects an artery and vein with an artificial tube called a graft.\nNeedle insertions can be done into the graft for hemodialysis.\nA graft takes 3 to 6 weeks to heal.\nCentral venous catheter:\nIf you need hemodialysis right away and you do not have time to wait for a fistula or graft to become ready for use, the surgeon can put in a hemodialysis catheter.\nThe catheter is put into a vein in the neck, chest, or upper leg.\nThis catheter is temporary. It can be used for dialysis while you wait for a fistula or graft to heal.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nKidneys act like filters to remove extra fluid and waste from your blood. When your kidneys stop working,\nhemodialysis\ncan be used to clean your blood."}

When your kidneys stop working,\nhemodialysis\ncan be used to clean your blood. Hemodialysis is usually done 3 times a week and takes about 3 to 4 hours.\nRisks\nWith any type of access, you will have a risk of developing an infection or a blood clot. If infection or blood clots develop, you will need treatment or more surgery to fix it.\nBefore the Procedure\nThe surgeon decides the best place to put your vascular access. A good access needs good blood flow. Doppler ultrasound or venography tests may be done to check blood flow at a possible access site.\nVascular access is often done as a day procedure. You can go home afterwards. Ask your surgeon if you will need someone to drive you home.\nTalk to your surgeon and anesthesiologist about anesthesia for the access procedure. There are two choices:\nYou can receive medicine that makes you a little sleepy and local anesthetic to numb the site."}

Prop your arm up on pillows and keep your elbow straight to decrease swelling.\nKeep the incision dry. If you have a temporary catheter put in, do not get it wet."}
