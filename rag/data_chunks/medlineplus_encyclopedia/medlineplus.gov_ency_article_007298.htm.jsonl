Most of the time, urine does not have a strong smell if you are healthy and drink plenty of fluids.\nCauses\nMost changes in urine odor are not a sign of disease and go away in time. Some foods and medicines, including vitamins, may affect your urine's odor. For example, eating asparagus causes a distinct urine odor.\nFoul-smelling urine may be due to bacteria. Sweet-smelling urine may be a sign of uncontrolled diabetes or a rare disease of metabolism. Liver disease and certain metabolic disorders may cause musty-smelling urine.\nSome conditions that can cause changes in urine odor include:\nBladder\nfistula\nBladder infection\nBody is low on fluids (concentrated urine can smell like ammonia)\nPoorly controlled diabetes (sweet smelling urine)\nLiver failure\nKetonuria\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have signs of a urinary tract infection with abnormal urine odor."}
