The chronic disorder most often affects the small intestine, but can also occur in the large intestine (colon). The acute disorder usually affects the large intestine.\nThe condition may start suddenly or be a chronic or long-term problem. Sudden onset is called acute intestinal pseudo-obstruction and usually affects the small intestine and often other parts of the digestive tract. Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction usually affects the large intestine (colon.) It is most common in children and older people. The cause of the problem is often unknown."}

In chronic forms of the disease, symptoms can come back and get worse over many years.\nIf the intestine dilates severely, a hole in the bowel (perforation) may occur and surgical removal of the involved bowel may be needed.
