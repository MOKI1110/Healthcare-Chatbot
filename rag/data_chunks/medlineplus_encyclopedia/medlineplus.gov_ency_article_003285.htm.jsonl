Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNikolsky sign\nNikolsky sign\nNikolsky sign is a skin finding in which the top layers of the skin slip away from the lower layers when rubbed.\nConsiderations\nThe sign is more common in newborn babies and in young children under 5 years of age. It often begins in the mouth and on neck, shoulder, arm pit, and genital area. A child may be lethargic, irritable, and feverish. They may develop red painful blisters on the skin, which break easily.\nAdults with disturbed kidney functions or with a weak immune system may have this sign. Your health care provider may use a pencil eraser or finger to test for Nikolsky sign. The skin is pulled to the side with a shearing pressure on the surface, or by rotating the eraser back and forth.\nIf the test result is positive, the very thin top layer of skin will shear off, leaving skin pink and moist, and usually very tender.\nA positive result is usually a sign of a blistering skin condition."}
