Rabies is spread by infected saliva that enters the body through a bite or broken skin. The virus travels from the wound to the brain, where it causes swelling or inflammation. This inflammation leads to symptoms of the disease. Most rabies deaths occur in children.\nIn the past, human rabies cases in the United States usually resulted from a dog bite. Recently, more cases of human rabies have been linked to bats and raccoons. Dog bites are a common cause of rabies in developing countries, especially Asia and Africa. There have been no reports of rabies caused by dog bites in the United States for a number of years due to widespread animal vaccination.\nOther wild animals that can spread the rabies virus include:\nFoxes\nSkunks\nBats can spread rabies through minor or unrecognized bites or scratches. Bites can be so small you may not realize you have been bitten."}

Bites can be so small you may not realize you have been bitten. If you find a bat in your home, you should contact your health care provider or health department, even if you don't feel or see a bite. They can advise you about whether you need treatment.\nIn rare cases, rabies has been transmitted without an actual bite. This type of infection is believed to be caused by infected saliva or other infectious material that may come in contact with an existing scratch or wound, usually in bat caves.\nSymptoms\nThe time between infection and when you get sick ranges from 10 days to 7 years. This time period is called the incubation period. The average incubation period is 3 to 12 weeks.\nFear of water (hydrophobia) is the most common symptom."}

Call your local animal control authorities to safely capture the animal. If rabies is suspected, the animal will be watched for signs of rabies.\nA special test called immunofluorescence is used to look at the brain tissue after an animal is dead. This test can reveal whether the animal had rabies.\nYour provider will examine you and look at the bite. The wound will be cleaned and treated.\nThe same test used on animals can be done to check for rabies in humans. The test uses a piece of skin from the neck."}

Other tests done may include:\nMRI of brain\nCT of the head\nTreatment\nThe aim of treatment is to relieve the symptoms of the bite wound and assess risk of rabies infection. Clean the wound well with soap and water and seek professional medical help. You will need your provider to clean the wound and remove any foreign objects. Most of the time, stitches should not be used for animal bite wounds.\nIf there is any risk of rabies, you will be given a series of a preventive\nvaccine\n. The vaccine is generally given in 4 doses over 14 days. Antibiotics have no effect on the rabies virus.\nMost people also receive a treatment called human rabies immunoglobulin (HRIG)."}

They may carry rabies.\nContact your provider even when no bite took place.\nImmunization and treatment for possible rabies are recommended for at least up to 14 days after exposure or a bite.\nThere is no known curative treatment for people with symptoms of a rabies infection. It is nearly always a fatal illness, but there have been a few reports of people surviving with experimental treatments.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIt is possible to prevent rabies if you get the vaccine soon after the bite. To date, no one in the United States has developed rabies when they were given the vaccine promptly and appropriately.\nOnce the symptoms appear, the person rarely survives the disease, even with treatment."}
