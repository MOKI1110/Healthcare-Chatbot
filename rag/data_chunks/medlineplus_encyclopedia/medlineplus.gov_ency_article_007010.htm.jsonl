Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nOtitis media with effusion\nOtitis media with effusion\nOtitis media with effusion (OME) is thick or sticky fluid behind the eardrum in the middle ear. It occurs without an\near infection\n.\nNote\n: This article is intended to be applicable to children only. There are additional considerations for teens and adults.\nCauses\nThe Eustachian tube connects the inside of the ear to the back of the throat. This tube helps drain fluid to prevent it from building up in the ear. The fluid drains from the tube and is swallowed.\nOME and ear infections are connected in two ways:\nAfter most ear infections have been treated, fluid (an effusion) remains in the middle ear for a few days or weeks.\nWhen the Eustachian tube is partially blocked,\nfluid builds up in the middle ear\n. Bacteria inside the ear become trapped and begin to grow."}

Bacteria inside the ear become trapped and begin to grow. This may lead to an ear infection.\nThe following can cause swelling of the Eustachian tube lining that leads to increased fluid in the middle ear:\nAllergies\nIrritants (particularly cigarette smoke)\nRespiratory infections\nThe following can cause the Eustachian tube to close or become blocked:\nDrinking while lying on your back\nSudden increases in air pressure (such as descending in an airplane or on a mountain road)\nAny swelling in the inside of the nose or throat (in teens and adults this can include tumors)\nGetting water in a baby's ears will not lead to a blocked Eustachian tube.\nOME is most common in winter or early spring, but it can occur at any time of year. It can affect people of any age."}

It can affect people of any age. It occurs most often in children under age 2, but is rare in newborns.\nYounger children get OME more often than older children or adults for several reasons:\nThe Eustachian tube is shorter, more horizontal, and straighter, making it easier for bacteria to enter.\nThe Eustachian tube is floppier, with a tinier opening that's easy to block.\nYoung children get more colds because it takes time for the immune system to be able to recognize and ward off cold viruses.\nThe fluid in OME is often thin and watery. In the past, it was thought that the fluid got thicker the longer it was present in the ear."}

In the past, it was thought that the fluid got thicker the longer it was present in the ear. (\"Glue ear\" is a common name given to OME with thick fluid.) However, fluid thickness is now thought to be related to the ear itself, rather than to how long the fluid is present.\nSymptoms\nUnlike children with an ear infection, children with OME do not act sick.\nOME often does not have obvious symptoms.\nOlder children and adults often complain of muffled hearing or a sense of fullness in the ear. Younger children may turn up the television volume because of hearing loss.\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider may find OME while checking your child's ears after an ear infection has been treated.\nThe provider will examine the eardrum and look for certain changes, such as:\nAir bubbles on the surface of the eardrum\nDullness of the eardrum when a light is used\nEardrum that does not seem to move when little puffs of air are blown at it\nFluid behind the eardrum\nA test called\ntympanometry\nis an accurate tool for diagnosing OME."}

This can help the provider decide on treatment.\nTreatment\nMost providers will not treat OME in children at first, unless there are also signs of an infection. Instead, they will recheck the problem in 2 to 3 months.\nYou can make the following changes to help clear up the fluid behind the eardrum:\nAvoid cigarette smoke\nEncourage infants to breastfeed\nTreat allergies by staying away from triggers (such as dust). Adults and older children may be given allergy medicines.\nMost often the fluid will clear on its own."}

These medicines are not always helpful. At this point, teens and adults need additional testing to check for a tumor in the nose or throat.\nAt some point, the child's hearing should be tested. If there is significant hearing loss (more than 20 decibels), antibiotics or ear tubes might be needed.\nIf the fluid is still present after 4 to 6 months, tubes are probably needed, even if there is no major hearing loss.\nSometimes the adenoids must be taken out for the Eustachian tube to work properly.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nOME most often goes away on its own over a few weeks or months."}
