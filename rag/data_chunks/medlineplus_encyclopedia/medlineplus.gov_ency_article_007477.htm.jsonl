It helps build and protect your teeth and bones. Getting enough calcium over your lifetime can help prevent\nosteoporosis\n, which is sometimes called thin bones.\nMany people get enough calcium in their normal diet. Dairy foods, leafy green vegetables, and calcium fortified foods have high levels of calcium. For example, 1 cup or 237 milliliters (mL) of milk or yogurt has 300 milligrams (mg) of calcium. Older women and men may need extra calcium to prevent them from getting osteoporosis.\nYour health care provider will tell you if you need to take extra calcium. The decision to take extra calcium should be based on balancing the benefits and risks of doing so.\nTYPES OF CALCIUM SUPPLEMENTS\nForms of calcium include:\nCalcium carbonate. Over-the-counter (OTC) antacid products contain calcium carbonate. These sources of calcium do not cost much. Each pill or chew provides 200 mg or more of calcium."}

Over-the-counter (OTC) antacid products contain calcium carbonate. These sources of calcium do not cost much. Each pill or chew provides 200 mg or more of calcium. This form of calcium should be taken with meals.\nCalcium citrate. This is a more expensive form of calcium. It is absorbed well on an empty or full stomach. People with low levels of stomach acid (a condition that is more common in people over age 50) absorb calcium citrate better than calcium carbonate.\nOther forms, such as calcium gluconate, calcium lactate, calcium phosphate: Most have less calcium than the carbonate and citrate forms and do not offer any advantages over them.\nWhen choosing a calcium supplement:\nLook for the word purified or the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) symbol on the label.\nAvoid products made from unrefined oyster shell, bone meal, or dolomite that do not have the USP symbol. They may have high levels of lead or other toxic metals.\nHOW TO TAKE EXTRA CALCIUM\nFollow your provider's advice on how much extra calcium you need.\nIncrease the dose of your calcium supplement slowly."}

Your provider may suggest that you start with 500 mg a day for a week, and then add more over time.\nTry to spread the extra calcium you take over the day. Do not take more than 500 mg at a time. Taking calcium throughout the day will:\nAllow more calcium to be absorbed\nCut down on side effects such as gas, bloating, and constipation\nThe total amount of calcium adults need every day from food and calcium supplements:\n19 to 50 years: 1,000 mg/day\n51 to 70 years: Men - 1,000 mg/day; Women - 1,200 mg/day\n71 years and over: 1,200 mg/day\nThe body needs vitamin D to help absorb calcium. You can get vitamin D from sunlight exposure to your skin and from your diet. Ask your provider whether you need to take a vitamin D supplement."}
