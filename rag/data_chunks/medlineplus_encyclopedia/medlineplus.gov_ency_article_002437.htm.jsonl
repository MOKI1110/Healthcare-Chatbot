Even when weight is normal, a person may not be getting the right nutrition. Children with CF may not grow or develop correctly.\nRecommendations\nThe following are ways for adding protein and calories to the diet. Be sure to follow other specific instructions from your health care provider.\nEnzymes, vitamins, and salt:\nMost people with CF must take pancreatic enzymes. These enzymes help your body absorb fat and protein. Taking them all the time will decrease or get rid of foul-smelling stools, gas, and bloating.\nTake enzymes with all meals and snacks.\nTalk to your provider about increasing or decreasing your enzymes, depending on your symptoms.\nAsk your provider about taking extra vitamins A, D, E, K, and extra calcium. There are special formulas for people with CF.\nPeople who live in hot climates may need a small amount of extra table salt.\nEating patterns:\nEat whenever you are hungry. This may mean eating several small meals throughout the day.\nKeep a variety of nutritious snack foods around."}
