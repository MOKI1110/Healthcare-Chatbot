It is caused by a lack of vitamin D, calcium, or phosphate. It leads to softening and weakening of the bones.\nCauses\nVitamin D\nhelps the body control calcium and phosphate levels. If the blood levels of these minerals become too low, the body may produce hormones that cause calcium and phosphate to be released from the bones. This leads to weak and soft bones.\nVitamin D is absorbed from food or produced by the skin when exposed to sunlight. Lack of vitamin D production by the skin may occur in people who:\nLive in climates with little exposure to sunlight\nMust stay indoors\nWork indoors during the daylight hours\nYou may not get enough vitamin D from your diet if you:\nAre\nlactose intolerant\n(have trouble digesting milk products)\nDO NOT drink milk products\nFollow a vegetarian diet\nInfants who are breastfed only may develop vitamin D deficiency. Human breast milk does not supply the proper amount of vitamin D."}

Human breast milk does not supply the proper amount of vitamin D. This can be a particular problem for darker-skinned children in winter months. This is because there are lower levels of sunlight during these months.\nNot getting enough calcium and phosphorous in your diet can also lead to rickets. Rickets caused by a lack of these minerals in the diet is rare in developed countries. Calcium and phosphorous are found in milk and green vegetables.\nYour genes may increase your risk for rickets. Hereditary rickets is a form of the disease that is passed down through families. It occurs when the kidneys are unable to hold onto the mineral phosphate. Rickets may also be caused by kidney disorders that involve\nrenal tubular acidosis\n.\nDisorders that reduce the digestion or absorption of fats will make it more difficult for vitamin D to be absorbed into the body.\nSometimes, rickets may occur in children who have disorders of the liver. These children cannot convert vitamin D to its active form.\nRickets is rare in the United States."}

These children cannot convert vitamin D to its active form.\nRickets is rare in the United States. It is most likely to occur in children during periods of rapid growth. This is the age when the body needs high levels of calcium and phosphate. Rickets may also be seen in children ages 6 to 24 months. It is uncommon in newborns.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of rickets include:\nBone pain or tenderness\nin the arms, legs, pelvis, and spine\nDecreased muscle tone\n(loss of muscle strength) and\nweakness\nthat gets worse\nDental deformities, including delayed tooth formation, defects in the tooth structure, holes in the enamel, and increased cavities (\ndental caries\n)\nImpaired growth\nIncreased bone fractures\nMuscle cramps\nShort stature\n(adults less than 5 feet or 1.52 meters tall)\nSkeletal deformities\nsuch as an odd-shaped skull,\nbowlegs\n, bumps in the ribcage (rachitic rosary), breastbone that is pushed forward (pigeon chest), pelvic deformities, and spine deformities (spine that curves abnormally, including\nscoliosis\nor\nkyphosis\n)\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam reveals tenderness or pain in the bones,"}

The cause must be treated to prevent the disease from returning.\nReplacing calcium, phosphorus, or vitamin D that is lacking will eliminate most symptoms of rickets. Dietary sources of vitamin D include fish liver and processed milk.\nExposure to moderate amounts of sunlight is encouraged. If rickets is caused by a metabolic problem, a prescription for vitamin D supplements may be needed.\nPositioning or bracing may be used to reduce or prevent deformities."}

Some skeletal deformities may require surgery to correct them.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe disorder may be corrected by replacing vitamin D and minerals. Laboratory values and x-rays usually improve after about 1 week. Some cases may require large doses of minerals and vitamin D.\nIf rickets is not corrected while the child is still growing, skeletal deformities and short stature may be permanent. If it is corrected while the child is young, skeletal deformities often improve or disappear with time.\nPossible Complications\nPossible complications are:\nLong-term (\nchronic\n) skeletal pain\nSkeletal deformities\nSkeletal fractures, may occur without cause\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your child's health care provider if you notice symptoms of rickets.\nPrevention\nYou can prevent rickets by making sure that your child gets enough calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D in their diet."}
