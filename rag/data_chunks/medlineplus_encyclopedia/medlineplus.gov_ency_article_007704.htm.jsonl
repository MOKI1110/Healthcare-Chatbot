Ureteral reimplantation is surgery to change the position of these tubes where they enter the bladder wall.\nDescription\nThis procedure changes the way the ureter is attached to the bladder.\nThe surgery takes place in the hospital while your child is asleep and pain-free. The surgery takes 2 to 3 hours.\nDuring surgery, the surgeon will:\nDetach the ureter from the bladder.\nCreate a new tunnel between the bladder wall and muscle in a better position in the bladder.\nPlace the ureter in the new tunnel.\nStitch the ureter in place and close the bladder with stitches.\nIf needed, this will be done to the other ureter.\nClose any cut made in your child's belly with stitches or staples.\nThe surgery can be done in 3 ways."}

The method used will depend on your child's condition and how the ureters need to be reattached to the bladder.\nIn open surgery, the surgeon will make a small incision in the lower belly through muscle and fat.\nIn laparoscopic surgery, the surgeon will perform the procedure using a camera and small surgical tools through 3 or 4 small cuts in the belly.\nRobotic surgery\nis similar to laparoscopic surgery, except that the instruments are held in place by a robot. The surgeon controls the robot.\nYour child will be discharged 1 to 2 days after the surgery.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThe surgery is done to prevent urine from flowing backwards from the bladder to the kidneys. This is called reflux, and it can cause repeat urinary tract infections and damage the kidneys.\nThis type of surgery is common in children for reflux due to a birth defect of the urinary system."}
