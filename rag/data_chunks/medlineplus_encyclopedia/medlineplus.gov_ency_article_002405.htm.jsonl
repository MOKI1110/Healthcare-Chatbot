Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nVitamin D\nVitamin D\nVitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin. Fat-soluble vitamins are stored in the body's fatty tissue and liver.\nFunction\nVitamin D helps the body absorb\ncalcium\n. Calcium is a mineral that you must have for normal bone formation.\nIf you do not consume enough calcium in your diet, or if your body does not absorb enough calcium due to low vitamin D, bone production and bone tissues may suffer.\nVitamin D deficiency can lead to weakened bones (osteomalacia and\nosteoporosis\nin adults or\nrickets\nin children).\nFood Sources\nThe body makes vitamin D when the skin is directly exposed to the sun. That is why it is often called the \"sunshine\" vitamin. Most people meet at least some of their vitamin D needs this way.\nVery few foods naturally contain vitamin D. As a result, many foods are fortified with vitamin D. Fortified means that vitamins have been added to the food.\nFatty fish (such as tuna, salmon, and mackerel) are among the best sources of vitamin D.\nBeef liver, cheese, and egg yolks provide small amounts.\nMushrooms provide some vitamin D."}

Some mushrooms you buy in the store have higher vitamin D content because they have been exposed to ultraviolet light.\nMost milk in the United States is fortified with 400 IU vitamin D per quart. Most of the time, foods made from milk, such as cheese and ice cream, are not fortified.\nVitamin D is added to many breakfast cereals. It is also added to some brands of soy beverages, orange juice, yogurt, and margarine. Check the nutrition fact panel on the food label.\nSUPPLEMENTS\nIt can be hard to get enough vitamin D from food sources alone. As a result, some people may need to take a vitamin D supplement. Vitamin D found in supplements and fortified foods comes in two different forms:\nD\n2\n(ergocalciferol)\nD\n3\n(cholecalciferol)\nFollow a diet that provides the proper amount of calcium and vitamin D."}

Your provider may recommend higher doses of vitamin D if you have risk factors for osteoporosis, a disease that reduces absorption of vitamin D, or a low blood level of this vitamin.\nSide Effects\nToo much vitamin D can make the intestines absorb too much calcium. This may cause high levels of calcium in the blood. High blood calcium can lead to:\nCalcium deposits in soft tissues such as the heart and lungs\nConfusion and disorientation\nDamage to the kidneys\nKidney stones\nNausea, vomiting, constipation, poor appetite, weakness, and weight loss\nRecommendations\nSome experts have suggested that a few minutes of sunlight directly on the skin of your face, arms, back, or legs (without sunscreen) every day can produce the body's requirement of vitamin D. However, the amount of vitamin D produced by sunlight exposure can vary greatly from person to person.\nPeople who do not live in sunny places may not make enough vitamin D within a limited time in the sun."}

Cloudy days, shade, and having dark-colored skin also cut down on the amount of vitamin D the skin makes.\nBecause exposure to sunlight is a risk for skin cancer, exposure for more than a few minutes without sunscreen is not recommended.\nThe best measure of your vitamin D status is to look at blood levels of a form known as 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25(OH)D). Blood levels are measured either as nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) or nanomoles per liter (nmol/L), where 0.4 ng/mL = 1 nmol/L.\nLevels below 30 to 50 nmol/L (12 to 20 ng/mL) are too low for bone or overall health, and levels above 125 nmol/L (50 ng/mL) are probably too high. Levels of 50 nmol/L or above (20 ng/mL or above) are enough for most people.\nRecommendations for vitamin D, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine."}
