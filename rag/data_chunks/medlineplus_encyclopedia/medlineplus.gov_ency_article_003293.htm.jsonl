Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMoro reflex\nMoro reflex\nA reflex is a type of involuntary (without trying) response to stimulation. The Moro reflex is one of many\nreflexes\nthat are seen at birth. It normally goes away after 3 or 4 months.\nConsiderations\nYour baby's health care provider will check for this reflex right after birth and during well-child visits.\nTo see the Moro reflex, the child will be placed face up on a soft, padded surface.\nThe head is gently lifted with enough support to just begin to remove the body weight from the pad. (Note: The infant's body should not be lifted off the pad, only the weight removed.)\nThe head is then released suddenly, allowed to fall backward for a moment, but quickly supported again (not allowed to bang on the padding).\nThe normal response is for the baby to have a startled look. The baby's arms should move sideways with the palms up and the thumbs flexed."}

The baby's arms should move sideways with the palms up and the thumbs flexed. The baby may cry for a minute.\nAs the reflex ends, the infant draws its arms back to the body, elbows flexed, and then relaxes.\nCauses\nThis is a normal reflex present in newborn infants.\nAbsence of the Moro reflex in an infant is abnormal.\nAbsence on both sides suggests damage to the brain or spinal cord.\nAbsence on only one side suggests either a broken shoulder bone or an injury to the group of nerves that run from the lower neck and upper shoulder area into the arm may be present (these nerves are called brachial plexus).\nA Moro reflex in an older infant, child, or adult is abnormal.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nAn abnormal Moro reflex is most often discovered by your provider. Your provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the child's medical history."}
