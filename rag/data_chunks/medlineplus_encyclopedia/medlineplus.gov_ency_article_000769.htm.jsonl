The most common are:\nLung cancer\nBreast cancer\nMelanoma\nKidney cancer\nSome types of cancer rarely spread to the brain, such as prostate and colon cancer. In some cases, a tumor can spread to the brain from an unknown location. This is called cancer of unknown primary (CUP).\nGrowing brain tumors can place pressure on nearby parts of the brain. Brain swelling due to these tumors also causes increased\npressure within the skull\n.\nBrain tumors that spread are classified based on the location of the tumor in the brain, the type of tissue involved, and the original location of the tumor.\nMetastatic brain tumors occur in about one fourth (25%) of all cancers that spread through the body."}

They are much more common than primary brain tumors (tumors that start in the brain).\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nDecreased coordination\n, clumsiness, falls\nGeneral ill feeling\nor\nfatigue\nHeadache\n, new or more severe than usual\nMemory loss, poor judgment, difficulty solving problems\nNumbness, tingling, pain, and other changes in sensation\nPersonality changes\nRapid emotional changes or strange behaviors\nSeizures\nthat are new\nProblems with speech\nVision changes\n, double vision, decreased vision\nVomiting, with or without nausea\nWeakness of a body area\nSpecific symptoms vary. Common symptoms of most types of metastatic brain tumors are caused by increased pressure in the brain.\nExams and Tests\nAn exam can show brain and nervous system changes based on where the tumor is in the brain. Signs of increased pressure in the skull are also common. Some tumors may not show signs until they are very large."}

Signs of increased pressure in the skull are also common. Some tumors may not show signs until they are very large. Then, they can cause a very quick decline in nervous system function.\nThe original (primary) tumor may be found by examining tumor tissues from the brain.\nTests may include:\nMammogram\n,\nCT scans\nof the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to find the original tumor site\nCT scan or\nMRI of the brain\nto confirm the diagnosis and identify the tumor location (MRI is usually more sensitive for finding tumors in the brain)\nExamination of tissue removed from the tumor during surgery or  CT scan- or MRI-guided\nbiopsy\nto confirm the type of tumor\nLumbar puncture\n(spinal tap)\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on:\nThe size and type of the tumor\nLocation in the body from where it spread\nThe person's general health\nThe goals of treatment may be to relieve symptoms, improve functioning, or provide comfort.\nWhole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) is often used to treat tumors that have spread to the brain, especially if there are many tumors, and surgery is not a good option.\nSurgery may be used when there is a single t"}

Some tumors may be completely removed. Tumors that are deep or that extend into brain tissue may be reduced in size (debulked).\nSurgery may reduce pressure and relieve symptoms in cases when the tumor cannot be removed.\nChemotherapy\nfor metastatic brain tumors is usually not as helpful as surgery or radiation. Some types of tumors, though, do respond to chemotherapy.\nStereotactic radiosurgery (SRS)\nmay also be used. This form of radiation therapy focuses high-power x-rays on a small area of the brain. It is used when there are only a few, small, metastatic tumors.\nMedicines for brain tumor symptoms include:\nAnticonvulsants such as phenytoin or levetiracetam to reduce or prevent seizures\nCorticosteroids such as dexamethasone to reduce brain swelling\nPain medicines\nWhen the cancer has spread, treatment may focus on relieving pain and other symptoms."}
