Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nStandard eye exam\nStandard eye exam\nA standard eye exam is a series of tests done to check your vision and the health of your eyes. This exam is performed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist. Both of these professionals are often called an \"eye doctor.\"\nHow the Test is Performed\nFirst, you will be asked if you are having any eye or vision problems. You will be asked to describe these problems, how long you have had them, and any factors that have made them better or worse.\nYour history of glasses or contact lenses will also be reviewed. The eye doctor will then ask about your overall health, including any medicines you take and your family's medical history.\nNext, the doctor will check your vision (\nvisual acuity\n) using a Snellen chart.\nYou will be asked to read random letters that become smaller line by line as your eyes move down the chart."}

Some Snellen charts are actually video monitors showing letters or images.\nTo see if you may need glasses, the doctor will place several lenses in front of your eye, one at a time, and ask you when the letters on the Snellen chart become easier to see. This is called a\nrefraction\n.\nOther parts of the exam include tests to:\nSee if you have proper three-dimensional (3D) vision (stereopsis).\nCheck your side (peripheral) vision.\nCheck the eye muscles by asking you to look in different directions at a penlight or other small object.\nExamine the pupils with a penlight to see if they respond (constrict) properly to light.\nOften, you'll be given eye drops to open up (dilate) your pupils. This allows the doctor to use a device called an ophthalmoscope to view the structures at the back of the eye. This area is called the fundus."}

Avoid eye strain on the day of the test. If you wear glasses or contacts, bring them with you. You may need someone to drive you home if the doctor uses eye drops to dilate your pupils.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe tests cause no pain or discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nAll children should have vision screening in a pediatrician's or family practitioner's office around the time when they learn the alphabet, and then every 1 to 2 years afterward."}
