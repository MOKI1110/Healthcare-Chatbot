Surgeons trained in the Mohs procedure can do this surgery. It allows skin cancer to be removed with less damage to the healthy skin around it.\nDescription\nMohs surgery usually takes place in the surgeon's office. The surgery is usually started early in the morning and is done in one day. Sometimes if the\ntumor\nis big or you need reconstruction, it may take two visits.\nDuring the procedure, the surgeon removes the cancer in layers until all the cancer has been removed. The surgeon will:\nNumb your skin where cancer is so you do not feel any pain. You stay awake for the procedure.\nRemove the visible tumor along with a thin layer of tissue next to the tumor.\nLook at the tissue under a microscope.\nCheck for cancer. If there is still cancer in that layer, the surgeon will take out another layer and look at that under the microscope.\nKeep repeating this procedure until there is no cancer found in a layer."}

Each round takes about 1 hour. The surgery takes 10 to 20 minutes, while preparing the tissue and looking at it under the microscope takes 40 to 50 minutes.\nDo 2 or more rounds to get all of the cancer. Larger or deep tumors may need more layers.\nApply a pressure dressing to the wound between layers.\nClose the wound with stitches after the skin cancer is removed completely. Small wounds sometimes do not require stitches."}

Small wounds sometimes do not require stitches. Larger wounds may require a\nskin graft\nor skin flap to close the wound.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nMohs surgery can be used for most skin cancers, such as basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers.\nMohs surgery may be preferred when the skin cancer is on an area where:\nIt is important to remove as little tissue as possible, such as the scalp, face, neck, hands, feet, nails, shins, or genitalia.\nThere is a scar or prior radiation treatment was used.\nThere is a higher chance the tumor will come back, such as on the ears, lips, nose, eyelids, temples, hands, feet, nails, or genitalia.\nMohs surgery may also be preferred when:\nThe skin cancer was already treated, and it was not completely removed, or it came back.\nThe skin cancer is large, or the edges of the skin cancer are not clear.\nYour\nimmune system\nis not working well due to cancer, cancer treatments, or medicines you are taking.\nThe tumor is deeper.\nRisks\nMohs surgery is generally safe."}

With Mohs surgery, you do not need to be put asleep (\ngeneral anesthesia\n) as you would with other surgeries.\nWhile rare, these are some risks for this surgery:\nInfection.\nNerve damage that causes numbness or a burning sensation. This usually goes away.\nLarger scars that are raised and red, called\nkeloids\n.\nBleeding.\nBefore the Procedure\nYour surgeon will explain what you should do to prepare for your surgery. You may be asked to:\nStop taking certain medicines, such as aspirin or other blood thinners that are not medically indicated. Do not stop taking any prescription medicines unless your surgeon tells you to stop.\nStop smoking.\nArrange to have someone take you home after your surgery if needed.\nAfter the Procedure\nTaking proper care of your wound after surgery will help your skin look its best. Your surgeon will talk with you about your options:\nLet a small wound heal itself. Most small wounds heal well on their own.\nUse stitches to close the wound.\nUse\nskin grafts\n."}

The surgeon covers the wound using skin from another part of your body.\nUse skin flaps. The surgeon covers the wound with the skin next to your wound. Skin near your wound matches in color and texture.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMohs surgery has a 99% cure rate in treating skin cancer.\nWith this surgery, the smallest amount of tissue possible is removed. You will have a smaller scar than you might have with other treatment options.\nAlternative Names\nSkin cancer - Mohs surgery; Basal cell skin cancer - Mohs surgery; Squamous cell skin cancer - Mohs surgery; Melanoma - Mohs surgery\nImages\nBasal cell cancer\nReferences\nAmerican College of Mohs Surgery website.
