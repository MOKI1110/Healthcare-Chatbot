This gives the health care providers time to perform tests to ensure that the donor's and recipient's blood and tissue match.\nPROCEDURE FOR A LIVING KIDNEY DONOR\nIf you are donating a kidney, you will be placed under general anesthesia before surgery. This means you will be asleep and pain-free."}

This means you will be asleep and pain-free. Surgeons today can often use small surgical cuts with laparoscopic techniques to remove the kidney.\nPROCEDURE FOR THE PERSON RECEIVING THE KIDNEY (RECIPIENT)\nPeople receiving a kidney transplant are given general anesthesia before surgery.\nThe surgeon makes a cut in the lower belly area.\nYour surgeon places the new kidney inside your lower belly. The artery and vein of the new kidney are connected to the artery and vein in your pelvis. Your blood flows through the new kidney, which makes urine just like your own kidneys did when they were healthy. The tube that carries urine (ureter) is then attached to your bladder.\nYour own kidneys are left in place unless they are causing a medical problem. The wound is then closed.\nKidney transplant surgery takes about 3 hours. People with diabetes may also have a pancreas transplant done at the same time."}

The wound is then closed.\nKidney transplant surgery takes about 3 hours. People with diabetes may also have a pancreas transplant done at the same time. This can add another 3 hours to the surgery.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nYou may need a kidney transplant if you have end-stage kidney disease. The most common cause of end-stage kidney disease in the United States is diabetes. However, there are many other causes.\nA kidney transplant may NOT be done if you have:\nCertain infections, such as TB or bone infections\nProblems taking medicines several times each day for the rest of your life\nHeart, lung, or liver disease\nOther life-threatening diseases\nRecent history of cancer\nInfections, such as hepatitis\nCurrent behaviors such as smoking, alcohol or drug abuse, or other risky lifestyle habits\nRisks\nSpecific risks related to this procedure include:\nBlood clots (deep venous thrombosis)\nHeart attack or stroke\nWound infections\nSide effects from medicines used to prevent transplant rejection\nLoss of transplanted kidney\nBefore the Procedure\nYou will be evaluated by a team at the transplant center."}

They will want to make sure that you are a good candidate for a kidney transplant. You will have several visits over a period of several weeks or months. You will need to have blood drawn and x-rays taken.\nTests done before the procedure include:\nTissue and blood typing to help make sure your body will not reject the donated kidney\nBlood tests or skin tests to check for infections\nHeart tests such as an ECG, echocardiogram, or cardiac catheterization\nTests to look for early cancer\nYou will also want to consider one or more transplant centers to determine which is best for you.\nAsk the center how many transplants they perform every year and what their survival rates are."}

Compare these numbers to those of other transplant centers.\nAsk about support groups they have available and what type of travel and housing arrangements they offer.\nIf the transplant team believes you are a good candidate for a kidney transplant, you will be put on a national waiting list.\nYour place on a waiting list is based on a number of factors. Key factors include the type of kidney problems you have, how severe your kidney disease is, what other conditions you have, such as heart disease, and the likelihood that a transplant will be successful.\nFor adults, the amount of time you spend on a waiting list is not the most important or main factor in how soon you get a kidney. Most people waiting for a kidney transplant are on dialysis. While you are waiting for a kidney:\nFollow any diet your transplant team recommends.\nDo not drink alcohol.\nDo not smoke.\nKeep your weight in the range that has been recommended."}

Report any changes in your medicines and any new or worsening medical problems to the transplant team.\nGo to all regular visits with your regular doctor and transplant team. Make sure the transplant team has the correct phone numbers so they can contact you right away if a kidney becomes available. Always make sure that you can be contacted quickly and easily.\nHave everything ready in advance to go to the hospital.\nAfter the Procedure\nIf you have received a donated kidney, you will need to stay in the hospital for about 3 to 7 days. You will need close follow-up by your transplant team and regular blood tests for 1 to 2 months.\nThe recovery period is about 6 months. Often, your transplant team will ask you to stay close to the hospital for the first 3 months."}

Those who receive a kidney from a living related donor do better than those who receive a kidney from a donor who has died. If you donate a kidney, you can most often live safely without complications with your one remaining kidney.\nPeople who receive a transplanted kidney may reject the new organ. This means that their immune system sees the new kidney as a foreign substance and tries to destroy it.\nIn order to avoid rejection, almost all kidney transplant recipients must take medicines that suppress their immune response for the rest of their life. This is called immunosuppressive therapy. Although the treatment helps prevent organ rejection, it also puts patients at a higher risk for infection and cancer. If you take this type of medicine, you need to be screened for cancer."}
