These cells are called cones. They are found in the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eye, called the\nretina\n.\nIf just one pigment is missing, you may have trouble telling the difference between red and green. This is the most common type of color blindness. If a different pigment is missing, you may have trouble seeing blue-yellow colors. People with blue-yellow color blindness often have problems seeing reds and greens, too.\nThe most severe form of color blindness is achromatopsia. This is a rare condition in which a person cannot see any color, only shades of gray.\nMost color blindness is due to a\ngenetic problem\n. About 1 in 10 men have some form of color blindness. Very few women are color blind.\nThe drug hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) can also cause color blindness."}

It is used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms vary from person to person, but may include:\nTrouble seeing colors and the brightness of colors in the usual way\nInability to tell the difference between shades of the same or similar colors\nOften, symptoms are so mild that people may not know they are color blind. A parent may notice signs of color blindness when a young child is first learning colors.\nRapid, side-to-side eye movements (nystagmus) and other symptoms may occur in severe cases.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider or eye specialist can check your color vision in several ways. Testing for color blindness is usually part of a complete\neye exam\n.\nTreatment\nThere is no known treatment. Special contact lenses and glasses may help people with color blindness tell the difference between similar colors.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nColor blindness is a lifelong condition."}

Most people are able to adjust to it.\nPossible Complications\nPeople who are colorblind may not be able to get a job that requires the ability to see colors accurately. For example, electricians, painters, and fashion designers need to be able to see colors accurately.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall your provider or eye specialist if you think you (or your child) may have color blindness.\nAlternative Names\nColor deficiency; Blindness - color\nReferences\nRobson AG, Moore AT, Duncan JL.
