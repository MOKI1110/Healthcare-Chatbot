Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMembranous nephropathy\nMembranous nephropathy\nMembranous nephropathy is a kidney disorder that leads to changes and inflammation of the structures inside the kidney that help filter wastes and fluids. The inflammation may lead to problems with kidney function.\nCauses\nMembranous nephropathy is caused by the thickening of a part of the glomerular basement membrane. The glomerular basement membrane is a part of the kidneys that helps filter waste and extra fluid from the blood. The exact reason for this thickening is not known.\nThe thickened glomerular membrane does not work normally. As a result, large amounts of protein are lost in the urine.\nThis condition is one of the most common causes of\nnephrotic syndrome\n. This is a group of symptoms and abnormal test results that include protein in the urine, low blood protein level, high cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels, increased blood clot risk, and swelling."}
