If the broken bone punctures the skin, it is called an open fracture (compound fracture).\nA stress fracture is a break in the bone that develops because of repeated or prolonged forces against the bone. The repeated stress weakens the bone until it finally breaks.\nConsiderations\nIt may be hard to tell a\ndislocated joint\nfrom a broken bone."}

Call emergency help right away. DO NOT breathe on the\nwound\nor probe it. Try to cover the wound to avoid further contamination. Cover with sterile dressings if they are available. Don't try to line up the fracture unless you are medically trained to do so.\nIf needed, immobilize the broken bone with a splint or sling. Possible splints include a rolled up newspaper or strips of wood. Immobilize the area both above and below the injured bone.\nApply ice packs to reduce pain and swelling. Elevating the limb can also help to reduce swelling.\nTake steps to prevent\nshock\n."}

Lay the person flat, elevate the feet about 12 inches (30 centimeters) above the head, and cover the person with a coat or blanket. However, DO NOT move the person if a head, neck, or back injury is suspected.\nCHECK BLOOD CIRCULATION\nCheck the person's blood circulation. Press firmly over the skin beyond the fracture site. (For example, if the fracture is in the leg, press on the foot). It should first blanch white and then \"pink up\" in about 2 seconds. Signs that circulation is inadequate include pale or blue skin, numbness or tingling, and loss of pulse.\nIf circulation is poor and trained personnel are NOT quickly available, try to realign the limb into a normal resting position. This will reduce swelling, pain, and damage to the tissues from lack of blood.\nTREAT BLEEDING\nPlace a dry, clean cloth over the wound to dress it.\nIf the bleeding continues, apply direct pressure to the site of bleeding."}

If you must move the person, pull the person to safety by their clothes (such as by the shoulders of a shirt, a belt, or pant legs).\nDO NOT move a person who has a possible spine injury.\nDO NOT attempt to straighten a bone or change its position unless blood circulation appears hampered and no medically trained personnel are nearby.\nDO NOT try to reposition a suspected spine injury.\nDO NOT test a bone's ability to move.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if:\nThe person is not responding or is losing consciousness.\nThere is a suspected broken bone in the head, neck, or back.\nThere is a suspected broken bone in"}

Remove throw rugs and electrical cords from floor surfaces. Use handrails on staircases and non-skid mats in bathtubs. These steps are especially important for older people.\nAlternative Names\nBone - broken; Fracture; Stress fracture; Bone fracture\nPatient Instructions\nFemur fracture repair - discharge\nHip fracture - discharge\nImages\nX-ray\nFracture types (1)\nFracture, forearm - x-ray\nOsteoclast\nBone fracture repair  - series\nFracture types (2)\nExternal fixation device\nFractures across a growth plate\nInternal fixation devices\nReferences\nGeiderman JM, Torbati S.
