Ovarian failure that occurs before the age of 40 is considered premature ovarian failure.\nCauses\nPremature ovarian failure may be caused by genetic factors such as chromosome abnormalities. It may also occur with certain autoimmune disorders that disrupt the normal function of the ovaries. Most often there is no obvious cause, although a family history of the condition may play a role.\nChemotherapy and radiation therapy can also cause premature ovarian failure.\nSymptoms\nWomen with premature ovarian failure may develop symptoms of menopause, which include:\nHot flashes\nIrregular or absent periods\nMood swings\nNight sweats\nVaginal dryness\nThis condition may also make it hard for a woman to become pregnant.\nExams and Tests\nA blood test will be done to check your level of follicle-stimulating hormone, or\nFSH\n."}

FSH levels are higher than normal in women with premature ovarian failure.\nA vaginal ultrasound may be done to check how many follicles the ovaries contain. Reduced numbers of ovarian follicles may occur in women who develop this condition.\nOther blood tests may be done to look for autoimmune disorders or thyroid disease.\nWomen with premature ovarian failure who want to become pregnant may be concerned about their ability to conceive. Those younger than age 30 may have a chromosome analysis to check for genetic problems. In most cases, older women who are close to menopause do not need this test.\nTreatment\nEstrogen therapy often helps relieve menopausal symptoms and prevents bone loss. However, it will not increase your chances of becoming pregnant. Fewer than 1 in 10 women with this condition will be able to get pregnant."}
