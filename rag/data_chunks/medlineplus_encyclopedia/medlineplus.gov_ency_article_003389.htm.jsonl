Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTransillumination\nTransillumination\nTransillumination is the shining of a light through a body area or organ to check for abnormalities.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe room lights are dimmed or turned off so that the area of the body may be seen more easily. A bright light is then pointed at that area. Areas where this test is used include the:\nHead\nScrotum\nChest of a premature or newborn infant\nBreast of an adult female\nTransillumination is also sometimes used to find blood vessels.\nIn some locations in the stomach and intestine, the light can be seen through the skin and tissues at the time of\nupper endoscopy\nand\ncolonoscopy\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo preparation is necessary for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThere is no discomfort with this test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test may be done along with other tests to diagnose:\nHydrocephalus\nin newborns or infants\nFluid-filled sac in the scrotum (\nhydrocele\n) or a tumor in the testicle\nBreast lesions or cysts in women\nIn newborns, a bright halogen light may be used to transilluminate the chest"}

(Transillumination through the chest is only possible on small newborns.)\nIn general, transillumination is not an accurate enough test to rely on. Further tests, such as an\nx-ray\n,\nCT scan\n, or\nultrasound\n, are needed to confirm the diagnosis.\nNormal Results\nNormal findings depend on the area being evaluated and the normal tissue of that area.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAreas filled with abnormal air or fluid light up when they should not."}
