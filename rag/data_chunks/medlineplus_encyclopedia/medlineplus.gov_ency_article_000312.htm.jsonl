Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHypokalemic periodic paralysis\nHypokalemic periodic paralysis\nHypokalemic periodic paralysis (hypoPP) is a disorder that causes occasional episodes of muscle weakness and sometimes a lower than normal level of potassium in the blood. The medical name for low potassium level is\nhypokalemia\n.\nHypoPP is one of a group of genetic disorders that includes\nhyperkalemic periodic paralysis\nand\nthyrotoxic periodic paralysis\n.\nHypoPP is the most common form of periodic paralysis. It affects males more often.\nCauses\nHypoPP is congenital. This means it is present at birth. In most cases, it is passed down through families (inherited) as an\nautosomal dominant\ndisorder. In other words, only one parent needs to pass the gene related to this condition on to their child in order for the child to be affected.\nIn some cases, the condition may be the result of a genetic problem that is not inherited.\nUnlike other forms of periodic paralysis, people with hypoPP have normal thyroid function."}

But they have a very low blood level of potassium during episodes of weakness. This results from potassium moving from the blood into muscle cells in an abnormal way.\nRisk factors include having other family members with periodic paralysis. The risk is slightly higher in Asian men who also have thyroid disorders.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include attacks of muscle weakness or loss of muscle movement (\nparalysis\n) that come and go. There is normal muscle strength between attacks.\nAttacks usually begin in the teen years, but they can occur before age 10. How often the attacks occur varies. Some people have attacks every day. Others have them once a year."}

How often the attacks occur varies. Some people have attacks every day. Others have them once a year. During attacks the person remains alert.\nThe weakness or paralysis:\nMost commonly occurs at the shoulders and hips\nMay also affect the arms, legs, muscles of the eyes, and muscles that help with breathing and swallowing\nOccurs off and on\nMost commonly occurs on awakening or after sleep or rest\nIs rare during exercise, but may be triggered by resting after exercise\nMay be triggered by high-carbohydrate, high-salt meals, stress, pregnancy, heavy exercise, and cold\nAn attack usually lasts for several hours up to a day\nAnother symptom may include eyelid\nmyotonia\n(a condition in which after opening and closing the eyes, they cannot be opened for a short time).\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider may suspect hypoPP based on a family history of the disorder. Other clues to the disorder are muscle weakness symptoms that come and go with normal or low results of a blood\npotassium test\n.\nBetween attacks, a physical examination shows nothing abnormal."}

Before an attack, there may be leg stiffness or heaviness in the legs.\nDuring an attack of muscle weakness, the blood potassium level is low. This confirms the diagnosis. There is no decrease in total body potassium. The blood potassium level is normal between attacks.\nDuring an attack, muscle reflexes are decreased or absent. And muscles go limp rather than staying stiff. Muscle groups near the body, such as the shoulders and hips, are involved more often than the arms and legs.\nTests that may be done include:\nElectrocardiogram (\nECG\n), which may be abnormal during attacks\nElectromyography (\nEMG\n), which is usually normal between attacks and abnormal during attacks\nMuscle biopsy\n, which may show abnormalities\nOther tests may be ordered to rule out other causes.\nTreatment\nThe goals of treatment are relief of symptoms and prevention of further attacks.\nMuscle weakness that involves the breathing or swallowing muscles is an emergency situation."}

Dangerous irregular heartbeats (\nheart arrhythmias\n) may also occur during attacks. Any of these must be treated right away.\nPotassium given during an attack may stop the attack. Potassium can be taken by mouth. But if weakness is severe, potassium may need to be given through a vein (IV).\nTaking potassium supplements may help prevent muscle weakness.\nEating a low-carbohydrate diet may help decrease symptoms.\nA medicine called acetazolamide may be prescribed to prevent attacks. Your provider may tell you to also take potassium supplements because acetazolamide may cause your body to lose potassium.\nIf acetazolamide does not work for you, other medicines may be prescribed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHypoPP responds well to treatment. Treatment may prevent, and even reverse, progressive muscle weakness."}

Because it can be inherited, genetic counseling may be advised for couples at risk of the disorder.\nTreatment prevents attacks of weakness."}
