It is very important to seek immediate medical help after a battery is swallowed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThis substance is very poisonous. How well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed, what symptoms occur within the first 10 to 15 minutes after swallowing it, and how quickly treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery. Kidney dialysis (filtration) through a machine may be needed if the kidneys do not recover after acute mercury poisoning.\nKidney failure\nand death can occur, even from small doses.\nIf the poisoning has occurred slowly over time, any brain damage may be permanent.\nMercuric oxide poisoning can lead to multiple organ failure and death.\nReferences\nKao LW, Tormoehlen L, Froberg BA.
