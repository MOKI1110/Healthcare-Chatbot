Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFine needle aspiration of the thyroid\nFine needle aspiration of the thyroid\nFine needle aspiration of the thyroid gland is a procedure to remove thyroid cells for examination. The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped gland located inside the front of the lower neck.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis test may be done in your health care provider's office or in a hospital. Numbing medicine (anesthesia) may or may not be used. Because the needle is very thin, you may not need this medicine.\nYou lie on your back with a pillow under your shoulders with your neck extended. The biopsy site is cleaned. A thin needle is inserted into your thyroid, where it collects a sample of thyroid cells and fluid. The needle is then taken out. If your provider cannot feel the biopsy site, they may use\nultrasound\nor a\nCT scan\nto guide where to put the needle. Ultrasound and CT scans are painless procedures that show images inside the body.\nPressure is applied to the biopsy site to stop any bleeding."}

Also, make sure your provider has a current list of all medicines you take, including herbal remedies and over-the-counter medicines.\nA few days to a week before your biopsy, you may be asked to temporarily stop taking blood-thinning medicines. The medicines you may need to stop taking include:\nAspirin\nClopidogrel (Plavix)\nIbuprofen (Advil, Motrin)\nNaproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn)\nWarfarin (Coumadin)\nBe sure to talk with your provider before stopping any medicines.\nHow the Test will Feel\nIf numbing medicine is used, you may feel a sting as the needle is inserted and the medicine is injected.\nAs the biopsy needle passes into your thyroid, you may feel some pressure, but it should not be painful.\nYou may have slight discomfort in your neck afterward."}

You may also have slight bruising, which soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis is a test to diagnose thyroid disease or\nthyroid cancer\n. It is often used to find out if thyroid\nnodules\nthat your provider can feel or see on an ultrasound are noncancerous or cancerous.\nNormal Results\nA normal result shows the thyroid tissue looks normal and the cells do not appear to be cancer under a microscope.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may mean:\nThyroid disease, such as\ngoiter\nor\nthyroiditis\nNoncancerous tumors\nThyroid cancer\nRisks\nThe main risk is bleeding into or around the thyroid gland. With severe bleeding, there may be pressure on the windpipe (trachea). This problem is rare.\nAlternative Names\nThyroid nodule fine needle aspirate biopsy; Biopsy - thyroid - skinny-needle; Skinny-needle thyroid biopsy; Thyroid nodule - aspiration; Thyroid cancer - aspiration\nImages\nEndocrine glands\nThyroid gland biopsy\nReferences\nAhmad FI, Zafereo ME, Lai SY."}
