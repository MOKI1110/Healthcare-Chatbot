DNA is the material that holds\ngenes\n. It is the building block of the human body.\nChromosomes also contain proteins that help DNA exist in the proper form.\nInformation\nChromosomes come in pairs. Normally, each cell in the human body has 23 pairs of chromosomes (46 total chromosomes). Half come from the mother; the other half come from the father.\nTwo of the chromosomes (the X and the Y chromosome) are called sex chromosomes, and in almost all people:\nFemales have 2 X chromosomes.\nMales have 1 X and 1 Y chromosome.\nAt conception, the mother gives an X chromosome to the child, and the father may contribute an X or a Y. The chromosome from the father determines if the baby is female or male.  In most cases, a child is born as a male or female according to their chromosomes. However, children with\ndifferences  of sex development\nmay be born with genitalia that do not match their chromosomes."}

All of these conditions can cause problems with sexual development.\nThe remaining chromosomes are called autosomal chromosomes. They are known as chromosome pairs 1 through 22.\nImages\nChromosomes and DNA\nReferences\nPerle MA, Stein CH. Applications of cytogenetics in modern pathology.
