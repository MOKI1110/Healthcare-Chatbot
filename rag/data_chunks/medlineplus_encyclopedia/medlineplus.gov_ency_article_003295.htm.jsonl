Joints most commonly affected are the elbows, wrists, fingers, and knees.\nConsiderations\nChildren's joints are often more flexible than adults' joints. But children with hypermobile joints can flex and extend their joints beyond what is considered normal. The movement is done without too much force and without discomfort.\nThick bands of tissue called ligaments help hold joints together and keep them from moving too much or too far. In children with hypermobility syndrome, those ligaments are loose or weak. This may lead to:\nArthritis, which may develop over time, usually many years\nDislocated joints, which is a separation of two bones where they meet at a joint\nSprains and strains\nChildren with hypermobile joints also often have flat feet.\nCauses\nHypermobile joints often occur in otherwise healthy and normal children."}

This is called benign hypermobility syndrome.\nRare medical conditions associated with hypermobile joints include:\nCleidocranial dysostosis\n(abnormal development of bones in the skull and clavicle)\nDown syndrome\n(genetic condition in which a person has 47 chromosomes instead of the usual 46)\nEhlers-Danlos syndrome\n(group of inherited disorders marked by extremely loose joints)\nMarfan syndrome\n(connective tissue disorder)\nMucopolysaccharidosis type IV\n(disorder in which body is missing or doesn't have enough of a substance needed to break down long chains of sugar molecules)\nHome Care\nThere is no specific care for this condition. People with hypermobile joints have an increased risk for\njoint dislocation\nand other problems.\nExtra care may be needed to protect the joints."}
