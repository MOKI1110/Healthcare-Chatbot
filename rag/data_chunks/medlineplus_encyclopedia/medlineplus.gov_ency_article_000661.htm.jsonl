It is in the same family as the Epstein-Barr virus, which causes\nmononucleosis\n.\nKSHV is transmitted mainly through saliva. It can also be spread through sexual contact, blood transfusion, or transplants. After it enters the body, the virus can infect different kinds of cells, especially cells that line blood vessels and lymphatic vessels. Like all herpesviruses, KSHV remains in your body for the rest of your life. If your immune system becomes weakened in the future, this virus may have the chance to reactivate, causing symptoms.\nThere are four types of KS based on the groups of people who are infected:\nClassic KS: Mainly affects older men of Eastern European, Middle Eastern, and Mediterranean descent."}

The disease usually develops slowly.\nEpidemic (AIDS-related) KS: Occurs most often in people who have HIV infection and have developed AIDS.\nEndemic (African) KS: Mainly affects people of all ages in Africa.\nImmunosuppression-associated, or transplantation-associated, KS: Occurs in people who have had an organ transplant and take medicines that suppress their immune system.\nSymptoms\nThe tumors (lesions) most often appear as bluish-red or purple bumps on the skin. They are reddish-purple because they are rich in blood vessels.\nThe lesions may first appear on any part of the body. They also can appear inside the body. Lesions inside the body may bleed."}

Lesions in the lungs can cause\nbloody sputum\nor\nshortness of breath\n.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam, focusing on the lesions.\nThe following tests may be performed to diagnose KS and associated conditions:\nBronchoscopy\nCT scan\nEndoscopy\nSkin biopsy\nHIV test\nTreatment\nHow KS is treated depends on:\nHow much the immune system is suppressed (\nimmunosuppression\n)\nNumber and location of the tumors\nSymptoms\nTreatments include:\nAntiviral therapy against HIV, since there is no specific therapy for HHV-8\nCombination\nchemotherapy\nFreezing the lesions\nRadiation therapy\nLesions may return after treatment.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nTreating KS does not improve the chances of survival from HIV/AIDS itself. The outlook depends on the person's immune status and how much of the HIV virus is in their blood (viral load)."}

If HIV is controlled with medicine, the lesions will often shrink away on their own.\nPossible Complications\nComplications can include:\nCough (possibly bloody) and shortness of breath if the disease is in the lungs\nLeg swelling that may be painful or cause infections if the disease is in the lymph nodes of the legs\nThe tumors can return even after treatment. KS can be deadly for a person with AIDS.\nAn aggressive form of endemic KS can spread quickly to the bones. Another form found in African children does not affect the skin. Instead, it spreads through the lymph nodes and vital organs, and can quickly become deadly.\nPrevention\nSafer sexual practices\ncan prevent HIV infection."}
