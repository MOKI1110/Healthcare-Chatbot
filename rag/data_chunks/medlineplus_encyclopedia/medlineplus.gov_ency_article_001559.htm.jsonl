Bilirubin is a yellow substance that the body creates when it replaces old red blood cells. The liver helps break down the substance so it can be removed from the body in the stool.\nA high level of bilirubin makes a baby's skin and whites of the eyes look yellow. This is called jaundice.\nCauses\nIt is normal for a baby's bilirubin level to be a bit high after birth.\nWhen the baby is growing in the mother's womb (uterus), the placenta removes bilirubin from the baby's body. The placenta is the organ that grows during pregnancy to feed the baby. After birth, the baby's liver starts doing this job. But, it may take some time for the baby's liver to be able to do this efficiently.\nMost newborns have some jaundice. This is called physiological jaundice. It is usually noticeable when the baby is 2 to 4 days old. Most of the time, it does not cause problems and goes away within 2 weeks.\nTwo types of jaundice may occur in newborns who are breastfed."}

It is usually noticeable when the baby is 2 to 4 days old. Most of the time, it does not cause problems and goes away within 2 weeks.\nTwo types of jaundice may occur in newborns who are breastfed. Both types are usually harmless.\nBreastfeeding jaundice is seen in breastfed babies during the first week of life. It is more likely to occur when babies do not nurse well or the mother's milk is slow to come, leading to\ndehydration\n.\nBreast milk jaundice may appear in some healthy, breastfed babies after day 7 of life. It is likely to peak during weeks 2 and 3, but may last at low levels for a month or more. The problem may be due to how substances in the breast milk affect the breakdown of bilirubin in the liver."}

It usually begins on the face and then moves down to the chest, belly area, legs, and soles of the feet.\nSometimes, infants with severe jaundice may be very tired and feed poorly.\nExams and Tests\nYour baby's health care providers will watch for signs of jaundice at the hospital. After the newborn goes home, family members will usually spot the jaundice.\nAny infant who appears jaundiced should have bilirubin levels measured right away. This can be done with a blood test.\nMany hospitals check total bilirubin levels on all babies at about 24 hours of age. Hospitals use probes that can estimate the bilirubin level just by touching the skin."}

Others may need to go back to the hospital when they are a few days old. Treatment in the hospital usually lasts 1 to 2 days.\nSometimes, special blue lights are used on infants whose bilirubin levels are very high. These lights work by helping to break down bilirubin in the skin. This is called\nphototherapy\n.\nThe infant is placed under these lights in a warm, enclosed bed to maintain a constant temperature.\nThe baby will wear only a diaper and special eye shades to protect the eyes.\nBreastfeeding should be continued during phototherapy, if possible.\nIn rare cases, the baby may need an IV line to deliver fluids.\nIf the bilirubin level is not too high or is not rising quickly, you can do phototherapy at home with a fiberoptic blanket, which has tiny bright lights in it."}

In this procedure, the baby's blood is replaced with fresh blood. Giving IV immunoglobulin to babies who have severe jaundice may also be effective in reducing bilirubin levels.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nNewborn jaundice is not harmful most of the time.

The risk for serious jaundice can often be reduced by feeding babies at least 8 to 12 times a day for the first several days and by carefully identifying infants at highest risk.\nAll pregnant women should be tested for blood type and unusual antibodies. If the mother is Rh negative, follow-up testing on the infant's umbilical cord is recommended. This may also be done if the mother's blood type is O positive.\nCareful monitoring of all babies during the first 5 days of life can prevent most complications of jaundice."}
