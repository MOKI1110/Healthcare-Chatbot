Pulmonary means related to the lungs.\nCauses\nMany types of lung injury can result from medicines. It is usually impossible to predict who will develop lung disease from a medicine.\nTypes of lung problems or diseases that may be caused by medicines include:\nAllergic reactions\n--\nasthma\n,\nhypersensitivity pneumonitis\n, or\neosinophilic pneumonia\nBleeding into the lung air sacs, called alveoli (alveolar hemorrhage)\nSwelling and inflamed tissue in the main passages that carry air to the lungs (\nbronchitis\n)\nDamage to lung tissue (\ninterstitial fibrosis\n)\nDrugs that cause the immune system to mistakenly attack and destroy healthy body tissue, such as\ndrug-induced lupus erythematosus\nGranulomatous lung disease -- a type of inflammation in the lungs\nInflammation of the lung air sacs (pneumonitis or infiltration)\nLung vasculitis (inflammation of lung blood vessels)\nLymph node swelling\nSwelling and irri"}

These include:\nAntibiotics, such as nitrofurantoin and sulfa drugs\nHeart medicines, such as amiodarone\nChemotherapy\ndrugs such as bleomycin, cyclophosphamide, and methotrexate\nImmunotherapy drugs that are used to treat cancer\nStreet drugs\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nBloody sputum\nChest pain\nCough\nFever\nShortness of breath\nWheezing\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and listen to your chest and lungs with a stethoscope."}

Anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids are most often used to quickly reverse the lung inflammation.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAcute\nepisodes usually go away within 48  to 72 hours after the medicine has been stopped.\nChronic\nsymptoms may take longer to improve.\nSome drug-induced lung diseases, such as pulmonary fibrosis, may never go away and can worsen, even after the medicine or substance is stopped and can lead to severe lung disease and death.\nPossible Complications\nComplications that may develop include:\nDiffuse interstitial pulmonary fibrosis\nHypoxemia (low blood oxygen)\nRespiratory failure\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of this disorder.\nPrevention\nNote any past reaction you have had to a medicine, so that you can avoid the medicine in the future. Wear a medical alert bracelet if you have known drug reactions."}
