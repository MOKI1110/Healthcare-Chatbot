Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSerum sickness\nSerum sickness\nSerum sickness is a reaction that is similar to an\nallergy\n. The\nimmune system reacts\nto medicines that contain proteins used to treat immune conditions. It can also react to antiserum, the liquid part of blood that contains\nantibodies\ngiven to a person to help protect them against germs or poisonous substances.\nCauses\nPlasma is the clear fluid portion of blood. It does not contain blood cells. But it does contain many proteins, including antibodies, which are formed as part of the immune response to protect against infection.\nAntiserum is produced from the plasma of a person or animal that has immunity against an infection or poisonous substance. Antiserum may be used to protect a person who has been exposed to a germ or toxin. For example, you may receive a certain type of antiserum injection:\nIf you have been exposed to\ntetanus\nor\nrabies\nand have never been vaccinated against these germs."}

This is called passive immunization.\nIf you have been bitten by a snake that produces a dangerous toxin.\nDuring serum sickness, the immune system falsely identifies a protein in antiserum as a harmful substance (\nantigen\n). The result is an immune system response that attacks the antiserum. Immune system elements and the antiserum combine to form immune complexes, which cause the symptoms of serum sickness.\nCertain medicines (such as penicillin, cefaclor, and sulfa) can cause a similar reaction.\nInjected proteins such as antithymocyte globulin (used to treat organ transplant rejection) and rituximab (used to treat immune disorders and cancers) can cause serum sickness reactions.\nBlood products may also cause serum sickness.\nSymptoms\nUnlike other\nmedicine allergies\n, which occur very soon after receiving the medicine, serum sickness develops 7 to 21 days after the first exposure to a medicine."}
