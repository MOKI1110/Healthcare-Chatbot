Without oxygen, brain damage can occur in as little as 4 minutes. Rapid first aid for choking can save a person's life.\nCauses\nChoking can be caused by any of the following:\nEating too fast, not chewing food well, or eating with dentures that do not fit well\nFoods such as food chunks, hot dogs, popcorn, peanut butter, sticky or gooey food (marshmallows, gummy bears, dough)\nDrinking alcohol (even a small amount of alcohol affects awareness)\nBeing unconscious and breathing in vomit\nBreathing in small objects (young children)\nInjury to the head and face (for example, swelling, bleeding, or a deformity can cause choking)\nSwallowing problems after a stroke\nEnlarged tonsils or tumors of the neck and throat\nProblems with the esophagus (food pipe or"}

If the person does not do this, look for these danger signs:\nInability to speak\nDifficulty breathing\nNoisy breathing or high-pitched sounds while inhaling\nWeak, ineffective coughing\nBluish skin color\n(cyanosis)\nLoss of consciousness (unresponsiveness) if blockage is not cleared\nFirst Aid\nFirst ask, \"Are you choking? Can you speak?\" Do not perform first aid if the person is coughing forcefully and is able to speak. A strong cough can dislodge the object. Encourage the person to keep coughing to dislodge the object.\nIf the person cannot speak or is having a hard time breathing, you need to act fast to help the person. You can perform abdominal thrusts, back blows, or both.\nTo perform abdominal thrusts (Heimlich maneuver):\nStand behind the person and wrap your arms around the person's waist. For a child, you may have to kneel.\nMake a fist with one hand."}

Anyone who is choking should have a medical exam. Complications can occur not only from the choking, but also from the first aid measures that were taken.\nDO NOT\nDo not interfere if the person is coughing forcefully, is able to speak, or is able to breathe in and out adequately.
