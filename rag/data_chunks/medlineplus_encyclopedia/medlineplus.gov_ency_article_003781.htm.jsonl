Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRenal arteriography\nRenal arteriography\nRenal arteriography is a special x-ray of the arteries of the kidneys.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis test is done in the hospital or outpatient office by a radiologist usually assisted by a technician or other staff members. You will lie on an x-ray table.\nDoctors often use an artery near the groin for the test. Occasionally, the doctor may use an artery in the wrist.\nYour doctor will:\nClean and shave the area.\nApply a numbing medicine to the area.\nPlace a needle into the artery.\nPass a thin wire through the needle into the artery.\nTake out the needle.\nInsert a long, narrow, flexible tube called a catheter in its place.\nThe doctor directs the catheter into correct position using x-ray images of the body. An instrument called fluoroscope sends the images to a TV monitor, which the doctor can see.\nThe catheter is pushed ahead over the wire into the aorta (main blood vessel from the heart). It then enters the kidney artery. The test uses a special dye (called contrast) to help the arteries show on the x-ray."}

It then enters the kidney artery. The test uses a special dye (called contrast) to help the arteries show on the x-ray. The blood vessels of the kidneys are not seen with ordinary x-rays. The dye flows through the catheter into the kidney artery.\nX-ray images are taken as the dye moves through the blood vessels. Saline (sterile salt water) containing a blood thinner may also be sent through the catheter to keep blood in the area from clotting.\nThe catheter is removed after the x-rays are taken. A closure device is placed in the groin or pressure is applied to the area to stop the bleeding. You may be asked to keep your leg straight for 4 to 6 hours after the procedure.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nTell your doctor if:\nYou are pregnant\nYou have ever had any bleeding problems\nYou currently take blood thinners, including daily aspirin\nYou ever had any\nallergic reactions\n, especially those related to x-ray contrast material or iodine substances\nYou have ever been diagnosed with kidney failure or poorly functioning kidneys\nYou must sign a consent form."}

DO NOT eat or drink anything for 6 to 8 hours before the test. You will be given a hospital gown to wear and asked to remove all jewelry. You may be given a pain pill (sedative) before the procedure or IV sedatives during the procedure.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will lie flat on the x-ray table. There is usually a cushion, but it is not as comfortable as a bed. You may feel a sting when the anesthesia medicine is given. You may feel some pressure and discomfort as the catheter is positioned.\nSome people feel a warm sensation when the dye is injected, but most people cannot feel it. You don't feel the catheter inside your body.\nThere may be slight tenderness and bruising at the site of the injection after the test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nRenal arteriography is often done after other tests are done first. These may include\nduplex ultrasound\n, CT abdomen, CT angiogram, MRI abdomen, or MRI angiogram."}

Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nRenal angiography may show the presence of tumors, narrowing of the artery or aneurysms (widening of the vein or artery), blood clots, fistulas, or bleeding in the kidney.\nThe test may also be done with the following conditions:\nBlockage of an artery by a blood clot\nRenal artery stenosis\nRenal cell cancer\nAngiomyolipomas (noncancerous tumors of the kidney)\nSome of these problems can be treated with techniques done at the same time the arteriogram is performed.\nAngioplasty is a procedure to open a narrowed or blocked blood vessels that supply blood to your kidneys.\nA stent is a small, metal mesh tube that keeps the artery open. It may be placed to keep a narrowed artery open.\nCancers and noncancerous tumors can be treated using a process called embolization. This involves using substances that block blood flow in order to kill or shrink the tumor."}

Sometimes, this is performed in combination with surgery.\nBleeding can also be treated with embolization.\nRisks\nThe procedure is generally safe. There may be some risks, such as:\nAllergic reaction to the dye (contrast medium)\nArterial damage\nDamage to the artery or artery wall, which can lead to blood clots\nKidney damage from damage to the artery or from the dye\nThere is low\nradiation exposure\n. Pregnant women and children are more sensitive to the risks related to x-rays.\nConsiderations\nThe test should NOT be done if you are pregnant or have severe bleeding problems.\nMagnetic resonance angiography\n(MRA) or CT angiography (CTA) can be done instead. MRA and CTA are noninvasive and can provide similar imaging of the kidney arteries, although they cannot be used for treatment.\nAlternative Names\nRenal angiogram; Angiography - kidney; Renal angiography; Renal artery stenosis - arteriography\nImages\nKidney anatomy\nRenal arteries\nReferences\nAzarbal AF, Mclafferty RB.
