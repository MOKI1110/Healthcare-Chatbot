These growths are typically not cancerous (benign), and do not become cancerous.\nCauses\nUterine fibroids are common. As many as one in five women may have fibroids during their childbearing years. Half of all women have fibroids by age 50.\nFibroids are rare in women under age 20. They are more common in African Americans than White, Hispanic, or Asian women.\nNo one knows exactly what causes fibroids. They are thought to be caused by:\nHormones in the body\nGenes (may run in families)\nFibroids can be so tiny that you need a microscope to see them. They can also grow very large. They may fill the entire uterus and may weigh several pounds or kilograms."}

They can also grow very large. They may fill the entire uterus and may weigh several pounds or kilograms. Although it is possible for just one fibroid to develop, most often there is more than one.\nFibroids can grow:\nIn the muscle wall of the uterus (myometrial)\nJust under the surface of the uterine lining (submucosal)\nJust under the outside lining of the uterus (subserosal)\nOn a long stalk on the outside of the uterus or inside the uterus (pedunculated)\nSymptoms\nCommon symptoms of uterine fibroids are:\nBleeding between periods\nHeavy bleeding during your period, sometimes with blood clots\nPeriods that may last longer than normal\nNeeding to urinate more often\nPelvic cramping or pain with periods\nFeeling fullness or pressure in your lower belly\nPain during intercourse\nOften, you can have fibroids and not have any symptoms. Your health care provider may find them during a physical exam or other test. Fibroids often shrink and cause no symptoms in women who have gone through menopause."}

This may show that you have a change in the shape and size of your womb.\nFibroids are not always easy to diagnose. Being obese may make fibroids harder to detect. You may need these tests to look for fibroids:\nUltrasound\nuses sound waves to create a picture of the uterus.\nMRI\nuses powerful magnets and radio waves to create a picture of the uterus.\nSaline infusion sonogram (hysterosonography) -- Saline is injected into the uterus to make it easier to see the uterus using ultrasound.\nHysteroscopy uses a long, thin tube inserted through the vagina and into the uterus to examine the inside of the uterus.\nEndometrial biopsy\nremoves a small piece of the lining of the uterus to check for cancer if you have unusual bleeding.\nTreatment\nWhat type of treatment you have depends on:\nYour age\nYour general health\nYour symptoms\nType of fibroids\nIf you are pregnan"}

Most often, this therapy is used only for a short time to shrink fibroids before surgery. They can also be used longer when small amounts of estrogen hormone are added back to reduce side effects.\nSurgery and procedures used to treat fibroids include:\nHysteroscopy\n-- This procedure can remove fibroids growing inside the uterus.\nEndometrial ablation\n-- This procedure is sometimes used to treat heavy bleeding associated with fibroids. It works best when the fibroids are small in size. It often stops menstruation completely.\nUterine artery embolization\n-- This procedure stops the blood supply to the fibroid, causing it to shrink and die. This may be a good option if you wish to avoid surgery and are not planning to become pregnant.\nMyomectomy -- This surgery removes the fibroids from the uterus. This also may be a good choice if you want to have children. It will not prevent new fibroids from growing.\nHysterectomy\n-- This surgery removes the uterus completely."}

This is due to the increased blood flow and higher estrogen levels. The fibroids usually return to their original size after your baby is born.\nPossible Complications\nComplications of fibroids include:\nSevere pain or very heavy bleeding that needs emergency surgery.\nTwisting of the fibroid -- This can cause blocked blood vessels that feed the tumor."}
