They are caused by a virus called human papillomavirus (HPV). There are more than 150 types of HPV viruses. Some types of warts are spread through sex.\nCauses\nAll warts can spread from one part of your body to another. Warts can spread from person to person by contact, especially sexual contact.\nSymptoms\nMost warts are raised and have a rough surface. They may be round or oval.\nThe spot where the wart is may be lighter or darker than your skin. In rare cases, warts are black.\nSome warts have smooth or flat surfaces.\nSome warts may cause pain.\nDifferent types of warts include:\nCommon warts\noften appear on the hands, but they can grow anywhere.\nFlat warts\nare generally found on the face and forehead. They are common in children. They are less common in teens, and rare in adults.\nGenital warts\nusually appear on the genitals, in the pubic area, and in the space between the thighs."}
