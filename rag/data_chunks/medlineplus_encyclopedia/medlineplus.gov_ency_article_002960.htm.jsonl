The retina is the light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye. Detachment means that it has pulled away from the layers of tissue around it.\nThis article describes the repair of rhegmatogenous retinal detachments. These occur due to a hole or tear in the retina.\nDescription\nMost retinal detachment repair operations are urgent. If holes or tears in the retina are found before the retina detaches, the eye doctor can close the holes using a laser. This procedure is most often done in the eye doctor's office.\nIn any surgery to repair a retinal detachment there are two steps. In one step, a scar around the tear or hole is created usually using a cryoprobe or a laser. The other step is to \"push\" the separated layers of the retina back together. There are two ways: push them together from the inside using a gas bubble inside the eye (retinopexy) or push them together from the outside using a scleral buckle."}

There are two ways: push them together from the inside using a gas bubble inside the eye (retinopexy) or push them together from the outside using a scleral buckle. The type of detachment (size, location) will determine which step occurs first.\nIf the retina has just started to detach, a procedure called pneumatic retinopexy may be done to repair it.\nPneumatic retinopexy (gas bubble placement) is most often an office procedure.\nThe eye doctor injects a bubble of gas into the eye.\nYou are then positioned so the gas bubble floats up against the hole in the retina and pushes it back into place.\nThe doctor will use a laser to permanently seal the hole.\nSevere detachments need more advanced surgery. The following procedures are done in a hospital or outpatient surgery center:\nThe scleral buckle method indents the wall of the eye inward so that it meets the hole in the retina. Scleral buckling can be done using numbing medicine while you are awake (local anesthesia) or when you are asleep and pain free (\ngeneral anesthesia\n).\nThe vitrectomy procedure uses very small devices inside the eye to release tension on the retina."}

This allows the retina to move back into its proper position. Most vitrectomies are done with numbing medicine while you are awake.\nIn complex cases, both procedures may be done at the same time.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nRetinal detachments do not get better without treatment. Repair is needed to prevent permanent\nvision loss\n.\nHow quickly the surgery needs to be done depends on the location and extent of the detachment. If possible, the surgery should be done the same day if the detachment has not affected the central vision area (the macula). This can help prevent further detachment of the retina. It also will increase the chance of preserving good vision.\nIf the macula detaches, it is too late to restore normal vision. Surgery can still be done to prevent total blindness."}

In these cases, eye doctors can wait a week to 10 days to schedule surgery.\nRisks\nRisks for retinal detachment surgery include:\nBleeding\nDetachment that is not completely fixed (may require more surgeries)\nIncrease in eye pressure (elevated intraocular pressure)\nInfection\nGeneral anesthesia may be needed. The risks for any anesthesia are:\nReactions to medicines\nProblems breathing\nYou may not recover full vision.\nAfter the Procedure\nThe chances of successful reattachment of the retina depend on the number of holes, their size, and whether there is scar tissue in the area.\nIn most cases, the procedures do not require an overnight hospital stay. You may need to limit your physical activity for some time.\nIf the retina is repaired using the gas bubble procedure, you need to keep your head face down or turned to one side for several days or weeks."}

It is important to maintain this position so the gas bubble pushes the retina into place.\nPeople with a gas bubble in the eye may not fly or go to high altitudes until the gas bubble dissolves. This most often happens within a few weeks.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost of the time, the retina can be reattached with one operation. However, some people will need several surgeries. More than 9 out of 10 detachments can be repaired. Failure to repair the retina always results in loss of vision to some degree.\nWhen a detachment occurs, the photoreceptors (rods and cones) start to degenerate. The sooner the detachment is repaired, the sooner the retina will begin to recover."}

The sooner the detachment is repaired, the sooner the retina will begin to recover. However, once the retina has detached, its rods and cones that detect light (the photoreceptors) may never recover completely.\nAfter surgery, the quality of vision depends on where the detachment occurred, and the cause:\nIf the central area of vision (macula) was not involved, vision will usually be very good.\nIf the macula was involved for less than 1 week, vision will usually be improved, but not to 20/20 (normal).\nIf the macula was detached for a long time, some vision will return, but it will be very impaired. Often, it will be less than 20/200, the limit for legal blindness.\nAlternative Names\nScleral buckling; Vitrectomy; Pneumatic retinopexy; Laser retinopexy; Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment repair\nImages\nDetached retina\nRetinal detachment repair  - series\nReferences\nCioffi GA, Liebmann JM.
