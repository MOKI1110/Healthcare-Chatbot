Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture\nA cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) culture is a lab test to look for bacteria, fungi, and viruses in the fluid that moves in the space around the spinal cord. CSF protects the brain and spinal cord from injury.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA sample of CSF is needed. This is usually done with a lumbar puncture (also known as a\nspinal tap\n).\nThe sample is sent to the lab. There, it is placed in a dish that has a special substance called a culture medium. Lab staff then observe if bacteria, fungi, or viruses grow in the dish. Growth means there is an infection.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nFollow instructions on how to prepare for a spinal tap.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour health care provider may order this test if you have signs of an infection that affects the brain or nervous system. The test helps identify what is causing the infection."}

The test helps identify what is causing the infection. This will help your provider decide on the best treatment.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means no bacteria, viruses, or fungi grew in the lab dish. This is called a negative result. However, a normal result doesn't mean there is no infection. The spinal tap and CSF smear may need to be done again.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nBacteria or other germs found in the sample may be a sign of\nmeningitis\n. This is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. The infection can be caused by bacteria, fungi, or viruses.\nRisks\nA lab culture poses no risk to you. Your provider will tell you about the risks of a spinal tap.\nAlternative Names\nCulture - CSF; Spinal fluid culture; CSF culture\nImages\nPneumococci organism\nCSF smear\nReferences\nHasbun R, Tunkel AR.
