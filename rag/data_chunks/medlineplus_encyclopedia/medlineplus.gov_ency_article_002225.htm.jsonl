Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAppropriate for gestational age (AGA)\nAppropriate for gestational age (AGA)\nGestation is the period of time between conception and birth. During this time, the baby grows and develops inside the mother's womb.\nIf the baby's gestational age findings after birth match the calendar age, the baby is said to be appropriate for gestational age (AGA).\nAGA babies have lower rates of problems and death than babies that are small or large for their\ngestational age\n.\nInformation\nGestational age is the common term used during pregnancy to describe how far along the pregnancy is. It is measured in weeks, from the first day of the woman's last menstrual cycle to the current date. A normal pregnancy can range from 38 to 42 weeks.\nGestational age can be determined before or after birth.\nBefore birth, your health care provider will use ultrasound to measure the size of the baby's head, abdomen, and thigh bone. This provides a view on how well the baby is growing in the womb.\nAfter birth, gestational age can be measured by looking at the baby."}
