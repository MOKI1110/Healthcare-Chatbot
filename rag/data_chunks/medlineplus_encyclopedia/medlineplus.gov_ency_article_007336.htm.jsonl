It is used to treat people who have severe liver problems.\nDescription\nPortacaval shunting is major surgery. It involves a large cut (incision) in the belly area (abdomen). The surgeon then makes a connection between the portal vein (which supplies most of the liver's blood) and the inferior vena cava (the vein that drains blood from most of the lower part of the body.)\nThe new connection diverts blood flow away from the liver. This reduces blood pressure in the portal vein and decreases the risk for a tear (rupture) and bleeding from the veins in the esophagus and stomach.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nNormally, blood coming from your esophagus, stomach, and intestines first flows through the liver. When your liver is very damaged and the blood vessels are narrowed by the scarring, blood cannot flow through it easily."}

When your liver is very damaged and the blood vessels are narrowed by the scarring, blood cannot flow through it easily. This is called portal hypertension (increased pressure and backup of the portal vein.) The veins can then break open (rupture), causing serious bleeding. Most cases of portal hypertension happen in patients with cirrhosis (end-stage scarring in the liver).\nCommon causes of portal hypertension are:\nAlcohol use\ncausing scarring of the liver (\ncirrhosis\n)\nBlood clots\nin a vein that flows from the liver to the heart\nToo much iron in the liver (\nhemochromatosis\n)\nHepatitis B\nor\nhepatitis C\nMetabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH): a metabolic condition associated with conditions like diabetes, insulin resistance, high blood pressure, obesity, hyperlipidemia, where the liver becomes inflamed and scarred\nWhen portal hypertension occurs, you may have:\nBleeding from veins of the stomach, esophagus, or intestines (\nvariceal bleeding\n)\nBuildup of fluid in the belly (\nascites\n)\nBuildup of fluid in the chest (hydrothorax)\nHepatic encephalopathy\n(which causes symptoms such as confusion, slow refl"}
