Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBlood clots\nBlood clots\nBlood clots are clumps that occur when blood hardens from a liquid to a solid.\nA blood clot that forms inside one of your veins or arteries is called a thrombus. A thrombus may also form in your heart.\nA thrombus that breaks loose and travels from one location in the body to another is called an\nembolus\n.\nA thrombus or embolus can partly or completely block the flow of blood in a blood vessel.\nA blockage in an artery may prevent oxygen from reaching the tissues in that area. This is called ischemia."}

This is called ischemia. If ischemia is not treated promptly, it can lead to tissue damage or death.\nA blockage in the vein will often cause fluid buildup and swelling in the area where blood is drained by that vein.\nCauses\nSituations in which a blood clot is more likely to form in veins include:\nBeing on long-term bed rest\nSitting for long periods, such as in a plane or car\nDuring and after pregnancy\nTaking birth control pills or estrogen hormones (especially in women who smoke)\nLong-term use of an intravenous catheter\nAfter surgery\nBlood clots are also more likely to form after an injury. People with\ncancer\n,\nobesity\n, and\nliver\nor kidney disease are also prone to blood clots.\nSmoking also increases the risk of forming blood clots.\nConditions that are passed down through families (inherited) may make you more likely to form abnormal blood clots."}
