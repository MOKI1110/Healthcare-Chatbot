You will use a special kit to collect the urine.\nA urine sample can also be taken by inserting a thin rubber tube (catheter) through the urethra into the bladder. This is done by someone in your provider's office or at the hospital. The urine drains into a sterile container, and the catheter is removed.\nRarely, your provider may collect a urine sample by inserting a needle through the skin of your lower abdomen into your bladder.\nThe urine is taken to a lab to determine which, if any, bacteria or yeast are present in the urine."}

This takes 24 to 48 hours.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nIf possible, collect the sample when urine has been in your bladder for 2 to 3 hours.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the catheter is inserted, you may feel pressure. A special gel is used to numb the urethra.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order this test if you have symptoms of a\nurinary tract infection\nor bladder infection, such as pain or burning when urinating.\nYou also may have a urine culture after you have been treated for an infection. This is to make sure that all of the bacteria are gone.\nNormal Results\n\"Normal growth\" is a normal result. This means that there is no infection.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA \"positive\" or abnormal test is when bacteria or yeast are found in the culture."}

This likely means that you have a urinary tract infection or bladder infection.\nOther tests may help your provider know which bacteria or yeast are causing the infection and which antibiotics will best treat it, if treatment is needed.\nSometimes more than one type of bacteria, or only a small amount, may be found in the culture.\nRisks\nThere is a very rare risk for a hole (\nperforation\n) in the urethra or bladder if your provider uses a catheter.\nConsiderations\nYou may have a false-negative urine culture if you have been taking antibiotics.\nAlternative Names\nCulture and sensitivity - urine\nImages\nUrine sample\nFemale urinary tract\nMale urinary tract\nReferences\nCooper KL, Badalato GM, Rutman MP.
