Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nParoxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)\nParoxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)\nParoxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria is a rare disease in which red blood cells break down earlier than normal.\nCauses\nPeople with this disease have blood cells that are missing a gene called PIG-A. This gene allows a substance called glycosyl-phosphatidylinositol (GPI) to help certain proteins stick to cells.\nWithout PIG-A, important proteins cannot connect to the cell surface and protect the cell from substances in the blood called complement. As a result, red blood cells break down too early. The red cells leak hemoglobin into the blood, which can pass into the urine. This can happen at any time, but is more likely to occur during the night or early morning.\nThe disease can affect people of any age."}

Blood transfusions may be needed. Supplemental iron and folic acid are provided. Blood thinners may also be needed to prevent clots from forming.\nSoliris (eculizumab) and Ultomiris (ravulizumab) are medicines used to treat PNH. They block the breakdown of red blood cells.\nBone marrow transplantation can cure this disease. It may also stop the risk for developing PNH in people with aplastic anemia.\nAll people with PNH should receive vaccinations against certain types of bacteria to prevent infection. Ask your health care provider which ones are right for you.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome varies. Most people survive for more than 10 years after their diagnosis."}
