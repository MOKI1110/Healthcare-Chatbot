Open a urine collection bag (a plastic bag with an adhesive paper on one end).\nFor males, place the entire penis in the bag and attach the adhesive to the skin.\nFor females, place the bag over the two folds of skin on either side of the vagina (labia). Put a diaper on the baby (over the bag).\nCheck the infant often, and change the bag after the infant has urinated. Empty the urine from the bag into the container provided by your health care provider.\nAn active infant can cause the bag to move. It may take more than  one try to collect the sample.\nWhen finished, label the container and return it as instructed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nCertain drugs can also affect the test results. Your provider may tell you to stop taking certain medicines before the test."}
