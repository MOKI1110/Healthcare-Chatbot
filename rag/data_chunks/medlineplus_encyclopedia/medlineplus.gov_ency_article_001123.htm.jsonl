Aortic arch syndrome refers to a group of signs and symptoms associated with structural problems in the arteries that branch off the aortic arch.\nWatch this video about:\nHeartbeat\nCauses\nAortic arch syndrome problems can be due to trauma, blood clots, or malformations that develop before birth. These defects result in abnormal blood flow to the head, neck, or arms.\nIn children, there are many types of aortic arch syndromes, including:\nCongenital absence of a branch of the aorta\nIsolation of the subclavian arteries\nVascular rings\nAn inflammatory disease called Takayasu syndrome may result in narrowing (stenosis) of the vessels of the aortic arch.
