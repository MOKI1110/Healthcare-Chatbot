Intersex is an older term for DSD.\nCauses\nThere are many causes of DSD. They can be divided into several categories, discussed in more detail below:\n46,XX DSD\n46,XY DSD\nOvotesticular DSD\nComplex or undetermined DSD\nNote: The cause of DSD may remain undetermined, even with modern diagnostic techniques.\n46,XX DSD\nThe person has the XX chromosomes (typically seen in females), the ovaries of a female, but external genitals that appear male. This most often is the result of a female fetus having been exposed to excess male hormones before birth. The labia (\"lips\" or folds of skin of the external female genitals) fuse (grow together), and the clitoris enlarges to appear like a penis. In most cases, this person has a normal uterus and fallopian tubes."}

In most cases, this person has a normal uterus and fallopian tubes. This condition is also called 46,XX with virilization. There are several possible causes:\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia.\nThis is the most common cause of 46,XX DSD.\nMale hormones\n(such as testosterone) taken or encountered by the mother during pregnancy.\nMale hormone-producing tumors in the mother.\nThese are most often ovarian tumors. Mothers who have children with 46,XX DSD should be checked for this unless there is another clear cause.\nAromatase deficiency.\nThis may not be noticeable until puberty. Aromatase is an enzyme that normally converts male hormones to female hormones. Too much aromatase activity can lead to excess estrogen (female hormone); too little can lead to 46,XX DSD. At puberty, these XX children, who had been raised as girls, may begin to take on male characteristics.\n46,XY DSD\nThe person has the XY chromosomes (typically seen in males), but the external genitals are incompletely formed, ambiguous (\nambiguous genitalia\n), or clearly female."}

Internally, testes may be normal, malformed, or absent. This condition is also called 46,XY with undervirilization. Formation of normal male external genitals depends on the appropriate balance between male and female hormones. Therefore, it requires the adequate production and function of male hormones. 46,XY DSD has many possible causes:\nProblems with the testes.\nThe testes normally produce male hormones. If the testes do not form properly, it will lead to undervirilization. There are a number of possible causes for this, including XY pure\ngonadal dysgenesis\n.\nProblems with testosterone formation.\nTestosterone is made through a series of chemical steps. Each of these steps requires a different enzyme. Deficiencies in any of these enzymes can result in inadequate testosterone and produce a different syndrome of 46,XY DSD."}

Each of these steps requires a different enzyme. Deficiencies in any of these enzymes can result in inadequate testosterone and produce a different syndrome of 46,XY DSD. Different types of congenital adrenal hyperplasia can also fall in this category.\nProblems with using testosterone.\nSome people have normal testes and make adequate amounts of testosterone, but still have 46, XY DSD due to conditions such as 5-alpha-reductase deficiency or androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS).\nPeople with 5-alpha-reductase deficiency lack the enzyme needed to convert testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). There are at least 5 different types of 5-alpha-reductase deficiency. Some of the babies have normal male genitalia, some have normal female genitalia, and many have something in between. Most change to external male genitalia around the time of puberty.\nAIS is the most common cause of 46,XY DSD. In this situation, the hormones are all normal, but the receptors to male hormones don't function properly."}

In this situation, the hormones are all normal, but the receptors to male hormones don't function properly. Over 150 different defects have been identified so far, and each causes a different type of AIS.\nOVOTESTICULAR DSD\nThe person has both ovarian and testicular tissue. This may be in the same gonad (an ovotestis), or the person might have 1 ovary and 1 testis. The person may have XX chromosomes, XY chromosomes, or both. The external genitals may be ambiguous or may appear to be female or male. In most people with ovotesticular DSD, the underlying cause is unknown.\nCOMPLEX OR UNDETERMINED DSD\nMany chromosome configurations other than simple 46,XX or 46,XY can result in disorders of sex development. These include 45,XO (only one X chromosome), and 47,XXY or 47,XXX - both cases have an extra sex chromosome, either an X or a Y. These disorders do not result in a condition in which there is a discrepancy between internal and external genitalia."}

They may include:\nAmbiguous genitalia at birth\nA very small penis (micropenis)\nEnlarged clitoris (clitoromegaly)\nPartly fused labia\nUndescended testes (which may turn out to be ovaries) in boys\nLabial or groin (inguinal) masses (which may turn out to be testes) in girls\nThe opening of the penis is somewhere other than at the tip (\nhypospadias\n); in females, the urethra (urine canal) opens into the vagina\nOtherwise unusual-appearing genitalia at birth\nElectrolyte abnormalities\nDelayed or absent puberty\nUnexpected changes at puberty\nExams and Tests\nThe following tests and exams may be done:\nChromosome analysis\n(karyotyping) to determine the person's genetic makeup\nBlood tests to check levels of\ntestosterone\n,\nluteinizing hormone (LH)\n, and\nfollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)"}

This team may include neonatologists, geneticists, endocrinologists, and psychiatrists or social workers. The specific treatment will depend on the specific cause of the DSD. Depending on the cause, surgery, hormone replacement, or other treatments are used to treat DSD.\nThere have been significant changes in treating DSD in recent years. In the past, the external genitals were prioritized over chromosomes."}
