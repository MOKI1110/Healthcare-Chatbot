They are given through shots in or around the spine.\nDescription\nA doctor who gives you epidural or spinal anesthesia is called an anesthesiologist. In some situations, this may be administered by a certified registered nurse anesthetist..\nFirst, the area of your back where the needle is inserted is cleaned with a special solution. The area may also be numbed with a local anesthetic.\nYou'll likely receive fluids through an intravenous line (IV) in a vein. You may receive medicine through the IV to help you relax.\nFor an epidural:\nThe health care provider injects medicine just outside of the sac of fluid around your spinal cord. This is called the epidural space.\nThe medicine numbs, or blocks, feeling in a certain part of your body so that you either feel less pain or no pain at all depending on the procedure. The medicine begins to take effect in about 10 to 20 minutes."}

The medicine begins to take effect in about 10 to 20 minutes. It works well for longer procedures. Women often have an\nepidural during childbirth\n.\nA small tube (catheter) is often left in place. You can receive more medicine through the catheter to help control your pain during or after your procedure.\nFor a spinal:\nThe provider injects medicine into the fluid around your spinal cord. This is usually done only once, so you will not need to have a catheter placed.\nThe medicine begins to take effect right away.\nYour pulse, blood pressure, and oxygen level in your blood are checked during the procedure. After the procedure, you will have a bandage where the needle was inserted.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nSpinal and epidural anesthesia work well for certain procedures and do not require placing a breathing tube into the windpipe (trachea). People usually recover their senses much faster."}

Sometimes, they have to wait for the anesthetic to wear off so they can walk or urinate.\nSpinal anesthesia is often used for genital, urinary tract, or lower body procedures.\nEpidural anesthesia is often used during labor and delivery, and surgery in the pelvis and legs.\nEpidural and spinal anesthesia are often used when:\nThe procedure or labor is too painful without any pain medicine.\nThe procedure is in the belly, legs, or feet.\nYour body can remain in a comfortable position during your procedure.\nYou want fewer systemic medicines and less \"hangover\" than you would have from general anesthesia.\nRisks\nSpinal and epidural anesthesia are generally safe."}
