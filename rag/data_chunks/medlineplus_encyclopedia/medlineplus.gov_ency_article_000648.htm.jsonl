Peritonitis is present when this tissue becomes inflamed or infected.\nSpontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is present when this tissue becomes infected and there is no clear cause.\nCauses\nSBP is most often caused by infection in fluid that collects in the peritoneal cavity (\nascites\n). The fluid buildup often occurs in people with advanced liver or kidney disease.\nRisk factors for liver disease include:\nVery heavy alcohol use\nChronic\nhepatitis B\nor\nhepatitis C\nOther diseases that lead to cirrhosis\nSBP also occurs in people who are on peritoneal dialysis for kidney failure.\nPeritonitis may have other causes\nin which case it is called secondary peritonitis."}
