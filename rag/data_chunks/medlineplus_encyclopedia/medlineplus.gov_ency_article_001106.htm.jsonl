The condition is present at birth (congenital).\nCauses\nHypoplastic left heart is a rare type of congenital heart disease. It is more common in males than in females.\nAs with most congenital heart defects, there is no known cause. About 10% of babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome also have other birth defects. It is also associated with some genetic diseases such as Turner syndrome, Jacobsen syndrome, trisomy 13 and 18.\nThe problem develops before birth when the left ventricle and other structures do not grow properly, including the:\nAorta (the blood vessel that carries oxygen-rich blood from the left ventricle to the entire body)\nEntrance and exit of the ventricle\nMitral and aortic valves\nThis causes the left ventricle and aorta to be poorly developed, or hypoplastic."}

In most cases, the left ventricle and aorta are much smaller than normal.\nIn babies with this condition, the left side of the heart is unable to send enough blood to the body. As a result, the right side of the heart must maintain the circulation for both the lungs and the body. The right ventricle can support the circulation to both the lungs and the body for a while, but this extra workload eventually causes the right side of the heart to fail.\nThe only possibility of survival is a connection between the right and the left side of the heart, or between the arteries and pulmonary arteries (the blood vessels that carry blood to the lungs)."}

Babies are normally born with two of these connections:\nForamen\novale (a hole between the right and left atrium)\nDuctus arteriosus\n(a small blood vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery)\nBoth connections normally close on their own a few days after birth.\nIn babies with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, blood leaving the right side of the heart through the pulmonary artery travels through the ductus arteriosus to the aorta. This is the only way for blood to get to the body. If the ductus arteriosus is allowed to close in a baby with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the baby may quickly die because no blood will be pumped to the body."}

If the ductus arteriosus is allowed to close in a baby with hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the baby may quickly die because no blood will be pumped to the body. Babies with known hypoplastic left heart syndrome are usually started on a medicine to keep the ductus arteriosus open.\nBecause there is little or no flow out of the left heart, blood returning to the heart from the lungs needs to pass through the foramen ovale or an atrial septal defect (a hole connecting the collecting chambers on the left and right sides of the heart) back to the right side of the heart. If there is no foramen ovale, or if it is too small, the baby could die. Babies with this problem have the hole between their atria opened, either with surgery or using a thin, flexible tube (heart catheterization).\nSymptoms\nAt first, a newborn with hypoplastic left heart may appear normal. Symptoms may occur in the first few hours of life, although it may take up to a few days to develop symptoms."}

It is a sign that there is not enough oxygen in the blood. Central cyanosis often increases with crying.\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam may show signs of heart failure:\nFaster than normal heart rate\nLethargy\nLiver enlargement\nRapid breathing\nAlso, the pulse at various locations (wrist, groin, and others) may be very weak."}

A breathing machine (ventilator) may be needed to help the baby breathe. A medicine called prostaglandin E1 is used to keep blood circulating to the body by keeping the ductus arteriosus open.\nThese measures do not solve the problem.

This procedure creates a right ventricle to pulmonary artery connection.\nAfterward, the baby goes home in most cases. The child will need to take daily medicines and be closely followed by a pediatric cardiologist, who will determine when the second stage of surgery should be done.\nStage II of the operation is called the Glenn shunt or hemi-Fontan procedure.

The surgery is most often done when the child is 4 to 6 months of age.\nDuring stages I and II, the child may still appear somewhat blue (cyanotic).\nStage III, the final step, is called the Fontan procedure. The rest of the veins that carry blue blood from the body (the inferior vena cava) are connected directly to the blood vessels to the lungs.

But there are few donated hearts available for small infants.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf left untreated, hypoplastic left heart syndrome is fatal.
