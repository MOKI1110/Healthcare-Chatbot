Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAnencephaly\nAnencephaly\nAnencephaly is the absence of a large part of the brain and the skull.\nCauses\nAnencephaly is one of the most common neural tube defects. Neural tube defects are birth defects that affect the tissue that becomes the spinal cord and brain.\nAnencephaly occurs early in the development of an unborn baby. It results when the upper part of the neural tube fails to close. The exact cause is not known. Possible causes include:\nEnvironmental\ntoxins\nLow intake of\nfolic acid\nby the mother during pregnancy\nThe exact number of cases of anencephaly is unknown. Many of these pregnancies result in miscarriage. Having one infant with this condition increases the risk of having another child with neural tube defects.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of anencephaly are:\nAbsence of the skull\nAbsence of parts of the brain\nFacial feature abnormalities\nSevere developmental delay\nHeart defects may be present in 1 out of 5 cases.\nExams and Tests\nAn\nultrasound\nduring pregnancy is done to confirm the diagnosis. The ultrasound may reveal too much fluid in the uterus."}

This condition is called\npolyhydramnios\n.\nThe mother may also have these tests during pregnancy:\nAmniocentesis\n(to look for increased levels of\nalpha-fetoprotein\n)\nAlpha-fetoprotein level (increased levels suggest a neural tube defect)\nUrine estriol level\nA pre-pregnancy serum folic acid test may also be done.\nTreatment\nThere is no current treatment. Talk to your health care provider about care decisions.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThis condition most often causes death within a few days after birth.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nA provider usually detects this condition during routine prenatal testing and ultrasound. Otherwise, it is recognized at birth.\nIf anencephaly is detected before birth, further counseling will be needed.\nPrevention\nThere is good evidence that folic acid can help reduce the risk for certain birth defects, including anencephaly. Women who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant should take a multivitamin with folic acid every day."}
