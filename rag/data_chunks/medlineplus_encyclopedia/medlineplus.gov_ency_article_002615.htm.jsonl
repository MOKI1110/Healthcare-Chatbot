These movements may continue if they are not treated quickly and correctly.\nIn rare cases, an overdose can cause more serious symptoms. Nervous system symptoms may be permanent. The most serious side effects are usually due to damage to the heart. If heart damage can be stabilized, recovery is likely. Life-threatening heart rhythm disturbances may be difficult to treat, and may result in death. Survival past 2 days is usually a good sign.\nReferences\nAronson JK. Prochlorperazine.
