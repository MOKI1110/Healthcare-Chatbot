Tiny dry cell batteries are sometimes called button batteries.\nThis article discusses the harmful effects from swallowing a dry cell battery (including button batteries) or breathing in large amounts of dust or smoke from burning batteries.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\nPoisonous Ingredient\nAcidic dry cell batteries contain:\nManganese dioxide\nAmmonium chloride\nAlkaline dry cell batteries contain:\nSodium hydroxide\nPotassium hydroxide\nLithium dioxide dry cell batteries contain:\nManganese dioxide\nWhere Found\nDry cell batteries are used to power a variety of different items."}

Small dry cell batteries may be used to power watches and calculators, while larger ones (for example, size \"D\" batteries) can be used in items such as flashlights.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms depend on the type and size of the battery, and whether or not the battery has leaked chemicals.\nSymptoms of acidic dry cell battery poisoning include:\nDecreased mental ability\nIrritation or burns in the mouth\nMuscle cramps\nSlurred speech\nSwelling of the lower legs\n, ankles, or feet\nSpastic walk\nTremor\nWeakness\nSymptoms that can result from breathing in large amounts of the acidic battery fumes, or contents, dust, and smoke from burning batteries include:\nBronchial irritation and cough\nDecreased mental ability\nDifficulty sleeping\nHeadache\nMuscle cramps\nNumbness\nof the fingers or toes\nItching skin\nPneumonia\n(from irritation and blockage of the airways)\nSlurred speech\nSpastic walk\nWeakness in the legs\nSymptoms of alkaline battery poisoning may include:\nAbdominal pain\nBreathing difficulty from throat swelling"}

DO NOT make a person throw up unless told to do so by poison control or a health care provider. Immediately give the person water or milk, unless instructed otherwise by poison control or a provider.\nIf the person breathed in fumes from the battery, immediately move them to fresh air.\nIf the battery broke and contents touched the eyes or skin, wash the area with water for 15 minutes.\nBefore Calling Emergency\nGet the following information:\nPerson's age, weight, and condition\nType of battery\nTime it was swallowed\nAmount swallowed\nPoison Control\nYour local\npoison control center\ncan be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.

The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery. Full recovery is often possible if treated quickly.\nSerious problems are most often seen following industrial accidents. Most household exposures (such as licking some liquid from a leaking battery or swallowing a button battery) are minor. If a large battery does not pass through the intestinal tract within a limited period of time and is causing bowel blockage or threatens to leak, a surgical procedure with general anesthesia may be needed.\nAlternative Names\nBatteries - dry cell\nReferences\nBregstein JS, Prabhu E, Sonnett M.
