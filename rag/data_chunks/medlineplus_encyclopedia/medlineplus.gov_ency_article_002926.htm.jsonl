The surgery is done under\ngeneral anesthesia\n. This means the infant is asleep and feels no pain during the procedure.\nFor mild imperforate anus defects:\nThe first step involves enlarging the opening where the stool drains, so stool can pass more easily.\nSurgery involves closing any small\ntube-like openings\n(fistulas), creating an anal opening, and putting the rectal pouch into the anal opening. This is called an anoplasty.\nThe child must often take stool softeners for weeks to months.\nTwo surgeries are often needed for more severe imperforate anus defects:\nThe first surgery is called a\ncolostomy\n. The surgeon creates an opening (stoma) in the skin and muscle of the abdominal wall. The end of the large intestine is attached to the opening."}

Stool will drain into a bag attached to the abdomen.\nThe baby is often allowed to grow for 3 to 6 months.\nIn the second surgery, the surgeon moves the colon to a new position. A cut is made in the anal area to pull the rectal pouch down into place and create an anal opening.\nThe colostomy will likely be left in place for 2 to 3 more months.\nYour child's surgeon can tell you more about the exact way the surgeries will be done.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThe surgery repairs the defect so that stool can move through the rectum.\nRisks\nRisks from anesthesia and surgery in general include:\nReactions to medicines\nBreathing problems\nBleeding, blood clots, infection\nRisks of this procedure include:\nDamage to the urethra (tube that carries urine out of the bladder)\nDamage to the ureter (tube that carries urine from the kidneys to the bladder)\nHole that develops through the wall of the intestine (perforation)\nAbnormal connection (fistula) between the anus and vagina or skin\nNarrowed opening o"}

Or, your baby may need to spend several days in the hospital.\nYour health care provider will use an instrument to stretch (dilate) the new anus. This is done to improve muscle tone and prevent narrowing. This stretching must be done for several months.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost defects can be corrected with surgery. Children with mild defects usually do very well. But, constipation may be a problem.\nChildren who have more complex surgeries still usually have control of their bowel movements. But, they often need to follow a bowel program."}

This includes eating high-fiber foods, taking stool softeners, and sometimes using enemas.\nSome children may need more surgery. Most of these children will need to be followed-up closely for life.\nChildren with imperforate anus may also have other birth defects, including problems with the heart, kidneys, arms, legs, or spine.\nAlternative Names\nAnorectal malformation repair; Perineal anoplasty; Anorectal anomaly; Anorectal plasty\nImages\nImperforate anus repair  - series\nReferences\nBischoff A, De La Torre L, PeÃ±a A.
