Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTesticular torsion repair\nTesticular torsion repair\nTesticular torsion repair is surgery to untangle or untwist a spermatic cord. The spermatic cord has a collection of blood vessels in the scrotum that lead to the testicles.\nTesticular torsion\ndevelops when the cord twists. This pulling and twisting blocks blood flow to the testicle.\nDescription\nMost of the time, you will get\ngeneral anesthesia\nfor testicular torsion repair surgery. You will be asleep and pain-free.\nTo perform the procedure:\nThe surgeon will make a cut in your\nscrotum\nto get to the twisted cord.\nThe cord will be untwisted. The surgeon will then attach the testicle to the inside of your scrotum using stitches.\nThe other testicle will be attached in the same way to prevent future problems.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nTesticular torsion is an emergency. In most cases, surgery is needed right away to relieve pain and swelling and to prevent the loss of the testicle. For the best results, surgery should be done within 4 hours after symptoms begin."}

By 12 hours, a testicle may become damaged so badly that it has to be removed.\nRisks\nRisks of this surgery are:\nBleeding\nInfection\nPain\nWasting away of the testicle despite the return of blood flow\nInfertility\nBefore the Procedure\nMost of the time, this surgery is done as an emergency, so there is often too little time to have medical tests beforehand. You may have an imaging test (most often ultrasound) to check for blood flow and tissue death.\nMost of the time, you will be given pain medicine and sent to a urologist for surgery as soon as possible.\nAfter the Procedure\nFollowing your surgery:\nPain medicine, rest, and ice packs will relieve pain and swelling after surgery.\nDo not put the ice directly on your skin. Wrap it in a towel or cloth.\nRest at home for several days. You may wear a scrotal support for a week after surgery.\nAvoid strenuous activity for 1 to 2 weeks."}

Slowly start doing your normal activities.\nYou may resume sexual activity after about 4 to 6 weeks.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf surgery is done in time, you should have a complete recovery. When it is done within 4 hours after symptoms begin, the testicle can be saved most of the time.\nIf one testicle has to be removed, the remaining healthy testicle should provide enough hormones for normal male growth, sex life, and fertility.\nPatient Instructions\nSurgical wound care - open\nImages\nMale reproductive anatomy\nTesticular torsion repair - series\nReferences\nBoswell B, Thomas AA.
