It often contributes to the heart's inability to pump or function well.\nMany people with cardiomyopathy have\nheart failure\n.\nCauses\nThere are many types of cardiomyopathy, with different causes. Some of the more common causes are:\nDilated cardiomyopathy (also called idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy if there is no known cause) is a condition in which the heart becomes weak and the heart's chambers get large. As a result, the heart cannot pump enough blood out to the body. It can be caused by many medical problems.\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes thick. This makes it harder for blood to leave the heart. This type of cardiomyopathy is most often passed down through families.\nIschemic cardiomyopathy is caused by a narrowing of the arteries that supply the heart with blood."}

This type of cardiomyopathy is most often passed down through families.\nIschemic cardiomyopathy is caused by a narrowing of the arteries that supply the heart with blood. It makes the heart walls thin so they do not pump well.\nRestrictive cardiomyopathy is due to a group of disorders. The heart chambers are unable to fill with blood because the heart muscle is stiff. The most common causes of this type of cardiomyopathy are amyloidosis and scarring of the heart from an unknown cause.\nPeripartum cardiomyopathy occurs during pregnancy or in the first 5 months afterward.\nTreatment\nWhen possible, the cause of cardiomyopathy is treated."}

It may get worse over time. Some people develop severe heart failure. In this case, medicines, surgery, and other treatments may no longer help.\nPeople with certain types of cardiomyopathy are at risk for dangerous heart rhythm problems.\nPatient Instructions\nHeart failure - what to ask your doctor\nImages\nHeart - section through the middle\nHeart - front view\nDilated cardiomyopathy\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nPeripartum cardiomyopathy\nReferences\nElliott PM, Olivotto I.
