Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHeart attack\nHeart attack\nMost heart attacks are caused by a blood clot that blocks one of the coronary arteries. The coronary arteries bring blood and oxygen to the heart. If the blood flow is blocked, the heart is starved of oxygen and heart cells die.\nThe medical term for this is myocardial infarction.\nCauses\nA substance called plaque can build up in the walls of your coronary arteries. This plaque is made up of cholesterol and other cells.\nA heart attack may occur when:\nA disruption in the plaque occurs. This triggers blood platelets and other substances to form a blood clot at the site that blocks most or all of the oxygen-carrying blood from flowing to a part of the heart muscle."}

This triggers blood platelets and other substances to form a blood clot at the site that blocks most or all of the oxygen-carrying blood from flowing to a part of the heart muscle. This is the most common cause of heart attack.\nThe cause of a heart attack is not always known, but there are well known risk factors.\nA heart attack may occur:\nWhen you are resting or asleep\nAfter a sudden increase in physical activity\nWhen you are active outside in cold weather\nAfter sudden, severe emotional or physical stress, including an illness\nMany\nrisk factors may lead to the development of plaque buildup and a heart attack\n.\nSymptoms\nA heart attack is a medical emergency. If you have symptoms of a heart attack, call 911 or your local emergency number right away.\nDO NOT try to drive yourself to the hospital.\nDO NOT WAIT. You are at greatest risk for sudden death in the early hours of a heart attack.\nChest pain\nis the most common symptom of a heart attack.\nYou may feel the pain in only one part of your body OR\nPain may move from your chest to your arms, shoulder, neck, teeth, jaw, belly area, or back\nThe pain can be severe or mild."}

Rest and a medicine to relax the blood vessels (called nitroglycerin) may not completely relieve the pain of a heart attack. Symptoms may also go away and come back.\nOther symptoms of a heart attack can include:\nAnxiety\nCough\nFainting\nLightheadedness, dizziness\nNausea and vomiting\nPalpitations (feeling like your heart is beating too fast or irregularly)\nShortness of breath\nSweating\n, which may be very heavy\nSome people (including older adults, people with diabetes, and women) may have little or no chest pain.

Medicines and fluids pass through this IV.\nYou may get nitroglycerin and morphine to help reduce chest pain.\nYou may receive aspirin, unless it would not be safe for you."}

It should be done within 90 minutes after you get to the hospital, and usually no later than 12 hours after a heart attack.\nA stent is a small, metal mesh tube that opens up (expands) inside a coronary artery. A stent is usually placed right after or during angioplasty. It helps prevent the artery from closing up again.\nYou may be given medicines to break up the clot. This is called\nthrombolytic therapy\n."}

This procedure is also called coronary artery bypass grafting or\nopen heart surgery\n.\nTREATMENT AFTER A HEART ATTACK\nAfter several days, you will be\ndischarged from the hospital\n.\nYou will likely need to take medicines, some for the rest of your life.
