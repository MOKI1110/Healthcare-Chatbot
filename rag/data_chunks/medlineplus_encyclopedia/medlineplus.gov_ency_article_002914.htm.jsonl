Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nD and C\nD and C\nD and C (dilation and curettage) is a procedure to scrape and collect the tissue (endometrium) from inside the uterus.\nDilation (D) is a widening of the cervix to allow instruments into the uterus.\nCurettage (C) is the scraping of tissue from the walls of the uterus.\nDescription\nD and C, also called uterine scraping, may be performed in the hospital or in a clinic while you are under\ngeneral\nor local anesthesia.\nThe health care provider will insert an instrument called a speculum into the vagina. This holds the vaginal canal open. Numbing medicine may be applied to the opening to the uterus (\ncervix\n).\nThe cervical canal is widened, and a curette (a metal loop on the end of a long, thin handle) is passed through the opening into the uterus cavity. The provider gently scrapes the inner layer of tissue, called the endometrium. Alternatively, a suction curette may be used to remove endometrial tissue."}
