These substances destroy red blood cells and cause kidney injury.\nCauses\nHemolytic-uremic syndrome (HUS) often occurs after a gastrointestinal infection with\nE coli\nbacteria (\nEscherichia coli\nO157:H7). However, the condition has also been linked to other gastrointestinal infections, including\nshigella\nand\nsalmonella\n. It has also been linked to non-gastrointestinal infections.\nHUS is most common in children. It is the most common cause of acute kidney failure in children. Several large outbreaks have been linked to undercooked hamburger meat contaminated with\nE coli\n.\nE coli\ncan be transmitted through:\nContact from one person to another\nConsuming uncooked food, such as milk products or beef\nSTEC-HUS is not to be confused with atypical HUS (aHUS) which is not infection-related."}

It is similar to another disease called\nthrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura\n(TTP).\nSymptoms\nSTEC-HUS often begins with vomiting and diarrhea, which may be bloody. Within a week, the person may become weak and irritable. People with this condition may urinate less than normal. Urine output may almost stop.\nRed blood cell destruction leads to symptoms of\nanemia\n.\nEarly symptoms:\nBlood in the stools\nIrritability\nFever\nLethargy\nVomiting\nand\ndiarrhea\nWeakness\nLater symptoms:\nBruising\nDecreased consciousness\nLow urine output\nNo urine output\nPallor\nSeizures\n-- rare\nSkin rash that looks like fine red spots (\npetechiae\n)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam.

You should also avoid contact with unclean water and follow proper hand washing methods.\nAlternative Names\nHUS; STEC-HUS; Hemolytic-uremic syndrome\nImages\nMale urinary system\nReferences\nAlexander T, Licht C, Smoyer WE, Rosenblum ND.
