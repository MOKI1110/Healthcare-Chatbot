Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nGestational age\nGestational age\nGestation is the period of time between conception and birth. During this time, the baby grows and develops inside the mother's womb.\nGestational age is the common term used during pregnancy to describe how far along the pregnancy is. It is measured in weeks, from the first day of the woman's last menstrual cycle to the current date. A normal pregnancy can range from 38 to 42 weeks.\nInfants born before 37 weeks are considered premature. Infants born after 42 weeks are considered postmature.\nInformation\nGestational age can be determined before or after birth.\nBefore birth, your health care provider will use ultrasound to measure the size of the baby's head, abdomen, and thigh bone."}

This provides a view on how well the baby is growing in the womb.\nAfter birth, gestational age can be measured by looking at the baby's weight, length,\nhead circumference\n, vital signs, reflexes, muscle tone, posture, and the condition of the skin and hair.\nIf the baby's gestational age findings after birth match the calendar age, the baby is said to be appropriate for gestational age (AGA). AGA babies have lower rates of problems and death than babies that are small or large for their gestational age.\nThe weight for full-term infants that are born AGA will most often be between 2,500 grams (about 5.5 pounds [lbs] or 2.5 kilograms [kg]) and 4,000 grams (about 8.8 lbs or 4 kg).\nInfants weighing less are considered\nsmall for gestational age (SGA)\n.\nInfants weighing more are considered\nlarge for gestational age (LGA)\n.\nAlternative Names\nFetal age - gestational age; Gestation; Neonatal gestational age; Newborn gestational age\nReferences\nBall JW, Dains JE, Flynn JA, Solomon BS, Stewart RW."}
