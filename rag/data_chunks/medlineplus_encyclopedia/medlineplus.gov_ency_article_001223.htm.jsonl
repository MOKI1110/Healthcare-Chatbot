Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCollagen vascular disease\nCollagen vascular disease\nIn a class of diseases known as\nautoimmune disorders\n, the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. Some of these diseases are similar to each other. They may involve arthritis and inflammation of arteries in the tissues. People who developed these disorders were previously said to have \"connective tissue\" or \"collagen vascular\" disease. We now have names for many specific conditions such as:\nAnkylosing spondylitis\nDermatomyositis\nPolyarteritis nodosa\nPolymyositis\nPsoriatic arthritis\nRheumatoid arthritis\nScleroderma\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\nMixed connective tissue disease\nRelapsing polychondritis\nVasculitis\nWhen a specific disease cannot be diagnosed, more general terms may be used. These are called undifferentiated systemic rheumatic (connective tissue) diseases or overlap syndromes.\nImages\nDermatomyositis - heliotrope eyelids\nPolyarteritis - microscopic on the shin\nSystemic lupus erythematosus rash on the face\nSclerodactyly\nRheumatoid arthritis\nReferences\nGraf J.
