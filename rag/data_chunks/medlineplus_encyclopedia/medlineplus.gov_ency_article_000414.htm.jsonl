This results in deformity of the affected bones.\nCauses\nThe cause of Paget disease is unknown. It may be due to genetic factors, but also could be due to a viral infection early in life or hypersensitivity to vitamin D.\nThe disease occurs worldwide, but is more common in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand. The disease has become much less common over the last 50 years.\nIn people with Paget disease, there is an abnormal breakdown of bone tissue in specific areas. This is followed by abnormal bone formation. The new area of bone is larger, but weaker. The new bone is also filled with new blood vessels.\nThe affected bone may only be in one or two areas of the skeleton, or in many different bones in the body. It more often involves bones of the arms, collarbones, legs, pelvis, spine, and skull.\nSymptoms\nMost people with the condition have no symptoms."}

It more often involves bones of the arms, collarbones, legs, pelvis, spine, and skull.\nSymptoms\nMost people with the condition have no symptoms. Paget disease is often diagnosed when an x-ray is done for another reason. It may also be discovered when trying to find the cause of high blood calcium levels.\nIf they do occur, symptoms may include:\nBone pain\n, joint pain or stiffness, and neck pain (the pain may be severe and be present most of the time)\nBowing of the legs and other visible deformities\nEnlarged head and skull deformities\nFracture\nHeadache\nHearing loss\nReduced height\nWarm skin over the affected bone\nExams and Tests\nTests that may indicate Paget disease include:\nBone scan\nBone x-ray\nElevated markers of bone breakdown (for example, N-telopeptide or procollagen type I N-terminal propeptide (PINP))\nThis disease may also affect the results of the following tests:\nAlkaline phosphatase (ALP)\n, bone specific isoenzyme\nSerum calcium\nTreatment\nNot all people with Paget disease need to be treated."}

People who may not need treatment include those who:\nOnly have mildly abnormal blood tests or x-ray or bone scan findings\nHave no symptoms and no evidence of active disease\nPaget disease is commonly treated when:\nCertain bones, such as weight-bearing bones, are involved and the risk of fracture is higher.\nBony changes are getting worse quickly (treatment can reduce the risk of fractures).\nBony deformities are present.\nA person has pain or other symptoms.\nThe skull is affected. (This is to prevent hearing loss.)\nThe serum calcium levels are elevated and causing symptoms.\nDrug therapy helps prevent further bone breakdown and formation. Currently, there are several classes of drugs used to treat Paget disease. These include:\nBisphosphonates: These drugs are the first treatment, and they help decrease bone remodeling. Medicines are commonly taken by mouth, or given through a vein (intravenously).\nCalcitonin: This hormone is involved in bone metabolism."}

It may be given as a nasal spray (Miacalcin), or as an injection under the skin (Calcimar or Mithracin).\nDenosumab: This monoclonal antibody (commonly used for treatment of osteoporosis) may be used.\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also be given for pain. In severe cases, orthopedic surgery may be needed to correct a deformity or fracture.\nSupport Groups\nPeople with this condition may benefit from taking part in support groups for people with similar experiences.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost of the time, the condition can be controlled with medicines. A small number of people may develop a cancer of the bone called osteosarcoma."}
