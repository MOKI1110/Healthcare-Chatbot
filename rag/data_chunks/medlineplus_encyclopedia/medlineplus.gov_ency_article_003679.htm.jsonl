Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFactor IX assay\nFactor IX assay\nThe factor IX assay is a blood test that measures the activity of factor IX. This is one of the proteins in the body that helps the blood clot.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may need to stop taking some medicines before this test. Your health care provider will tell you which ones.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is used to find the cause of too much bleeding (decreased blood clotting). Or, it may be ordered if a family member is known to have\nhemophilia B\n. The test may also be done to see how well treatment for hemophilia B is working.\nNormal Results\nA normal value is 50% to 200% of the lab control or reference value.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples."}

Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nThe examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nDecreased factor IX activity may be related to:\nHemophilia B\n(a bleeding disorder caused by a lack of blood clotting factor IX)\nDisorder in which the proteins that regulate blood clotting become overactive (\ndisseminated intravascular coagulation\n)\nFat\nmalabsorption\n(not absorbing enough fat from your diet)\nLiver disease\n(such as\ncirrhosis\n)\nVitamin K\ndeficiency\nTaking certain blood thinners\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other."}

The risk of excessive bleeding is slightly more than for people without bleeding problems.\nAlternative Names\nChristmas factor assay; Serum factor IX; Hemophilic factor B; Plasma thromboplastin component; PTC\nReferences\nCarcao M, Gomez K, Davide M, Pierce GF.
