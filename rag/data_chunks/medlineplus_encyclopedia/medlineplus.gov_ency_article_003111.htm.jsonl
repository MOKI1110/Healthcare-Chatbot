This article focuses on groin pain in men. The terms \"groin\" and \"testicle\" are sometimes used interchangeably. But what causes pain in one area does not always cause pain in the other.\nCauses\nCommon causes of groin pain include:\nPulled muscle, tendon, or ligaments in the leg -- This problem often occurs in people who play sports such as hockey, soccer, and football. This condition is sometimes called \"sports hernia\" although the name is misleading since it is not an actual hernia. It may also involve pain in the testicles. Pain most often improves with rest and medicines.\nHernia\n-- This problem occurs when there is a weak spot in the wall of the abdominal muscle that allows internal organs to press through."}
