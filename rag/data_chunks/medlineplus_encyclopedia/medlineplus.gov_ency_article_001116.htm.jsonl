Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nWilliams syndrome\nWilliams syndrome\nWilliams syndrome is a rare disorder that can lead to problems with development.\nCauses\nWilliams syndrome is caused by not having a copy of 25 to 27 genes on\nchromosome\nnumber 7.\nIn most cases, the gene changes occur on their own, either in the sperm or egg that a baby develops from.\nHowever, once someone carries the genetic change, their children have a 50% chance of inheriting it.\nOne of the missing genes is the gene that produces elastin. This is a protein that allows blood vessels and other tissues in the body to stretch."}

This is a protein that allows blood vessels and other tissues in the body to stretch. It is likely that missing a copy of this gene results in the narrowing of blood vessels, stretchy skin, and flexible joints seen in this condition.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of Williams syndrome are:\nFeeding problems, including colic,\nreflux\n, and vomiting\nInward bend of the small finger\nSunken chest\nHeart disease or blood vessel problems\nDevelopmental delay, mild to moderate intellectual disability, learning disorders\nDelayed speech that may later turn into strong speaking ability and strong learning by hearing\nEasily distracted,\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder\n(ADHD)\nPersonality traits including being very friendly, trusting strangers, fearing loud sounds or physical contact, and being interested in music\nShort height, compared to the rest of the person's biologic relatives\nThe face and mouth of someone with Williams syndrome may show:\nflattened nasal bridge\nwith small, upturned nose\nLong ridges in the skin that run from the nose to the upper lip\nProminent lips with an open mouth\nSk"}

Avoid taking extra calcium and vitamin D. Treat high blood calcium if it occurs. Blood vessel narrowing can be a major health problem."}

Avoid taking extra calcium and vitamin D. Treat high blood calcium if it occurs. Blood vessel narrowing can be a major health problem. Treatment is based on how severe it is.\nPhysical therapy is helpful for people with joint stiffness. Developmental and speech therapy can also help. For example, having strong verbal skills can help make up for other problems. Other treatments are based on the person's symptoms.\nIt can help to have treatment coordinated by a geneticist who is experienced with Williams syndrome.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with Williams syndrome and their families can be found at:\nWilliams Syndrome Association --\nwilliams-syndrome.org\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people with Williams syndrome:\nHave some intellectual disability.\nMay have a shortened lifespan due to the various medical issues and other possible complications.\nRequire full-time caregivers and often live with supervision.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nCalcium deposits in the kidney and other kidney problems\nDeath (in rare cases from anesthesia)\nHeart failure due to narrowed blood vessels\nPain in th"}

Contact your health care provider if your child has features similar to those of Williams syndrome. Seek genetic counseling if you have a family history of Williams syndrome.\nPrevention\nThere is no known way to prevent the genetic problem that causes Williams syndrome.
