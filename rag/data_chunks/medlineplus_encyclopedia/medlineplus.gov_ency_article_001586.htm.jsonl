It is more common among the Ashkenazi Jewish population than in the general population.\nThe lack of the enzyme aspartoacylase leads to a buildup of material called N-acetylaspartic acid in the brain. This causes the\nwhite matter of the brain\nto break down.\nThere are two forms of the disease:\nNeonatal (infantile) -- This is the most common form. Symptoms are severe. Babies seem to be normal the first few months after birth. By 3 to 5 months, they have developmental problems, such as those mentioned below under the Symptoms section of this article.\nJuvenile -- This is a less common form. Symptoms are mild. Developmental problems are less severe than those of the neonatal form. In some cases, the symptoms are so mild that they go undiagnosed as Canavan disease.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms often begin in the first year of life."}

Parents tend to notice it when their child is not reaching certain developmental milestones, including head control.\nSymptoms include:\nAbnormal posture with flexed arms and straight legs\nFood material flows back into the nose\nFeeding problems\nIncreasing head size\nIrritability\nPoor muscle tone\n, especially of the neck muscles\nA lack of head control when baby is pulled from a lying to a sitting position\nPoor visual tracking, or blindness\nReflux\n(gastrointestinal) with vomiting\nSeizures\nSevere intellectual disability\nSwallowing difficulties\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam may show:\nExaggerated reflexes\nJoint stiffness\nLoss of tissue in the optic nerve of the eye\nTests for this condition include:\nBlood chemistry\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) chemistry\nGenetic testing for aspartoacylase gene mutations\nHead CT scan\nHead MRI scan\nUrine or blood chemistry for elevated aspartic acid\nDNA analysis\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment available."}

People are likely to become disabled.\nThose with the neonatal form often do not live beyond childhood. Some children may live into their teens."}

Counseling should be considered if both parents are of Ashkenazi Jewish descent. For this group, DNA testing can almost always tell if the parents are carriers.\nA diagnosis may be made before the baby is born (prenatal diagnosis) by testing the\namniotic fluid\n, the fluid that surrounds the womb.\nAlternative Names\nSpongy degeneration of the brain; Aspartoacylase deficiency; Canavan - van Bogaert disease\nReferences\nDugoff L, Wapner RJ.
