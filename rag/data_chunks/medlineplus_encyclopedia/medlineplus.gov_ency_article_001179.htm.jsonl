The medical name of this condition is hyperkalemia.\nCauses\nPotassium is needed for cells to function properly. You get potassium through food. Your kidneys remove excess potassium through the urine to keep a proper balance of this mineral in your body.\nIf your kidneys are not working well, they may not be able to remove the proper amount of potassium. As a result, potassium can build up in the blood."}
