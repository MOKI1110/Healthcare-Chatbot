Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nOvarian overproduction of androgens\nOvarian overproduction of androgens\nOvarian overproduction of androgens is a condition in which the ovaries make too much\ntestosterone\n. This leads to the development of male characteristics in a woman. Androgens from other parts of the body can also cause male characteristics to develop in women.\nCauses\nIn healthy women, the ovaries and adrenal glands produce about 40% to 50% of the body's testosterone. Tumors of the ovaries and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) can both cause  too much  androgen production.\nCushing disease is a problem with the pituitary gland that  leads to  excess amounts of corticosteroids. Corticosteroids may cause masculine body changes in women."}

Medicines can be given to decrease hair production in women with excess body hair, or to regulate menstrual cycles. In some cases, surgery may be needed to remove an ovarian or adrenal tumor.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nTreatment success depends on the cause of excess androgen production. If the condition is caused by an ovarian tumor, surgery to remove the tumor may correct the problem."}
