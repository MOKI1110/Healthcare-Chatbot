Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nUterine prolapse\nUterine prolapse\nUterine prolapse occurs when the womb (uterus) drops down and presses into the vaginal area.\nCauses\nMuscles, ligaments, and other structures hold the uterus in the pelvis. If these tissues are weak or stretched, the uterus drops into the vaginal canal. This is called prolapse.\nThis condition is more common in women who have had 1 or more vaginal births.\nOther things that can cause or lead to uterine prolapse include:\nNormal aging\nLack of estrogen after menopause\nConditions that put pressure on the pelvic muscles, such as chronic cough and obesity\nPelvic tumor (rare)\nRepeated straining to have a bowel movement due to long-term constipation can make the problem worse.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nPressure or heaviness in the pelvis or vagina\nProblems with sexual intercourse\nLeaking urine or sudden urge to empty the bladder\nLow backache\nUterus and cervix that bulge into the vaginal opening\nRepeated bladder infections\nVaginal bleeding\nIncreased vaginal discharge\nSymptoms may be worse when you stand or sit for a long time."}

Exercise or lifting may also make symptoms worse.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will do a pelvic exam. You will be asked to bear down as if you are trying to push out a baby. This shows how far your uterus has dropped.\nUterine prolapse is mild when the\ncervix\ndrops into the lower part of the\nvagina\n.\nUterine prolapse is moderate when the cervix drops out of the vaginal opening.\nOther things the pelvic exam may show are:\nThe bladder and front wall of the vagina are bulging into the vagina (\ncystocele\n).\nThe rectum and back wall of the vagina (rectocele) are bulging into the vagina.\nThe urethra and bladder are lower in the pelvis than usual.\nTreatment\nYou do not need treatment unless you are bothered by the symptoms.\nMany women will get treatment by the time the uterus drops to the opening of the vagina.\nLIFESTYLE CHANGES\nThe following can help you control your symptoms:\nLose weight if you are obese.\nAvoid heavy lifting or straining.\nGet treated for a chronic cough."}

If your cough is due to smoking, try to quit.\nVAGINAL PESSARY\nYour provider may recommend placing a rubber or plastic donut-shaped device, into your vagina. This is called a pessary. This device holds your uterus in place.\nThe pessary may be used for short-term or long-term. The device is fitted for your vagina. Some pessaries are similar to a diaphragm used for birth control.\nPessaries must be cleaned regularly. Sometimes they need to be cleaned by your provider. Many women can be taught how to insert, clean, and remove a pessary.\nSide effects of pessaries include:\nFoul smelling discharge from the vagina\nIrritation of the lining of the vagina\nUlcers in the vagina\nProblems with vaginal sexual intercourse\nSURGERY\nSurgery should not be done until the prolapse symptoms are worse than the risks of having surgery."}

The type of surgery will depend on:\nThe severity of the prolapse\nThe woman's plans for future pregnancies\nThe woman's age, health, and other medical problems\nThe woman's desire to retain vaginal function\nThere are some surgical procedures that can be done without removing the uterus, such as a sacrospinous fixation. This procedure involves using nearby ligaments to support the uterus. Other procedures are also available.\nOften, a\nvaginal hysterectomy\ncan be done at the same time as the procedure to correct uterine prolapse. Any sagging of the vaginal walls, urethra, bladder, or rectum can be surgically corrected at the same time.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost women with mild uterine prolapse do not have symptoms that require treatment.\nVaginal pessaries can be effective for many women with uterine prolapse.\nSurgery often provides very good results."}
