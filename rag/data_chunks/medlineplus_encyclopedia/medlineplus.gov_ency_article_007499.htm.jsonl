This can be done to relieve symptoms of arthritis by realigning your leg.\nDescription\nThere are two types of surgery:\nTibial osteotomy is surgery done on the shin bone below the knee cap.\nFemoral osteotomy is surgery done on the thigh bone above the knee cap.\nDuring surgery:\nYou will be pain-free during surgery. You may get\nspinal or epidural anesthesia\n, along with medicine to help you relax. You may also receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n, in which you will be asleep.\nYour surgeon will make a 4 to 5 inch (10 to 13 centimeters) cut on the area where the osteotomy is being done.\nThe surgeon may remove a wedge of your shinbone or thighbone from underneath the healthy side of your knee. This is called a closing wedge osteotomy.\nThe surgeon may also open a wedge on the painful side of the knee. This is called an opening wedge osteotomy.\nStaples, screws, or plates may be used, depending on the type of osteotomy."}

This is called an opening wedge osteotomy.\nStaples, screws, or plates may be used, depending on the type of osteotomy. This is called fixation.\nYou may need a bone graft to fill in the wedge.\nIn most cases, the procedure will take 1 to 1 1/2 hours.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nOsteotomy of the knee is done to treat symptoms of knee arthritis or for instability. It is done when other treatments no longer offer relief.\nArthritis most often affects the inside part of the knee. Most of the time, the outside part of the knee is less affected unless you have had a knee injury in the past.\nOsteotomy surgery works by shifting the weight away from the damaged part of your knee."}

For the surgery to be successful, the side of the knee where the weight is being shifted to should have little or no arthritis.\nRisks\nThe risks for any anesthesia or surgery are:\nAllergic reactions to medicines\nBreathing problems\nBleeding\nInfection\nOther risks from this surgery include:\nBlood clot\nin the leg.\nInjury to a blood vessel or nerve.\nInfection in the knee joint.\nKnee stiffness or a knee joint that is not well-aligned.\nStiffness in the knee.\nFailure of the fixation that requires more surgery.\nFailure for the osteotomy to heal. This may require more surgery or treatment.\nPain from the plates and screws that were placed.\nBefore the Procedure\nAlways tell your surgeon which medicines you are taking, even medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\nDuring the 2 weeks before your surgery:\nYou may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot."}

These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), blood thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin), and other medicines.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\nTell your surgeon if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol -- more than 1 or 2 drinks a day.\nIf you smoke, try to stop. Ask your health care provider for help. Smoking can slow down wound and bone healing.\nOn the day of your surgery:\nYou will most often be asked not to drink or eat anything for 6 to 12 hours before the procedure.\nTake the drugs your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\nYou will be told when to arrive at the hospital.\nAfter the Procedure\nBy having an osteotomy, you may be able to delay the need for a knee replacement for up to 10 years, but still stay active with your own knee joint.\nA tibial osteotomy may make you look \"knock-kneed.\" A femoral osteotomy may make you look \"bow legged.\"\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nYou will be fitted with a"}

The brace may also help hold your knee in the correct position.\nYou will need to use crutches for 6 weeks or more. At first, you may be asked to not place any weight on your knee. Ask your surgeon when it will be OK to walk with weight on your leg that had the surgery. You will see a physical therapist to help you with an exercise program.\nComplete recovery may take several months to a year.\nAlternative Names\nProximal tibial osteotomy; Lateral closing wedge osteotomy; High tibial osteotomy; Distal femoral osteotomy; Arthritis - osteotomy\nImages\nTibial osteotomy - series\nReferences\nCrenshaw AH.
