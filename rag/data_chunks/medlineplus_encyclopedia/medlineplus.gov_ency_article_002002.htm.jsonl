Rolling over, crawling, walking, and talking are all considered milestones. The milestones are different for each age range.\nThere is a normal range in which a child may reach each milestone. For example, walking may begin as early as 8 months in some children. Others walk as late as 18 months and it is still considered normal.\nOne of the reasons for well-child visits to your child's health care provider in the early years is to follow your child's development. Most parents also watch for different milestones. Talk to your child's provider if you have concerns about your child's development.\nClosely watching a checklist or calendar of developmental milestones may trouble parents if their child is not developing normally. At the same time, milestones can help to identify a child who needs a more detailed evaluation than may be possible at well child visits."}
