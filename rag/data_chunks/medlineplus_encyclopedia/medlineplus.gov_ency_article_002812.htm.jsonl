Swallowing this type of poison can have severe effects on many parts of the body. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\nBurns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue necrosis, resulting in infection, shock, and death, even several months after the substance was first swallowed. Scars may form in these tissues leading to long-term difficulties with breathing, swallowing, and digestion.\nIf metal cleaner gets into the lungs (\naspiration\n), serious and possibly permanent lung damage can occur.\nReferences\nAronson JK.
