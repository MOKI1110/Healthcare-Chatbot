Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nChoanal atresia\nChoanal atresia\nChoanal atresia is a narrowing or blockage of the nasal airway by tissue. It is a congenital condition, meaning it is present at birth.\nCauses\nThe cause of choanal atresia is unknown. It is thought to occur when the thin tissue separating the nose and mouth area during fetal development remains after birth.\nThe condition is the most common nasal abnormality in newborn infants. Females get this condition about twice as often as males. More than half of affected infants also have other congenital problems.\nChoanal atresia is most often diagnosed shortly after birth while the infant is still in the hospital.\nSymptoms\nNewborns generally prefer to breathe through their nose. Typically, infants only breathe through their mouths when they cry. Babies with choanal atresia have difficulty breathing unless they are crying.\nChoanal atresia may affect one or both sides of the nasal airway. Choanal atresia blocking both sides of the nose causes acute breathing problems with bluish discoloration and breathing failure."}

Choanal atresia blocking both sides of the nose causes acute breathing problems with bluish discoloration and breathing failure. Such infants may need\nresuscitation\nat delivery. More than one half of infants have a blockage on only one side, which causes less severe problems.\nSymptoms include:\nChest retracts unless the child is breathing through mouth or crying.\nDifficulty breathing\nfollowing birth, which may result in cyanosis (bluish discoloration), unless infant is crying.\nInability to nurse and breathe at same time.\nInability to pass a catheter through each side of the nose into the throat.\nPersistent one-sided nasal blockage or discharge.\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam may show an obstruction of the nose.\nTests that may be done include:\nCT scan\nEndoscopy\nof the nose\nSinus x-ray\nTreatment\nThe immediate concern is to resuscitate the baby if necessary. An airway may need to be placed so that the infant can breathe. In some cases,\nintubation\nmay be needed.\nAn infant can learn to mouth breathe, which can delay the need for immediate surgery.\nSurgery to remove the obstruction cures the problem."}

One-sided atresia may not cause symptoms, and the infant may be sent home without a diagnosis.\nIf your infant has any of the problems listed here, consult your health care provider.
