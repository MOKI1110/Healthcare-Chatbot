In otherwise healthy people, it may occur as a local infection. But in people with weakened immune systems, it may spread throughout the body.\nCauses\nNocardia infection is caused by a specific bacterium. It usually starts in the lungs. It may spread to other organs, most often the brain and the skin. It may also involve the kidneys, joints, heart, eyes, and bones.\nNocardia bacteria are found in soil around the world. You can get the disease by breathing in dust that has the bacteria."}

It may also involve the kidneys, joints, heart, eyes, and bones.\nNocardia bacteria are found in soil around the world. You can get the disease by breathing in dust that has the bacteria. You can also get the disease if soil containing nocardia bacteria gets into an open wound.\nYou are more likely to get this infection if you have long-term (chronic) lung disease or a weakened immune system, which can occur with transplants,\ncancer\n, HIV/AIDS, and long-term use of steroids.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms vary and depend on the organs involved.\nIf in the lungs, symptoms may include:\nChest pain when breathing (may occur suddenly or slowly)\nCoughing up blood\nFever\nNight sweats\nWeight loss\nIf in the brain, symptoms may include:\nFever\nHeadache\nSeizures\nComa\nIf the skin is affected, symptoms may include:\nSkin breakdown and a draining tract (\nfistula\n)\nUlcers or nodules with infection sometimes spreading along lymph nodes\nSome people with nocardia infection have no symptoms.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms.\nNocardia infection is diagnosed using tests that identify the bacteria (\nGram stain\n, modified acid-fast staining or\nculture\n)."}

You may need more than one antibiotic.\nSurgery may be done to drain pus that has collected in the skin or tissues (\nabscess\n).\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well you do depends on your overall health and the parts of the body involved."}

Infection that affects many areas of the body is hard to treat, and some people may not be able to recover.\nPossible Complications\nComplications of nocardia infections depend on how much of the body is involved.\nCertain lung infections may lead to scarring and long-term (chronic) shortness of breath.\nSkin infections may lead to scarring or disfigurement.\nBrain abscesses may lead to loss of neurological function.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have any symptoms of this infection.
