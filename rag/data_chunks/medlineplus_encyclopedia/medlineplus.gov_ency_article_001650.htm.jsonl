It often occurs when a teen is growing rapidly.\nCauses\nOsteosarcoma is the most common bone cancer in children. The average age at diagnosis is 15 years. Boys and girls are just as likely to develop this\ntumor\nuntil the late teens, after which it occurs more often in boys. Osteosarcoma is also common in people over age 60.\nThe cause is not known. In some cases, osteosarcoma runs in families. At least one gene has been linked to an increased risk. This gene is also associated with familial\nretinoblastoma\n. This is a cancer of the eye that occurs in children.\nOsteosarcoma tends to occur in the bones of the:\nShin (near the knee)\nThigh (near the knee)\nUpper arm (near the shoulder)\nOsteosarcoma occurs most commonly in large bones in the area of bone with the fastest growth rate. However, it can occur in any bone.\nSymptoms\nThe first symptom is usually bone pain near a joint."}

However, it can occur in any bone.\nSymptoms\nThe first symptom is usually bone pain near a joint. This symptom may be overlooked, especially in young people, because of other more common causes of joint pain.\nOther symptoms may include any of the following:\nBone fracture\n(may occur after a routine movement)\nLimitation of motion\nLimping (if the tumor is in the leg)\nPain when lifting (if the tumor is in the arm)\nTenderness, swelling, or redness at the site of the tumor\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history and symptoms.\nTests that may be done include:\nBiopsy\n(at time of surgery for diagnosis)\nBlood tests\nBone scan\nto see if the cancer has spread to other bones\nCT scan of the chest\nto see if the cancer has spread to the lungs\nMRI scan\nPET scan\nX-ray\nTreatment\nTreatment usually starts after a biopsy of the tumor is done.\nBefore surgery to remove the tumor,\nchemotherapy\n,\nradiation therapy\n, or both is usually given. This can shrink the tumor and make surgery easier."}

This can shrink the tumor and make surgery easier. It may also kill any cancer cells that have spread to other parts of the body.\nSurgery is used after chemotherapy to remove any remaining tumor. In most cases, surgery can remove the tumor while saving the affected limb. This is called limb-sparing surgery. In rare cases, more extensive surgery (such as amputation) is necessary.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\ncancer support group\n. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you and your family not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf the tumor has not spread to the lungs (pulmonary\nmetastasis\n), long-term survival rates are better. If the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, the outlook is worse."}
