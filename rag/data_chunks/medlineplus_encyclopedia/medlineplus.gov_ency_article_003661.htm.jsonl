Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nLower-than-normal AT III may mean you have an increased risk for blood clotting. This can occur when there is not enough AT III in your blood, or when there is enough AT III in your blood, but the AT III does not function properly and is less active.\nAbnormal results may not appear until you are an adult.\nExamples of complications associated with increased blood clotting are:\nDeep venous thrombosis\n(DVT)\nPhlebitis (vein inflammation)\nPulmonary embolus\n(blood clot traveling to lung)\nThrombophlebitis\n(vein inflammation with clot formation)\nLower than normal AT III may be due to:\nBone marrow transplant\nDisseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)\nAT III deficiency, an inherited condition\nLiver\ncirrhosis\nNephrotic syndrome\nHigher than normal AT III may be due to:\nUse of anabolic steroids\nBleeding disorder (\nhemophilia\n)\nKidney transplant\nLow level of vitamin K\nRisks\nThere is little risk involv"}

Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other.
