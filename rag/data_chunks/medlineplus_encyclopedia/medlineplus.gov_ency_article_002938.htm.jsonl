Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nOmphalocele repair\nOmphalocele repair\nOmphalocele\nrepair is a procedure done on an infant to correct a birth defect in the wall of the belly (abdomen) in which all or part of the bowel, possibly the liver and other organs stick out of the belly button (navel) in a thin sac.\nOther birth defects may also be present.\nDescription\nThe goal of the procedure is to place the organs back into the baby's belly and fix the defect. Repair may be done right after the baby is born. This is called a primary repair. Or, the repair is done in stages. This is called a staged repair.\nSurgery for primary repair is most often done for a small omphalocele.\nRight after birth, the sac with the organs outside the belly is covered with a sterile dressing to protect it.\nWhen your surgeons determine your newborn is strong enough for surgery, your baby is prepared for the operation.\nYour baby receives\ngeneral anesthesia\n."}

This is medicine that allows your baby to sleep and be pain-free during the operation.\nThe surgeon makes a cut (incision) to remove the sac around the organs.\nThe organs are examined closely for signs of damage or other birth defects. Unhealthy parts are removed. The healthy edges are stitched together.\nThe organs are placed back into the belly.\nThe opening in the wall of the belly is repaired.\nStaged repair is done when your baby isn't stable enough for primary repair. Or, it is done if the omphalocele is very large and the organs can't fit into the baby's belly. The repair is performed the following way:\nRight after birth, a plastic pouch (called a silo) or a mesh-type of material is used to contain the omphalocele. The pouch or mesh is then attached to the baby's belly.\nEvery 2 to 3 days, the surgeon gently tightens the pouch or mesh to push the intestine into the belly.\nIt may take up to 2 weeks or more for all of the organs to be back inside the belly."}

It needs to be treated soon after birth so that the baby's organs can develop and be protected in the belly.\nRisks\nRisks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:\nAllergic reactions to medicines\nBreathing problems\nBleeding\nInfection\nNausea and vomiting\nRisks for omphalocele repair are:\nBreathing problems. The baby may need a breathing tube and breathing machine for a few days or weeks after surgery.\nInflammation of the tissue that lines the wall of the abdomen and covers the abdominal organs.\nOrgan injury.\nProblems with digestion and absorbing nutrients from food, if a baby has a lot of damage to the small bowel.\nBlockage of the bowel, either just after the surgery, or later.\nA hernia, either at the repair site, or in the groin region.\nBefore the Procedure\nOmphalocele is usually seen on ultrasound before the baby is born."}

After it is found, your baby will be followed very closely to make sure they are growing.\nYour baby should be delivered at a hospital that has a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and a pediatric surgeon. A NICU is set up to handle emergencies that occur at birth. A pediatric surgeon has special training in surgery for babies and children. Most babies who are known to have a giant omphalocele are delivered by cesarean delivery (C-section).\nAfter the Procedure\nAfter surgery, your baby will receive care in the NICU."}

Your baby will be placed in a special bed to keep them warm.\nYour baby may need to be on a breathing machine until organ swelling has decreased and the size of the belly area has increased.\nOther treatments your baby will probably need after surgery are:\nAntibiotics\nFluids and nutrients given through a vein\nOxygen\nPain medicines\nA nasogastric (NG) tube placed through the nose into the stomach to drain the stomach and keep it empty\nFeedings are started through the NG tube as soon as your baby's bowel starts working after surgery. Feedings by mouth will start very slowly. Your baby may eat slowly and may need feeding therapy, lots of encouragement, and time to recover after a feeding.\nHow long your baby stays in the hospital depends on whether there are other birth defects and complications."}

You may be able to take your baby home once they start taking all foods by mouth and gaining weight.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAfter you go home, your child may develop a blockage in the intestines (\nbowel obstruction\n) due to a kink or scar in the intestines. Your surgeon can tell you how this will be treated.\nMost of the time, surgery can correct omphalocele. How well your baby does depends on how much damage or loss of intestine there was, and whether your child has other birth defects.\nSome babies have\ngastroesophageal reflux\nafter surgery. This condition causes food or stomach acid to come back up from the stomach into the esophagus.\nSome babies with large omphaloceles may also have small lungs and may need to use a breathing machine.\nAll babies born with an omphalocele should have chromosome testing."}
