This type of surgery is called breast reconstruction. It can be performed at the same time as a mastectomy (immediate reconstruction) or later (delayed reconstruction).\nThe breast is usually reshaped in two stages, or surgeries. During the first stage, a tissue expander is used. An implant is placed during the second stage. Sometimes, the implant is inserted in the first stage.\nDescription\nIf you are having reconstruction at the same time as your mastectomy, your surgeon may do either of the following:\nSkin-sparing mastectomy. This means a small area of skin is removed along with the nipple and areola (the pigmented area around the nipple).\nNipple-sparing mastectomy."}

This means a small area of skin is removed along with the nipple and areola (the pigmented area around the nipple).\nNipple-sparing mastectomy. This means all of the skin, the nipple, and areola are kept.\nIn either case, skin is left to make reconstruction easier.\nIf you will have breast reconstruction later, your surgeon will remove enough skin over your breast during the mastectomy to be able to close the skin flaps and make the chest look as smooth and flat as possible.\nBreast reconstruction with implants is usually done in two stages, or surgeries. During the surgeries, you will receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n. This uses medicines that keep you asleep and pain-free.\nIn the first stage:\nThe surgeon creates a pocket under your chest muscle.\nA small tissue expander is placed in the pocket. The expander is balloon-like and made of a silicone shell with a lumen that can be filled gradually.\nAn accessible fill port is present in the expander within the breast.\nYour chest still looks flat right after this surgery.\nStarting about 2 to 3 weeks after surgery, you see your surgeon every 1 or 2 weeks."}

During these visits, your surgeon injects a small amount of saline (salt water) through the port into the expander.\nOver time, the expander slowly enlarges the pocket in your chest to the right size for the surgeon to place an implant.\nWhen it reaches the right size, you will wait 1 to 3 months before the permanent breast implant is placed during the second stage.\nIn the second stage:\nThe surgeon removes the tissue expander from your chest and replaces it with a breast implant. This surgery takes 1 to 2 hours.\nBefore this surgery, you will have talked with your surgeon about the different kinds of breast implants. Implants may be filled with either saline or a silicone gel.\nYou may have another minor procedure later that remakes the nipple and areola area."}

Sometimes fat grafting will be performed to help the contour.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nYou and your surgeon will decide together about whether to have breast reconstruction, and when to have it.\nHaving breast reconstruction does not make it harder to find a tumor if your\nbreast cancer\ncomes back.\nGetting breast implants does not take as long as breast reconstruction that uses your\nown tissue\n. You will also have fewer scars. But, the size, fullness, and shape of the new breasts may be more natural in appearance with reconstruction that uses your own tissue.\nSome women choose not to have breast reconstruction or implants. They may use a prosthesis (an artificial breast) in their bra that gives them a natural shape, or they may choose to use nothing at all.\nRisks\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:\nReactions to medicines\nBreathing problems\nBleeding\n,\nblood clots\n, or infection\nRisks of breast reconstruction with implants are:\nThe implant may break or leak."}

This is called capsular contracture. You will need more surgery if this happens.\nInfection soon after surgery. You will need to have the expander or the implant removed.\nBreast implants can shift. This will cause a change in the shape of your breast.\nOne breast may be larger than the other (asymmetry of the breasts).\nYou may have a loss of sensation around the nipple and areola.\nSome women have noticed other symptoms related to having an implant in their body.\nBefore the Procedure\nAsk your surgeon if you need a screening mammogram based on your age and risk of having breast cancer."}

It is nearly impossible to make a reconstructed breast look exactly the same as the remaining natural breast.
