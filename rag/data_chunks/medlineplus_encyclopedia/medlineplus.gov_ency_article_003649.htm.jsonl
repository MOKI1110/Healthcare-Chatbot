Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEosinophil count - absolute\nEosinophil count - absolute\nAn absolute eosinophil count is a blood test that measures the number of one type of white blood cells called eosinophils. Eosinophils become active when you have certain allergic diseases, infections, and other medical conditions.\nHow the Test is Performed\nMost of the time, blood is drawn from a vein on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. The site is cleaned with an antiseptic. The health care provider wraps an elastic band around your upper arm to make the vein swell with blood.\nNext, the provider gently inserts a needle into the vein. The blood collects into an airtight tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm. The needle is then removed and the site is covered to stop bleeding.\nIn infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to prick the skin. The blood collects in a small glass tube, or onto a slide or test strip. A bandage is put on the spot to stop bleeding.\nIn the lab, the blood is placed on a microscope slide."}

The blood collects in a small glass tube, or onto a slide or test strip. A bandage is put on the spot to stop bleeding.\nIn the lab, the blood is placed on a microscope slide. A stain is added to the sample. This causes eosinophils to show up as orange-red granules. The technician then counts how many eosinophils are present per 100 cells. The percentage of eosinophils is multiplied by the\nwhite blood cell count\nto give the absolute eosinophil count.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nMost of the time, adults do not need to take special steps before this test. Tell your provider the medicines you are taking, including the ones without a prescription. Some medicines may change the test results.\nMedicines that may cause you to have an increase in eosinophils include:\nAmphetamines (appetite suppressants)\nCertain laxatives containing psyllium\nCertain antibiotics\nInterferon\nTranquilizers\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou will have this test to see if you have abnormal results from a blood differential test."}

This test may also be done if the provider thinks you may have a specific disease.\nThis test may help diagnose:\nAcute hypereosinophilic syndrome (a rare, but sometimes fatal leukemia-like condition)\nAn\nallergic reaction\n(can also reveal how severe the reaction is)\nCancer\nEarly stages of\nAddison disease\nInfection by a parasite\nVasculitis\nNormal Results\nNormal eosinophil count is less than 500 cells per microliter (cells/mcL).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nThe example above shows the common measurements for results of these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA high number of eosinophils (eosinophilia) is often linked to a variety of disorders."}

The test cannot tell if the higher number of cells is caused by allergy or parasite infection.\nAlternative Names\nEosinophils; Absolute eosinophil count\nImages\nBlood cells\nReferences\nKhoury P, Akuthota P, Weller PF, Klion AD.
