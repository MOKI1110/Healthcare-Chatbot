Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMucopolysaccharidosis type III\nMucopolysaccharidosis type III\nMucopolysaccharidosis type III (MPS III) is a rare disease in which the body is missing or does not have enough of certain\nenzymes\nneeded to break down long chains of sugar molecules. These chains of molecules are called glycosaminoglycans (formerly called mucopolysaccharides). As a result, the molecules build up in different parts of the body and cause various health problems.\nThe condition belongs to a group of diseases called\nmucopolysaccharidoses\n(MPSs). MPS III is also known as Sanfilippo syndrome.\nThere are several other types of MPSs, including:\nMPS I\n(Hurler syndrome; Hurler-Scheie syndrome; Scheie syndrome)\nMPS II\n(Hunter syndrome)\nMPS IV\n(Morquio syndrome)\nCauses\nMPS III is an inherited disorder. This means it is typically passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of a gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease."}

If both parents carry a nonworking copy of a gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease. This is called an\nautosomal recessive\ntrait.\nMPS III occurs when the enzymes needed to break down the heparan sulfate sugar chain are missing or defective.\nThere are four main types of MPS III. The type a person has depends on which enzyme is affected.\nType A is caused by a defect in the\nSGSH\ngene and is the most severe form. People with this type do not have a normal form of the enzyme called heparan\nN\n-sulfatase.\nType B is caused by a defect in the\nNAGLU\ngene. People with this type are missing or do not produce enough alpha-\nN\n-acetylglucosaminidase.\nType C is caused by a defect in the\nHGSNAT\ngene. People with this type are missing or do not produce enough acetyl-CoA:alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase.\nType D is caused by a defect in the\nGNS\ngene. People with this type are missing or do not produce enough\nN\n-acetylglucosamine 6-sulfatase.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms often appear after the first year of life. A decline in learning ability typically occurs between ages 2 and 6."}

Delayed development is followed by worsening mental status.\nOther symptoms may include:\nBehavioral problems, including\nhyperactivity\nCoarse facial features with heavy eyebrows that meet in the middle of the face above the nose\nChronic diarrhea\nEnlarged liver\nand\nspleen\nSleep difficulties\nStiff joints that may not extend fully\nVision problems and hearing loss\nWalking problems\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam.\nUrine tests will be done. People with MPS III have a large amount of a mucopolysaccharide called heparan sulfate in the urine.\nOther tests may include:\nBlood enzyme level\nEchocardiogram\nGenetic testing\nSlit lamp eye exam\nSkin fibroblast culture\nX-rays of the bones\nTreatment\nTreatment of MPS III is aimed at managing the symptoms. There is no specific treatment for this disease."}
