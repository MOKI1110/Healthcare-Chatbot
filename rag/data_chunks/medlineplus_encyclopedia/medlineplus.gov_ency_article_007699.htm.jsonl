Vulvodynia causes severe pain, burning, and stinging of the vulva.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of vulvodynia is unknown. Researchers are working to learn more about the condition. Causes may include:\nIrritation or injury to the nerves of the vulva\nHormonal changes\nOverreaction in the cells of the vulva to infection or injury\nExtra nerve fibers in the vulva\nWeak pelvic floor muscles\nAllergies to certain chemicals\nGenetic factors that cause sensitivity or overreaction to infection or inflammation\nSexually transmitted infections (STIs) do not cause this condition.\nSymptoms\nThere are two main types of vulvodynia:\nLocalized vulvodynia.\nThis is pain in just one area of the vulva, usually the opening of the vagina (vestibule). The pain often occurs due to pressure on the area, such as from sexual intercourse, inserting a tampon, or sitting for a long time.\nGeneralized vulvodynia.\nThis is pain in different areas of the vulva."}

The pain is fairly constant, with some periods of relief. Pressure on the vulva, such as from sitting for a long time or wearing tight pants can make symptoms worse.\nThe vulvar pain is often:\nSharp\nBurning\nItching\nThrobbing\nYou may feel symptoms all the time or just some of the time. At times, you may feel pain in the area between your vagina and anus (perineum) and in the inner thighs.\nVulvodynia may occur in teens or in women. Women with vulvodynia often complain of pain during sexual activity. It may occur after having sex the first time. Or, it may occur after years of sexual activity.\nCertain things may trigger symptoms:\nSexual intercourse\nInserting a tampon\nWearing tight under wear or pants\nUrinating\nSitting for a long time\nExercising or bicycling\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions about your medical history. Your provider may do a urinalysis to rule out a urinary tract infection."}

Your provider may do a urinalysis to rule out a urinary tract infection. You may have other tests to check for a yeast infection or skin disease.\nYour provider also may perform cotton swab test. During this test, the provider will apply gentle pressure to different areas of your vulva and ask you to rate your pain level. This will help identify specific areas of pain.\nVulvodynia is diagnosed when all other possible causes have been excluded.\nTreatment\nThe goal of the treatment is to reduce pain and relieve symptoms.
