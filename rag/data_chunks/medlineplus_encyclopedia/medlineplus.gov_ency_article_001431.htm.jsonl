Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAutonomic dysreflexia\nAutonomic dysreflexia\nAutonomic dysreflexia (AD) is an abnormal, overreaction of the involuntary (autonomic) nervous system to stimulation. This reaction may include:\nChange in heart rate\nExcessive sweating\nHigh blood pressure\nMuscle spasms\nSkin color changes (paleness, redness, blue-gray skin color)\nCauses\nThe cause of AD is spinal cord injury, most often due to spine trauma. The nervous system of people with AD over-responds to the types of stimulation that do not bother healthy people.\nOther conditions may cause autonomic dysfunction (not dysreflexia) which has similar symptoms, including:\nGuillain-BarrÃ© syndrome\n(disorder in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks part of the nervous system)\nSide effects of some medicines\nSevere head trauma and other brain injuries\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage\n(a form of brain bleeding)\nUse of illegal stimulant drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines\nSymptoms\nSymptoms can include any of the following:\nAnxiety or worry\nBladder or bowel problems\nBlurry vision, widened (dilated) pupils\nLighth"}

Tell your provider about all the medicines you are taking now and that you took in the past. This helps determine which tests you need.\nTests may include:\nBlood and urine tests\nCT\nor\nMRI scan\nECG\n(measurement of the heart's electrical activity)\nLumbar puncture\nTilt-table testing (testing of blood pressure as the body position changes)\nToxicology screening\n(tests for any medicines, including illegal drugs, in your bloodstream)\nX-rays\nOther conditions share many symptoms with AD, but have a different cause."}

If medicines or illegal drugs are worsening the symptoms, they must be stopped. Any illness needs to be treated."}

If medicines or illegal drugs are worsening the symptoms, they must be stopped. Any illness needs to be treated. For example, the provider will check for a blocked urinary catheter and signs of constipation which may cause AD in someone with a spinal cord injury. The person should be checked for injuries, sores, or other irritants that may be triggering the symptoms.\nIf a slowing of the heart rate is causing AD, medicines called anticholinergics (such as atropine) may be used.\nVery high blood pressure needs to be treated quickly but carefully, because the blood pressure can drop suddenly.\npacemaker\nmay be needed for an unstable heart rhythm.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nOutlook depends on the cause.\nPeople with autonomic dysfunction due to a medicine usually recover when that medicine is stopped. When AD is aggravated by other factors, recovery depends on how well the disease can be treated.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may occur due to side effects of medicines used to treat the condition. A sudden severe increase in blood pressure can cause a stroke or bleeding into the brain."}
