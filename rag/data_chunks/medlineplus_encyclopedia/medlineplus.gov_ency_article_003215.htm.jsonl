Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBlue discoloration of the skin\nBlue discoloration of the skin\nA bluish color to the skin or mucous membrane is usually due to a lack of oxygen in the blood. The medical term is cyanosis.\nConsiderations\nRed blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. Most of the time, nearly all red blood cells in the arteries carry a full supply of oxygen. These blood cells are bright red and the skin is pinkish or red.\nBlood that has lost its oxygen is dark bluish-red. People whose blood is low in oxygen tend to have a bluish color to their skin. This condition is called cyanosis.\nDepending on the cause, cyanosis may develop suddenly, along with shortness of breath and other symptoms.\nCyanosis that is caused by long-term heart or lung problems may develop slowly."}

Symptoms may be present, but are often not severe.\nWhen the oxygen level has dropped only a small amount, cyanosis may be hard to detect.\nIn dark-skinned people, cyanosis may be easier to see in the mucous membranes (lips, gums, around the eyes) and nailbeds.\nPeople with cyanosis do not normally have\nanemia\n(low blood count). Anemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells.\nCauses\nCyanosis that is seen in only one part of the body may be due to:\nblood clot\nthat blocks the blood supply to a leg, foot, hand, or arm\nRaynaud phenomenon\n(condition in which cold temperatures or strong emotions cause blood vessel spasms, which block blood flow to the fingers, toes, ears, and nose)\nMost often, cyanosis occurs because of a lack of oxygen in the blood."}
