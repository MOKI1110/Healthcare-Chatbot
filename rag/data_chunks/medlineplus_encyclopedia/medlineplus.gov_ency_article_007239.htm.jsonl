Fluids are given into a vein to provide most of the nutrients the body needs. The method is used when a person cannot or should not receive feedings or fluids by mouth.\nInformation\nSick or premature newborns may be given TPN before starting other feedings. They may also have this type of feeding when they cannot absorb nutrients through the gastrointestinal tract for a long time. TPN delivers a mixture of fluid, electrolytes, sugars, amino acids (protein), vitamins, minerals, and often lipids (fats) into an infant's vein. TPN can be lifesaving for very small or very sick babies. It can provide a better level of nutrition than regular\nintravenous\n(IV) feedings, which provide only sugars and salts.\nInfants who get this type of feeding must be watched carefully to make sure they are getting the proper nutrition."}

Blood and urine tests help the health care team know what changes are needed.\nHOW IS TPN GIVEN?\nAn IV line is often placed in a vein in the baby's hand, foot, or scalp. A large vein in the belly button (umbilical vein) may be used. Sometimes a longer IV, called a central line or\nperipherally-inserted central catheter\n(PICC) line, is used for long-term IV feedings.\nWHAT ARE THE RISKS?\nTPN is a major benefit for babies who cannot get nutrition in other ways. However, this type of feeding can result in abnormal levels of blood sugars, fats, or electrolytes.\nProblems can develop due to use of the TPN or IV lines. The line may move out of place or clots may form. A serious infection called sepsis is a possible complication of a central line IV."}

Infants who receive TPN will be closely monitored by the health care team.\nLong-term use of TPN may lead to liver problems.\nMany children on TPN will have frequent laboratory evaluations to check protein levels in the blood and monitor electrolytes, kidney and liver function.\nAlternative Names\nIV fluids - infants; TPN - infants; Intravenous fluids - infants; Hyperalimentation - infants\nImages\nIntravenous fluid sites\nReferences\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Committee on Nutrition.
