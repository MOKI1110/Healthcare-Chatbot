The two types are autosomal chromosomes and sex chromosomes. It also depends on whether the trait is dominant or recessive.\nA variation in a gene on one of the first 22 nonsex\nchromosomes\ncan lead to an autosomal disorder.\nGenes come in pairs. One gene in each pair comes from the egg, and the other gene comes from the sperm. Recessive inheritance means both genes in a pair must be abnormal to cause disease. People with only one variant gene in the pair are called carriers. These people are most often not affected with the condition."}

People with only one variant gene in the pair are called carriers. These people are most often not affected with the condition. However, they can pass the variant gene to their children.\nCHANCES OF INHERITING A TRAIT\nIf you are born to parents who both carry the same autosomal recessive gene, you have a 25% (1 in 4) chance of inheriting the variant gene from both parents and developing the disease. You have a 50% (1 in 2) chance of inheriting one variant gene. This would make you a carrier.\nIn other words, for a child born to a couple who both carry the variant gene (but do not have signs of disease), the expected outcome for each pregnancy is:\nA 25% chance that the child is born with two normal genes (healthy)\nA 50% chance that the child is born with one normal and one variant gene (carrier, without disease)\nA 25% chance that the child is born with two variant genes (at risk for the disease)\nNote: These outcomes do not mean that the children will definitely be carriers or be severely affected.\nAlternative Names\nGenetics - autosomal recessive; Inheritance - autosomal recessive\nImages\nAutosomal recessive\nReferen"}
