Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMethemoglobinemia\nMethemoglobinemia\nMethemoglobinemia (MetHb) is a blood disorder in which an abnormal amount of methemoglobin is produced. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells (RBCs) that carries and distributes oxygen to the body. Methemoglobin is a form of hemoglobin.\nWith methemoglobinemia, the hemoglobin can carry oxygen, but is not able to release it effectively to body tissues.\nCauses\nThe MetHb condition can be:\nPassed down through families (inherited or congenital)\nCaused by exposure to certain medicines, chemicals, or foods (acquired)\nThere are two forms of inherited MetHb. The first form is passed on by both parents due to genetic variants in both. The parents usually do not have the condition themselves. They carry the gene that causes the condition."}

The first form is passed on by both parents due to genetic variants in both. The parents usually do not have the condition themselves. They carry the gene that causes the condition. It occurs when there is a problem with an enzyme called\ncytochrome b5 reductase\n.\nThere are two types of inherited MetHb:\nType 1 (also called erythrocyte reductase deficiency) occurs when RBCs lack the enzyme.\nType 2 (also called generalized reductase deficiency) occurs when the enzyme doesn't work in the body.\nThe second form of inherited MetHb is called hemoglobin M disease. It is caused by defects in the hemoglobin protein itself. Only one parent needs to pass on the variant gene for the child to inherit the disease.\nAcquired MetHb\nis more common than the inherited forms."}

Tests may include:\nChecking the oxygen level in the blood (pulse oximetry)\nBlood test to check levels of gases in the blood (\narterial blood gas analysis\n)\nTreatment\nPeople with hemoglobin M disease don't have symptoms. So, they may not need treatment.\nA medicine called methylene blue is used to treat severe MetHb. Methylene blue may be unsafe in people who have or may be at risk for a blood disease called\nG6PD deficiency\n. They should not take this medicine. If you or your child has G6PD deficiency, always tell your provider before getting treatment.\nAscorbic acid\nmay also be used to reduce the level of methemoglobin.\nAlternative treatments include\nhyperbaric oxygen therapy\n, red blood cell transfusion and\nexchange transfusions\n.\nIn most cases of mild acquired MetHb, no treatment is needed.

It often causes death within the first few years of life.\nPeople with acquired MetHb often do very well once the medicine, food, or chemical that caused the problem is identified and avoided.\nPossible Complications\nComplications of MetHb include:\nShock\nSeizures\nDeath\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you:\nHave a family history of MetHb\nDevelop symptoms of this disorder\nCall 911 or the local emergency number right away if you have severe\nshortness of breath\n.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling\nis suggested for couples with a family history of MetHb and are considering having children.\nBabies 6 months or younger are more likely to develop methemoglobinemia."}
