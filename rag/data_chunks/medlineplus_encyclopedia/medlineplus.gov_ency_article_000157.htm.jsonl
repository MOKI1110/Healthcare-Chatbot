Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAtrial septal defect (ASD)\nAtrial septal defect (ASD)\nAtrial septal defect (ASD) is a heart defect that is present at birth (congenital).\nAs a baby develops in the womb, a wall (septum) forms that divides the upper chamber into a left and right atrium. When this wall does not form correctly, it can result in a defect that remains after birth. This is called an atrial septal defect, or ASD.\nCauses\nNormally, blood cannot flow between the two upper heart chambers. However, an ASD allows this to happen.\nWhen blood flows between the two heart chambers, this is called a shunt. Blood most often flows from the left to the right side. When this happens the right side of the heart enlarges. Over time pressure in the lungs may build up. When this happens, the blood flowing through the defect will then go from right to left."}

When this happens the right side of the heart enlarges. Over time pressure in the lungs may build up. When this happens, the blood flowing through the defect will then go from right to left. If this occurs, there will be less oxygen in the blood that goes to the body.\nAtrial septal defects are defined as primum or secundum.\nThe primum defects are linked to other heart defects of the\nventricular septum\nand\nmitral valve\n.\nSecundum defects can be a single, small or large hole. They may also be more than one small hole in the septum or wall between the two chambers.\nVery small defects (less than 5 millimeters or  ¼ inch) are less likely to cause problems. Smaller defects are often discovered much later in life than larger ones.\nAlong with the size of the ASD, where the defect is located plays a role that affects blood flow and oxygen levels. The presence of other heart defects is also important.\nASD is not very common.\nSymptoms\nA person with no other heart defect, or a small defect (less than 5 millimeters) may not have any symptoms, or symptoms may not occur until middle age or later.\nSymptoms that do occur may begin at any time after birth through childhood."}

A murmur may be heard only in certain body positions. Sometimes, a murmur may not be heard at all. A murmur means that blood is not flowing through the heart smoothly.\nThe physical exam may also show signs of\nheart failure\nin some adults.\nAn\nechocardiogram\nis a test that uses sound waves to create a moving picture of the heart.

Some people with ASDs may be able to have this procedure, depending on the size and location of the defect.\nThe procedure involves placing an ASD closure device into the heart through tubes called catheters.\nThe provider makes a tiny cut in the groin, then inserts the catheters into a blood vessel and up into the heart.\nThe closure device is then placed across the ASD and the defect is closed.\nSometimes,\nopen-heart surgery\nmay be needed to repair the defect. This type of surgery is more likely needed when other heart defects are present.\nPeople who have a repair to close an ASD should get antibiotics before any dental procedures they have in the period following the procedure. Antibiotics are not needed later on.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn infants, small ASDs (less than 5 mm) will often not cause problems, or will close without treatment."}

These may include a leaky valve or a hole in another area of the heart.\nPossible Complications\nPeople with a larger or more complicated ASD are at an increased risk for developing other problems, including:\nAbnormal heart rhythms\n, particularly atrial fibrillation\nHeart failure\nHeart infection (endocarditis)\nHigh blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs\nStroke\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of an atrial septal defect.\nPrevention\nThere is no known way to prevent the defect."}
