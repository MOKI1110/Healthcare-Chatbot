Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nProstate biopsy\nProstate biopsy\nA prostate biopsy is the removal of tiny samples of prostate tissue to examine it for signs of prostate cancer.\nThe prostate is a small, walnut-sized gland just under the bladder in men. It wraps around the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body. The prostate makes semen, the fluid that carries sperm.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThere are three main ways to perform a prostate biopsy.\nTransrectal\n-- through the rectum. This is the most common method.\nYou will be asked to lie still on your side with your knees bent.\nYour health care provider will insert a finger-sized ultrasound probe into your rectum. You may feel a little discomfort or pressure.\nThe ultrasound allows your provider to see images of the prostate. Using these images, your provider will inject a numbing medicine around the prostate.\nThen, using ultrasound to guide the biopsy needle, your provider will insert the needle into the prostate to take a sample. This may cause a brief stinging sensation.\nAbout 10 to 18 samples will be taken."}

They will be sent to the lab for examination.\nThe entire procedure will take about 10 minutes.\nTransperineal\n-- through the perineum (the skin between the anus and the scrotum), is being used more frequently.\nYou will receive medicine to make you sleepy so you do not feel pain.\nYour provider will insert an ultrasound probe into your rectum to image the prostate.\nA needle is inserted into the perineum to collect prostate tissue.\nA transperineal biopsy may reduce the risk of infection while maintaining similar cancer detection.\nTransurethral\n-- through the urethra, not used very often.\nYou will receive medicine to make you sleepy so you do not feel pain.\nA flexible tube with a camera on the end (\ncystoscope\n) is inserted through the opening of the urethra at the tip of the penis.\nTissue samples are gathered from the prostate through the scope.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider will inform you about the risks and benefits of the biopsy."}

You may have to sign a consent form.\nSeveral days before the biopsy, your provider may tell you to stop taking any:\nBlood thinning medicines (anticoagulants) such as warfarin, (Coumadin, Jantoven), clopidogrel (Plavix), apixaban (Eliquis), dabigatran (Pradaxa), edoxaban (Savaysa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), or aspirin\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen\nHerbal supplements\nVitamins\nContinue to take any prescription medicines unless your provider tells you not to take them.\nYour provider may ask you to:\nEat only light meals the day before the biopsy.\nDo an enema at home before the procedure to cleanse your rectum.\nTake antibiotics the day before, the day of, and the day after your biopsy.\nHow the Test will Feel\nDuring the procedure you may feel:\nMild discomfort while the probe is inserted\nA brief sting when a sample is taken with the biopsy needle\nAfter the procedure, you may have:\nSoreness in your rectum\nSmall amounts of blood in your stools, urine,"}

Be sure you take the full dose as directed.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA biopsy is done to check for prostate cancer.\nYour provider may recommend a prostate biopsy if:\nA blood test shows that you have a higher than normal prostate specific antigen (PSA) level\nYour provider discovers a lump or abnormality in your prostate during a digital rectal exam\nNormal Results\nNormal results from the biopsy suggest that no cancer cells have been found.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA positive biopsy result means that cancer cells have been found. The lab will give the cells a grade called a\nGleason score\n. This helps predict how fast the cancer will grow. Your provider will talk to you about your treatment options.\nThe biopsy may also show cells that look abnormal, but may or may not be cancer."}
