These include bacteria and fungi. While most germs are harmless, some can cause infection under certain conditions.\nThrush occurs in children and adults when conditions permit too much growth of a fungus called candida in your mouth. A small amount of this fungus normally lives in your mouth. It is most often kept in check by your immune system and other germs that also live in your mouth.\nWhen your immune system is weak or when normal bacteria die, too much of the fungus can overgrow and cause thrush.\nYou are more likely to get thrush if you have one of the following:\nYou are in poor health.\nYou are very old."}

The sores are easy to recognize.\nTo confirm you have thrush, your provider may:\nTake a sample of a\nmouth sore\nby gently scraping it.\nExamine mouth scrapings under a microscope.\nIn severe cases, thrush can grow in your esophagus as well. The esophagus is the tube that connects your mouth to your stomach. If this occurs or is suspected, your provider may:\nTake a\nthroat culture\nto see what germs are causing your thrush.\nExamine your esophagus and stomach with a flexible, lighted scope with a camera on the end.\nTreatment\nIf you get mild thrush after taking antibiotics, eat yogurt or take over-the-counter acidophilus pills. This may help restore a healthy balance of germs in your mouth.\nFor a more severe case of thrush, your provider may prescribe:\nAntifungal mouthwash (nystatin).\nLozenges (clotrimazole).\nAntifungal medicines taken as a pill or syrup, these medicines include fluconazole (Diflucan) or itraconazole (Sporanox).\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nOral thrush can be cured."}
