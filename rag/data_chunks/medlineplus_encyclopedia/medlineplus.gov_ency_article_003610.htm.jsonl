There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nCreatinine is a chemical waste product of creatine. Creatine is a chemical the body makes to supply energy, mainly to muscles.\nThis test is done to see how well your kidneys work. Creatinine is removed by the body entirely by the kidneys. If kidney function is not normal, the creatinine level in your urine decreases.\nThis test can be used for the following:\nTo evaluate how well the kidneys are working\nAs part of the\ncreatinine clearance\ntest\nTo provide information on other chemicals in the urine, such as albumin or protein\nNormal Results\nUrine creatinine (24-hour urine collection) values can range from 500 to 2000 mg/day (4,420 to 17,680 mmol/day). Results depend on your age and amount of lean body mass.\nAnother way of expressing the normal range for test results is:\n14 to 26 mg per kg of body mass per day for men (123.8 to 229.8  µmol/kg/day)\n11 to 20 mg per kg of body mass per day for women (97.2 to 176.8  µmol/kg/day)\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}

Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results of urine creatinine may be due to any of the following:\nHigh meat diet\nKidney problems, such as\ndamage to the tubule cells\nKidney failure\nToo little blood flow to the kidneys, causing\ndamage to filtering units\nKidney infection (pyelonephritis)\nMuscle breakdown\n(rhabdomyolysis), or\nloss of muscle tissue\n(myasthenia gravis)\nUrinary tract obstruction\nRisks\nThere are no risks with this test.\nAlternative Names\nUrine creatinine test\nImages\nFemale urinary tract\nMale urinary tract\nCreatinine tests\nCreatinine urine test\nReferences\nLandry DW, Gharavi AG.
