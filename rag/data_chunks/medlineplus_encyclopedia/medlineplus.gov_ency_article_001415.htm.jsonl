It occurs more often in the first year of life and decreases with age. The very young and older adults are more likely to have a severe case.\nEncephalitis is most often caused by a virus. Many types of viruses may cause it. Exposure can occur through:\nBreathing in droplets from the nose, mouth, or throat from an infected person\nContaminated food or drink\nMosquito, tick, and other insect bites\nSkin contact\nDifferent viruses occur in different geographic locations."}

Many cases occur during a certain season.\nEncephalitis caused by the herpes simplex virus is the leading cause of more severe cases in all ages, including newborns.\nRoutine vaccination has greatly reduced encephalitis due to some viruses, including:\nMeasles\nMumps\nPolio\nRabies\nRubella\nVaricella\n(chickenpox)\nOther viruses that cause encephalitis include:\nAdenovirus\nCoxsackievirus\nCytomegalovirus\nEastern equine encephalitis virus\nEchovirus\nJapanese encephalitis, which occurs in Asia\nWest Nile virus\nAfter the virus enters the body, the brain tissue swells."}
