This makes it easier to see the structures of your organs on the x-rays.\nBefore the x-rays are taken, you must drink 16 to 20 ounces (480 to 600 milliliters) of a milkshake-like drink. The drink contains a substance called barium, which shows up well on x-rays.\nAn x-ray method called fluoroscopy tracks how the barium moves through your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine."}

The drink contains a substance called barium, which shows up well on x-rays.\nAn x-ray method called fluoroscopy tracks how the barium moves through your esophagus, stomach, and small intestine. Pictures are taken while you sit or stand in different positions.\nThe test most often takes around 3 hours but can take as long as 6 hours to complete.\nA GI series may include this test or a barium enema.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may have to change your diet for 2 or 3 days before the test. In most cases, you will not be able to eat for a period of time before the test.\nBe sure to ask your health care provider if you need to change how you take any of your medicines. Often you can continue taking the medicines you take by mouth. Never make any changes in your medicines without first talking to your provider.\nYou will be asked to remove all jewelry on your neck, chest, or abdomen before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThis test may cause mild bloating but no discomfort most of the time."}

The barium milkshake feels chalky as you drink it.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to look for a problem in the structure or function of your esophagus, stomach, or small intestine.\nNormal Results\nA normal result shows that the esophagus, stomach, and small intestine are normal in size, shape, and movement.\nA normal result may vary depending on your overall health. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results in the esophagus may indicate the following problems:\nAchalasia\nDiverticula\nEsophageal cancer\nEsophageal narrowing (stricture) - benign\nHiatal hernia\nUlcers\nAbnormal results in the stomach may indicate the following problems:\nGastric cancer\nGastric ulcer\n- benign\nGastritis\nPolyps (a tumor that is usually noncancerous and grows on the\nmucus membrane\n)\nPyloric stenosis\n(narrowing)\nAbnormal results in the small intestine may indicate the following problems:\nDiverticulosis\nMalabsorption syndrome"}

X-rays are monitored and regulated to provide the minimum amount of radiation exposure needed to produce the image. Most experts feel that the risk is low compared with the benefits.\nPregnant women should not have this test in most cases. Children are more sensitive to the risks for x-rays.\nBarium may cause constipation. Talk to your provider if the barium has not passed through your system by 2 or 3 days after the exam.\nConsiderations\nAfter this test, the barium that remains in the body may block details in other imaging tests."}
