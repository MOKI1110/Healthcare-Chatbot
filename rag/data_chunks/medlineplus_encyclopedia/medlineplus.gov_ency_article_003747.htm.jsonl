Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNasopharyngeal culture\nNasopharyngeal culture\nNasopharyngeal culture is a test that examines a sample of secretions from the uppermost part of the throat, behind the nose, to detect organisms that can cause disease.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will be asked to cough before the test begins and then tilt your head back. A sterile cotton-tipped swab is gently passed through a nostril and into your nasopharynx. This is the part of the pharynx that covers the roof of the mouth. The swab is quickly rotated and removed. The sample is sent to a laboratory. There, it is placed in a special dish (culture). It is then watched to see if bacteria, viruses, or other disease-causing organisms grow.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may have slight discomfort and may gag.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test identifies viruses and bacteria that cause upper respiratory tract symptoms."}
