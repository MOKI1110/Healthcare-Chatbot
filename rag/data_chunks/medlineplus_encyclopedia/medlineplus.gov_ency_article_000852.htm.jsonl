Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAcanthosis nigricans\nAcanthosis nigricans\nAcanthosis nigricans (AN) is a skin disorder in which there is darker, thick, velvety skin in body folds and creases.\nCauses\nAN can affect otherwise healthy people. It can also be related to medical problems, such as:\nGenetic disorders, including\nDown syndrome\nand\nAlstrÃ¶m syndrome\nHormone imbalances that occur in\ndiabetes\nand\nobesity\n, often called insulin resistance\nCancer, such as cancer of the digestive system, liver, kidney, bladder, or lymphoma\nSome medicines, including hormones such as human growth hormone or birth control pills\nSymptoms\nAN usually appears slowly and doesn't cause any symptoms other than skin changes.\nEventually, dark, velvety skin with very visible markings and creases appears in the armpits, groin and neck folds, and over the joints of the fingers and toes.\nSometimes, the lips, palms, soles of the feet, or other areas are affected. These symptoms are more common in people with cancer.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can usually diagnose AN by looking at your skin."}

These symptoms are more common in people with cancer.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can usually diagnose AN by looking at your skin. A\nskin biopsy\nmay be needed in rare cases.\nIf there is no clear cause of AN, your provider may order tests. These may include:\nBlood tests to check blood sugar level or insulin level\nEndoscopy\nX-rays\nTreatment\nNo treatment is needed, as AN only causes a change in skin color. If the condition is affecting your appearance, using moisturizers containing ammonium lactate, tretinoin, or hydroquinone can help lighten the skin. Your provider may also suggest laser treatment.\nIt is important to treat any underlying medical problem that may be causing these skin changes. When AN is related to obesity, losing weight often improves the condition.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAN often disappears if the cause can be found and treated.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop areas of thick, dark, velvety skin.\nAlternative Names\nAN; Skin pigment disorder - acanthosis nigricans\nImages\nAcanthosis nigricans - close-up\nAcanthosis nigricans on the hand\nReferences\nDinulos JGH."}
