Red blood cells provide oxygen to the body's tissues.\nRed blood cells last for about 120 days before the body gets rid of them. In hemolytic anemia, red blood cells in the blood are destroyed earlier than normal.\nImmune hemolytic\nanemia\noccurs when antibodies form against the body's own red blood cells and destroy them. This happens because the immune system mistakenly recognizes these blood cells as foreign.\nCauses\nPossible causes include:\nCertain chemicals, medicines, and toxins\nInfections\nTransfusion of blood from a donor with a blood type that does not match\nCertain cancers\nWhen\nantibodies\nform against red blood cells for no reason, the condition is called idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia.\nThe antibodies may also be caused by:\nA complication of another disease\nPast blood transfusions\nPregnancy (if the baby's blood type is different from the mother's)\nRisk factors are related to the causes.\nSymptoms\nYou may not"}

If a steroid medicine does not improve the condition, treatment with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) or removal of the spleen (splenectomy) may be considered.\nYou may receive treatment to suppress your immune system if you do not respond to steroids. Medicines such as azathioprine (Imuran), cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan), and rituximab (Rituxan) have been used.\nBlood transfusions are given with caution, because the blood may not be compatible and it may cause more red blood cell destruction.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe disease may start quickly and be very serious, or it may stay mild and not need special treatment.\nIn most people, steroids or splenectomy can totally or partially control anemia.\nPossible Complications\nSevere anemia rarely leads to death. Severe infection may occur as a complication of treatment with steroids, other medicines that suppress the immune system, or splenectomy."}
