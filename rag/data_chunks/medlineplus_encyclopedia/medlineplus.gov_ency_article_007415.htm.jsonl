Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nProstate resection - minimally invasive\nProstate resection - minimally invasive\nMinimally invasive prostate resection is surgery to remove part of the prostate gland, to treat an\nenlarged prostate\n. The surgery will improve the flow of urine through the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder outside of your body. It can be done in different ways. There is no incision (cut) in your skin.\nDescription\nThese procedures are often done in your surgeon's office or at a surgery center.\nThe surgery can be done in many ways. The type of surgery will depend on the size of your prostate and what caused it to grow. Your surgeon will consider the size of your prostate, how healthy you are, and what type of surgery you may want.\nAll of these procedures are done by passing an instrument through the opening in your penis (meatus). You will be given\ngeneral anesthesia\n(asleep and pain-free),\nspinal or epidural anesthesia\n(awake but pain-free), or local anesthesia and sedation."}

You will be given\ngeneral anesthesia\n(asleep and pain-free),\nspinal or epidural anesthesia\n(awake but pain-free), or local anesthesia and sedation. Choices are:\nLaser prostatectomy (laser TURP):\nThis procedure takes about 1 to 2 hours. The laser destroys prostate tissue that blocks the opening of the urethra. You will probably go home the same day. You will need a\nFoley catheter\nplaced in your bladder to help drain urine for a few days after surgery.\nTransurethral incision (TUIP):\nYour surgeon makes small surgical cuts where the prostate meets your bladder. This makes the urethra wider. This procedure takes 20 to 30 minutes. Many men can go home the same day. Full recovery can take 2 to 3 weeks. You may go home with a catheter in your bladder.\nTransurethral electrovaporization (TUVP):\nA tool or instrument delivers a strong electric current to destroy prostate tissue. You will have a catheter placed in your bladder."}

You will have a catheter placed in your bladder. It may be removed within hours after the procedure or you may go home with it.\nPhotoselective vaporization (PVP):\nA high-powered green-light laser is used to vaporize and remove excess prostate tissue with very little loss of blood. You may need a Foley catheter placed in your bladder to help drain urine for a few days after surgery.\nProstatic urethral lift (PUL):\nSmall implants are placed in the prostate lobes to compress the prostate tissue.\nTransurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT):\nTUMT delivers heat using microwave pulses to destroy prostate tissue. Your doctor will insert the microwave antenna through your urethra. You may need a Foley catheter placed in your bladder to help drain urine after surgery for 3 to 5 days.\nWater vapor thermal therapy (WVTT):\nThis procedure releases sterile water vapor (steam) into the prostate to remove extra tissue."}

High-frequency sound waves (\nultrasound\n) heat the needles and prostate tissue. You may need a Foley catheter placed in your bladder to help drain urine after surgery for 3 to 5 days.\nProstate water jet treatment (Aquablation)\n: Miniature high pressure water jets are used to remove portions of an enlarged prostate.

You may also get\nurinary tract infections\n. Removing all, or part, of the prostate gland can make these symptoms better.
