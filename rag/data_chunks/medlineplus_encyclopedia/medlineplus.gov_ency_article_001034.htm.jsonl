Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMastoiditis\nMastoiditis\nMastoiditis is an infection of the mastoid bone of the skull. The mastoid bone is located just behind the ear.\nCauses\nMastoiditis is most often caused by a middle ear infection (\nacute otitis media\n). The infection may spread from the ear to the mastoid bone. This bone has a honeycomb-like structure that fills with infected material and may break down.\nThe condition is most common in children. Before antibiotics, mastoiditis was one of the leading causes of death in children. The condition does not occur very often today. It is also much less dangerous.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nDrainage from the ear\nEar pain or discomfort\nFever, may be high or suddenly increase\nHeadache\nHearing loss\nRedness of the ear or behind the ear\nSwelling behind the ear, may cause ear to stick out or feel as if it is filled with fluid\nExams and Tests\nAn exam of the head may reveal signs of mastoiditis."}

The following tests may show an abnormality of the mastoid bone:\nCT scan\nof the ear\nHead CT scan\nHead MRI scan\nA culture of drainage from the ear may show bacteria.\nTreatment\nMastoiditis may be hard to treat because the medicine may not reach deeply into the bone. The condition sometimes requires repeated or long-term treatment. The infection is treated with antibiotic injections, followed by antibiotics taken by mouth.\nSurgery to remove part of the bone and drain the mastoid (\nmastoidectomy\n) may be needed if antibiotic treatment does not work. Surgery to drain the middle ear through the eardrum (\nmyringotomy\n) may be needed to treat the middle ear infection.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMastoiditis can be cured."}
