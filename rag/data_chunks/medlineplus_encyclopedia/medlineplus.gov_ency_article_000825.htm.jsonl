Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCarbuncle\nCarbuncle\nA carbuncle is a skin infection that often involves a group of hair follicles. The infected material forms a lump, which occurs deep in the skin and often contains pus.\nWhen a person has many carbuncles, the condition is called carbunculosis.\nCauses\nMost carbuncles are caused by the bacteria\nStaphylococcus aureus\n(\nS aureus\n).\nA carbuncle is a cluster of several skin boils (\nfuruncles\n). The infected mass is filled with fluid, pus, and dead tissue. Fluid may drain out of the carbuncle, but sometimes the mass is so deep that it cannot drain on its own.\nCarbuncles can develop anywhere. But they are most common on the back and the nape of the neck. Men get carbuncles more often than women.\nThe bacteria that cause this condition spread easily. So, family members may develop carbuncles at the same time."}

Often, the cause of a carbuncle cannot be determined.\nYou are more likely to get a carbuncle if you have:\nFriction from clothing or shaving\nPoor hygiene\nPoor overall health\nPeople with diabetes, dermatitis, and a weakened immune system are more likely to develop staph infections that can cause carbuncles.\nStaph bacteria are sometimes found in the nose or around the genitals. Carbuncles can recur when antibiotics are not able to treat the bacteria in those areas.\nSymptoms\nA carbuncle is a swollen lump or mass under the skin. It may be the size of a pea or as large as a golf ball. The carbuncle may be red and irritated and might hurt when you touch it.\nA carbuncle usually:\nDevelops over several days\nHave a white or yellow center (contains pus)\nWeep, ooze, or crust\nSpread to other skin areas\nSometimes, other symptoms may occur."}

The diagnosis is based on what the skin looks like. A sample of the pus may be sent to a lab to determine the bacteria causing the infection (bacterial culture). The test result helps your provider determine the appropriate treatment.\nTreatment\nCarbuncles usually must drain before they will heal. This most often occurs on its own in less than 2 weeks.\nPlacing a warm moist cloth on the carbuncle helps it to drain, which speeds healing. Apply a clean, warm moist cloth several times each day."}
