It is passed down through families as an\nautosomal dominant\ntrait. That means you only need to get the abnormal gene from one parent in order for you to inherit the disease.\nCleidocranial dysostosis is a congenital condition, which means it is present from before birth. The condition affects girls and boys equally.\nSymptoms\nPeople with cleidocranial dysostosis have a jaw and brow area that sticks out. The middle of their nose (nasal bridge) is wide.\nThe collar bones may be missing or abnormally developed. This pushes the shoulders together in front of the body.\nPrimary teeth do not fall out at the expected time. Adult teeth may develop later than normal and an extra set of adult teeth grow in."}

The provider will do a physical examination and may do series of x-rays to check for:\nUndergrowth of the collarbone\nUndergrowth of the shoulder blade\nFailure of the area in the front of the pelvis bone to close\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for it and management depends on each person's symptoms."}
