Melanin is a natural substance in the body that gives color to your hair, skin, and iris of the eye.\nCauses\nAlbinism occurs when one of several genetic changes makes the body unable to produce or distribute\nmelanin\n.\nThese changes may be passed down (inherited) through families.\nThe most severe form of albinism is called oculocutaneous albinism. People with this type of albinism have white or pink hair, skin, and iris color. They also have vision problems.\nAnother type of albinism, called ocular albinism type 1 (OA1), affects only the eyes. The person's skin and eye color are usually in the normal range. However, an eye exam will show that there is no coloring in the back of the eye (retina).\nHermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a form of albinism caused by a change to a single gene."}

It can occur with a bleeding disorder, as well as with lung, kidney, and bowel diseases.\nSymptoms\nA person with albinism may have one of these symptoms:\nNo color in the hair, skin, or iris of the eye\nLighter than normal skin and hair\nPatches of missing skin color\nMany forms of albinism are associated with the following symptoms:\nCrossed eyes\nLight sensitivity\nRapid eye movements\nVision problems, or functional\nblindness\nExams and Tests\nGenetic testing offers the most accurate way to diagnose the specific type of albinism. Such testing is helpful if you have a family history of albinism. It is also useful for certain groups of people who are known to get the disease.\nYour health care provider may also diagnose the condition based on the appearance of your skin, hair, and eyes. An eye doctor called an ophthalmologist may perform an\nelectroretinogram\n. This is a test that can reveal vision problems related to albinism."}

A test called a visual evoked potentials test can be very useful when the diagnosis is uncertain.\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms. It will depend on how severe the disorder is.\nTreatment involves protecting the skin and eyes from the sun. To do this:\nReduce sunburn risk by avoiding the sun, using sunscreen, and covering up completely with clothing when exposed to the sun.\nUse sunscreen with  a high sun protection factor (SPF).\nWear sunglasses (UV protected)  to help  relieve light sensitivity.\nGlasses are often prescribed to correct vision problems and eye position. Eye muscle surgery is sometimes recommended to correct abnormal eye movements.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with albinism and their families can be found at:\nNational Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation --\nwww.albinism.org\nNational Library of Medicine - MedlinePlus website.

However, the HPS form of albinism can shorten a person's lifespan due to lung disease or bleeding problems.\nPeople with albinism may be limited in their outdoor activities because they can't tolerate the sun.\nPossible Complications\nThese complications can occur:\nDecreased vision, blindness\nSkin cancer\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have albinism or symptoms such as light sensitivity that cause discomfort. Also contact your provider if you notice any skin changes that might be an early sign of skin cancer.\nPrevention\nBecause albinism is inherited, genetic counseling is important. People with a family history of albinism or\nvery light coloring\nshould consider genetic counseling.\nAlternative Names\nOculocutaneous albinism; Ocular albinism\nImages\nMelanin\nReferences\nJoyce JC.
