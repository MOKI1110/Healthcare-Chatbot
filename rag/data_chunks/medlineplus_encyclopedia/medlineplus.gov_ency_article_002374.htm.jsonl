It destroys foreign substances to protect the body from infection.\nInformation\nMacrophages do not travel through the blood. Instead, they remain in one part of the body.\nMacrophages are found in many organs and tissues, including the:\nBrain\nBreast tissue\nLiver\nLung\nLymph nodes\nPlacenta\nSpleen\nTonsils\nMacrophages quickly recognize infectious material (pathogens), and are an important first line of defense for the immune system. Macrophages take in viruses and bacteria, present them to other cells of the immune system (T and B cells) and activate the inflammatory response.\nIn people with a disease called Langerhans cell histiocytosis (previously called\nhistiocytosis X\n), there is an excess of macrophages and other white blood cells in some bodily tissues.\nAlternative Names\nMacrophage\nReferences\nCrow MK.
