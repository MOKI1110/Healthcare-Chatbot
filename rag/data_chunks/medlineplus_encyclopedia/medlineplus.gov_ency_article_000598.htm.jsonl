The bacteria may enter the body through wounds or by eating improperly canned or preserved food.\nCauses\nClostridium botulinum\nare found in soil and untreated water throughout the world. The bacteria produce protective\nspores\nto help them survive. In certain conditions, such as improperly preserved or canned food, these spores can grow and produce a toxin. When eaten, even tiny amounts of this toxin can lead to severe poisoning.\nFoods that can be contaminated include:\nHome-canned vegetables\nCured pork and ham\nSmoked or raw fish\nHoney or corn syrup\nBaked potatoes cooked in foil\nCarrot juice\nChopped garlic in oil\nInfant botulism occurs when a baby eats\nClostridium botulinum\nspores and the bacteria grow in the baby's intestines. The most common cause of\ninfant botulism\nis eating honey or corn syrup or using pacifiers that have been coated with honey.\nClostridium botulinum\ncan be found normally in the stool of some infants."}

The most common cause of\ninfant botulism\nis eating honey or corn syrup or using pacifiers that have been coated with honey.\nClostridium botulinum\ncan be found normally in the stool of some infants. Infants develop botulism when the bacteria grow in their gut.\nBotulism may also occur if the bacteria enter open wounds and produce toxins there.\nAbout 110 cases of botulism are reported in the United States each year. Most of the cases are in infants.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms often appear 8 to 36 hours after you eat food contaminated with the toxin. There is no fever with this infection.\nIn adults, symptoms may include:\nAbdominal cramps\nBreathing difficulty\nthat may lead to respiratory failure\nDifficulty swallowing and speaking\nDouble vision\nNausea\nVomiting\nWeakness with paralysis (equal on both sides of the body)\nSymptoms in infants may include:\nConstipation\nDrooling\nPoor feeding and weak sucking\nRespiratory distress\nWeak cry\nWeakness, loss of muscle tone\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

A\nstool culture\nmay also be ordered. Lab tests can be done on the suspected food to confirm botulism.\nTreatment\nYou will need medicine to fight the toxin produced by the bacteria. The medicine is called botulism antitoxin.\nYou will have to stay in the hospital if you have breathing trouble. A tube may be inserted through the nose or mouth into the windpipe to provide an airway for oxygen. You may need a breathing machine.\nPeople who have trouble swallowing may be given fluids through a vein (by IV)."}

A feeding tube may be inserted.\nProviders must tell state health authorities or the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention about people with botulism, so that the contaminated food is removed from stores.\nSome people are given antibiotics, but they may not always help.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPrompt treatment greatly reduces the risk for death.\nPossible Complications\nHealth problems that may result from botulism include:\nAspiration pneumonia\nand infection\nLong-lasting weakness\nNervous system problems for up to 1 year\nRespiratory distress\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nGo to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you suspect botulism.\nPrevention\nNEVER give honey or corn syrup to infants younger than 1 year old. Never give even just a little taste on a pacifier.\nHelp prevent infant botulism by breastfeeding only, if possible.\nAlways throw away bulging cans or foul-smelling preserved foods."}

Sterilize home-canned foods by pressure cooking them at 250 °F (121 °C) for 30 minutes. This can reduce the risk for botulism.\nSee the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website for more information on home canning safety at\nwww.cdc.gov/botulism/prevention/home-canned-foods.html\n.\nKeep foil-wrapped baked potatoes hot or in the refrigerator. Do not store at room temperature. Carrot juice and oils with garlic or other herbs should also be refrigerated.
