This leaves you with fewer healthy blood cells in your body. The blood cells that have matured may not function properly.\nMyelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a form of cancer. In about a third of people, MDS may develop into\nacute myeloid leukemia\n(AML).\nCauses\nStem cells in bone marrow form different types of blood cells. With MDS, the DNA in stem cells becomes damaged. Because the DNA is damaged, the stem cells cannot produce healthy blood cells.\nThe exact cause of MDS is not known. For most cases, there is no known cause.\nRisk factors for MDS include:\nCertain genetic disorders\nExposure to environmental or industrial chemicals, fertilizers, pesticides, solvents, or heavy metals\nSmoking\nPrior cancer treatment increases the risk for MDS. This is called secondary or treatment-related MDS.\nCertain chemotherapy medicines increase the chance of developing MDS."}

This is called secondary or treatment-related MDS.\nCertain chemotherapy medicines increase the chance of developing MDS. This is a major risk factor.\nRadiation therapy, when used with chemotherapy, increases the risk for MDS even more.\nPeople who have stem cell transplants may develop MDS because they also receive high doses of chemotherapy.\nMDS usually occurs in adults age 60 years and older. It is more common in men.\nWatch this video about:\nRed blood cell production\nSymptoms\nEarly stage MDS often has no symptoms. MDS is often discovered during other blood tests.\nPeople with very low blood counts often experience symptoms. Symptoms depend on the type of blood cell affected, and they include:\nWeakness or tiredness due to anemia\nShortness of breath\nEasy bruising and bleeding\nSmall red or purple pinpoint dots under the skin caused by bleeding\nFrequent infections and fever\nExams and Tests\nPeople with MDS have a shortage of blood cells. MDS may reduce the number of one or more of these:\nRed blood cells\nWhite blood cells\nPlatelets\nThe shapes of these cells may also be changed."}

Your health care provider will perform a\ncomplete blood count\nand\nblood smear\nto find which type of blood cells have been affected.\nOther tests that may be performed are:\nBone marrow aspiration and biopsy\n.\nCytochemistry, flow cytometry, immunocytochemistry, and immunophenotyping tests are used to identify and classify specific types of MDS.\nCytogenetics and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) are used for genetic analysis. Cytogenetic testing can detect translocations and other genetic abnormalities. FISH is used to identify specific changes within chromosomes. Genetic variations identified by next generation sequencing may help determine the response to treatment.\nSome of these tests will help your provider determine what type of MDS you have."}
