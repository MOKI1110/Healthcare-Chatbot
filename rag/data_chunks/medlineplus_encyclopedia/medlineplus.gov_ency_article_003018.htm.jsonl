An awake craniotomy is done when your surgeon works near critical areas of your brain, such as the language area.\nBefore surgery, the hair on part of the scalp is shaved and the skin is cleaned. The surgeon makes a cut through the scalp to expose the bone (skull). The location of this cut depends on where the problem in the brain is located.\nThe surgeon uses a high-speed drill and saw to cut a portion of the bone (a bone flap) to access the brain.\nIn some cases, the surgeon may create a smaller incision and use a tube equipped with a light and camera, known as an endoscope. The surgery is done by inserting tools through the endoscope."}

The surgery is done by inserting tools through the endoscope. A computerized navigation system that generates 3D images from an\nMRI\nor\nCT\nscan of your brain helps the surgeon locate the specific area to be operated on.\nDuring surgery, your surgeon may:\nClip off an\naneurysm\nto prevent bleeding\nRemove abnormal blood vessels\nRemove a\ntumor\nor a piece of tumor for a\nbiopsy\nRemove abnormal brain tissue\nDrain blood or an infection\nFree a nerve\nTake a sample of brain tissue to help diagnose nervous system diseases\nPut a tube (shunt) in the cavities of your brain to remove excess fluid\nThe bone flap is usually placed back at the end of the surgery, using small titanium plates to hold it in place. These plates are MRI compatible. This brain surgery is called a craniotomy.\nIf a smaller hole (burr hole) was made, your surgeon may cover it with a metal plate.\nThe bone flap may not be put back if your surgery involved a tumor or an infection, or if the brain was swollen. This brain surgery is called a craniectomy."}
