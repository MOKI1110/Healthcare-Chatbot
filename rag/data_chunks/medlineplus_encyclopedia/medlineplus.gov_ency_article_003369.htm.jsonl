Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCSF analysis\nCSF analysis\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is a group of lab tests that measure chemicals in the cerebrospinal fluid. CSF is a clear fluid that surrounds and protects the brain and spinal cord. The tests may look for cells, proteins, sugar (glucose), and other substances.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA sample of CSF is needed. A\nlumbar puncture\n, also called a spinal tap, is the most common way to collect this sample. Less common ways to take a fluid sample include:\nCisternal puncture\nRemoval of CSF from a tube that is already in the CSF, such as a shunt, ventricular drain, or pain pump\nVentricular puncture\nAfter the sample is taken, it is sent to the lab for evaluation.\nYour health care provider may ask you to lie flat for at least one hour after the lumbar puncture. You may develop a headache after the lumbar puncture. If it happens, fluids and drinking caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea or soda may help.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider will tell you how to prepare for the\nlumbar puncture\n."}

If it happens, fluids and drinking caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea or soda may help.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider will tell you how to prepare for the\nlumbar puncture\n. Make sure to let them know all of the medicines you are taking in case any adjustment to the procedure is needed. It is important to report any blood thinners, aspirin, or herbal medicines too.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nAnalysis of CSF can help detect certain conditions and diseases. All of the following can be, but are not always, measured in a sample of CSF:\nAntibodies to and DNA of common viruses\nBacteria (including that which causes syphilis, using a\nVDRL test\n)\nCell count\nChloride\nCryptococcal\nantigen\nGlucose\nGlutamine\nLactate dehydrogenase\nOligoclonal banding\nto look for specific proteins\nMyelin basic protein\nTotal protein\nWhether there are cancerous cells present (CSF cytology)\nOpening pressure\nNormal Results\nNormal results include:\nAntibodies and DNA of common viruses: None\nBacteria: No bacteria grows in a lab culture\nCancerous cells: No cancerous cells present\nCell count: 0 to 5 white blood cells (all mononuclear) and 0 red blood cells\nChloride: 115 to 130 mEq/L (115 to 130 mm"}
