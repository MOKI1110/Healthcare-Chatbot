Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nGiant congenital nevus\nGiant congenital nevus\nA congenital pigmented or melanocytic nevus is a dark-colored, often hairy, patch of skin. It is present at birth or appears in the first year of life.\nA giant congenital nevus is smaller in infants and children, but it usually continues to grow as the child grows. A giant pigmented nevus is larger than 15 inches (in) or 38.1 centimeters (cm) once it stops growing.\nCauses\nThese marks are thought to be caused by a localized increase in melanocytes as a baby grows in the womb. Melanocytes are the skin cells that produce melanin, which gives skin its color. A nevus has an increased amount of melanocytes.\nThe condition is thought to be caused by a variant gene.\nThe condition may occur with:\nOther nevi (moles)\nInvolvement of the membranes of the brain and spinal cord when the nevus affects a very large area\nSmaller congenital pigmented or melanocytic nevi are common in children and do not cause problems most of the time."}

A giant nevus on the spine may be linked to brain or spinal cord problems.\nYour provider will measure the dark skin area every year and may take pictures to check if the spot is getting larger.\nTreatment\nYou will need to have regular exams to check for skin cancer.\nSurgery to remove the nevus can be done for cosmetic reasons or if your provider thinks it may become skin cancer.\nSkin grafting\nis also done when needed. Larger nevi may need to be removed in several stages.\nLasers and\ndermabrasion\n(rubbing them off) can also be used to improve appearance. These treatments may not remove the whole birthmark, so it may be harder to detect skin cancer (\nmelanoma\n). Talk to your provider about the pros and cons of surgery for you.\nTreatment may be helpful if the birthmark causes emotional problems because of how it looks.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSkin cancer may develop in some people with large or giant nevi. The cancer risk is higher for nevi that are larger in size."}
