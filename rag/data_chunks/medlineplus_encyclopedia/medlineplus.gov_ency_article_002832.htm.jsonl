Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nInsecticide poisoning\nInsecticide poisoning\nInsecticide is any chemical that kills bugs. Insecticide poisoning occurs when someone swallows or breathes in an insecticide or it is absorbed through the skin.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\nPoisonous Ingredient\nMost household\nbug sprays\ncontain plant-derived chemicals called pyrethrins. These chemicals were originally isolated from chrysanthemum flowers and are generally not harmful. However, they can cause life-threatening breathing problems if they are breathed in.\nStronger insecticides, which a farm or commercial greenhouse might use or someone might store in their garage, contain many dangerous substances."}

The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery. Swallowing these poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body.\nIt is a good sign that recovery will occur if the person continues to improve in the first 4 to 6 hours after they receive treatment.\nAlthough the symptoms are the same for carbamate and organophosphate poisoning, it is harder to recover after organophosphate poisoning.\nAlternative Names\nOrganophosphate poisoning; Carbamate poisoning\nReferences\nRoberts DM, Bode M.
