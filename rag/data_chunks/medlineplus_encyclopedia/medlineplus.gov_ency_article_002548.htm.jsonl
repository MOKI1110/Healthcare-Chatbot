Surgery may be required if the esophagus, stomach or intestine have developed holes (perforation) from exposure to the acid.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well a person does depends on how rapidly the sodium bisulfate was diluted and neutralized. There is a good chance of recovery if proper treatment is given soon after the poison was swallowed. Without prompt treatment, extensive damage to the mouth, throat, eyes, lungs, esophagus, nose, and stomach are possible, depending on how exposure occurred. Perforations in the esophagus and stomach may result in serious infections in both the chest and abdominal cavities, which may result in death.\nDamage to the esophagus may occur as late as 2 to 3 weeks after swallowing the poison. Death may occur up to 1 month or longer after swallowing the poison. Those who recover may have continued stomach or esophagus problems, including cancer.\nReferences\nHoyte C. Caustics.
