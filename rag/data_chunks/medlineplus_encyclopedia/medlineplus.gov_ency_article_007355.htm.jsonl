Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPelvis MRI scan\nPelvis MRI scan\nA pelvis MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan is an imaging test that uses a machine with powerful magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the area between the hip bones. This part of the body is called the pelvic area.\nStructures inside and near the pelvis include the bladder, prostate and other male reproductive organs, female reproductive organs, lymph nodes, large bowel, small bowel, and pelvic bones.\nAn MRI does not use radiation. Single\nMRI\nimages are called slices. The images are stored on a computer or printed on film. One exam produces dozens or sometimes hundreds of images.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou may be asked to wear a hospital gown or clothing without metal fasteners. Certain types of metal can cause inaccurate images.\nYou will lie on your back on a narrow table. The table slides into the middle of the MRI machine.\nSmall devices, called coils, may be placed around your hip area. These devices help send and receive the radio waves. They also improve the quality of the images."}

These devices help send and receive the radio waves. They also improve the quality of the images. If pictures of the prostate and rectum are needed, a small coil may be placed into your rectum. This coil must stay in place for about 30 minutes while the images are taken.\nSome exams require a special dye, called contrast media. The dye is most often given before the test through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. The dye helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly.\nDuring the MRI, the person who operates the machine will watch you from another room. The test typically lasts 30 to 60 minutes, but may take longer.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan.\nTell your health care provider if you are afraid of close spaces (have claustrophobia). You may be given a medicine to help you relax and be less anxious."}

You may be given a medicine to help you relax and be less anxious. Or, your provider may suggest an open MRI, in which the machine is not as close to the body.\nBefore the test, tell your provider if you have:\nBrain aneurysm clips\nArtificial heart valves\nHeart defibrillator or pacemaker\nInner ear (cochlear) implants\nKidney disease or dialysis (you may not be able to receive contrast)\nRecently placed artificial joints\nVascular\nstents\nPain pumps\nWorked with sheet metal in the past (you may need tests to check for metal pieces in your eyes)\nBecause the MRI contains strong magnets, metal objects are not allowed into the room with the MRI scanner:\nPens, pocket knives, and eyeglasses may fly across the room.\nItems such as jewelry, watches, credit cards, and hearing aids can be damaged.\nPins, hairpins, metal zippers, and similar metallic items can distort the images.\nRemovable dental work should be taken out just before the scan.\nHow the Test will Feel\nAn MRI exam causes no pain."}

If you have difficulty lying still or are very nervous, you may be given a medicine to relax you. Too much movement can blur MRI images and cause errors.\nThe table may be hard or cold, but you can request a blanket or pillow. The machine produces loud thumping and humming noises when turned on. You can wear ear plugs to help reduce the noise.\nAn intercom in the room allows you to speak to someone at any time. Some MRIs have televisions and special headphones that you can use to help the time pass.\nThere is no recovery time, unless you were given a medicine to relax."}

This is called staging. Staging helps guide future treatment and follow-up. It gives you some idea of what to expect in the future. A pelvic MRI may be used to help stage cervical, uterine, bladder, rectal, prostate, and testicular cancers.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means your pelvic area appears normal.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results in a woman may be due to:\nAdenomyosis\nof the uterus\nCervical cancer\nCongenital defect of the reproductive organs\nEndometrial cancer\nEndometriosis\nOvarian cancer\nOvarian growths\nProblem with the structure of the reproductive organs, such as the fallopian tubes\nUterine fibroids\nAbnormal results in a man may be due to:\nProstate cancer\nTesticular cancer\nAbnormal results in both males and females may be due to:\nAbscess (collection o"}

To date, no side effects from the magnetic fields and radio waves have been reported.\nThe most common type of contrast (dye) used is gadolinium. It is very safe. Allergic reactions to the substance rarely occur. But gadolinium can be harmful to people with kidney problems who require dialysis. If you have kidney problems, tell your provider before the test.\nThe strong magnetic fields created during an MRI can interfere with pacemakers and other implants. People with most cardiac pacemakers cannot have an MRI and should not enter an MRI area. Some newer pacemakers are made that are safe with MRI."}
