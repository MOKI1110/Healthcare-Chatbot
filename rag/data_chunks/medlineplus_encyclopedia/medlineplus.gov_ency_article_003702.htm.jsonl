Many medicines can affect ADH level, including:\nAlcohol\nDiuretics (water pills)\nBlood pressure medicines\nInsulin\nMedicines for mental disorders\nNicotine\nSteroids\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nADH is a hormone that is produced in a part of the brain called the\nhypothalamus\n. It is then stored and released from the pituitary, a small gland at the base of the brain."}

It is then stored and released from the pituitary, a small gland at the base of the brain. ADH acts on the kidneys to control the amount of water excreted in the urine.\nADH blood test is ordered when your provider suspects you have a disorder that affects your ADH level such as:\nBuildup of fluids in your body that are causing swelling or puffiness (\nedema\n)\nExcessive amounts of urine\nLow sodium (salt) level in your blood\nThirst that is intense or uncontrollable\nCertain diseases affect the normal release of ADH. The blood level of ADH must be tested to determine the cause of the disease. ADH may be measured as part of a water restriction test to find the cause of a disease.\nNormal Results\nNormal values for ADH can range from 0 to 5.9 pg/mL (0 to 5.4 pmol/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nMost laboratories cannot run this test."}

Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nMost laboratories cannot run this test. Only very specialized laboratories can perform the assay correctly.\nSerum co-peptin is now commonly used as a substitute for measuring ADH.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA higher-than-normal level may occur when too much ADH is released, either from the brain where it is made or from somewhere else in the body. This is called the\nsyndrome of inappropriate ADH (SIADH).\nCauses of SIADH include:\nBrain injury or trauma\nBrain tumors\nFluid imbalance after surgery\nInfection in the brain\nor\nthe tissue that surrounds the brain\nInfection in the lungs\nCertain medicines, such as some seizure medicines, pain medicines, and antidepressants\nSmall cell carcinoma lung cancer\nStroke\nA higher-than-normal level of ADH may be found in people with heart failure, liver failure, or some kind of kidney disease.\nA lower-than-normal level may indicate:\nDamage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland\nCentral diabetes insipidus\n(a condition in which the kidneys are not able to conserve water)\nExcessive thirst (\npolydip"}

Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting\nor feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma\n(blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nArginine vasopressin; Antidiuretic hormone; AVP; Vasopressin\nReferences\nFrasier LL, Keating JJ, Shiroff AM.
