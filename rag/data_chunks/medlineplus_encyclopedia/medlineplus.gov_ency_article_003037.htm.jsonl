Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNystagmus\nNystagmus\nNystagmus is a term to describe uncontrollable movements of the eyes that may be:\nSide to side (horizontal nystagmus)\nUp and down (vertical nystagmus)\nRotary (rotary or torsional nystagmus)\nDepending on the cause, these movements may be in both eyes or in just one eye.\nNystagmus can affect vision, balance, and coordination.\nConsiderations\nThe involuntary eye movements of nystagmus are caused by abnormal function in the areas of the brain that control eye movements. The part of the inner ear that senses movement and position (the labyrinth) helps control eye movements.\nThere are two forms of nystagmus:\nInfantile nystagmus syndrome (INS) is present at birth (congenital).\nAcquired nystagmus develops later in life because of a disease or injury.\nCauses\nNYSTAGMUS THAT IS PRESENT AT BIRTH (infantile nystagmus syndrome, or INS)\nINS is usually mild. It does not become more severe, and it is not related to any other disorder.\nPeople with this condition are usually not aware of the eye movements, but other people may see them."}

It does not become more severe, and it is not related to any other disorder.\nPeople with this condition are usually not aware of the eye movements, but other people may see them. If the movements are large, sharpness of vision (visual acuity) may be less than 20/20. Surgery may improve vision.\nNystagmus may be caused by congenital diseases of the eye. Although this is rare, an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) should evaluate any child with nystagmus to check for eye disease.\nACQUIRED NYSTAGMUS\nThe most common cause of acquired nystagmus is certain drugs or medicines. Phenytoin (Dilantin) - an antiseizure medicine, excessive alcohol, or any sedating medicine can impair the labyrinth's function.\nOther causes include:\nInner ear disorders such as\nbenign positional vertigo\n,\nlabyrinthitis\nor\nMeniere disease\nHead injury from motor vehicle accidents\nStroke\nInfections such as\nLyme disease\nand\nsyphilis\nThiamine or\nvitamin B12\ndeficiency\nMultiple sclerosis\nBrain tumors\nAutoimmune disease\nParaneoplastic syndromes (due to cancer elsewhere in the body)\nSeizures\nNystagmus can also be a symptom of other neurological disorders.\nHome Care\nYou may need to make changes in the home to"}

The provider may ask you to wear a pair of goggles that magnify your eyes for part of the exam.\nTo check for nystagmus, your provider may use the following procedure:\nYou spin around for about 30 seconds, stop, and try to stare at an object.\nYour eyes will first move slowly in one direction, then will move quickly in the opposite direction.\nIf you have nystagmus due to a medical condition, the type and severity of the eye movements during this maneuver will depend on the cause.\nYou may have the following tests:\nCT scan\nof the head\nElectro-oculography: An electrical method of measuring eye movements using tiny elec"}
