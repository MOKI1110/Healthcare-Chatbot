Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nALP isoenzyme test\nALP isoenzyme test\nAlkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme found in many body tissues such as liver, bile ducts, bone, and intestine. There are several different structural forms of ALP called isoenzymes. The structure of the enzyme depends on where in the body it is produced. This test is most often used to test ALP made in the tissues of the liver and bones.\nThe ALP isoenzyme test is a lab test that measures the amounts of different types of ALP in the blood.\nThe\nALP test\nis a related test.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is\ndrawn from a vein\nlocated on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nMany medicines can interfere with blood test results.\nYour health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test.\nDO NOT stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted."}

You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nWhen the ALP test result is high, you may need to have the ALP isoenzyme test. This test will help determine what part of the body is causing higher ALP levels.\nThis test may be used to diagnose or monitor:\nBone disease\nLiver\n, gallbladder, or bile duct disease\nPain in the abdomen\nParathyroid gland disease\nVitamin D deficiency\nIt may also be done to check liver function and to see how medicines you take may affect your liver.\nNormal Results\nThe normal value for total ALP is 44 to 147 international units per liter (IU/L) or 0.73 to 2.45 microkatal per liter ( µkat/L). ALP isoenzyme testing may have differing normal values.\nAdults have lower levels of\nALP\nthan children. Bones that are still growing produce higher levels of ALP. During some growth spurts, levels can be as high as 500 IU/L or 835  µKat/L."}
