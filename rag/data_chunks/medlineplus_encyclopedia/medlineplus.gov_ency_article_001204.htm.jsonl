Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMucopolysaccharidosis type I\nMucopolysaccharidosis type I\nMucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) is a rare disease in which the body is missing or does not have enough of an\nenzyme\nneeded to break down long chains of sugar molecules. These chains of molecules are called glycosaminoglycans (formerly called mucopolysaccharides). As a result, the molecules build up in different parts of the body and cause various health problems.\nThe condition belongs to a group of diseases called\nmucopolysaccharidoses\n(MPSs). MPS I is the most common.\nThere are several other types of MPSs, including:\nMPS II\n(Hunter syndrome)\nMPS III\n(Sanfilippo syndrome)\nMPS IV\n(Morquio syndrome)\nCauses\nMPS I is inherited, which means that your parents typically pass the disease on to you. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease.\nPeople with MPS I do not make an enzyme called lysosomal alpha-L-iduronidase."}

This enzyme helps break down long chains of sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans. These molecules are found throughout the body, often in mucus and in fluid around the joints.\nWithout the enzyme, glycosaminoglycans build up and damage organs, including the heart. Symptoms can range from mild to severe. The mild form is called attenuated MPS I and the severe form is called severe MPS I.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of MPS I most often appear from ages 3 to 8 years."}
