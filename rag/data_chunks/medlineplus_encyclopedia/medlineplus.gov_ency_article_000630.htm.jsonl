In rare cases, it can be found as far north as Canada.\nPeople catch the infection when their skin comes in contact with soil that is contaminated with the worms.\nThis tiny worm is barely visible to the naked eye. Young roundworms can move through a person's skin and eventually into the bloodstream to the lungs and airways.\nThey then move up to the throat, where they are swallowed into the stomach. From the stomach, the worms move to the small intestine, where they attach to the intestinal wall. Later, they produce eggs, which hatch into tiny larvae (immature worms) and pass out of the body.\nUnlike other worms, these larvae can re-enter the body through the skin around the anus, which allows an infection to grow."}

Areas where the worms go through the skin can become red and painful.\nThis infection is uncommon in the United States, but it does occur in the southeastern US. Most cases in North America are brought by travelers who have visited or lived in South America or Africa.\nSome people are at risk for a severe type called strongyloidiasis hyperinfection syndrome. In this form of the condition, there are many worms and they multiply more quickly than normal. It can occur in people who have a weakened immune system. This includes people who have had an organ or blood-product transplant, people with HIV/AIDS, and those who take steroid medicine or immune-suppressing medicines.\nSymptoms\nMost of the time, there are no symptoms."}

This includes people who take medicines that suppress the immune system, such as those who are going to have, or have had, a transplant.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWith proper treatment, the worms can be killed and full recovery is expected."}
