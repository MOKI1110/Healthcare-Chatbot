Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCurvature of the penis\nCurvature of the penis\nCurvature of the penis is an abnormal bend in the penis that occurs during erection. In adults, it is most often due to Peyronie disease.\nCauses\nIn Peyronie disease, fibrous scar tissue develops in the deep tissues of the penis. The cause of this fibrous tissue is often not known. It can occur spontaneously. It can also be due to a previous injury to the penis, even one that occurred many years ago.\nFracture of the penis (injury during intercourse) can lead to this condition. Men are at higher risk for developing curvature of the penis after surgery or radiation treatment for prostate cancer.\nPeyronie disease is uncommon. It affects men ages 40 and older.\nCurvature of the penis can occur along with\nDupuytren contracture\n. This is a cord-like thickening across the palm of one or both hands. It is a fairly common disorder in white men over age 50. However, only a very small number of people with Dupuytren contracture develop curvature of the penis.\nOther risk factors have not been found."}

However, only a very small number of people with Dupuytren contracture develop curvature of the penis.\nOther risk factors have not been found. However, people with this condition have a certain type of immune cell marker, which indicates that it may be inherited.\nNewborns may have a curvature of the penis. This may be part of an abnormality called chordee, which is different from Peyronie disease.\nSymptoms\nYou or your health care provider may notice an abnormal hardening of the tissue below the skin, in one area along the shaft of the penis. It may also feel like a hard lump or bump.\nDuring erection, there may be:\nA bend in the penis, which most often begins at the area where you feel the scar tissue or hardening\nSoftening of the portion of the penis beyond the area of scar tissue\nNarrowing of the penis\nPain\nProblems with penetration or pain during intercourse\nShortening of the penis\nExams and Tests\nThe provider can diagnose curvature of the penis with a physical exam. The hard plaques can be felt with or without an erection.\nThe provider may give you a shot of medicine to cause an erection."}

Or, you may provide your provider with pictures of the erect penis for evaluation.\nAn\nultrasound\nmay show the scar tissue in the penis. However, this test is usually not necessary.\nTreatment\nAt first, you may not need treatment. Some or all of the symptoms may improve over time or may not get worse.\nTreatments may include:\nCorticosteroid injections into the fibrous band of tissue.\nPotaba (a medicine taken by mouth containing aminobenzoate potassium).\nRadiation therapy\n.\nShock wave\nlithotripsy\n.\nVerapamil injection (a medicine used to treat high blood pressure).\nVitamin E.\nCollagenase clostridium histolyticum (Xiaflex) injection.\nHowever, not all of these treatments help very much if at all. Some may also cause more scarring.\nIf medicine and lithotripsy do not help, and you are unable to have intercourse because of the curve of the penis, surgery may be done to correct the problem. However, some types of surgery may cause\nimpotence\n."}
