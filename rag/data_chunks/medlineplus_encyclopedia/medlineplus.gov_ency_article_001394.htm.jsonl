It affects the brain and other parts of the body.\nAtaxia refers to uncoordinated movements, such as walking. Telangiectasias are enlarged blood vessels (capillaries) just below the surface of the skin. Telangiectasias appear as tiny, red, spider-like blood vessels.\nCauses\nAtaxia-telangiectasia is inherited. This means it is passed down through families. It is an\nautosomal recessive\ntrait. Both parents must provide a copy of a nonworking gene for the child to have symptoms of the disorder.\nThe disease results from a variant in the\nATM\ngene. This gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control the rate at which cells grow and divide."}

This gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps control the rate at which cells grow and divide. Defects in this gene can lead to abnormal cell death in many sites of the body, including the part of the brain that helps coordinate movement.\nBoys and girls are equally affected.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nDecreased coordination of movements (ataxia) in late childhood that can include ataxic gait (cerebellar\nataxia\n), jerky gait, unsteadiness\nDecreasing mental development, slows or stops after age 10 to 12\nDelayed walking\nDiscoloration of skin areas exposed to sunlight\nDiscoloration of skin (coffee-with-milk-colored spots)\nEnlarged blood vessels in skin of nose, ears, and inside of the elbow and knee\nEnlarged blood vessels in the whites of the eyes\nJerky or abnormal eye movements (\nnystagmus\n) late in the disease\nPremature graying of the hair\nSeizures\nSensitivity to radiation, including x-rays\nSevere respiratory infections that keep coming back (recurring)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}
