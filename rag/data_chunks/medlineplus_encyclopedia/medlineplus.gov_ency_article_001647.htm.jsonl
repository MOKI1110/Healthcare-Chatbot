It occurs when the varicella-zoster virus infects a specific nerve in the head.\nCauses\nThe varicella-zoster virus that causes Ramsay Hunt syndrome is the same virus that causes\nchickenpox\nand\nshingles\n.\nIn people with this syndrome, the virus is believed to infect the facial nerve near the inner ear. This leads to irritation and swelling of the nerve.\nThe condition mainly affects adults."}

In rare cases, it is seen in children.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nSevere pain in the ear\nPainful rash on the eardrum, ear canal, earlobe, tongue, and roof of the mouth on the side with the affected nerve\nHearing changes on one side\nSensation of things spinning (\nvertigo\n)\nWeakness on one side of the face that causes difficulty closing one eye, eating (food falls out of the weak corner of the mouth), making expressions, and making fine movements of the face, as well as facial droop and paralysis on one side of the face\nChanges in taste sensation or loss of taste\nExcess or loss of tearing of the eye on the affected side\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will usually diagnose Ramsay Hunt Syndrome by looking for signs of weakness in the face and a blister-like rash.\nTests may include:\nBlood tests for varicella-zoster virus\nElectromyography\n(EMG)\nLumbar puncture\n(in rare cases)\nMRI of the head\nNerve conduction\n(to determine the amount of damage to the facial nerve)\nSkin scraping"}

Antiviral medicines, such as acyclovir or valacyclovir will usually be given.\nSometimes strong painkillers are also needed if the pain continues even with steroids. While you have weakness of the face, wear an eye patch to prevent injury to the cornea (\ncorneal abrasion\n) and other damage to the eye if the eye does not close completely. Some people may use a special eye lubricant at night and artificial tears during the day to prevent the eye from drying out.\nIf you have dizziness, your provider can advise other medicines.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf there is not much damage to the nerve, you should get better completely within a few weeks. If damage is more severe, you may not fully recover, even after several months.\nOverall, your chances of recovery are better if the treatment is started within 3 days after the symptoms begin."}

When treatment is started within this time, most people make a full recovery. If treatment is delayed for more than 3 days, there is less of a chance of complete recovery. Children are more likely to have a complete recovery than adults.\nPossible Complications\nComplications of Ramsay Hunt syndrome may include:\nChanges in the appearance of the face (disfigurement) from loss of movement\nChange in taste\nDamage to the eye (\ncorneal ulcers and infections\n), resulting in a loss of vision\nNerves that grow back to the wrong structures and cause abnormal reactions to a movement -- for example, smiling causes the eye to close\nPersistent pain (postherpetic\nneuralgia\n)\nSpasm of the face muscles or eyelids\nOccasionally, the virus may spread to other nerves, or even to the brain and spinal cord. This can cause:\nConfusion\nDrowsiness\nHeadaches\nLimb weakness\nNerve pain\nIf these symptoms occur, a hospital stay may be needed."}
