Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nUrinary incontinence - injectable implant\nUrinary incontinence - injectable implant\nInjectable implants are injections of material into the wall of the urethra to help control urine leakage (\nurinary incontinence\n) caused by a weak urinary sphincter. The sphincter is a muscle that allows your body to hold urine in the bladder. If your sphincter muscle stops working well, you will have urine leakage.\nDescription\nThe material that is injected is permanent. Coaptite and Macroplastique are examples of two brands.\nThe surgeon injects material through a needle into the wall of your urethra. This is the tube that carries urine from your bladder out of your body. The material bulks up the urethral tissue, causing it to tighten."}

This is the tube that carries urine from your bladder out of your body. The material bulks up the urethral tissue, causing it to tighten. This stops urine from leaking out of your bladder.\nYou may receive one of the following types of anesthesia (pain relief) for this procedure:\nLocal anesthesia (only the area being worked on will be numb)\nSpinal anesthesia\n(you will be numb from the waist down)\nGeneral anesthesia\n(you will be asleep and not able to feel pain)\nAfter you are numb or asleep from anesthesia, the surgeon puts a medical device called a cystoscope into your urethra. The cystoscope allows your surgeon to see the area.\nThen the surgeon passes a needle through the cystoscope into your urethra. Material is injected into the wall of the urethra or bladder neck through this needle. The surgeon can also inject material into the tissue next to the sphincter.\nThe implant procedure is usually done in the hospital. Or, it is done in your surgeon's office."}

The procedure takes about 20 to 30 minutes.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nImplants can help both men and women.\nMen who have urine leakage after\nprostate surgery\nmay choose to have implants.\nWomen who have urine leakage and want a simple procedure to control the problem may choose to have an implant procedure. These women may not want to have surgery that requires general anesthesia or a long recovery after surgery.\nRisks\nRisks for this procedure are:\nDamage to the urethra or bladder\nUrine leakage that gets worse\nPain where the injection was done\nAllergic reaction to the material\nImplant material that moves (migrates) to another area of the body\nTrouble urinating\nafter the procedure\nUrinary tract infection\nBlood in the urine\nBefore the Procedure\nTell your surgeon what medicines you are taking."}

This includes medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\nYou may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), vitamin E, warfarin (Coumadin), and any other medicines that make it hard for your blood to clot (blood thinners).\nOn the day of your procedure:\nYou may be asked not to drink or eat anything for 6 to 12 hours before the procedure. This will depend on what type of anesthesia you will have.\nTake the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\nYou will be told when to arrive at the hospital or clinic. Be sure to arrive on time.\nAfter the Procedure\nMost people can go home soon after the procedure. It may take up to a month before the injection fully works.\nIt may become harder to empty your bladder. You may need to use a catheter for a few days. This and any other urinary problems usually go away.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nYou may need 2 or 3 more injections to get good results."}

If the material moves away from the spot where it was injected, you may need more treatments in the future.\nImplants can help most men who have had transurethral resection of the prostate (\nTURP\n). Implants help about one half of men who have had their prostate gland removed to treat prostate cancer.\nAlternative Names\nIntrinsic sphincter deficiency repair; ISD repair; Injectable bulking agents for stress urinary incontinence\nPatient Instructions\nKegel exercises - self-care\nSelf catheterization - female\nSuprapubic catheter care\nUrinary catheters - what to ask your doctor\nUrinary incontinence products - self-care\nUrinary incontinence surgery - female - discharge\nUrinary incontinence - what to ask your doctor\nUrine drainage bags\nWhen you have urinary incontinence\nImages\nFemale urinary tract\nMale urinary tract\nReferences\nBoone TB, Stewart JN, Martinez LM.
