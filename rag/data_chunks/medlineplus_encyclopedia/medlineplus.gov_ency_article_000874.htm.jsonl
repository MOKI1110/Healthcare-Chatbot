It leads to inflammation and damage to blood vessels, mainly in the skin. The term is not used much currently because more specific names are considered more precise.\nCauses\nHypersensitivity vasculitis, or cutaneous small vessel vasculitis, is caused by:\nAn\nallergic reaction\nto a drug or other foreign substance\nA reaction to an infection\nIt usually affects people older than age 16.\nOften, the cause of the problem cannot be found even with a careful study of the person's medical history.\nHypersensitivity vasculitis may look like systemic,\nnecrotizing vasculitis\n, which can affect blood vessels throughout the body and not just in the skin."}
