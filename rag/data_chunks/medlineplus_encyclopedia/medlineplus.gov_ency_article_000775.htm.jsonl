Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nOsmotic demyelination syndrome\nOsmotic demyelination syndrome\nOsmotic demyelination syndrome (ODS) leads to brain cell dysfunction. It is caused by the destruction of the layer (\nmyelin sheath\n) covering nerve cells in the brain, most often the middle of the brainstem (pons).\nCauses\nWhen the myelin sheath that covers nerve cells is destroyed, signals from one nerve to another aren't properly transmitted. Although the brainstem is mainly affected, other areas of the brain can also be involved.\nThe most common cause of ODS is a quick change in the body's blood sodium levels. This most often occurs when someone is being treated for low blood sodium (\nhyponatremia\n) and the sodium is replaced too fast. Sometimes, it occurs when a high level of sodium in the body (hypernatremia) is corrected too quickly.\nODS does not usually occur on its own."}
