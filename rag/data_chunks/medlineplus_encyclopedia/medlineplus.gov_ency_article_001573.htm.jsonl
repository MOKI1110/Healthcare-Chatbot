Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nOsteogenesis imperfecta\nOsteogenesis imperfecta\nOsteogenesis imperfecta is a condition causing extremely fragile bones.\nCauses\nOsteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is present at birth. It is often caused by a defect in the gene that produces type I collagen, an important building block of bone. There are many defects that can affect this gene. The severity of OI depends on the specific gene defect.\nIf you have one copy of the gene, you will have the disease. Most cases of OI are inherited from a parent. However, some cases are the result of new genetic mutations.\nA person with OI has a 50% chance of passing on the gene and the disease to their children.\nSymptoms\nAll people with OI have weak bones, and fractures are more likely. People with OI are most often below average height (\nshort stature\n)."}

People with OI are most often below average height (\nshort stature\n). However, the severity of the disease varies greatly.\nThe classic symptoms include:\nBlue tint to the whites of their eyes (blue sclera)\nMultiple\nbone fractures\nEarly hearing loss (\ndeafness\n)\nBecause type I collagen is also found in ligaments, people with OI often have loose joints (hypermobility) and flat feet. Some types of OI also lead to the development of poor teeth.\nSymptoms of more severe forms of OI may include:\nBowed legs and arms\nKyphosis\nScoliosis (S-curve spine)\nExams and Tests\nOI is most often suspected in children whose bones break with very little force. A physical exam may show that the whites of their eyes have a blue tint.\nA definitive diagnosis may be made using a\nskin punch biopsy\n. Family members may be given a DNA blood test.\nIf there is a family history of OI,\nchorionic villus sampling\nmay be done during pregnancy to determine if the baby has the condition."}

Family members may be given a DNA blood test.\nIf there is a family history of OI,\nchorionic villus sampling\nmay be done during pregnancy to determine if the baby has the condition. However, because so many different mutations can cause OI, some forms cannot be diagnosed with a genetic test.\nThe severe form of type II OI can be seen on ultrasound when the fetus is as young as 16 weeks.\nTreatment\nThere is not yet a cure for this disease. However, specific therapies can reduce the pain and complications from OI.\nMedicines that can increase the strength and density of bone are used in people with OI. They have been shown to reduce bone pain and fracture rate (especially in the bones of the spine). They are called bisphosphonates.\nLow impact exercises, such as swimming, keep muscles strong and help maintain strong bones. People with OI can benefit from these exercises and should be encouraged to do them.\nIn severe cases, surgery to place metal rods into the long bones of the legs may be considered. This procedure can strengthen the bone and reduce the risk for fracture. Bracing can also be helpful for some people.\nSurgery may be needed to correct any deformities."}

This procedure can strengthen the bone and reduce the risk for fracture. Bracing can also be helpful for some people.\nSurgery may be needed to correct any deformities. This treatment is important because deformities (such as bowed legs or a spinal problem) can interfere with a person's ability to move or walk.\nEven with treatment, fractures will occur. Most fractures heal quickly. Time in a cast should be limited, because bone loss may occur when you do not use a part of your body for a period of time.\nMany children with OI develop body image problems as they enter their teenage years. A social worker or psychologist can help them adapt to life with OI.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well a person does depends on the type of OI they have.\nType I, or mild OI, is the most common form. People with this type can live a normal lifespan.\nType II is a severe form that often leads to death in the first year of life.\nType III is also called severe OI. People with this type have many fractures starting very early in life and can have severe bone deformities."}

People with this type have many fractures starting very early in life and can have severe bone deformities. Many people need to use a wheelchair and often have a somewhat shortened life expectancy.\nType IV, or moderately severe OI, is similar to type I, although people with type IV often need braces or crutches to walk. Life expectancy is normal or near normal.\nThere are other types of OI, but they occur very rarely and most are considered subtypes of the moderately severe form (type IV).\nPossible Complications\nComplications are largely based on the type of OI present. They are often directly related to the problems with weak bones and multiple fractures.\nComplications may include:\nHearing loss (common in type I and type III)\nHeart failure (type II)\nRespiratory problems and pneumonias due to chest wall deformities\nSpinal cord or brain stem problems\nPermanent deformity\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nSevere forms are most often diagnosed early in life, but mild cases may not be noted until later in life."}
