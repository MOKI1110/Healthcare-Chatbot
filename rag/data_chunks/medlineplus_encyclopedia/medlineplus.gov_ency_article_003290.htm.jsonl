Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSingle palmar crease\nSingle palmar crease\nA single palmar crease is a single line that runs across the palm of the hand. People most often have 3 creases in their palms.\nThe crease is most often referred to as a single palmar crease. The older term \"simian crease\" is not used much anymore, since it tends to have a negative meaning (the word \"simian\" refers to a monkey or ape).\nConsiderations\nDistinct lines that form creases appear on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. The palm has 3 of these creases in most cases. But sometimes, the creases join to form just one.\nPalmar creases develop while a baby is growing in the womb, most often by the 12th week of\ngestation\n.\nA single palmar crease appears in about 1 out of 30 people. Males are twice as likely as females to have this condition. Some single palmar creases may indicate problems with development and be linked with certain disorders.\nCauses\nHaving a single palmar crease is often normal."}
