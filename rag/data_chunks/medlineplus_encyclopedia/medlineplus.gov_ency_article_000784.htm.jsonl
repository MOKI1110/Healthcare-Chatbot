Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAmaurosis fugax\nAmaurosis fugax\nAmaurosis fugax is a temporary loss of vision in one or both eyes due to a lack of blood flow to the\nretina\n. The retina is the light-sensitive layer of tissue at the back of the eyeball.\nCauses\nAmaurosis fugax is not itself a disease. Instead, it is a sign of other disorders. Amaurosis fugax can occur from different causes. One cause is when a blood clot or a piece of plaque blocks an artery in the eye. The blood clot or plaque usually travels from a larger artery, such as the carotid artery in the neck or an artery in the heart, to an artery in the eye.\nPlaque is a hard substance that forms when fat, cholesterol, and other substances build up in the walls of arteries."}

Some people describe the loss of vision as a gray or black shade coming down over the eye.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a complete eye and nervous system exam. In some cases, an eye exam will reveal a bright spot where the clot is blocking a retinal artery.\nTests that may be done include:\nUltrasound\nor\nmagnetic resonance angiography scan\nof the carotid artery to check for blood clots or plaque\nBlood tests to check cholesterol and blood sugar levels\nTests of the heart, such as an\nelectrocardiogram\n(ECG), or Holter monitor or loop recorder to check its electrical activity\nEchocardiogram\nto check the structure of the heart and to look for blood clots in the heart\nTreatment\nTreatment of amaurosis fugax depends on its cause. When amaurosis fugax is due to a blood clot or plaque, the concern is to prevent a stroke. The following can help prevent a stroke:\nAvoid fatty foods and follow a healthy, low-fat diet."}

If you have diabetes or have had a stroke, your provider may tell you to aim for a lower blood pressure.\nIf you have diabetes, heart disease, or hardening of the arteries, your LDL (bad) cholesterol should be lower than 70 mg/dL.
