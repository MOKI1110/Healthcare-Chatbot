The optic nerve carries images of what the eye sees to the brain.\nCauses\nThere are many causes of optic atrophy. The most common is poor blood flow. This is called ischemic optic neuropathy. The problem most often affects older adults. The optic nerve can also be damaged by shock, toxins, radiation, and trauma.\nEye diseases, such as\nglaucoma\n, can also cause a form of optic nerve atrophy. The condition can also be caused by diseases of the brain and central nervous system. These may include:\nBrain tumor\nGiant cell arteritis (sometimes called temporal arteritis or cranial arteritis)\nMultiple sclerosis\nStroke\nThere are also rare forms of hereditary optic nerve atrophy that affect children and young adults. Sometimes injuries to the face or head may result in optic nerve atrophy.\nSymptoms\nOptic nerve atrophy causes vision to dim and reduces the field of vision. The ability to see fine detail will also be lost. Colors will seem faded."}

The ability to see fine detail will also be lost. Colors will seem faded. Over time, the pupil will be less able to react to light, and eventually,  its ability to react to light may be lost.\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will do a complete eye exam to look for the condition. The exam will include tests of:\nColor vision\nPupil light reflex\nTonometry\n(pressure in the eye)\nVisual acuity\nVisual field (side vision) test\nYou may also need a complete\nphysical exam\nand other tests.\nTreatment\nDamage from optic nerve atrophy cannot be reversed. The underlying disease must be found and treated. Otherwise, vision loss will continue.\nRarely, conditions that lead to optic atrophy may be treatable. Stem cells may prove helpful for people with optic atrophy.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nVision lost to optic nerve atrophy cannot be recovered. It is very important to protect the other eye.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nPeople with this condition need to be checked regularly by an eye doctor with experience in nerve-related conditions."}

Tell your eye doctor right away about any change in vision.\nPrevention\nMany causes of optic nerve atrophy cannot be prevented.\nPrevention steps include:\nOlder adults should have their provider carefully manage their blood pressure.\nUse standard safety precautions to prevent injuries to the face. Most facial injuries are the result of car accidents. Wearing seat belts may help prevent these injuries.\nSchedule a routine annual eye exam to check for glaucoma.\nNever drink home-brewed alcohol and forms of alcohol that are not intended for drinking. Methanol, which may be found in home-brewed alcohol, can cause optic nerve atrophy in both eyes.\nAlternative Names\nOptic atrophy; Optic neuropathy\nImages\nOptic nerve\nVisual field test\nReferences\nBarboni P, Balducci N, Karanjia R.
