Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nUrine pH test\nUrine pH test\nA urine pH test measures the level of acid in urine.\nHow the Test is Performed\nAfter you provide a urine sample, it is tested right away. The health care provider uses a dipstick made with a color-sensitive pad. The color on the dipstick tells the provider the level of acid in your urine.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider may tell you to stop taking certain medicines that can affect the results of the test. These may include:\nAcetazolamide\nAmmonium chloride\nMethenamine mandelate\nPotassium citrate\nSodium bicarbonate\nThiazide diuretic\nDO NOT stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.\nEat a normal, balanced diet for several days before the test. Note that:\nA diet high in fruits, vegetables, or non-cheese dairy products can increase your urine pH.\nA diet high in fish, meat products, or cheese can decrease your urine pH.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order this test to check for changes in your urine acid levels."}

There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order this test to check for changes in your urine acid levels. It may be done to see if you:\nAre at risk of\nkidney stones\n. Different types of stones can form depending on how acidic your urine is.\nHave a metabolic condition, such as renal tubular acidosis.\nNeed to take certain medicines to treat urinary tract infections. Some medicines are more effective when urine is acidic or non-acidic (alkaline).\nNormal Results\nThe normal values range from pH 4.6 to 8.0.\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA high urine pH may be due to:\nKidneys that do not properly remove acids from the bloodstream (renal tubular acidosis)\nKidney failure\nStomach pumping (gastric suction to remove fluid from the stomach)\nUrinary tract infection\nVomiting\nA low urine pH may be due to:\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\nDiarrhea\nToo much acid in the body fluids (\nmetabolic acidosis\n), such as\ndiabetic ketoacidosis\nStarvation\nRisks\nThere are no risks with this test.\nAlternative Names\npH - urine\nImages\nFemale urinary tract\nPH urine test\nMale urinary tract\nReferences\nBushinsky DA.
