It has several possible causes, including:\nPast sexual trauma or abuse\nMental health factors\nA response that develops due to physical pain\nIntercourse\nSometimes no cause can be found.\nVaginismus is an uncommon condition.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptoms are:\nDifficult or painful vaginal penetration during sex. Vaginal penetration may not be possible.\nVaginal pain during sexual intercourse or a pelvic exam.\nWomen with vaginismus often become anxious about sexual intercourse.

A medical history and complete physical exam are needed to look for other causes of pain with sexual intercourse (dyspareunia).\nTreatment\nA health care team made up of a gynecologist, physical therapist, and sexual counselor can help with treatment.\nTreatment involves a combination of physical therapy, education, counseling, and exercises such as pelvic floor muscle contraction and relaxation (\nKegel exercises\n).\nYour provider may recommend injection of medicines to help relax the vaginal muscles.\nVaginal dilation exercises using plastic dilators are recommended. This method helps to make the person less sensitive to vaginal penetration. These exercises should be done under the direction of a sex therapist, physical therapist, or other health care provider. Therapy should involve the partner and can slowly lead to more intimate contact. Intercourse may ultimately be possible.\nYou will get information from your provider."}
