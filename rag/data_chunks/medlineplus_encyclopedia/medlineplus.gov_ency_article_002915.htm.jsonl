The uterus is a hollow muscular organ that nourishes the developing baby during pregnancy.\nDescription\nYou may have all or part of the uterus removed during a hysterectomy. The fallopian tubes and ovaries may also be removed.\nThere are many different ways to perform a hysterectomy. It may be done through:\nA surgical cut in the belly (called an open or abdominal hysterectomy)\nThree to four small surgical cuts in the belly and then using a laparoscope\nA surgical cut in the vagina, aided by the use of a laparoscope (called a vaginal hysterectomy)\nA surgical cut in the vagina without the use of a laparoscope (called a vaginal hysterectomy)\nThree to four small surgical cuts in the belly, in order to perform robotic surgery\nYou and your surgeon will decide which type of procedure."}

Many women notice changes in their body and in how they feel about themselves after a hysterectomy. Talk with your provider, family, and friends about these possible changes before you have surgery.\nTell your health care team about all the medicines you are taking. These include herbs, supplements, and other medicines you bought without a prescription.\nDuring the days before the surgery:\nYou may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), clopidogrel (Plavix), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other medicines like these.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\nIf you smoke, try to stop. Ask your provider for help quitting.\nOn the day of your surgery:\nYou will most often be asked not to drink or eat anything for 8 hours before the surgery.\nTake any medicines your provider told you to take with a small sip of water.\nArrive at the hospital on time.\nAfter the Procedure\nAfter surgery, you will be given pain medicines.\nYou may also have a tube, called a catheter, inserted into your bladder to pass urine."}

This helps prevent\nblood clots\nfrom forming in your legs and speeds recovery.\nYou will be asked to get up to use the bathroom as soon as you are able. You may return to a normal diet as soon as you can without causing nausea and vomiting.\nHow long you stay in the hospital depends on the type of hysterectomy.\nYou can likely go home the next day when surgery is done through the vagina, with a laparoscope, or after robotic surgery.\nWhen a larger surgical cut (incision) in the abdomen is made, you may need to stay in the hospital for 1 to 2 days. You may need to stay longer if the hysterectomy is done because of cancer.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow long it takes you to recover depends on the type of hysterectomy."}
