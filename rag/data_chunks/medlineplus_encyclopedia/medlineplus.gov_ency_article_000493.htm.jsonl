As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called\nacidosis\n).\nCauses\nWhen the body performs its normal functions, it produces acid. If this acid is not removed or neutralized, the blood becomes too acidic. This can lead to\nelectrolyte\nimbalances in the blood. It can also cause problems with normal function of some cells.\nThe kidneys help control the body's acid level by removing acid from the blood and excreting it into the urine.\nDistal renal tubular acidosis (type I RTA) is caused by a defect in the kidney tubes that causes acid to build up in the blood.\nType I RTA is caused by a variety of conditions, including:\nAmyloidosis\n, a buildup of abnormal protein, called amyloid, in the tissues and organs\nFabry disease, an abnormal buildup in the body of a certain type of fatty substance\nHigh level of calcium in the blood\nSickle cell disease\n, red blood ce"}

This will help correct bone disorders and reduce calcium buildup in the kidneys (nephrocalcinosis) and kidney stones.\nThe underlying cause of distal renal tubular acidosis should be corrected if it can be identified.\nMedicines that may be prescribed include potassium citrate, sodium bicarbonate, and thiazide diuretics. These are alkaline medicines that help correct the acidic condition of the body. Sodium bicarbonate may correct the loss of potassium and calcium.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe disorder must be treated to reduce its effects and complications, which can be permanent or life threatening."}
