Most often, malabsorption involves problems absorbing certain sugars, fats, proteins, or vitamins. It can also involve an overall problem with absorbing food.\nProblems or damage to the small intestine that may lead to problems absorbing important nutrients. These include:\nCeliac disease\nTropical sprue\nCrohn disease\nWhipple disease\nDamage from\nradiation\ntreatments\nOvergrowth of bacteria in the small bowel\nParasite or tapeworm infection\nSurgery that removes all or part of the small intestine\nEnzymes produced by the pancreas help absorb fats and other nutrients. A decrease of these enzymes makes it harder to absorb fats and certain nutrients."}

A decrease of these enzymes makes it harder to absorb fats and certain nutrients. Problems with the pancreas may be caused by:\nCystic fibrosis\nInfections or swelling of the pancreas\nTrauma to the pancreas\nSurgery to remove part of the pancreas\nSome of the other causes of malabsorption include:\nAIDS and HIV\nCertain medicines (tetracycline, some antacids, some medicines used to treat obesity, colchicine, acarbose, phenytoin, cholestyramine)\nGastrectomy\nand\nsurgical treatments for obesity\nCholestasis\nChronic liver disease\nCow's milk protein intolerance\nSoy milk protein intolerance\nSymptoms\nIn children, the current weight or rate of weight gain is often much lower than that of other children of similar age and sex. This is called\nfailure to thrive\n."}

The child may not grow and develop normally.\nAdults may also have failure to thrive, with weight loss, muscle wasting, weakness, and even problems thinking.\nChanges in the stools are often present, but not always.\nChanges in the stools may include:\nBloating, cramping, and gas\nBulky stools\nChronic diarrhea\nFatty stools (steatorrhea)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will do an exam. Tests that may be done include:\nBlood and urine tests\nCT scan of the abdomen\nHydrogen breath test\nMR or CT enterography\nSchilling test\nfor vitamin B12 deficiency\nSecretin stimulation test\nSmall bowel biopsy\nStool culture\nor\nculture of small intestine aspirate\nStool fat testing\nX-rays of the small bowel or other imaging tests\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the cause and is aimed at relieving symptoms and ensuring the body receives enough nutrients.\nA high-calorie diet may be tried."}

Those with damage to the pancreas may need to take pancreatic enzymes. Your provider will prescribe these if necessary.\nMedicines to slow down the normal movement of the intestine can be tried. This may allow food to remain in the intestine longer.\nIf the body is not able to absorb enough nutrients,\ntotal parenteral nutrition (TPN)\nmay be tried. It will help you or your child get nutrition from a special formula through a vein in the body. Your provider will select the right amount of calories and TPN solution."}
