Your body is then scanned to see the cells and track how they move through the body.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe procedure for this test may vary a little. This depends on the reason for the scan.\nThe RBCs are tagged with\nradioactive material\nin 1 of 2 ways.\nThe first method involves removing blood from a vein. The RBCs are separated from the rest of the blood sample. The cells are then mixed with the radioactive material. The cells with the radioactive material are considered \"tagged.\" A short time later the tagged RBCs are injected into one of your veins.\nThe second method involves an injection of a specific medicine. The medicine allows the radioactive material to attach to your red blood cells. The radioactive material is injected into a vein 15 or 20 minutes after you receive this medicine.\nScanning may be done right away or after a delay. For the scan, you will lie on a table under a special camera."}

The specific areas scanned depend on the reason for the test.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will need to sign a consent form. You put on a hospital gown and take off jewelry or metallic objects before the scan.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel a little pain when the needle is inserted to draw blood or to give the injection. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nThe radioactive material is painless."}

Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nThe radioactive material is painless. Some people may have discomfort from lying on the hard table.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is most often done to find the site of bleeding such as from the colon or other parts of the gastrointestinal tract.\nA similar test called a ventriculogram may be done to check heart function.\nNormal Results\nA normal exam shows no rapid bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThere is active bleeding from the gastrointestinal tract.\nRisks\nSlight risks from having blood drawn include:\nFainting\nor feeling lightheaded\nHematoma\n(blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nVery rarely, a person may have an\nallergic reaction\nto the radioisotope. This may include\nanaphylaxis\nif the person is very sensitive to the substance.\nYou will be exposed to a small amount of radiation from the radioisotope. The materials break down very quickly. Almost all radioactivity will be gone within 1 or 2 days."}
