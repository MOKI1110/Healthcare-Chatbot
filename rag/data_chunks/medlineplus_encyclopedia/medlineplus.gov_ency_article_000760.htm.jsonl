Alzheimer disease (AD) is the most common form of dementia. It affects memory, thinking, and behavior.\nDementia may also be referred to as major\nneurocognitive disorder\n.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of Alzheimer disease is not known. Research shows that certain changes in the brain are associated with Alzheimer disease. This leads to structures called neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles."}

This type is much less common than late onset. It tends to get worse quickly. Early onset disease can run in families. Several genes have been identified.\nLate onset Alzheimer disease -- This is the most common type. It occurs in people age 60 and older."}
