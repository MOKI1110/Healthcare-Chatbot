It may also be drawn from an artery on the inside of the elbow, groin, or other site. If blood is drawn from the wrist, your health care provider will first check your pulse. This is to make sure blood is flowing into the hand from the main arteries in the forearm (radial and ulnar arteries).\nThe procedure is done as follows:\nThe area is cleaned with antiseptic.\nA needle is inserted. A small amount of anesthetic may be injected or applied before the needle is inserted.\nBlood flows into a special collecting syringe.\nThe needle is removed after enough blood is collected.\nPressure is applied to the puncture site for 5 to 10 minutes to stop the bleeding."}

The site will be checked during this time to make sure the bleeding stops.\nIf it is easier to get blood from one location or side of your body, let the person who is drawing your blood know it before starting the test.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nPreparation varies with the specific test performed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nPuncture of an artery may be more uncomfortable than puncture of a vein. This is because arteries are deeper than veins. Arteries also have thicker walls and have more nerves.\nWhen the needle is inserted, there may be some discomfort or pain. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test Is Performed\nBlood transports oxygen, nutrients, waste products, and other materials within the body. Blood also helps regulate body temperature, fluids, and the balance of chemicals.\nBlood is made up of a fluid portion (plasma) and a cellular portion. Plasma contains substances dissolved in the fluid."}

Plasma contains substances dissolved in the fluid. The cellular portion is made up mainly of red blood cells, but it also includes white blood cells and\nplatelets\n.\nBecause blood has many functions, tests on the blood or its components may give valuable clues to help providers diagnose many medical conditions.\nBlood in the arteries (arterial blood) differs from blood in the veins (venous blood) mainly in its content of\ndissolved gases\n(oxygen and carbon dioxide). Testing arterial blood shows the makeup of the blood before any of its contents are used by the body tissues.\nNormal Results\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn arterial stick is done to get blood samples from arteries. Blood samples are mainly taken to measure gases dissolved in the arterial blood. Abnormal results may point to\nbreathing problems\nor problems with the body's\nmetabolism\n."}

Sometimes arterial sticks are done to get\nblood culture\n(testing for infection) or blood chemistry samples.\nRisks\nThere is little risk in having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nHematoma\n(blood accumulating under the skin)\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nThere is a slight risk for damage to nearby tissues when the blood is drawn. Blood can be taken from lower-risk sites, and techniques can be used to limit tissue damage.\nAlternative Names\nBlood sample - arterial\nImages\nArterial blood sample\nReferences\nCloutier MM.
