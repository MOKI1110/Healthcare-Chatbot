These bacteria release a toxin that causes an increased amount of water to be released from cells that line the intestines. This increase in water produces severe diarrhea.\nPeople develop the infection from eating or drinking food or water that contains the cholera germ. Living in or traveling to areas where cholera is present raises the risk of getting it.\nCholera occurs in places with a lack of water treatment or sewage treatment, or crowding, war, and famine. Common locations for cholera include:\nAfrica\nSome parts of Asia\nIndia\nBangladesh\nMexico\nSouth and Central America\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of cholera can be mild to severe."}

Common locations for cholera include:\nAfrica\nSome parts of Asia\nIndia\nBangladesh\nMexico\nSouth and Central America\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of cholera can be mild to severe. They include:\nAbdominal cramps\nDry mucous membranes or  dry mouth\nDry skin\nExcessive thirst\nGlassy or sunken eyes\nLack of tears\nLethargy\nLow urine output\nNausea\nRapid\ndehydration\nRapid pulse (heart rate)\nSunken \"soft spots\" (fontanelles) in infants\nUnusual sleepiness or tiredness\nVomiting\nWatery diarrhea that starts suddenly and has a fishy odor\nExams and Tests\nTests that may be done include:\nBlood culture\nStool culture\nand\nGram stain\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to replace fluid and salts that are lost through diarrhea. Diarrhea and fluid loss can be fast and extreme. It can be hard to replace lost fluids.\nDepending on your condition, you may be given fluids by mouth or through a vein (\nintravenous\n, or IV). Antibiotics may shorten the time you feel ill.\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) has developed packets of salts that are mixed with clean water to help restore fluids. These are cheaper and easier to use than the typical IV fluid."}

Supportive care is critical. Most people will make a full recovery when they are given enough fluids.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nSevere dehydration\nDeath\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you develop severe watery diarrhea. Also contact your provider if you have signs of dehydration, including:\nDry mouth\nDry skin\n\"Glassy\" eyes\nNo tears\nRapid pulse\nReduced or no urine\nSunken eyes\nThirst\nUnusual sleepiness or tiredness\nPrevention\nThere is a cholera vaccine available for adults ages 2 to 64 who are traveling to an area with an active cholera outbreak."}

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention does not recommend the cholera vaccine for most travelers because most people do not travel to areas where cholera is present.\nTravelers should always be careful when eating food and drinking water, even if they are vaccinated.\nWhen outbreaks of cholera occur, efforts should be made to establish clean water, food, and sanitation. Vaccination is not very effective in managing outbreaks.\nImages\nDigestive system\nBacteria\nReferences\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention website. Cholera.
