This can be done using different methods, including\ngallbladder surgery\nor a procedure called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (\nERCP\n).\nThe bile sample is sent to a lab. There, it is placed in a special dish called a culture medium to see if bacteria, viruses, or fungi grow on the sample.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nPreparation depends on the specific method used to obtain the bile sample. Follow your health care provider's instructions exactly.\nHow the Test will Feel\nIf bile is taken during gallbladder surgery, you will feel no pain because you are asleep.\nIf bile is taken during ERCP, you will receive medicine to relax you. You may have some discomfort as the\nendoscope\npasses through your mouth, throat, and down the esophagus. This feeling will go away shortly. You may also be given medicine (anesthesia) so that you will sleep lightly for this test."}

If you are asleep, you will not feel any discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to detect infection within the\nbiliary system\n. The biliary system creates, moves, stores, and releases bile to help in digestion.\nNormal Results\nThe test result is normal if no bacteria, virus, or fungus grew in the laboratory dish.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result means bacteria, fungus, or a virus grew in the laboratory dish. This may be a sign of infection.\nRisks\nRisks depend on the method used to take a sample of the bile. Your provider can explain these risks.\nAlternative Names\nCulture - bile\nImages\nBile culture\nERCP\nReferences\nKim AY, Chung RT.
