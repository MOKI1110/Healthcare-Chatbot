Infants may lose all of their hearing or just part of it.\nCauses\nAlthough it is not common, some infants may have some hearing loss at birth. Hearing loss can also develop in children who had normal hearing as infants.\nThe loss can occur in one or both ears. It may be mild, moderate, severe, or profound. Profound hearing loss is what most people call deafness.\nSometimes, hearing loss gets worse over time. Other times, it stays stable and does not get worse.\nRisk factors for infant hearing loss include:\nFamily history of hearing loss\nLow birth weight\nHearing loss may occur when there is a problem in the outer or middle ear. These problems may slow or prevent sound waves from passing through."}

These problems may slow or prevent sound waves from passing through. They include:\nBirth defects that cause changes in the structure of the ear canal or middle ear\nBuildup of\near wax\nBuildup of fluid behind the eardrum\nInjury to or rupture of the eardrum\nObjects stuck in the ear canal\nScar on the eardrum from many infections\nAnother type of hearing loss is due to a problem with the inner ear. It may occur when the tiny hair cells (nerve endings) that move sound through the ear are damaged. This type of hearing loss can be caused by:\nExposure to certain toxic chemicals or medicines while in the womb or after birth\nGenetic disorders\nInfections the mother passes to her baby in the womb (such as\ntoxoplasmosis\n,\nmeasles\n, or herpes)\nInfections that can damage the brain after birth, such as meningitis or measles\nProblems with the structure of the inner ear\nTumors\nCentral hearing loss results from damage to the auditory nerve itself, or the brain pathways that lead to the nerve."}

Central hearing loss is rare in infants and children.\nSymptoms\nSigns of hearing loss in infants vary by age. For example:\nA newborn baby with hearing loss may not startle when there is a loud noise nearby.\nOlder infants, who should respond to familiar voices, may show no reaction when spoken to.\nChildren should be using single words by 15 months, and simple 2-word sentences by age 2. If they do not reach these milestones, the cause may be hearing loss.\nSome children may not be diagnosed with hearing loss until they are in school. This is true even if they were born with hearing loss. Inattention and falling behind in class work may be signs of undiagnosed hearing loss.\nExams and Tests\nHearing loss makes a baby unable to hear sounds below a certain level. A baby with normal hearing will hear sounds below that level.\nThe health care provider will examine your child."}

A baby with normal hearing will hear sounds below that level.\nThe health care provider will examine your child. The exam may show bone problems or signs of genetic changes that may cause hearing loss.\nThe provider will use an instrument called an otoscope to see inside your child's ear canal. This allows the provider to see the eardrum and find problems that may cause hearing loss.\nTwo common tests are used to screen newborn infants for hearing loss:\nAuditory brain stem response (ABR) test. This test uses patches, called electrodes, to see how the auditory nerve reacts to sound.\nOtoacoustic emissions (OAE) test. Microphones placed into the baby's ears detect nearby sounds. The sounds should echo in the ear canal. If there is no echo, it is a sign of hearing loss.\nOlder babies and young children can be taught to respond to sounds through play. These tests, known as visual response audiometry and play audiometry, can better determine the child's range of hearing.\nTreatment\nOver 30 states in the United States require newborn hearing screenings."}

Treating hearing loss early can allow many infants to develop normal language skills without delay. In infants born with hearing loss, treatments should start as early as age 6 months.\nTreatment depends on the baby's overall health and the cause of hearing loss. Treatment may include:\nSpeech therapy\nLearning sign language\nCochlear implant\n(for those with profound sensorineural hearing loss)\nTreating the cause of hearing loss may include:\nMedicines for infections\nEar tubes\nfor repeated ear infections\nSurgery to correct structural problems\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIt is often possible to treat hearing loss that is caused by problems in the middle ear with medicines or surgery. There is no cure for hearing loss caused by damage to the inner ear or nerves.\nHow well your child does depends on the cause and severity of the hearing loss."}

Even infants with profound hearing loss can do well with the right combination of treatments.\nIf the baby has a disorder that affects more than hearing, the outlook depends on what other symptoms and problems the baby has.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your baby or young child displays signs of hearing loss, such as not reacting to loud noises, not making or mimicking noises, or not speaking at the expected age.\nIf your child has a cochlear implant, contact your provider  right away  if your child develops a fever, stiff neck, headache, or an ear infection.\nPrevention\nIt is not possible to prevent all cases of hearing loss in infants.\nWomen who are planning to become pregnant should make sure they are current on all vaccinations.\nPregnant women should check with their provider be"}
