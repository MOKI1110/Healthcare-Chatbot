Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAbdominal thrusts\nAbdominal thrusts\nChoking is when someone is having a very hard time breathing because food, a toy, or other object is blocking the throat or windpipe (airway).\nA choking person's airway may be blocked so that not enough oxygen reaches the lungs. Without oxygen, brain damage can occur in as little as 4 to 6 minutes. Rapid first aid for choking can save a person's life.\nAbdominal thrusts is an emergency technique to help clear someone's airway.\nThe procedure is done on someone who is\nchoking and also conscious\n.\nMost experts do not recommend abdominal thrusts for infants less than 1 year old.\nYou can also perform the maneuver on\nyourself\n.\nFirst Aid\nFirst ask, \"Are you choking? Can you speak?\" Do not perform first aid if the person is coughing forcefully and is able to speak. A strong cough can often dislodge the object.\nIf the person is choking, perform abdominal thrusts as follows:\nIf the person is sitting or standing, position yourself behind the person and reach your arms around their waist."}
