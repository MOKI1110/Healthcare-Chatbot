Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nWrist arthroscopy\nWrist arthroscopy\nWrist arthroscopy is surgery that uses a tiny camera and surgical tools to examine or repair the tissues inside or around your wrist. The camera is called an arthroscope. The procedure allows your surgeon to detect problems and make repairs to the wrist without making larger cuts in the skin and tissue. This means that you may have less pain and recover more quickly than open surgery.\nDescription\nYou may receive general anesthesia before this surgery. This means you will be asleep and unable to feel pain. Or, you will have regional anesthesia. This means your arm and wrist area will be numbed so that you do not feel any pain. If you receive regional anesthesia, you will also be given medicine to make you very sleepy during the operation.\nDuring the procedure, the surgeon does the following:\nInserts the arthroscope into your wrist through a small incision. The scope is connected to a video monitor in the operating room. This allows the surgeon to view the inside of your wrist.\nInspects all the tissues of your wrist."}

The scope is connected to a video monitor in the operating room. This allows the surgeon to view the inside of your wrist.\nInspects all the tissues of your wrist. These tissues include cartilage, bones, tendons, and ligaments.\nRepairs any damaged tissues. To do this, your surgeon makes 1 to 3 more small incisions and inserts other instruments through them. A tear in a muscle, tendon, or cartilage is fixed. Any damaged tissue is removed.\nAt the end of the surgery, the incisions will be closed with stitches and covered with a dressing (bandage). Most surgeons take pictures from the video monitor during the procedure to show you what they found and what repairs they made.\nYour surgeon may need to do open surgery if there is a lot of damage. Open surgery means you will have a large incision so that the surgeon can get directly to your bones and tissues.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nYou might need wrist arthroscopy if you have one of these problems or procedures:\nWrist pain\n. Arthroscopy allows the surgeon to explore what is causing your wrist pain.\nGanglion removal\n. This is a small, fluid-filled sac that grows from the wrist joint."}

Arthroscopy allows the surgeon to explore what is causing your wrist pain.\nGanglion removal\n. This is a small, fluid-filled sac that grows from the wrist joint. It is harmless, but it can be painful and can limit your ability to move your wrist freely.\nLigament tears. A ligament is a band of tissue that connects bone to bone. Several ligaments in the wrist help keep it stable and allow it to move. Torn ligaments can be repaired with this type of surgery.\nTriangular fibrocartilage complex (TFCC) tear. The TFCC is a cartilage area in the wrist. Injury to the TFCC can cause pain on the outer aspect of the wrist. Arthroscopy can repair damage of the TFCC.\nCarpal tunnel release\n. Carpal tunnel syndrome occurs when the nerve that passes through certain bones and tissues in your wrist becomes swollen and irritated. With arthroscopy the area through which this nerve passes can be made larger to relieve the pressure and pain.\nWrist fractures. Arthroscopy can be used to remove small bits of bone and help realign the bones in your wrist.\nArthritis."}
