Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nOpisthotonos\nOpisthotonos\nOpisthotonos is a condition in which a person holds their body in an abnormal position. The person is usually rigid and arches their back, with their head thrown backward. If a person with opisthotonos lies on their back, only the back of their head and heels touch the surface they are on.\nConsiderations\nOpisthotonos is much more common in infants and children than in adults. It is also more extreme in infants and children because of their less mature nervous systems.\nCauses\nOpisthotonos may occur in infants with\nmeningitis\n. This is an infection of the meninges, the membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. Viruses,\nmalaria\n, and syphilis are infections associated with opisthotonos."}
