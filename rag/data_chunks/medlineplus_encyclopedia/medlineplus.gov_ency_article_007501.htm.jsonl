Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTests for H pylori\nTests for H pylori\nHelicobacter pylori\n(\nH pylori\n) is the bacteria (germ) responsible for most stomach (gastric) and duodenal ulcers and many cases of stomach inflammation (chronic\ngastritis\n).\nHow the Test is Performed\nThere are several methods to test for\nH pylori\ninfection.\nBreath Test (Carbon Isotope-urea Breath Test, or UBT)\nUp to 2 weeks before the test, you need to stop taking antibiotics, bismuth medicines such as Pepto-Bismol, and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs).\nDuring the test, you swallow a special substance that has urea. Urea is a waste product the body produces as it breaks down protein. The urea used in the test has been made harmlessly radioactive.\nIf\nH pylori\nare present, the bacteria convert the urea into carbon dioxide, which is detected and recorded in your exhaled breath after 10 minutes.\nThis test can identify almost all people who have\nH pylori\n. It can also be used to check that the infection has been fully treated.\nBlood Tests\nBlood tests are used to measure\nantibodies\nto\nH pylori\n."}

It can also be used to check that the infection has been fully treated.\nBlood Tests\nBlood tests are used to measure\nantibodies\nto\nH pylori\n. Antibodies are proteins made by the body's immune system when it detects harmful substances such as bacteria.\nBlood tests for\nH pylori\ncan only tell if your body has\nH pylori\nantibodies. It cannot tell if you have a current infection or how long you have had it. This is because the test can be positive for years, even if the infection is cured. As a result, blood tests cannot be used to see if the infection has been cured after treatment.\nStool Test\nA stool test can detect traces of\nH pylori\nin the feces.\nThis test can be used to diagnose the infection and confirm that it has been cured after treatment.\nBiopsy\nA tissue sample, called a\nbiopsy\n, is taken from the stomach lining. This is the most accurate way to tell if you have an\nH pylori\ninfection.\nTo remove the tissue sample, you have a procedure called\nesophagogastroduodenoscopy\n(EGD). The procedure is done in the hospital or outpatient center.\nUsually, a biopsy is done if EGD is needed for other reasons."}

Reasons include diagnosing the ulcer, treating bleeding, or making sure there is no cancer.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nTesting is most often done to diagnose\nH pylori\ninfection:\nIf you currently have a stomach or duodenal ulcer\nIf you had a stomach or duodenal ulcer in the past, and were never tested for\nH pylori\nAfter treatment for\nH pylori\ninfection, to make sure there are no more of these bacteria\nTesting may also be done if you need to take long-term ibuprofen or other NSAID medicines. Your health care provider can tell you more.\nThe test may also be recommended for a condition called\ndyspepsia\n(indigestion). This is upper abdominal discomfort. Symptoms include a feeling of fullness or of heat, burning, or pain in the area between the navel and the lower part of the breastbone during or after eating."}

This is upper abdominal discomfort. Symptoms include a feeling of fullness or of heat, burning, or pain in the area between the navel and the lower part of the breastbone during or after eating. Testing for\nH pylori\nwithout EGD is most often done only when the discomfort is new, the person is younger than 55, and there are no other symptoms.\nNormal Results\nNormal results mean there is no sign that you have an\nH pylori\ninfection.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results mean that you have an\nH pylori\ninfection.
