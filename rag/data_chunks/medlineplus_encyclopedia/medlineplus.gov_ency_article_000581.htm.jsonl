Lymph tissue is found in the lymph nodes, spleen, and other organs of the immune system.\nWhite blood cells, called lymphocytes, are found in lymph tissue. They help prevent infections. Most lymphomas start in a type of white blood cell called the B lymphocyte, or B cell.\nCauses\nFor most people, the cause of NHL is unknown. But lymphomas may develop in people with weakened immune systems, including people who have had an organ transplant or people with HIV infection or Epstein-Barr virus infection.\nNHL most often affects adults. Men develop NHL more often than women. Children can also develop some forms of NHL.\nThere are many types of NHL. One classification (grouping) is by how fast the cancer spreads."}

Men develop NHL more often than women. Children can also develop some forms of NHL.\nThere are many types of NHL. One classification (grouping) is by how fast the cancer spreads. The cancer may be low grade (slow growing), intermediate grade, or high grade (fast growing).\nNHL is further grouped by how the cancer cells look under the microscope, what type of white blood cell it originates from, what special tests show about it, and whether there are certain DNA changes (gene variants) in the tumor cells themselves.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms depend on what area of the body is affected by the cancer and how fast the cancer is growing.\nSymptoms may include:\nNight sweats\nFatigue\nFever and chills that come and go\nItching\nSwollen lymph nodes\nin the neck, underarms, groin, or other areas\nWeight loss\nCoughing or shortness of breath if the cancer affects the thymus gland or lymph nodes in the chest, putting pressure on the windpipe (trachea) or its branches\nAbdominal pain or swelling, leading to loss of appetite, constipation, nausea, and vomiting\nHeadache, concentration problems, personality changes, or\nseizures\nif the cancer affects the brain\nExams and Tests\nYour health care p"}

This is called\nstaging\n. Staging helps guide future treatment and follow-up.\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on:\nThe specific type of NHL\nThe stage when you are first diagnosed\nYour age and overall health\nSymptoms, including weight loss, fever, and night sweats\nYou may receive\nchemotherapy\n,\nradiation therapy\n, or both.

Or you may not need immediate treatment. Your provider can tell you more about your specific treatment.\nRadioimmunotherapy may be used in some cases. This involves linking a radioactive substance to an antibody that targets the cancerous cells and injecting the substance into the body.\nA type of chemotherapy called\ntargeted therapy\nmay be tried. It uses a medicine to focus on specific targets (molecules) in or on cancer cells. Using these targets, the medicine disables the cancer cells so they cannot spread.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy may be given when NHL recurs or fails to respond to the first treatment administered. This is followed by an autologous\nstem cell transplant\n(using your own stem cells) to rescue (rebuild) the bone marrow after the high-dose chemotherapy. Stem cells from donors can also be used. With certain types of NHL, these treatment steps are used at first remission to try and achieve a cure."}

CAR-T cell therapy (a form of\nimmunotherapy\n) can be used if lymphoma comes back or does not respond to other treatments.\nBlood transfusions or platelet transfusions may be required if blood counts are low.\nYou and your provider may need to manage other concerns during your lymphoma treatment, including:\nHaving chemotherapy at home\nManaging your pets\nduring chemotherapy\nBleeding problems\nDry mouth\nEating enough calories\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\ncancer support group\n. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nLow-grade NHL often cannot be cured by chemotherapy alone. Low-grade NHL progresses slowly and may take many years before the disease gets worse or even requires treatment. The need for treatment is usually determined by the type of lymphoma, symptoms, and how fast the disease is progressing.\nChemotherapy may cure many types of high-grade lymphomas."}

These include:\nAutoimmune hemolytic anemia\n, a condition in which red blood cells are destroyed by the immune system\nInfection\nSide effects of chemotherapy medicines\nKeep following up with a provider who knows about monitoring and preventing these complications.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of this disorder.\nIf you have NHL, contact your provider if you experience persistent fever or other signs of infection.\nAlternative Names\nLymphoma - non-Hodgkin; Lymphocytic lymphoma; Histiocytic lymphoma; Lymphoblastic lymphoma; Cancer - non-Hodgkin lymphoma; NHL; Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma\nPatient Instructions\nBone marrow transplant - discharge\nChemotherapy - what to ask your doctor\nRadiation therapy - questions to ask your doctor\nImages\nLymphoma, malignant - CT scan\nImmune system st"}
