Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nQuantitative Bence-Jones protein test\nQuantitative Bence-Jones protein test\nThis test measures the level of abnormal proteins called Bence-Jones proteins in the urine.\nHow the Test is Performed\nclean-catch urine sample\nis needed. The clean-catch method is used to prevent germs from the penis or vagina from getting into a urine sample. To collect your urine, your health care provider may give you a special clean-catch kit that contains a cleansing solution and sterile wipes. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate.\nThe sample is sent to the lab. There are many methods used to detect Bence-Jones proteins. One method, called\nimmunoelectrophoresis\n, is the most accurate.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination, and there is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nBence-Jones proteins are a part of regular\nantibodies\ncalled light chains. These proteins are not normally in urine. Sometimes, when your body makes too many antibodies, the level of light chains also rises."}

Bence-Jones proteins are small enough to be filtered out by the kidneys. The proteins then spill into the urine.\nYour provider may order this test:\nTo diagnose conditions that lead to protein in the urine\nIf you have a lot of protein in your urine\nIf you have signs of a blood cancer called\nmultiple myeloma\nNormal Results\nA normal result means no Bence-Jones proteins are found in your urine.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nBence-Jones proteins are rarely found in urine."}
