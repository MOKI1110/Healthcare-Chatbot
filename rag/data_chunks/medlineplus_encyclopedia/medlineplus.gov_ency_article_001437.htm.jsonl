Autonomic nerves manage body functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, sweating, bowel and bladder emptying, and digestion. The tumors are usually noncancerous (\nbenign\n).\nGanglioneuromas usually occur in people over 10 years of age. They grow slowly, and may release certain chemicals or hormones.\nThere are no known risk factors. However, the tumors may be associated with some genetic problems, such as\nneurofibromatosis type 1\n.\nSymptoms\nA ganglioneuroma usually causes no symptoms."}

However, the tumors may be associated with some genetic problems, such as\nneurofibromatosis type 1\n.\nSymptoms\nA ganglioneuroma usually causes no symptoms. The tumor is only discovered when a person is examined or treated for another condition.\nSymptoms depend on the location of the tumor and the type of chemicals it releases.\nIf the tumor is in the chest area (mediastinum), symptoms may include:\nBreathing difficulty\nChest pain\nCompression of the windpipe (trachea)\nIf the tumor is lower down in the abdomen in the area called the retroperitoneal space, symptoms may include:\nAbdominal or back pain\nBloating\nIf the tumor is near the spinal cord, it may cause:\nCompression of the spinal cord, which leads to pain and loss of strength or feeling in the legs, arms, or both\nSpine deformity\nThese tumors may produce certain hormones, which can cause the following symptoms:\nDiarrhea\nHigh blood pressure\nIncreased body hair\nExams and Tests\nThe best tests to identify a ganglioneuroma are:\nCT scan\nof the chest, abdomen, and pelvis\nMRI scan\nof the chest and abdomen\nUltrasound of the abdomen or pelvis\nBlood and urine tests may be done to determine if the tu"}

The expected outcome is usually good.\nPossible Complications\nIf the tumor has been present for a long time and has pressed on the spinal cord or caused other symptoms, surgery to remove the tumor may not reverse the damage. Compression of the spinal cord may result in loss of movement (paralysis), especially if the cause is not detected promptly.\nSurgery to remove the tumor may also lead to complications in some cases."}
