This causes symptoms to occur throughout the body.\nCauses\nHeart failure is most often a long-term (chronic) condition, but it may come on suddenly. It can be caused by many different heart problems.\nThe condition may affect only the right side or only the left side of the heart. Both sides of the heart also can be involved.\nHeart failure may be due to two different problems with the heart muscle:\nYour heart muscle cannot contract very well. This is called systolic heart failure, or heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).\nYour heart muscle is stiff and does not fill up with blood easily even though pumping power is normal. This is called diastolic heart failure, or heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).\nAs the heart's pumping becomes less effective, blood may back up in other areas of the body."}

This is called diastolic heart failure, or heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF).\nAs the heart's pumping becomes less effective, blood may back up in other areas of the body. Fluid may build up in the lungs, liver, gastrointestinal tract, and the arms and legs. This is called congestive heart failure or, more simply, just heart failure.\nThe most common causes of heart failure are:\nCoronary artery disease (CAD), a narrowing or blockage of the arteries that supply blood and oxygen to the heart. This can weaken the heart muscle over time or suddenly.\nHigh blood pressure that is not well controlled, leading to problems with stiffness of the heart muscle, or eventually leading to heart muscle weakening.\nOther heart problems that may cause heart failure are:\nCongenital heart disease\nHeart attack (when coronary artery disease results in a sudden blockage of a heart artery)\nHeart valves that are leaky or narrowed\nInfection that weakens the heart muscle\nSome types of abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias)\nOther diseases that can cause or contribute to heart failure:\nAmyloidosis\nEmphysema\nOveractive thyroid\nSarcoidosis\nSevere anemia\nToo much iron in the body (usually d"}

At first, they may only occur when you are very active. Over time, you may notice breathing problems and other symptoms even when you are resting. Symptoms may also appear suddenly after the heart is damaged from a heart attack or other problem.\nCommon symptoms are:\nCough\nFatigue, weakness, faintness\nLoss of appetite\nNeed to urinate at night\nPulse that feels fast or irregular, or a sensation of feeling the heartbeat (palpitations)\nShortness of breath when you are active or after you lie down\nSwollen (enlarged) liver or abdomen\nSwollen feet and ankles\nWaking up from sleep after a couple of hours due to shortness of breath\nWeight gain\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you for signs of heart failure:\nFast or difficult breathing\nLeg swelling (edema)\nNeck veins that stick out (are distended)\nSounds (crackles) from fluid buildup in your lungs, heard through a stet"}

Your provider will use it to guide your treatment.\nOther imaging tests can look at how well your heart is able to pump blood, and how much the heart muscle is damaged.\nMany blood tests may also be used to:\nHelp diagnose and monitor heart failure\nIdentify risks for various types of heart disease\nLook for possible causes of heart failure, or problems that may make your heart failure worse\nMonitor for side effects of medicines you may be taking\nTreatment\nMONITORING AND SELF CARE\nIf you have heart failure, your provider will monitor you closely.

At home, watch for changes in your heart rate, pulse, blood pressure, and weight.\nWeight gain, especially over a day or two, can be a sign that your body is holding on to extra fluid and your heart failure is getting worse. Talk to your provider about what you should do if your weight goes up or you develop more symptoms.\nLimit how much salt you eat. Your provider may also ask you to limit how much fluid you drink during the day.\nOther important changes to make in your lifestyle:\nAsk your provider how much alcohol you may drink.\nDO NOT smoke\nor use tobacco.\nStay active.

It is very important that you take your medicine as your health care team directs.\nThese medicines may:\nHelp the heart muscle pump better\nKeep your blood from clotting\nLower your cholesterol levels\nOpen up blood vessels or slow your heart rate so your heart does not have to work as hard\nReduce damage to the heart\nReduce the risk for abnormal heart rhythms\nReplace potassium\nRid your body of excess fluid and salt (sodium)\nIt is very important that you take your medicine as directed."}
