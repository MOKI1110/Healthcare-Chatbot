Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis\nA slipped capital femoral epiphysis is a separation of the ball of the hip joint from the thigh bone (femur) at the upper growing end (growth plate) of the bone.\nCauses\nA slipped capital femoral epiphysis may affect both hips.\nAn epiphysis is an area at the end of a\nlong bone\n. It is separated from the main part of the bone by the growth plate. In this condition, the problem occurs in the upper area while the bone is still growing.\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis occurs in about 2 out of every 100,000 children."}

In this condition, the problem occurs in the upper area while the bone is still growing.\nSlipped capital femoral epiphysis occurs in about 2 out of every 100,000 children. It is more common in:\nGrowing children ages 11 to 15, especially boys\nChildren who are obese\nChildren who are growing rapidly\nChildren with hormone imbalances, such as hypothyroidism, caused by other conditions are at higher risk for this disorder.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nDifficulty walking\n, walking with a limp that came on quickly with or without trauma\nKnee pain\nHip pain\nHip stiffness\nOutward-turning leg\nRestricted hip movements\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will examine you. A hip or\npelvis x-ray\ncan confirm this condition.\nTreatment\nSurgery to stabilize the bone with pins or screws will prevent the ball of the hip joint from slipping or moving out of place. At times, the hip joint has to be opened up to allow the surgeon to realign the hip. Some surgeons may suggest using pins on the other hip at the same time. This is because many children will develop this problem in that hip later.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome is most often good with treatment."}

This is because many children will develop this problem in that hip later.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome is most often good with treatment. In rare cases, the hip joint may wear away, despite prompt diagnosis and treatment.\nPossible Complications\nThis disorder is linked to a greater risk for\nosteoarthritis\nlater in life. Other potential but rare complications include reduced blood flow to the hip joint and wearing away of hip joint tissue (avascular necrosis). This can lead to increased pain and stiffness of the joint, even at a young age.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIf your child has ongoing pain or other symptoms of this disorder, have them lie down right away and stay still until you get medical help.\nPrevention\nWeight control for obese children may be helpful. Many cases are not preventable.\nAlternative Names\nFemoral epiphysis - slipped\nImages\nFemoral fracture\nReferences\nSankar WN, Winell JJ, Horn BD, Wells L. The hip.
