This means the heart, brain, and other parts of the body may not get enough blood. In adults, the normal blood pressure is between 90/60 mmHg and 120/80 mmHg.\nThe medical word for low blood pressure is hypotension.\nCauses\nBlood pressure varies from one person to another and also over time for any given person. A drop of as little as 20 mmHg can cause problems for some people. There are different types and causes of low blood pressure.\nSevere hypotension (shock) can be caused by sudden loss of blood (\nshock\n), severe infection,\nheart attack\n, or severe allergic reaction (\nanaphylaxis\n).\nOrthostatic hypotension means your blood pressure drops when you shift from lying down to standing. This type of low blood pressure usually lasts only a few seconds or minutes. If this type of low blood pressure occurs after eating, it is called postprandial orthostatic hypotension."}

This type most often affects older adults, those with high blood pressure, and people with\nParkinson disease\n.\nNeurally mediated hypotension (NMH) most often affects young adults and children. It can occur when a person has been standing for a long time. Children usually outgrow this type of hypotension.\nCertain medicines and substances can lead to low blood pressure, including:\nAlcohol\nAnti-anxiety medicines\nCertain antidepressants\nDiuretics\nHeart medicines, including those used to treat\nhigh blood pressure\nand\ncoronary heart disease\nMedicines used for surgery\nPainkillers\nOther causes of low blood pressure include:\nNerve damage from diabetes\nor other disorders\nChanges in heart rhythm (\narrhythmias\n)\nNot drinking enough fluids (\ndehydration\n)\nHeart failure\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of low blood pressure may include:\nBlurry vision\nConfusion\nDizziness\nFainting\n(syncope)\nLightheadedness\nNausea or vomiting\nSleepiness\nWeakness\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you to determine"}
