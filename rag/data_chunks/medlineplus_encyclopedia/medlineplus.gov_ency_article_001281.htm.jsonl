Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nParaphimosis\nParaphimosis\nParaphimosis occurs when the foreskin of an uncircumcised male cannot be pulled back over the head of the penis.\nCauses\nCauses of paraphimosis include:\nInjury to the penis.\nFailure to return the foreskin to its normal location after urination or washing. This is more common in hospitals and nursing homes.\nInfection, which may be due to not washing the area well.\nMen who have not been circumcised and those who may not have been correctly circumcised are at risk.\nParaphimosis occurs most often in boys and older men.\nSymptoms\nThe foreskin is pulled back (retracted) behind the rounded tip of the penis (glans) and stays there. The retracted foreskin and glans become swollen. This makes it difficult to return the foreskin to its extended position.\nSymptoms include:\nInability to pull the retracted foreskin forward over the head of the penis\nPainful swelling at the end of the penis\nPain in the penis\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam confirms the diagnosis."}

The health care provider will usually find a \"doughnut\" around the shaft near the head of the penis (glans).\nTreatment\nPressing on the head of the penis while pushing the foreskin forward may reduce the swelling. If this fails, prompt surgical\ncircumcision\nor other surgery to relieve swelling will be needed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome is likely to be excellent if the condition is diagnosed and treated quickly.\nPossible Complications\nIf paraphimosis is left untreated, it can disrupt blood flow to the tip of the penis. In extreme (and rare) cases, this may lead to:\nDamage to the penis tip\nGangrene\nLoss of the penis tip\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nGo to your local emergency room if this occurs.\nPrevention\nReturning the foreskin to its normal position after pulling it back may help prevent this condition.\nCircumcision, when done correctly, prevents this condition.\nImages\nPenis - with and without foreskin\nReferences\nBoswell B, Thomas AA."}
