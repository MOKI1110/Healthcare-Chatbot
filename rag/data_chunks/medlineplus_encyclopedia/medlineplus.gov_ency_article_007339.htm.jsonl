The surgeon controls the robotic arm with a computer.\nDescription\nOften, you will be given\ngeneral anesthesia\nso that you are asleep and pain-free.\nThe surgeon sits at a computer station and directs the movements of a robot. Small surgical tools are attached to the robot's arms.\nThe surgeon makes small cuts to insert the instruments into your body.\nA thin tube with a camera attached to the end of it (laparoscope) allows the surgeon to view enlarged 3-D images of your body as the surgery is taking place.\nThe robot matches the surgeon's hand movements to perform the procedure using the tiny instruments.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nRobotic surgery is similar to laparoscopic surgery. It can be performed through smaller cuts than open surgery."}

It can be performed through smaller cuts than open surgery. The small, precise movements that are possible with this type of surgery give it some advantages over standard\nlaparoscopic\ntechniques.\nThe surgeon can make small, precise movements using this method. This can allow the surgeon to do a procedure through a small cut that once could be done only with open surgery.\nOnce the robotic arm is placed in the abdomen, it is easier for the surgeon to use the surgical tools than with laparoscopic surgery through a laparoscope.\nThe surgeon can also see the area where the surgery is performed more easily. This method also allows the surgeon to move in a more comfortable way.\nRobotic surgery can take longer to perform. This is due to the amount of time needed to set up the robot. Also, some hospitals may not have access to this method."}

This is due to the amount of time needed to set up the robot. Also, some hospitals may not have access to this method. However, it is becoming more common.\nRobotic surgery may be used for a number of different procedures, including:\nCoronary artery bypass\nCutting away cancer tissue from sensitive parts of the body such as blood vessels, nerves, or important body organs\nGallbladder removal\nHip replacement\nHysterectomy\nTotal or partial kidney removal\nKidney transplant\nMitral valve repair\nPyeloplasty (surgery to correct\nureteropelvic junction obstruction\n)\nPyloroplasty\nRadical prostatectomy\nRadical cystectomy\nTubal ligation\nRobotic surgery cannot always be used or be the best method of surgery for a specific problem.\nRisks\nThe risks of any anesthesia and surgery include:\nReactions to medicines\nBreathing problems\nBleeding\nInfection\nHeart problems\nRobotic surgery has as many risks as open and laparoscopic surgery."}

However, the risks are different.\nBefore the Procedure\nYou cannot have any food or fluid for 8 hours before the surgery.\nYou may need to cleanse your bowels with an enema or laxative the day before surgery for some types of procedures.\nStop taking aspirin, blood thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin) or clopidogrel (Plavix), anti-inflammatory medicines, vitamins, or other supplements 10 days before the procedure.\nAfter the Procedure\nYou will be taken to a recovery room after the procedure. Depending on the type of surgery performed, you may have to stay in the hospital overnight or for a couple of days.\nYou should be able to walk within a day after the procedure. How soon you are active will depend on the surgery that was done.\nAvoid heavy lifting or straining until your surgeon gives you the OK. Your surgeon may tell you not to drive for at least a week.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSurgical cuts are smaller than with traditional open surgery."}
