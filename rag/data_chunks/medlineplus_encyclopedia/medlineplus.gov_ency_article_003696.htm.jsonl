Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nACTH stimulation test\nACTH stimulation test\nThe ACTH stimulation test measures how well the adrenal glands respond to adrenocorticotropic hormone (\nACTH\n). ACTH is a hormone produced in the pituitary gland that stimulates the\nadrenal glands\nto release a hormone called cortisol.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is done the following way:\nYour blood is drawn.\nYou then receive a shot (injection) of ACTH, usually into the muscle in your shoulder. The ACTH may be a man-made (synthetic) form.\nAfter either 30 minutes or 60 minutes, or both, depending on how much ACTH you receive, your blood is drawn again.\nThe lab checks the cortisol level in all the blood samples.\nYou may also have other blood tests, including\nACTH\n, as part of the first blood test. Along with the blood tests, you may also have a\nurine cortisol test\nor\nurine 17-ketosteroids test\n, which involves collecting the urine over a\n24-hour period\n."}

Sometimes the test is done to measure a different hormone called 17-hydroxy progesterone.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may need to limit activities and eat foods that are high in carbohydrates 12 to 24 hours before the test. You may be asked to fast for 6 hours before the test. Sometimes, no special preparation is needed. You may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines, such as hydrocortisone, which can interfere with the cortisol blood test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nThe injection into the shoulder may cause moderate pain or stinging.\nSome people feel flushed, nervous, or nauseated after the injection of ACTH.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test can help determine whether your adrenal and pituitary glands are normal."}

It is most often used when your health care provider thinks you have an adrenal gland problem, such as\nAddison disease\n, or\npituitary insufficiency\n. It is also used to see if your pituitary and adrenal glands have recovered from prolonged use of glucocorticoid medicines, such as prednisone or dexamethasone.\nNormal Results\nAn increase in cortisol after stimulation by ACTH is expected. Cortisol level after ACTH stimulation should be higher than 13 to 14 mcg/dL (358 to 386 nmol/L) depending on the type of cortisol assay used and, on the dose of ACTH used.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThis test is helpful in finding out if you have:\nAcute adrenal crisis\n(life-threatening condition that occurs when there is not enough cortisol)\nAddison disease (adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol)\nHypopituitarism\n(pituitary gland is not producing enough hormones such as ACTH)\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.
