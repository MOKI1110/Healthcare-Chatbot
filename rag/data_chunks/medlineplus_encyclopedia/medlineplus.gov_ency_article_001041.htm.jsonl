The infection may be due to bacteria or viruses.\nThere are 3 pairs of major salivary glands:\nParotid glands -- These are the two largest glands. One is located in each cheek over the jaw in front of the ears. Inflammation of one or more of these glands is called parotitis, or parotiditis.\nSubmandibular glands -- These two glands are located just under both sides of the lower jaw and carry saliva up to the floor of the mouth under the tongue.\nSublingual glands -- These two glands are located just under the front most area of the floor of the mouth.\nAll of the salivary glands empty saliva into the mouth. The saliva enters the mouth through ducts that open into the mouth in different places.\nCauses\nSalivary gland infections are somewhat common, and they can return in some people.\nViral infections, such as\nmumps\n, often affect the salivary glands. (Mumps most often involves the parotid salivary gland)."}

Antibiotics are not useful against viral infections.\nSurgery or\naspiration\nto drain an abscess if you have one.\nA technique called sialendoscopy uses a very small camera and instruments to diagnose and treat infections and other problems in the salivary glands.\nSelf-care steps you can take at home to help with recovery include:\nPractice good oral hygiene. Brush your teeth and floss well at least twice a day."}
