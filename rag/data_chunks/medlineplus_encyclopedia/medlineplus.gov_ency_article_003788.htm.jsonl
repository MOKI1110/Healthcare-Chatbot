Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nChest CT\nChest CT\nA chest CT (computed tomography) scan is an imaging method that uses x-rays to create cross-sectional pictures of the chest and upper abdomen.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is done in the following way:\nYou'll likely be asked to change into a hospital gown.\nYou'll lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the scanner. Once you are inside the scanner, the machine's\nx-ray\nbeam rotates around you.\nYou must be still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short period of time.\nThe complete scan takes 30 seconds to a few minutes.\nCertain\nCT scans\nrequire a special dye, called contrast, to be delivered into the body before the test starts. Contrast highlights specific areas inside the body and creates a clearer image. If your health care provider requests a CT scan with intravenous contrast, you will be given it through a vein (\nIV\n) in your arm or hand. A blood test to measure your kidney function may be done before the test."}

A blood test to measure your kidney function may be done before the test. This test is to make sure your kidneys are healthy enough to filter the contrast.\nYou may be given medicine to help you relax during the test.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nTell your provider if you are pregnant. Chest CT scans are generally avoided during pregnancy, and special precautions are taken if they are needed.\nSome people have allergies to IV contrast and may need to take medicine before their test to safely receive this substance.\nIf contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.\nIf you weigh more than 300 pounds (lb) or 136 kilograms (kg), have your provider contact the scanner operator before the exam. CT scanners have an upper weight limit of 450 lb (204 kg). Some newer scanners can accommodate up to 680 lb (308 kg)."}

Because it is hard for x-rays to pass through metal, you will be asked to remove jewelry.\nHow the Test will Feel\nSome people may have discomfort from lying on the hard table.\nContrast given through an IV may cause a slight burning sensation, a metallic taste in the mouth, and a warm flushing of the body. These sensations are normal and usually go away within a few seconds.\nThere is no recovery time, unless you were given medicine to relax. After a CT scan, you can go back to your normal diet, activity, and medicines.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA CT scan quickly creates detailed pictures of the body. The test may be used to get a better view of the structures inside the chest."}

CT scans use low levels of ionizing radiation, which has the potential to cause cancer and other defects. However, the risk from any one scan is small. The risk increases as many more scans are done.\nThe most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. If a person with an iodine allergy is given this type of contrast, nausea, sneezing, vomiting, itching, or hives may occur. In rare cases, the dye can cause a life-threatening allergic response called\nanaphylaxis\n."}

Scanners come with an intercom and speakers, so the operator can hear you at all times.\nIn people with kidney problems, the dye may have harmful effects on the kidneys. In these situations, special steps may be taken to make the contrast dye safer to use.\nIn spite of its risks, a CT scan may still be done if the benefits greatly outweigh the risks. For example, it can be more risky to not have the exam if your provider thinks you might have cancer.\nAlternative Names\nThoracic CT; CT scan - lungs; CT scan - chest\nImages\nCT scan\nThyroid cancer - CT scan\nPulmonary nodule, solitary - CT scan\nLung mass, right upper lobe - CT scan\nBronchial cancer - CT scan\nLung mass, right lung - CT scan\nLung nodule, right lower lung - CT scan\nLung with squamous cell cancer - CT scan\nVertebra, thoracic (mid back)\nNormal lung anatomy\nThoracic organs\nReferences\nJokerst CE, Gotway MB."}
