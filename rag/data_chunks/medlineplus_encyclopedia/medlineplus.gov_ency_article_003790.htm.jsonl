Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRenal scan\nRenal scan\nA renal scan is a\nnuclear medicine\nexam in which a small amount of radioactive material (radioisotope) is used to measure the function of the kidneys.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe specific type of scan may vary. This article provides a general overview.\nA renal scan is similar to a\nrenal perfusion scintiscan\n. It may be done along with that test.\nYou will be asked to lie on the scanner table. The health care provider will place a tight band or blood pressure cuff on your upper arm. This creates pressure and helps your arm veins become bigger. A small amount of radioisotope is injected into a vein. The specific radioisotope used may vary, depending on what is being studied.\nThe cuff or band on the upper arm is removed, and the radioactive material moves through your blood. The kidneys are scanned a short time later. Several images are taken, each lasting 1 or 2 seconds. The scan takes about 30 minutes to 1 hour in total.\nA computer reviews the images and provides detailed information about how your kidney works."}

The scan takes about 30 minutes to 1 hour in total.\nA computer reviews the images and provides detailed information about how your kidney works. For example, it can tell your provider how much blood the kidney filters over time. A diuretic medicine (water pill) may also be injected during the test. This helps speed up the passage of radioisotope through your kidneys.\nYou should be able to go home after the scan. You may be asked to drink plenty of fluids and urinate often to help remove the radioactive material from the body.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nTell your provider if you take any nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or blood pressure medicines. These medicines might affect the test.\nYou may be asked to drink additional fluids before the scan.\nHow the Test will Feel\nSome people feel discomfort when the needle is placed into the vein. However, you will not feel the radioactive material. The scanning table may be hard and cold. You will need to lie still during the scan."}

You may feel an increased urge to urinate near the end of the test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA renal scan tells your provider how your kidneys work. It also shows their size, position, and shape. It may be done if:\nYou cannot have other x-rays using contrast (dye) material because you are sensitive or allergic to them, or you have reduced kidney function\nYou have had a kidney transplant and your provider wants to check how well the kidney is working and look for signs of rejection\nYou have high blood pressure and your provider wants to see how well your kidneys are working\nYour provider needs to confirm if a kidney that looks swollen or blocked on another imaging test is losing function\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results are a sign of reduced kidney function."}

This may be due to:\nAcute or chronic kidney failure\nChronic kidney infection\n(pyelonephritis)\nComplications of a\nkidney transplant\nGlomerulonephritis\nHydronephrosis\nInjury of the kidney and ureter\nNarrowing or blockage of the arteries that carry blood to the kidney\nObstructive uropathy\nRisks\nThere is a slight amount of radiation from the radioisotope. Most of this radiation exposure occurs to the kidneys and bladder. Almost all radiation is gone from the body in 24 hours. Caution is advised if you are pregnant or breastfeeding.\nVery rarely, a person will have an\nallergic reaction\nto the radioisotope, which may include severe\nanaphylaxis\n.\nAlternative Names\nRenogram; Kidney scan\nImages\nKidney anatomy\nKidney - blood and urine flow\nReferences\nDuddalwar VA, Jadvar H, Palmer SL.
