Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAsbestosis\nAsbestosis\nAsbestosis is a lung disease that occurs from breathing in asbestos fibers.\nCauses\nBreathing in asbestos fibers can cause scar tissue (fibrosis) to form inside the lung. Scarred lung tissue does not expand and contract normally.\nHow severe the disease is depends on:\nHow long the person was exposed to asbestos\nThe amount that was breathed in\nThe type of fibers breathed in\nOften, the symptoms aren't noticed for 20 years or more after the asbestos exposure.\nAsbestos fibers were commonly used in construction before 1975.\nAsbestos exposure occurs in asbestos mining and milling, construction, fireproofing, and other industries."}

Household members of asbestos workers can also be exposed from asbestos particles brought home on the worker's clothing.\nOther asbestos-related diseases include:\nPleural plaques\nMalignant mesothelioma\n(cancer of the pleura, the lining of the lung), which can develop 20 to 40 years after exposure\nPleural effusion\n, which is a collection of fluid that develops around the lung a few years after asbestos exposure and is benign\nLung cancer\nThese conditions can coexist with asbestosis.\nWorkers today are less likely to get asbestos-related diseases because of government regulations.\nCigarette smoking increases the risk of developing asbestos-related diseases.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nChest pain\nCough\nShortness of breath\nwith activity (slowly gets worse over time)\nTightness in the chest\nPossible other symptoms include:\nClubbing\nof fingers\nNail abnormalities\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms.\nWhen listeni"}

Stopping exposure to asbestos is essential. To ease symptoms, drainage and chest\npercussion\ncan help remove fluids from the lungs.\nYour provider may prescribe aerosol medicines to thin lung fluids. People with this condition may need to receive oxygen by mask or by a plastic piece that fits into the nostrils.

Having asbestosis makes it easier for you to develop lung infections. Talk to your provider about getting the flu, pneumonia, and other vaccines.\nIf you've been diagnosed with asbestosis, call your provider right away if you develop a cough, shortness of breath, fever, or other signs of a lung infection, especially if you think you have the flu. Since your lungs are already damaged, it's very important to have the infection treated right away. This will prevent breathing problems from becoming severe, as well as further damage to your lungs.\nPrevention\nIn people who have been exposed to asbestos for more than 10 years, screening with a chest x-ray every 3 to 5 years may detect asbestos-related diseases early. Stopping cigarette smoking can greatly reduce the risk of asbestos-related lung cancer.\nAlternative Names\nPulmonary fibrosis - from asbestos exposure; Interstitial pneumonitis - from asbestos exposure\nPatient Instructions\nInterstitial lung disease - adults - discharge\nImages\nRespiratory system\nReferences\nGo LHT, Cohen RA.
