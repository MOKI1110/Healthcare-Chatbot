When the pancreas does not produce enough trypsin and chymotrypsin, smaller-than-normal amounts can be seen in a stool sample.\nThis article discusses the test to measure trypsin and chymotrypsin in stool.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThere are several ways to collect the samples. Your health care provider will tell you how to collect the stool.\nYou can catch the stool on plastic wrap that is loosely placed over the toilet bowl and held in place by the toilet seat. Then put the sample in a clean container. One type of test kit contains a special tissue that you use to collect the sample. Then you put the sample in a clean container.\nTo collect a sample from infants and young children:\nIf the child wears a diaper, line the diaper with plastic wrap.\nPlace the plastic wrap so that urine and stool do not mix.\nA drop of stool is placed on a thin layer of special gelatin."}

This is most often due to\nchronic pancreatitis\n.\nThese tests are most often done in young children who are thought to have\ncystic fibrosis\n.\nNote: This test is used as a screening tool for cystic fibrosis, but it does not diagnose cystic fibrosis. Other tests are needed to confirm a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis.\nNormal Results\nThe result is normal if there is a normal amount of trypsin or chymotrypsin in the stool.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result means the trypsin or chymotrypsin levels in your stool are below the normal range. This may mean that your pancreas is not working properly."}
