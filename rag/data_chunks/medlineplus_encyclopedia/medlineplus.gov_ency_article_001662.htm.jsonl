However, some cases (45%) have been shown to be inherited. These are due to a change in 1 of 20 genes important for making protein correctly (the genes make ribosomal proteins).\nThis condition is similar to Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and the two conditions should considered the same. A missing piece on chromosome 19 is found in some people with Diamond-Blackfan anemia.\nThe anemia in Aase syndrome is caused by poor development of the bone marrow, which is where blood cells are formed.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nAbsent or small knuckles\nCleft palate\nDeformed ears\nDroopy eyelids\nInability to fully extend the joints from birth\nNarrow shoulders\nPale skin\nTriple-jointed thumbs\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

Tests that may be done include:\nBone marrow biopsy\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nEchocardiogram\nX-rays\nTreatment\nTreatment may involve blood transfusions in the first year of life to treat anemia.\nA steroid medicine called prednisone has also been used to treat anemia associated with Aase syndrome. However, it should only be used after reviewing the benefits and risks with a provider who has experience treating anemias.\nbone marrow transplant\nmay be necessary if other treatment fails.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe anemia tends to improve with age.\nPossible Complications\nComplications related to anemia include:\nFatigue\nDecreased oxygen in the blood\nWeakness\nHeart problems can lead to a variety of complications, depending on the specific defect.\nSevere cases of Aase syndrome have been associated with\nstillbirth\nor early death.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling is recommended if you have a family history of this syndrome and wish to become pregnant.\nAlternative Names\nAase-Smith syndrome; Hypoplastic a"}
