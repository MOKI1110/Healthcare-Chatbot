It is so thick and slippery that it usually falls off the skin or leaves the stomach and intestines without being absorbed.\nA lot of damage can occur, though, if elemental mercury gets into the air in the form of small droplets that are breathed into the lungs. This often occurs by mistake when people try to vacuum up mercury that has spilled onto the ground.\nBreathing in enough elemental mercury will cause symptoms right away. These are called acute symptoms. Long-term symptoms will occur if small amounts are inhaled over time. These are called chronic symptoms. Chronic symptoms may include:\nMetallic taste\nin the mouth\nVomiting\nDifficulty breathing\nBad cough\nSwollen, bleeding gums\nDepending on how much mercury is inhaled, permanent lung damage and death may occur. Long-term brain damage from inhaled elemental mercury can also occur.\nThere have been cases of mercury being injected under the skin, which can cause fever and rash."}

Long-term brain damage from inhaled elemental mercury can also occur.\nThere have been cases of mercury being injected under the skin, which can cause fever and rash. Infection may develop, requiring surgical drainage and removal of the mercury.\nINORGANIC MERCURY\nUnlike elemental mercury, inorganic mercury is usually poisonous when swallowed. Depending on how much is swallowed, symptoms may include:\nBurning in the stomach and throat\nBloody diarrhea and vomiting\nIf inorganic mercury enters your bloodstream, it can attack the kidneys and brain. Permanent kidney damage and kidney failure may occur. A large amount in the bloodstream may cause massive blood and fluid loss from diarrhea and kidney failure, leading to death.\nORGANIC MERCURY\nOrganic mercury can cause sickness if it is breathed in, eaten, or placed on the skin over long periods of time. Usually, organic mercury causes problems over years or decades, not right away. This means that being exposed to small amounts of organic mercury every day for years will likely cause symptoms to appear later."}

Most health care providers recommend eating less fish, especially high-mercury fish such as swordfish, while pregnant, and limiting the consumption of such fish by small children as well."}

Often, these medicines will have to be used for weeks to months.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nBreathing in a small amount of elemental mercury will cause very few, if any, long-term side effects. However, breathing in larger amounts can lead to a long hospital stay. Permanent lung damage is likely. There may be brain damage. Very large exposures will likely cause death.\nA large overdose of inorganic mercury may cause massive blood and fluid loss, kidney failure, and likely death.\nChronic brain damage from organic mercury poisoning is difficult to treat. Some people never recover, but there has been some success in people who receive chelation treatment.\nReferences\nMahajan PV. Heavy metal intoxication.
