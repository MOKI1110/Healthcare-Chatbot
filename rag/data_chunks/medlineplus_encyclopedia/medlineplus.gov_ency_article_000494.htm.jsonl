This type of kidney disease is called diabetic nephropathy.\nCauses\nEach kidney is made of hundreds of thousands of small units called nephrons. These structures filter your blood, help remove waste from the body, and regulate fluid balance.\nIn people with\ndiabetes\n, the nephrons slowly thicken and become scarred over time. The nephrons begin to leak, and protein (at first, albumin) passes into the urine. This damage can happen years before any symptoms of kidney disease begin."}
