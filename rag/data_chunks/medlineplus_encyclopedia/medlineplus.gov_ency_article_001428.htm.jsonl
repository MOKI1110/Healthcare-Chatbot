The syndrome involves\ndeafness\nand pale skin, hair, and eye color.\nCauses\nWaardenburg syndrome is most often inherited as an\nautosomal dominant\ntrait. This means only one parent needs to pass on the altered gene for a child to have this condition.\nThere are four main types of Waardenburg syndrome. The most common are type I and type II.\nType III (Klein-Waardenburg syndrome) and type IV (Waardenburg-Shah syndrome) are less common.\nThe multiple types of this syndrome result from defects in different genes."}
