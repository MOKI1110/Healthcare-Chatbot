It is closely related to the bacterium that causes syphilis, but this form of the bacterium is not sexually transmitted. Yaws mainly affects children in rural, warm, tropical areas, such as, Africa, Western Pacific islands, and Southeast Asia.\nYaws is transmitted by direct contact with the skin sores of infected people.\nSymptoms\nAbout 2 to 4 weeks after infection, the person develops a sore called a \"mother yaw\" where bacteria enter the skin. The sore may be tan or reddish and looks like a raspberry. It is most often painless, but does cause itching.\nThe sores may last for months. More sores may appear shortly before or after the mother yaw heals. Scratching the sore can spread the bacteria from the mother yaw to uninfected skin."}

More sores may appear shortly before or after the mother yaw heals. Scratching the sore can spread the bacteria from the mother yaw to uninfected skin. Eventually, the skin sores heal.\nOther symptoms include:\nBone pain\nScarring of the skin\nSwelling\nof the bones and fingers\nIn the advanced stage, sores on the skin and bones can lead to severe disfigurement and disability. This occurs in up to 1 in 5 people who do not get antibiotic treatment.\nExams and Tests\nA sample from a skin sore is examined under a special type of microscope (darkfield examination).\nThere is no blood test for yaws. However, the blood test for\nsyphilis\nis often positive in people with yaws because the bacteria that cause these two conditions are closely related.\nTreatment\nTreatment involves a single dose of penicillin, or 3 weekly doses for later stage disease. It is rare for the disease to return.\nPeople who live in the same house with someone who is infected should be examined for yaws and treated if they are infected.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf treated in its early stages, yaws can be cured."}

Skin lesions may take several months to heal.\nBy its late stage, yaws may have already caused damage to the skin and bones. It may not be fully reversible, even with treatment.\nPossible Complications\nYaws may damage the skin and bones. It can affect a person's appearance and ability to move. It can also cause deformities of the legs, nose, palate, and upper jaw.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if:\nYou or your child has sores on the skin or bone that don't go away.\nYou have stayed in tropical areas where yaws is known to occur.\nAlternative Names\nFrambesia tropica\nReferences\nDionne JA, Ghanem KG.
