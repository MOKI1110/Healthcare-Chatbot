There may not be any other symptoms or disease present. Polydactyly may be passed down in families. This trait involves only one  gene that can cause several variations.\nAfrican Americans, more than other ethnic groups, can inherit a 6th finger. In most cases, this is not caused by a genetic disease.\nPolydactyly can also occur with some genetic diseases.\nExtra digits may be poorly developed and attached by a small stalk. This most often occurs on the little finger side of the hand. Poorly formed digits are usually removed."}

Simply tying a tight string around the stalk can cause it to fall off in time if there are no bones in the digit.\nIn some cases, the extra digits may be well-formed and can even function.\nLarger digits may need surgery to be removed.\nCauses\nCauses may include:\nAsphyxiating thoracic dystrophy\nCarpenter syndrome\nEllis-van Creveld syndrome\n(chondroectodermal dysplasia)\nFamilial polydactyly\nLaurence-Moon-Biedl syndrome\nRubinstein-Taybi syndrome\nSmith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome\nTrisomy 13\nHome Care\nYou may need to take steps at home after surgery to remove an extra digit."}
