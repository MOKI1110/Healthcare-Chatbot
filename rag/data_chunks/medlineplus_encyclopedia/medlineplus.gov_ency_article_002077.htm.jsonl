This creates a difference in pressure on the two sides of the eardrum. You may feel\npressure and blockage in the ears\nas a result.\nInformation\nThe eustachian tube is a connection between the middle ear (the space behind the eardrum) and the back of the nose and upper throat. This structure connects the middle ear space to the outside world.\nSwallowing or yawning opens the eustachian tube and allows air to flow into or out of the middle ear. This helps equalize pressure on either side of the eardrum.\nSwallowing or yawning can unclog blocked ears when you are going up or coming down from high altitudes. Chewing gum the entire time you are changing altitudes helps by causing you to swallow often."}

Chewing gum the entire time you are changing altitudes helps by causing you to swallow often. This may prevent your ears from getting blocked.\nPeople who always have blocked ears when flying may want to take a decongestant about an hour before the flight leaves.\nIf your ears are blocked, you can try breathing in, then gently breathing out while holding your nostrils and mouth closed. Use care when doing this. If you breathe out too forcefully, you can cause\near infections\nby forcing bacteria into your ear canals. You can also create a hole (perforation) in your eardrum if you blow too hard.\nAlternative Names\nHigh altitudes and blocked ears; Flying and blocked ears; Eustachian tube dysfunction - high altitude\nImages\nEar anatomy\nMedical findings based on ear anatomy\nExternal and internal ear\nReferences\nPeak DA.
