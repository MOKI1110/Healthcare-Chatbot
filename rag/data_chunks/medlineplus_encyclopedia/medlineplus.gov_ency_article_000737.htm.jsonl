Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMultiple sclerosis\nMultiple sclerosis\nMultiple sclerosis (MS) is an\nautoimmune disease\nthat affects the\nbrain and spinal cord\n(central nervous system).\nCauses\nMS affects women more often than men. The disorder is most commonly diagnosed between ages 20 to 40, but it can be seen at any age.\nMS is caused by damage to the myelin sheath. This sheath is the protective covering that surrounds nerve cells. When this nerve covering is damaged, nerve signals slow or stop.\nThe nerve damage is caused by inflammation. Inflammation occurs when the body's immune cells attack the nervous system. This can occur along any area of the brain, optic nerve, and spinal cord.\nIt is unknown what exactly causes MS. The most common thought is that it is caused by a virus, a gene defect, or both."}

Environmental factors may also play a role.\nYou are slightly more likely to develop this condition if you have a family history of MS or you live in a part of the world where MS is more common (areas further from the equator).\nSymptoms\nSymptoms vary because the location and severity of each attack can be different. Attacks can last for days, weeks, or months. Attacks are followed by remissions. These are periods of reduced symptoms or no symptoms. Fever, hot baths, sun exposure, and stress can trigger or worsen attacks.\nNerves in any part of the brain or spinal cord may be damaged."}

It is often worse in the late afternoon.\nExams and Tests\nSymptoms of MS may mimic those of many other nervous system problems. MS is diagnosed by determining if there are signs of more than one attack on the brain or spinal cord and by ruling out other conditions.\nPeople who have a form of MS called relapsing-remitting MS have evidence of at least two attacks separated by a remission.\nIn other people, the disease may slowly get worse in between clear attacks. This form is called secondary progressive MS."}
