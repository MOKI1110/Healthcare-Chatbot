Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLactose intolerance\nLactose intolerance\nLactose is a type of sugar found in milk and other dairy products. An enzyme called lactase is needed by the body to digest lactose.\nLactose intolerance develops when the small intestine does not make enough of this enzyme.\nCauses\nBabies' bodies make the lactase enzyme so they can digest milk, including breast milk.\nBabies born too early (premature) sometimes have lactose intolerance.\nChildren who were born at full term often do not show signs of the problem before they are 3 years old.\nLactose intolerance is very common in adults. It is rarely dangerous. About 30 million American adults have some degree of lactose intolerance by age 20.\nIn white people, lactose intolerance often develops in children older than age 5."}

It is rarely dangerous. About 30 million American adults have some degree of lactose intolerance by age 20.\nIn white people, lactose intolerance often develops in children older than age 5. This is the age when our bodies may stop making lactase.\nIn African Americans, the problem can occur as early as age 2.\nThe condition is very common among adults with Asian, African, or Native American heritage.\nIt is less common in people of northern or western European background, but still may occur.\nAn illness that involves or injures your small intestine may cause less of the lactase enzyme to be made. Treatment of these illnesses may improve the symptoms of lactose intolerance. These may include:\nSurgery of the small intestine\nInfections in the small intestine (this is most often seen in children)\nDiseases that damage the small intestines, such as\nceliac disease\nor\nCrohn disease\nAny illness that causes diarrhea\nBabies may be born with a genetic variant, which may make them unable to make any of the lactase enzyme.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms often occur 30 minutes to 2 hours after having milk products."}

Symptoms are then assessed using a questionnaire.\nA 1 to 2 week trial of a completely lactose-free diet is also sometimes tried.\nTreatment\nCutting down your intake of milk products that contain lactose from your diet most often eases symptoms."}

Also look at food labels for hidden sources of lactose in non-milk products (including some beers) and avoid these.\nMost people with a low lactase level can drink up to one half cup of milk at one time (2 to 4 ounces or 60 to 120 milliliters) without having symptoms. Larger servings (more than 8 ounces or 240 mL) may cause problems for people with lactase deficiency.\nMilk products that may be easier to digest include:\nButtermilk and cheeses (these foods contain less lactose than milk)\nFermented milk products, such as yogurt\nGoat's milk\nAged hard cheeses\nLactose-free milk and milk products\nLactase-treated cow's milk for older children and adults\nSoy formulas for infants younger than 2 years\nSoy or rice milk for toddlers\nYou can add lactase enzymes to regular milk.

You need 1,000 to 1,500 mg of calcium each day depending on your age and sex. Some things you can do to get more calcium in your diet are:\nTake calcium supplements with Vitamin D. Talk to your health care provider about which ones to choose.\nEat foods that have more calcium (such as leafy greens, oysters, sardines, canned salmon, shrimp, and broccoli).\nDrink orange juice with added calcium.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSymptoms most often go away when you remove milk, other dairy products, and other sources of lactose from your diet."}
