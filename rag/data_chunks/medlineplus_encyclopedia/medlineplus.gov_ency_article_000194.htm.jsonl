This prevents the heart ventricles from expanding fully. The excess pressure from the fluid prevents the heart from working properly. As a result, the body does not get enough blood.\nCardiac tamponade can occur due to:\nDissecting aortic aneurysm\n(thoracic)\nEnd-stage lung cancer\nHeart attack (\nacute MI\n)\nHeart surgery\nPericarditis\ncaused by bacterial or viral infections\nWounds to the heart\nOther possible causes include:\nHeart tumors\nUnderactive thyroid gland\nKidney failure\nLeukemia\nPlacement of central lines\nRadiation therapy to the chest\nRecent invasive heart procedures\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\nDermatomyositis\nHeart failure\nCardiac tamponade due to disease occurs in about 2 out of 10,000 people.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nAnxiety\n, restlessness\nBreathing pr"}

This is known as surgical pericardiectomy or pericardial window.\nFluids are given to keep blood pressure normal until the fluid can be drained from around the heart. Medicines that increase blood pressure may also help keep the person alive until the fluid is drained.\nOxygen may be given to help reduce the workload on the heart by decreasing tissue demands for blood flow.\nThe cause of tamponade must be found and treated.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nDeath due to cardiac tamponade can occur quickly if the fluid or blood is not removed promptly from within the pericardium.\nThe outcome is often good if the condition is treated promptly. However, tamponade may come back.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nHeart failure\nPulmonary edema\nBleeding\nShock\nDeath\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nGo to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if symptoms develop."}
