Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHydatidiform mole\nHydatidiform mole\nHydatidiform mole (HM) is a rare mass or growth that forms inside the womb (uterus) at the beginning of a pregnancy. It is a type of\ngestational trophoblastic disease (GTD)\n.\nCauses\nHM, or molar pregnancy, results from abnormal fertilization of the oocyte (egg). It results in an abnormal fetus. The placenta grows normally with little or no growth of the fetal tissue. The placental tissue forms a mass in the uterus. On ultrasound, this mass often has a grape-like appearance, as it contains many small cysts.\nThe chance of mole formation is higher in older women."}

A history of mole in earlier years is also a risk factor.\nMolar pregnancy can be of two types:\nPartial molar pregnancy: There is an abnormal placenta and some fetal development.\nComplete molar pregnancy: There is an abnormal placenta and no fetus.\nThere is no way to prevent formation of a molar pregnancy.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a molar pregnancy may include:\nAbnormal growth of the uterus, either bigger or smaller than usual\nSevere\nnausea and vomiting\nVaginal bleeding\nduring the first 3 months of pregnancy\nSymptoms of\nhyperthyroidism\n, including\nheat intolerance\n,\nloose stools\n,\nrapid heart rate\n,\nrestlessness\nor nervousness, warm and moist skin,\ntrembling hands\n, or\nunexplained weight loss\nSymptoms similar to\npreeclampsia\nthat occur in the first trimester or early second trimester, including high blood pressure and\nswelling in the feet\n, ankles, and legs (this is almost always a sign of a hydatidiform mole, because preeclampsia is extremely rare this early in a normal pregnancy)\nExams an"}

However, the size of the womb may be abnormal and there may be no heart sounds from the baby. Also, there may be some vaginal bleeding.\nA pregnancy ultrasound will show a snowstorm appearance with an abnormal placenta, with or without some development of a baby.\nTests done may include:\nhCG (or HCG, both quantitative) blood test\nAbdominal or vaginal ultrasound of the pelvis\nChest x-ray\nCT\nor\nMRI\nof the abdomen (imaging tests)\nComplete blood count (\nCBC\n)\nBlood clotting tests\nKidney and\nliver function tests\nTreatment\nIf your provider suspects a molar pregnancy, removal of the abnormal tissue with a dilation and curettage (\nD&C\n) will most likely be suggested. D&C may also be done using suction. This is called suction aspiration (The method uses a suction cup to remove contents from the uterus).\nVery rarely, a partial molar pregnancy can continue."}

D&C may also be done using suction. This is called suction aspiration (The method uses a suction cup to remove contents from the uterus).\nVery rarely, a partial molar pregnancy can continue. A woman may choose to continue her pregnancy in the hope of having a successful birth and delivery. However, these are very high-risk pregnancies. Risks may include bleeding, problems with blood pressure, and premature delivery (having the baby before it is fully developed). In rare cases, the fetus is genetically normal. Women need to completely discuss the risks with their provider before continuing the pregnancy.\nA hysterectomy (\nsurgery to remove the uterus\n) may be an option for older women who do not wish to become pregnant in the future.\nAfter treatment, your hCG level will be followed. It is important to avoid another pregnancy and to use a reliable contraceptive for 6 to 12 months after treatment for a molar pregnancy. This time allows for accurate testing to be sure that the abnormal tissue does not grow back. Women who get pregnant too soon after a molar pregnancy are at high risk of having another molar pregnancy.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost HMs are noncancerous (\nbenign\n)."}

Treatment is usually successful. Close follow-up by your provider is important to ensure that signs of the molar pregnancy are gone and pregnancy hormone levels return to normal.\nAbout 15% of cases of HM can become invasive. These moles can grow deep into the uterine wall and cause bleeding or other complications. This type of mole most often responds well to medicines.\nIn very few cases of complete HM, moles develop into a choriocarcinoma. This is a fast-growing cancer."}
