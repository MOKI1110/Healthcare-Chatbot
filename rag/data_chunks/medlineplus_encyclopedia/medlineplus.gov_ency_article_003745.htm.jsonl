It is unlikely that you have strep throat.\nIf your provider still thinks that you may have strep throat, a\nthroat culture\nwill be done in children and adolescents.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA positive strep screen most often means group A streptococcus is present and confirms that you have strep throat.\nSometimes, the test may be positive even if you do not have strep. This is called a false-positive result.\nRisks\nThere are no risks.\nConsiderations\nThis test screens for the group A streptococcus bacteria only. It will not detect other causes of sore throat.\nAlternative Names\nRapid strep test\nImages\nThroat anatomy\nThroat swabs\nReferences\nAllen CT, Nussenbaum B, Merati AL.
