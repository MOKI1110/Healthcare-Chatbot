The causes and risk factors are unknown.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nBreast lump\nNipple discharge, which may be clear or bloodstained\nThese findings may be in just one breast or in both breasts.\nFor the most part, these papillomas do not cause pain.\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider might feel a small lump under the nipple, but this lump cannot always be felt. There may be discharge from the nipple. Sometimes, an intraductal papilloma is found on a mammogram or ultrasound, and then diagnosed by a needle biopsy.\nIf there is a mass or nipple discharge, both mammogram and ultrasound should be performed.\nIf these are normal, then breast MRI is sometimes recommended."}

If the MRI is normal, a needle or surgical biopsy may be performed to rule out cancer.\nAn intraductal papilloma is diagnosed on needle or surgical biopsy.\nTreatment\nIf there is nipple discharge, the duct is removed with surgery if imaging did not show a lump that can be checked with a needle biopsy. If a needle biopsy shows an intraductal papilloma, the papilloma may be removed with surgery, or watched over time with exams and imaging.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nFor the most part, intraductal papillomas do not appear to increase the risk of developing breast cancer.\nThe outcome is excellent for people with one papilloma. The risk for cancer may be higher for:\nWomen with many papillomas\nWomen who get them at an early age\nWomen with a family history of cancer\nWomen who have abnormal cells in the biopsy\nPossible Complications\nComplications of surgery can include bleeding, infection, scarring, and anesthesia risks."}
