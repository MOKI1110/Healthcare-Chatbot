Then wash the skin surrounding the hook.\nPut a loop of fish line or string through the bend of the fishhook so that a quick jerk can be applied and the hook can be pulled out straight backward, directly in line with the shaft of the hook.\nHolding onto the shaft, push the hook slightly downwards and inwards (away from the barb) so as to disengage the barb.\nHolding this pressure constant to keep the barb disengaged, give a quick jerk on the fish line and the hook will pop out.\nWash the wound thoroughly with soap and water. Apply a loose, sterile dressing. Do not close the wound with tape. Doing so can increase the chance of infection.\nWatch the skin for signs of infection such as redness, swelling, pain, or drainage.\nWire cutting method:\nFirst, wash your hands with soap and water or disinfecting solution. Then wash the skin surrounding the hook.\nIf the tip of the hook lies near the surface of the skin, advance the tip up and through the skin."}

Remove the rest of the hook by pulling it back through the way it entered.\nWash the wound thoroughly with soap and water. Apply a loose sterile dressing and apply antibiotic ointment. Do not close the wound with tape. Doing so can increase the chance of infection.\nWatch skin for signs of infection such as redness, swelling, pain, or drainage.\nDo not use any of the two methods above, or any other method, if the hook is stuck deeply in the skin, or in a joint or tendon, or located in or near an eye, eyelid, or artery.

If possible, place a cup or soft patch over the eye but do not allow it to touch the hook or put pressure on it.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nThe main advantage to getting medical help for any fishhook injury is that it can be removed under local anesthesia. This means before the hook is removed, your health care provider numbs the area with medicine.\nContact your provider if:\nYou have a fishhook injury and your\ntetanus\nimmunization is not up to date (or if you are unsure)\nAfter the fishhook is removed, the area starts to show signs of infection, such as increasing redness, swelling, pain, or drainage\nPrevention\nThe following steps can help prevent fishhook injuries.\nKeep a safe distance between you and another person who is fishing, especially if anyone is casting.\nKeep electrician's pliers with a wire-cutting blade and disinfecting solution in your tackle box.\nMake sure you are up to date on your tetanus immunization (vaccine)."}
