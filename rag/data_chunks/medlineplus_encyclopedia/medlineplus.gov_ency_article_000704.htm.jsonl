Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPituitary tumor\nPituitary tumor\nA pituitary tumor is an abnormal growth in the pituitary gland. The pituitary is a small gland at the base of the brain. It regulates the body's balance of many hormones.\nCauses\nMost pituitary tumors are noncancerous (\nbenign\n). Up to 10% to 20% of people have pituitary tumors. Many of these tumors do not cause symptoms and are never diagnosed during the person's lifetime.\nThe pituitary is part of the\nendocrine\nsystem. The pituitary helps control the release of hormones from other endocrine glands, such as the thyroid, sex glands (testes or ovaries), and\nadrenal glands\n. The pituitary also releases hormones that directly affect body tissues, such as bones and the breast milk glands. The pituitary hormones include:\nAdrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)\nGrowth hormone (GH)\nProlactin\nThyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)\nLuteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)\nWatch this video about:\nPituitary gland\nAs a pituitary tumor grows, the normal hormone-releasing cells of the pituitary may be damaged."}

This results in the pituitary gland not producing enough of its hormones. This condition is called\nhypopituitarism\n.\nThe causes of pituitary tumors are unknown. Some tumors are caused by hereditary disorders such as\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia I\n(MEN I).\nThe pituitary gland can be affected by other brain tumors that develop in the same part of the brain (skull base), resulting in similar symptoms.\nSymptoms\nSome pituitary tumors produce too much of one or more hormones."}

Your provider will note any problems with double vision and visual field, such as a loss of side (peripheral) vision or the ability to see in certain areas.\nThe exam will check for signs of too much cortisol (Cushing syndrome), too much growth hormone (acromegaly), or too much prolactin (\nprolactinoma\n).\nTests to check endocrine function may be ordered, including:\nCortisol levels --\ndexamethasone suppression test\n,\nurine cortisol\ntest, salivary cortisol test\nFSH\nlevel\nInsulin growth factor-1 (IGF-1) level\nLH\nlevel\nProlactin level\nTestosterone/estradiol levels\nThyroid hormone levels --\nfree T4 test\n,\nTSH test\nTests that help confirm the diagnosis include the following:\nVisual fields\nMRI of head\nTreatment\nSurgery to remove the tumor is often needed, especially if the tumor is pressing on the nerves that control vision (optic nerves).\nMost of the time, pituitary tumors can be surgica"}

If the tumor cannot be removed this way, it is removed through the skull.\nRadiation therapy\nmay be used to shrink the tumor  in people who cannot have surgery. It may also be used if the tumor returns after surgery.\nIn some cases, medicines are prescribed to shrink certain types of tumors.\nSmall tumors found incidentally during an MRI for other symptoms can often be followed with repeat MRI imaging over time if they are not causing any hormonal abnormality. Many of these tumors do not grow.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with pituitary tumors and their families can be found at:\nNational Cancer Institute --\nwww.cancer.gov/types/pituitary\nPituitary Network Association --\npituitary.org\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf the tumor can be surgically removed, the outlook is fair to good, depending on whether the entire tumor is removed.\nPossible Complications\nThe most serious complication is blindness."}

This can occur if the optic nerve is seriously damaged.\nThe tumor or its removal may cause lifelong hormone imbalances. The affected hormones may need to be replaced, and you may need to take medicine for the rest of your life.\nTumors and surgery can sometimes damage the posterior pituitary (back part of the gland). This can lead to\ndiabetes insipidus\n, a condition with symptoms of frequent urination and extreme thirst.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop any symptoms of a pituitary tumor.\nAlternative Names\nTumor - pituitary; Pituitary adenoma\nImages\nEndocrine glands\nPituitary gland\nReferences\nDorsey JF, Salinas RD, Dang M, et al.
