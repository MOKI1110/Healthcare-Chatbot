This causes injury to liver cells.\nCauses\nLow blood pressure\nfrom any condition can lead to hepatic ischemia. Such conditions may include:\nAbnormal heart rhythms\nDehydration\nHeart failure\nInfection, especially sepsis\nSevere bleeding\nOther causes may include:\nBlood clots in the main artery to the liver (hepatic artery) after a liver transplant\nInflammation of blood vessels, leading to reduced blood flow (vasculitis)\nBurns\nHeat stroke\nHaving a sickle cell crisis\nSymptoms\nThe person may have an altered mental status due to reduced blood flow to the brain."}

Other symptoms may include:\nLoss of appetite\nFeeling of general discomfort\nDiscomfort in the right upper quadrant of your abdomen\nJaundice\nDamage to the liver cells most often does not cause symptoms until it affects liver function.\nBlood clots in the liver's main artery may cause abdominal pain.\nExams and Tests\nThe following tests will be done:\nBlood tests to check liver function (AST and ALT). These readings can be very high (in the thousands) with ischemia.\nDoppler ultrasound of the blood vessels of the liver.\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the cause. Low blood pressure and blood clots must be treated right away.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPeople generally recover if the illness causing hepatic ischemia can be treated."}
