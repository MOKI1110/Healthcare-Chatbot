Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nComplement fixation test to C burnetii\nComplement fixation test to C burnetii\nThe complement fixation test to\nCoxiella burnetii\n(\nC burnetii\n) is a blood test that checks for infection due to bacteria called\nC burnetii\n, which causes\nQ fever\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed.\nThe sample is sent to a laboratory. There, a method called\ncomplement\nfixation is used to check if the body has produced substances called antibodies to a specific foreign substance (antigen), in this case,\nC burnetii\n. Antibodies defend the body against bacteria, viruses, and fungi. If the antibodies are present, they stick, or \"fix\" themselves, to the antigen. This is why the test is called \"fixation.\"\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary for this test.\nHow the Test Will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or bruising."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to detect Q fever.\nNormal Results\nAbsence of antibodies to\nC burnetii\nis normal. It means you do not have Q fever now or in the past.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result means you may have a current infection with\nC burnetii\n, or that you have been exposed to the bacteria in the past. People with past exposure may have antibodies, even if they are not aware that they were exposed. Further testing may be needed to distinguish between current, previous, and long-term (chronic) infection.\nDuring the early stage of an illness, few antibodies may be detected. Antibody production increases during the course of an infection. For this reason, this test may be repeated several weeks after the first test.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other."}
