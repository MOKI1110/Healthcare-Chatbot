The two most common ways to do a kidney biopsy are percutaneous and open. These are described below.\nPercutaneous biopsy.\nPercutaneous means through the skin. Most kidney biopsies are done this way. The procedure is usually done in the following way:\nYou may receive medicine to make you drowsy.\nYou lie on your stomach. If you have a transplanted kidney, you lie on your back.\nThe health care provider marks the spot on the skin where the biopsy needle is inserted.\nThe skin is cleaned.\nNumbing medicine (anesthetic) is injected under the skin near the kidney area.\nThe provider makes a tiny cut in the skin.\nUltrasound\nimages are used to find the proper location. Sometimes another imaging method, such as\nCT\n, is used.\nThe provider inserts a biopsy needle through the skin to the surface of the kidney."}

Sometimes another imaging method, such as\nCT\n, is used.\nThe provider inserts a biopsy needle through the skin to the surface of the kidney. You are asked to take and hold a deep breath as the needle goes into the kidney.\nIf the provider is not using ultrasound guidance, you may be asked to take several deep breaths. This allows the provider to know the needle is in place.\nThe needle may be inserted more than once if more than one tissue sample is needed.\nThe needle is removed. Pressure is applied to the biopsy site to stop any bleeding.\nAfter the procedure, a bandage is applied to the biopsy site.\nOpen biopsy.\nIn some cases, your provider may recommend a surgical (open) biopsy. This method is used when a larger piece of tissue is needed or a percutaneous needle biopsy cannot be done safely.\nYou receive medicine (anesthesia) that allows you to sleep and be pain-free.\nThe surgeon makes a small surgical cut (incision).\nThe surgeon locates the part of the kidney from which the biopsy tissue needs to be taken."}

The tissue is removed.\nThe incision is closed with stitches (sutures).\nAfter percutaneous or open biopsy, you will likely stay in the hospital for at least 12 hours. You will receive pain medicines and fluids by mouth or through a vein (IV). Your urine will be checked for heavy bleeding. A small amount of bleeding is normal after a biopsy.\nFollow instructions about caring for yourself after the biopsy."}

This may include not lifting anything heavier than 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) for 2 weeks after the biopsy.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nTell your provider:\nAbout medicines you are taking, including vitamins and supplements, herbal remedies, and over-the-counter medicines\nIf you have any allergies\nIf you have bleeding problems or if you take blood-thinning medicines such as warfarin (Coumadin), clopidogrel (Plavix), dipyridamole (Persantine), fondaparinux (Arixtra), apixaban (Eliquis), dabigatran (Pradaxa), or aspirin\nIf you are or think you might be pregnant\nHow the Test will Feel\nNumbing medicine is used, so the pain during the procedure is often slight. The numbing medicine may burn or sting when first injected.\nAfter the procedure, the area may feel tender or sore for a few days.\nYou may see bright, red blood in your urine during the first 24 hours after the test."}
