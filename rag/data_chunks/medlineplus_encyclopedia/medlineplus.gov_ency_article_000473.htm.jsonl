These substances are harmful to the kidney and often cause kidney damage.\nCauses\nWhen muscle is damaged, a protein called myoglobin is released into the bloodstream. It is then filtered out of the body by the kidneys. Myoglobin breaks down into substances that can damage kidney cells.\nRhabdomyolysis may be caused by injury or any other condition that damages skeletal muscle.\nProblems that may lead to this disease include:\nTrauma or crush injuries\nUse of drugs or medicines such as\ncocaine\n, amphetamines, statins,\nheroin\n, or PCP\nGenetic muscle diseases\nExtremes of body temperature\nIschemia or death of muscle tissue\nLow phosphate levels\nSeizures\nor muscle tremors\nSevere exertion, such as marathon running or calisthenics\nLengthy surgical procedures\nSevere dehydration\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nDark, red, or cola-colored urine\nDecreased urine output\nGeneral weakness\nMuscle stiffness or aching (\nmyalgia\n)\nMuscle tende"}

You may need to get fluids through a vein (IV). Some people may need kidney dialysis.\nYour health care provider may prescribe medicines including diuretics and bicarbonate (if there is enough urine output).\nHyperkalemia\nand low blood calcium levels (hypocalcemia) should be treated right away.\nKidney failure\nshould also be treated.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome depends on the amount of\nkidney damage\n."}

Acute kidney failure occurs in many people. Getting treated soon after rhabdomyolysis will reduce the risk of permanent kidney damage.\nPeople with milder cases may return to their normal activities within a few weeks to a month. However, some people continue to have problems with fatigue and muscle pain.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nAcute tubular necrosis\nAcute renal failure\nHarmful chemical imbalances in the blood\nShock\n(low blood pressure)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of rhabdomyolysis.\nPrevention\nRhabdomyolysis can be avoided by:\nAvoiding drugs or medicines that may cause rhabdomyolysis.\nDrinking plenty of fluids after strenuous exercise.\nRemoving extra clothes and immersing the body in cold water in case of heat stroke.\nImages\nKidney anatomy\nReferences\nLong B, Koyfman A.
