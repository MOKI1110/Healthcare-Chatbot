Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEndocarditis\nEndocarditis\nEndocarditis is inflammation of the inside lining of the heart chambers and heart valves (endocardium). It is most often caused by a bacterial or, rarely, a fungal infection.\nCauses\nEndocarditis can involve the heart muscle, heart valves, or lining of the heart. Some people who develop endocarditis have a:\nBirth defect of the heart\nDamaged or abnormal heart valve\nHistory of endocarditis\nNew heart valve after surgery\nParenteral (intravenous) drug use disorder or addiction\nLong-term intravenous line in place\nEndocarditis begins when germs enter the bloodstream and then travel to the heart.\nBacterial infection is the most common cause of endocarditis.\nEndocarditis can also be caused by fungi, such as Candida.\nIn some cases, no cause can be found.\nGerms are most likely to enter the bloodstream during:\nCentral venous access lines\nInjection drug use, from the use of unclean (unsterile) needles\nRecent dental surgery\nOther surgeries or minor procedures to the breathing tract, urinary tract, infected skin, or bones and muscles\nSymptoms\nSymptoms"}
