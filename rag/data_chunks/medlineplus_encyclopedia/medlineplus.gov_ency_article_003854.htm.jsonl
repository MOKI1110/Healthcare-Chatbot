This is an important part of\nlung testing\n, because the major function of the lungs is to allow oxygen to diffuse or pass into the blood from the lungs, and to allow carbon dioxide to diffuse from the blood into the lungs.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou breathe in (inhale) air containing a very small amount of\ncarbon monoxide\nand a tracer gas, such as methane or helium. You hold your breath for 10 seconds, then rapidly blow it out (exhale). The exhaled gas is tested to determine how much of the tracer gas was absorbed during the breath.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nBefore taking this test:\nDo not eat a heavy meal before the test.\nDo not smoke for at least 4 to 6 hours before the test.\nIf you use a bronchodilator or other inhaled medicines, ask your health care provider whether or not you can use them before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe mouthpiece fits tightly around your mouth."}

Clips are put on your nose.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is used to diagnose certain lung diseases, and to monitor the status of people with established lung disease. Repeatedly measuring the diffusing capacity can help determine whether the disease is improving or getting worse.\nNormal Results\nNormal test results depend on a person's:\nAge\nSex\nHeight\nHemoglobin (the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen) level\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results mean that gases do not move normally across the lung tissues into the blood vessels of the lung. This may be due to lung diseases such as:\nCOPD\nInterstitial fibrosis\nPulmonary embolism\nPulmonary hypertension\nSarcoidosis\nBleeding in the lung\nAsthma\nReduced lung volume (capacity)\nRisks\nThere are no significant risks.\nConsiderations\nOther\npulmonary function tests\nmay be done together with this test.\nAlternative Names\nDiffusing capacity; DLCO test\nImages\nLung diffusion testing\nReferences\nBhakta NR, Kaminsky DA."}
