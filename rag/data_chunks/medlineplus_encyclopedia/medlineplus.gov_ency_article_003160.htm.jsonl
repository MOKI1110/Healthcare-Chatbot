The pain can spread into the lower abdomen.\nCauses\nThe testicles are very sensitive. Even a minor injury can cause pain. In some conditions, abdominal pain may occur before testicle pain.\nCommon causes of testicle pain include:\nInjury.\nInfection or swelling of the sperm ducts (\nepididymitis\n) or testicles (\norchitis\n).\nTwisting of the testicles that can cut off the blood supply (\ntesticular torsion\n). It is most common in young men between 10 and 20 years old. It is a medical emergency that needs to be treated as soon as possible. If surgery is performed within 4 hours, most testicles can be saved.\nMild pain may be caused by fluid collection in the scrotum, such as:\nEnlarged veins in the scrotum (\nvaricocele\n).\nCyst in the epididymis that often contains dead sperm cells (\nspermatocele\n).\nFluid surrounding the testicle (\nhydrocele\n).\nPain in the testicles may also be caused by a hernia or kidney stone.\nTesticular cancer\nis almost always painless."}

But any testicle lump should be checked out by your health care provider, whether or not there is pain.\nHome Care\nNon-urgent causes of testicle pain, such as minor injuries and fluid collection, can often be treated with home care. The following steps may reduce discomfort and swelling:\nProvide support to the scrotum by wearing an athletic supporter.\nApply ice (wrapped in a cloth) to the scrotum.\nTake warm baths if there are signs of swelling.\nWhile lying down, place a rolled towel under your scrotum.\nTry over-the-counter pain relievers, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Do NOT give aspirin to children.\nTake the antibiotics your provider gives you if the pain is caused by infection. Preventive measures to take:\nPrevent injury by wearing an athletic supporter during contact sports.\nFollow safer sex practices."}
