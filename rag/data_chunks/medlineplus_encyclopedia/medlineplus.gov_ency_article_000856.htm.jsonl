Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTularemia\nTularemia\nTularemia is a bacterial infection in wild rodents. The bacteria are passed to humans through contact with tissue from the infected animal. The bacteria can also be passed by\nticks\n, biting flies, and mosquitoes.\nCauses\nTularemia is caused by the bacterium\nFrancisella tularensis.\nHumans can get the disease through:\nA bite from an infected tick, horsefly, or mosquito\nBreathing in infected dirt or plant material\nDirect contact, through a break in the skin, with an infected animal or its dead body (most often a rabbit, muskrat, beaver, or squirrel)\nEating infected meat (rare)\nThe disorder most commonly occurs in North America and parts of Europe and Asia. In the United States, this disease is found more often in Missouri, South Dakota, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. Although outbreaks can occur in the United States, they are rare.\nSome people may develop\npneumonia\nafter breathing infected dirt or plant material."}

Although outbreaks can occur in the United States, they are rare.\nSome people may develop\npneumonia\nafter breathing infected dirt or plant material. This infection has been known to occur on Martha's Vineyard (Massachusetts), where bacteria are present in rabbits, raccoons, and skunks.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms develop 3 to 5 days after exposure. The illness usually starts suddenly. It may continue for several weeks after symptoms begin.\nSymptoms include:\nFever, chills, sweating\nEye irritation (called\nconjunctivitis\n, if the infection began in the eye)\nHeadache\nJoint stiffness, muscle pain\nRed spot on the skin, growing to become a sore (ulcer)\nShortness of breath\nWeight loss\nExams and Tests\nTests for the condition include:\nBlood culture\nfor the bacteria\nBlood test measuring the body's immune response (antibodies) to the infection (\nserology for tularemia\n)\nChest x-ray\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) test of a sample from an ulcer\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to cure the infection with antibiotics.\nThe antibiotics streptomycin and tetracycline are commonly used to treat this infection."}

Another antibiotic, gentamicin, has been tried as an alternative to streptomycin. Gentamicin seems to be very effective, but it has been studied in only a small number of people because this is a rare disease. The antibiotics tetracycline and chloramphenicol can be used alone but are not usually a first choice.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nTularemia is fatal in about 10% of untreated cases, and in less than 1% of treated cases.\nPossible Complications\nTularemia may lead to these complications:\nBone infection (\nosteomyelitis\n)\nInfection of the sac around the heart (\npericarditis\n)\nInfection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (\nmeningitis\n)\nPneumonia\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if symptoms develop after a rodent bite, tick bite, or exposure to the flesh of a wild animal.\nPrevention\nPreventive measures include wearing gloves when skinning or dressing wild animals and staying away from sick or dead animals.\nAlternative Names\nDeerfly fever"}
