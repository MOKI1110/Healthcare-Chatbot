The clean-catch method is used to prevent germs from the penis or vagina from getting into a urine sample. To collect your urine, your health care provider may give you a special clean-catch kit that contains a cleansing solution and sterile wipes. Follow the instructions exactly.\nAfter you provide a urine sample, it is sent to the lab. There, a lab specialist will place the urine sample on special paper and apply an electric current. The proteins move and form visible bands. These reveal the general amounts of each protein.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider may tell you to stop taking certain medicines that could interfere with the test."}

Medicines that can affect test results include:\nChlorpromazine\nCorticosteroids\nIsoniazid\nNeomycin\nPhenacemide\nSalicylates\nSulfonamides\nTolbutamide\nDo not stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThis test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nNormally there is no protein, or only a small amount of protein in the urine. An abnormally high amount of protein in the urine can be a sign of many different disorders.\nUPEP may be recommended to help determine the cause of protein in the urine. Or it may be done as a screening test to measure the various amounts of different types of proteins in urine. UPEP detects 2 types of protein: albumin and globulins.\nNormal Results\nNo significant amount of globulins are found in the urine. Urine albumin is less than 5 mg/dL.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different specimens."}
