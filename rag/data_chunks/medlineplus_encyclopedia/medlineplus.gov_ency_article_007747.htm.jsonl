Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCologuard\nCologuard\nCologuard is a screening test for colon and rectal cancer.\nThe colon sheds cells from its lining every day. These cells pass with the stool through the colon. Colon cancer cells may have DNA changes in certain genes. Cologuard detects the altered DNA. The presence of abnormal cells or blood in the stool may indicate cancer or precancer tumors.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe Cologuard testing kit for\ncolon and rectal cancer\nmust be ordered by your health care provider. It will be sent by mail to your address. You collect the sample at home and send it back to the lab for testing.\nThe Cologuard testing kit will contain a sample container, a tube, preserving liquid, labels, and instructions on how to collect the sample. When you are ready to have a bowel movement, use the Cologuard testing kit to collect your stool sample.\nRead the instructions that come with the testing kit carefully. Wait until you are ready to have a bowel movement. Collect the sample only when it is possible to ship it within 24 hours."}

You do not need to change your diet or medicines before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test requires you to have a normal bowel movement. It will not feel any different from your regular bowel movements. You can collect the sample at your home privately.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is done to\nscreen for colon and rectal cancer\nand abnormal growths (polyps) in the colon or rectum.\nYour provider may suggest Cologuard testing once every 1 to 3 years starting at age 45 years. The test is recommended if you are age 45 to 75 years and have an average risk of colon cancer."}
