Surgery may be needed if the esophagus, stomach, or intestines have developed holes (perforations) from exposure to the chemical.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\nSwallowing poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Damage to the esophagus and stomach continues to occur for several weeks after the potassium hydroxide was swallowed. Death from complications may occur as long as several months later. Holes (perforations) in the esophagus and stomach may result in serious infections in both the chest and abdominal cavities, which may result in death.\nReferences\nHoyte C. Caustics.
