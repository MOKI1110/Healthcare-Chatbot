This covering is called the meninges.\nBacteria are one type of germ that may cause meningitis. Gram-negative bacteria are a type of bacteria that behave in a similar manner in the body. They are called gram-negative because they turn pink when tested in the lab with a special stain called Gram stain.\nCauses\nAcute\nbacterial meningitis can be caused by different Gram-negative bacteria including\nmeningococcus\nand\nH influenzae\n.\nThis article covers Gram-negative meningitis caused by the following bacteria:\nEscherichia coli\nKlebsiella pneumoniae\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\nSerratia marcescens\nGram-negative meningitis is more common in infants than adults. But it can also occur in adults, especially those with one or more risk factors."}

Questions will focus on symptoms and possible exposure to someone who might have the same symptoms, such as a stiff neck and fever.\nIf your provider thinks meningitis is possible, a lumbar puncture (\nspinal tap\n) will likely be done to remove a sample of spinal fluid for testing.\nOther tests that may be done include:\nBlood culture\nChest x-ray\nCT scan of the head\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nGram stain\nor, other special stains, and\nculture of the spinal fluid\nTreatment\nAntibiotics will be started as soon as possible. Ceftriaxone and cefepime are the most commonly used antibiotics for this type of meningitis. Other antibiotics may be given, depending on the type of bacteria.\nIf you have a spinal shunt, it may be removed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe earlier treatment is started, the better the outcome.\nMany people recover completely. But, many people have permanent brain damage or die of this type of meningitis. Young children and adults over age 50 have a higher risk for death."}
