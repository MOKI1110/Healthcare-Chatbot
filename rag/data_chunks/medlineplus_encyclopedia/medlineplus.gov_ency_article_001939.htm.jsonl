This person is most often a doctor. However, a PCP may be a\nphysician assistant\nor a\nnurse practitioner\n. Your PCP is often involved in your care for a long time. Therefore, it is important to choose someone with whom you will work well.\nInformation\nA PCP is your main health care provider in non-emergency situations. Your PCP's role is to:\nProvide preventive care and teach healthy lifestyle choices\nIdentify and treat common medical conditions\nAssess the urgency of your medical problems and direct you to the best place for that care\nMake referrals to medical or surgical specialists when necessary\nPrimary care is most often provided in an outpatient setting."}

However, if you are admitted to the hospital, your PCP may assist in or direct your care, depending on the circumstances.\nHaving a PCP can give you a trusting, ongoing relationship with one medical professional over time. You can choose from several different types of PCPs:\nFamily practitioners:\nDoctors who have completed a family practice (sometimes called family medicine) residency and are board-certified, or board-eligible, for this specialty. The scope of their practice includes children and adults of all ages and may include obstetrics and minor surgery.\nPediatricians:\nDoctors who have completed a pediatric residency and are board-certified or board-eligible in this specialty. The scope of their practice includes the care of newborns, infants, children, and adolescents.\nGeriatricians:\nDoctors who have completed a residency in either family medicine or internal medicine and are board-certified in this specialty."}

The scope of their practice includes the care of adults of all ages for many different medical problems.\nObstetricians/gynecologists:\nDoctors who have completed a residency and are board-certified or board-eligible in this specialty. They often serve as a PCP for women, particularly those of childbearing age.\nNurse practitioners (NP) and physician assistants (PA):\nPractitioners who go through a different training and certification process than doctors. They may be your PCP in some practices.\nMany insurance plans limit the providers you can choose from, or provide financial incentives for you to select from a specific list of providers."}

Make sure you know what your insurance covers before starting to narrow down your options.\nWhen choosing a PCP, also consider the following:\nIs the office staff friendly and helpful? Is the office good about returning calls?\nAre the office hours convenient to your schedule?\nHow easy is it to reach the provider? Does the provider use email or secure messaging through a patient portal?\nDo you prefer a provider whose communication style is friendly and warm, or more formal?\nDo you prefer a provider focused on disease treatment, or wellness and prevention?\nDoes the provider have a conservative or aggressive approach to treatment?\nDoes the provider order a lot of tests?\nDoes the provider refer to other specialists frequently or infrequently?\nWhat do colleagues and patients say about the provider?\nDoes the provider invite you to be involved in your care?"}

There may be no cost to do this, or you may be charged a co-payment or other small fee."}

Some practices, particularly pediatric practice groups, may have an open house where you have an opportunity to meet several of the providers in that particular group.\nIf a health care problem comes up and you do not have a primary provider, in most cases, it is best to seek non-emergency care from an urgent care center rather than a hospital emergency room. This will often save you time and money. In recent years, many emergency rooms have expanded their services to include urgent care within the emergency room itself or an adjoining area. To find out, contact the hospital first.\nAlternative Names\nFamily doctor - how to choose one; Primary care provider - how to choose one; Doctor - how to choose a family doctor\nImages\nPatient and doctor work together\nTypes of health care providers\nReferences\nGoldman L, Cooney KA, Bibbins-Domingo K, et al.
