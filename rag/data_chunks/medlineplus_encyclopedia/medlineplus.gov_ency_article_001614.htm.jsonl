It is transmitted by cat scratches, cat bites, or flea bites.\nCauses\nCat-scratch disease is caused by the bacteria\nBartonella henselae\n. The disease is spread through contact with an infected cat (a bite or scratch) or exposure to cat fleas. It also can be spread through contact with cat saliva on broken skin or mucosal surfaces like those in the nose, mouth, and eyes.\nSymptoms\nA person who has had contact with an infected cat may show symptoms, including:\nBump (\npapule\n) or blister (\npustule\n) at site of injury (usually the first sign)\nFatigue\nFever (in some people)\nHeadache\nLymph node swelling (\nlymphadenopathy\n) near the site of the scratch or bite\nOverall discomfort (\nmalaise\n)\nLess common symptoms may include:\nLoss of appetite\nSore throat\nWeight loss\nExams and Tests\nIf you have swollen lymph nodes and a scratch or bite from a cat, your health care provider may suspect cat-scratch disease.\nA physical exam may also reveal an\nenlarged spleen\n.\nSometimes"}

The\nBartonella henselae\nimmunofluorescence assay (IFA) blood test can detect the infection caused by these bacteria. The results of this test will be considered along with other information from your medical history, lab tests, or biopsy.\nlymph node biopsy\nmay also be done to look for other causes of swollen glands.\nTreatment\nMost often, cat-scratch disease is not serious. Medical treatment may not be needed. In some cases, treatment with antibiotics such as azithromycin can be helpful. Other antibiotics may be used, including:\nClarithromycin\nRifampin\nTrimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole\nCiprofloxacin\nIn people with HIV/AIDS and others, who have a weak immune system, cat-scratch disease can be more serious."}

People with a weak immune system need antibiotic treatment to recover.\nPossible Complications\nPeople with weak immune systems may develop complications such as:\nEncephalopathy (loss of brain function)\nNeuroretinitis\n(inflammation of the retina and optic nerve of the eye)\nOsteomyelitis\n(bone infection)\nParinaud syndrome\n(red, irritated, and painful eye)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have enlarged lymph nodes and you have been exposed to a cat.\nPrevention\nTo prevent cat-scratch disease:\nWash your hands thoroughly with soap and water after playing with your cat."}
