Bacteria commonly often found in water can cause ear infections. Rarely, the infection may be caused by a fungus.\nOther causes of swimmer's ear include:\nScratching the ear or inside the ear  which can damage the skin of the ear canal\nGetting something stuck in the ear\nTrying to clean (\nwax from the ear canal\n) with cotton swabs or small objects can also damage the skin.\nLong-term (chronic) swimmer's ear may be due to:\nAllergic reaction to something placed in the ear\nChronic skin conditions, such as\neczema\nor\npsoriasis\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of swimmer's ear include:\nDrainage from the ear\n-- yellow, yellow-green, pus-like, or foul smelling\nEar pain\n, which may get worse when you pull on the outer ear\nHearing loss\nItching of the ear or ear canal\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will look inside your ears.

The skin inside the ear canal may be scaly or shedding.\nTouching or moving the outer ear will increase the pain. The eardrum may be hard to see because of a swelling in the outer ear. The eardrum may have a hole in it. This is called a perforation.\nA sample of fluid may be removed from the ear and sent to a lab to look for bacteria or fungus.\nTreatment\nIn most cases, you will need to use antibiotic ear drops for 10 to 14 days. If the ear canal is very swollen, a wick may be put into the ear. The wick will allow the drops to travel to the end of the canal. Your provider can show you how to do this.\nOther treatments may include:\nAntibiotics taken by mouth if you have a middle ear infection or infection that spreads beyond the ear\nCorticosteroids to reduce itching and inflammation\nPain medicine, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin)\nVinegar (acetic acid) ear drops\nPeople with chronic swimmer's ear may need long-term or repeated treatment."}
