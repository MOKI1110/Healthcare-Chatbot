Your voice box contains your vocal cords and allows you to speak.\nHow the Test is Performed\nLaryngoscopy may be done in different ways:\nIndirect laryngoscopy uses a small mirror held at the back of your throat. Your health care provider shines a light on the mirror to view the throat area. This is a simple procedure. Most of the time, it can be done in your provider's office while you are awake. A medicine to numb the back of your throat may be used.\nFiberoptic laryngoscopy (nasolaryngoscopy) uses a small flexible telescope. The scope is passed through your nose and into your throat. This is the most common way that the voice box is examined. You are awake for the procedure. Numbing medicine will be sprayed in your nose. This procedure typically takes less than 1 minute.\nLaryngoscopy using strobe light can also be done."}

You are awake for the procedure. Numbing medicine will be sprayed in your nose. This procedure typically takes less than 1 minute.\nLaryngoscopy using strobe light can also be done. Use of strobe light can give your provider more information about problems with your voice box.\nDirect laryngoscopy uses a tube called a laryngoscope. The instrument is placed in the back of your throat. The tube may be flexible or stiff. This procedure allows your provider to see deeper in the throat and to remove a foreign object or sample tissue for a biopsy. It is done in a hospital or medical center under general anesthesia, meaning you will be asleep and pain-free.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nPreparation will depend on the type of laryngoscopy you will have. If the exam will be done under general anesthesia, you may be told not to drink or eat anything for several hours before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nHow the test will feel depends on which type of laryngoscopy is done.\nIndirect laryngoscopy using a mirror or stroboscopy can cause gagging."}

For this reason, it is not often used in children under age 6 to 7 or those who gag easily.\nFiberoptic laryngoscopy can be done in children. It may cause a feeling of pressure and a feeling like you are going to sneeze.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test can help your provider diagnose many conditions involving the throat and voice box. Your provider may recommend this test if you have:\nBad breath that does not go away\nBreathing problems, including noisy breathing (stridor)\nLong-term (chronic) cough\nCoughing up blood\nDifficulty swallowing\nEar pain that does not go away\nFeeling that something is stuck in your throat\nLong-term upper respiratory problem in a smoker\nMass in the head or neck area with signs of cancer\nThroat pain that does not go away\nVoice problems that last more than 3 weeks, including hoarseness, weak voice, raspy voice, or no voice\nA direct laryngoscopy may also be used to:\nRemove a sample of tissue in the throat for closer examination under a microscope (biopsy)\nRemove"}
