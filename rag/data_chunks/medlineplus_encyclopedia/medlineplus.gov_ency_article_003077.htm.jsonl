Your heart and circulation will also be checked.\nYour provider will ask questions such as:\nIs this the first time you have felt a bounding pulse?\nDid it develop suddenly or gradually? Is it always present, or does it come and go?\nDoes it only happen along with other symptoms, such as palpitations?"}
