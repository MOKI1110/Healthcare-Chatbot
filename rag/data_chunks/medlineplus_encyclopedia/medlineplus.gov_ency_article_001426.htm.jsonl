A child with this condition will have a port-wine stain birthmark (usually on the face) and may have nervous system problems.\nCauses\nIn many people, the cause of Sturge-Weber is due to a variation of the\nGNAQ\ngene. This gene affects small blood vessels called capillaries in some but not all body cells. Problems in the capillaries cause the\nport-wine stains\nto form.\nSturge-Weber is not thought to be passed down (inherited) through families.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of SWS include:\nPort-wine stain (more common on the upper face and eyelid than the rest of the body)\nSeizures\nHeadache\nParalysis\nor weakness on one side\nLearning disabilities\nGlaucoma (very high fluid pressure in the eye)\nLow thyroid function (\nhypothyroidism\n)\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider should check all birthmarks, including a port-wine stain.\nGlaucoma\nmay be one sign of the condition.\nTests may include:\nCT scan\nMRI scan\nX-rays\nTreatment\nTreatment is based on the person'"}

The condition does need regular lifelong follow-up. The person's quality of life depends on how well their symptoms (such as seizures) can be prevented or treated.\nThe person will need to visit an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) at least once a year to check for or treat glaucoma."}
