About one fourth of Americans are affected and risk increases with age and among certain ethnicities. Doctors are not sure whether the syndrome is due to one single cause. But many of the risks for the syndrome are related to obesity. Many people with metabolic syndrome used to be told they had pre-diabetes, early hypertension (high blood pressure) or mild hyperlipidemia (high fats in the blood).\nThe two most important risk factors for metabolic syndrome are:\nExtra weight around the middle and upper parts of the body (central\nobesity\n). This body type may be described as \"apple-shaped.\"\nInsulin resistance -- Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas. Insulin is needed to help control the amount of sugar in the blood."}

This body type may be described as \"apple-shaped.\"\nInsulin resistance -- Insulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas. Insulin is needed to help control the amount of sugar in the blood. Insulin resistance means that some cells in the body use insulin less effectively than normal. As a result, blood sugar level rises, which causes insulin production to rise. This may increase the amount of body fat.\nOther risk factors include:\nAging\nGenes that make you more likely to develop this condition\nChanges in male, female, and stress hormones\nLack of exercise\nPeople who have metabolic syndrome often have one or more other factors that may be linked with the condition, including:\nIncreased risk for blood clotting\nIncreased levels of blood substances that are a sign of inflammation throughout the body\nSmall amounts of a protein called albumin in the urine\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you.

The goal is to lose between 7% and 10% of your current weight. You will probably need to eat 500 to 1,000 fewer calories per day.  A variety of diet options can help people achieve this goal. There is no single âbest' diet to lose weight.\nGet 150 minutes a week of moderate intensity exercise such as walking. Do exercises to strengthen your muscles 2 days a week.  High intensity exercise for shorter periods is another option. Check with your provider to see if you are healthy enough to start a new exercise program.\nLower your cholesterol by\neating healthier foods, losing weight, exercising\n, and\ntaking cholesterol-lowering medicines\n, if needed.\nLower your blood pressure\nby eating less salt, losing weight, exercising, and taking medicine, if needed.\nYour provider may recommend daily low-dose aspirin.\nIf you smoke, now is\nthe time to quit\n."}
