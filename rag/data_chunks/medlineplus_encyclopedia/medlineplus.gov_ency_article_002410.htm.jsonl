Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPantothenic acid and biotin\nPantothenic acid and biotin\nPantothenic acid (B5) and biotin (B7) are types of B vitamins. They are water-soluble, which means that the body can't store them. If the body can't use the entire vitamin, the extra amount leaves the body through the urine. The body keeps a small reserve of these vitamins. They have to be taken on a regular basis to maintain the reserve.\nFunction\nPantothenic acid and biotin are needed for growth. They help the body break down and use food. This is called\nmetabolism\n. They are both required for making fatty acids.\nPantothenic acid also plays a role in the production of hormones and cholesterol."}

This is called\nmetabolism\n. They are both required for making fatty acids.\nPantothenic acid also plays a role in the production of hormones and cholesterol. In addition, it is used in the conversion of pyruvate, a substance that is essential to many metabolic pathways in the body.\nFood Sources\nAlmost all plant- and animal-based foods contain pantothenic acid in varying amounts, though food processing can cause a significant loss.\nPantothenic acid is found in foods that are good sources of B vitamins, including the following:\nAnimal proteins\nAvocado\nBroccoli, kale, and other vegetables in the cabbage family\nEggs\nLegumes and lentils\nMilk\nMushrooms\nOrgan meats\nPoultry\nWhite and sweet potatoes\nWhole-grain cereals\nYeast\nBiotin is found in foods that are good sources of B vitamins, including:\nCereal\nChocolate\nEgg yolk\nLegumes\nMilk\nNuts\nOrgan meats (liver, kidney)\nPork\nYeast\nSide Effects\nLack of pantothenic acid is very rare, but can cause a tingling feeling in the feet (paresthesia). Lack of biotin may lead to muscle pain, dermatitis, or glossitis (swelling of the tongue)."}

Signs of biotin deficiency include skin rashes, hair loss, and brittle nails.\nLarge doses of pantothenic acid do not cause symptoms, other than (possibly)\ndiarrhea\n. There are no known toxic symptoms from biotin.\nRecommendations\nREFERENCE INTAKES\nRecommendations for pantothenic acid and biotin, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA):\naverage daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people.\nAdequate Intake (AI):\nestablished when there is not enough evidence to develop an RDA."}
