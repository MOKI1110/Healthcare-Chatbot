Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSpondylolisthesis\nSpondylolisthesis\nSpondylolisthesis is a condition in which a bone (vertebra) in the spine moves forward, out of its proper position, in relation to the bone below it.\nCauses\nIn children, spondylolisthesis usually occurs between the fifth bone in the lower back (lumbar vertebra) and the first bone in the sacrum (pelvis) area. It is often due to a birth defect in that area of the spine or sudden injury (acute trauma).\nIn adults, the most common cause is abnormal wear on the cartilage and bones, such as\narthritis\n. The condition mostly affects people over 50 years old. It is more common in women than in men.\nBone disease and\nfractures\ncan also cause spondylolisthesis. Certain sports activities, such as gymnastics, weightlifting, and football, greatly stress the bones in the lower back. They also require that the athlete constantly overstretch (hyperextend) the spine. This can lead to a stress fracture on one or both sides of the vertebra."}

They also require that the athlete constantly overstretch (hyperextend) the spine. This can lead to a stress fracture on one or both sides of the vertebra. A stress fracture can cause a spinal bone to become weak and shift out of place.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of spondylolisthesis may vary from mild to severe. Many people with spondylolisthesis have no symptoms. Children may not show symptoms until they're 18 years old.\nThe condition can lead to increased and abnormal\nlordosis\n(also called swayback). In later stages, it may result in\nkyphosis\n(roundback) as the upper spine falls off the lower spine.\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nLower back pain\nMuscle tightness (tight hamstring muscle)\nPain,\nnumbness, or tingling\nin the thighs and buttocks\nLower back stiffness\nTenderness in the area of the vertebra that is out of place\nWeakness\nin the legs\nDifficulty with bladder or bowel control\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you and feel your spine. You will be asked to raise your leg straight out in front of you."}

Most people get better with exercises that stretch and strengthen lower back muscles.\nIf the shift is not severe, you can play most sports if there is no pain."}
