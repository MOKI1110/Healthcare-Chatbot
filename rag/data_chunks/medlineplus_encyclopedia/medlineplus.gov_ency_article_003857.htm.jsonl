Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBronchoscopy\nBronchoscopy\nBronchoscopy is a test to view the airways and diagnose lung disease. It may also be used during the treatment of some lung conditions.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA bronchoscope is a device used to see the inside of the airways and lungs. The scope can be flexible or rigid. A flexible scope is almost always used. It is a tube less than one half inch (1.27 centimeter) wide and about 2 feet (60 centimeters) long. In rare cases, a rigid bronchoscope is used.\nYou will likely get\nmedicines through a vein\n(IV, or intravenously) to help you relax. Or, you may be asleep under\ngeneral anesthesia\n, especially if a rigid scope is used.\nA numbing medicine (anesthetic) will be sprayed in your mouth and throat. If bronchoscopy is done through your nose, numbing jelly will be placed in the nostril the tube goes through.\nThe scope is gently inserted. It will likely make you cough at first. The coughing will stop as the numbing medicine begins to work.\nYour health care provider may send saline solution through the tube."}

It will likely make you cough at first. The coughing will stop as the numbing medicine begins to work.\nYour health care provider may send saline solution through the tube. This washes the lungs and allows your provider to collect samples of lung cells, fluids, microbes and other materials inside the air sacs. This part of the procedure is called a lavage.\nSometimes, tiny brushes, needles, or forceps may be passed through the bronchoscope to take very small tissue samples (biopsies) from your lungs.\nYour provider can also place a\nstent\nin your airway or view your lungs with\nultrasound\nduring the procedure. A stent is a small tube-like medical device. Ultrasound is a painless imaging method that allows your provider to see inside your body.\nSometimes ultrasound is used to see the lymph nodes and tissues around your airways, and small needles can be inserted there to obtain tissue and make certain diagnoses.\nAt the end of the procedure, the scope is removed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nFollow instructions on how to prepare for the test."}

You will likely be told:\nNot to eat or drink anything for 6 to 12 hours before your test.\nNot to take aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen, or other blood-thinning medicines before your procedure. Ask the provider who will do your bronchoscopy if and when to stop taking these medicines.\nArrange for a ride to and from the hospital.\nArrange for help with work, child care, or other tasks, as you will likely need to rest the next day.\nThe test is most often done as an outpatient procedure, and you will go home the same day. Rarely, some people may need to stay overnight in the hospital.\nHow the Test will Feel\nLocal anesthetic is used to relax and numb your throat muscles. Until this medicine begins to work, you may feel fluid running down the back of your throat. This may cause you to cough or gag.\nOnce the medicine takes effect, you may feel pressure or mild tugging as the tube moves through your windpipe."}

This may cause you to cough or gag.\nOnce the medicine takes effect, you may feel pressure or mild tugging as the tube moves through your windpipe. Although you may feel like you are not able to breathe when the tube is in your throat, there is no risk of this happening. The medicines you receive to relax will help with these symptoms. You will likely forget most of the procedure.\nWhen the anesthetic wears off, your throat may be scratchy for several days. After the test, your ability to cough (cough reflex) will return in 1 to 2 hours. You will not be allowed to eat or drink until your cough reflex returns.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou may have a bronchoscopy to help your provider diagnose lung problems."}
