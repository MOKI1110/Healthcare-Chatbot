Small cuts are made to insert the camera and small surgical tools into your knee for the procedure.\nDescription\nThree different types of pain relief (anesthesia) may be used for knee arthroscopy surgery:\nLocal anesthesia. Your knee may be numbed with pain medicine. You may also be given medicines that relax you. You will stay awake.\nSpinal anesthesia\n. This is also called regional anesthesia. The pain medicine is injected into a space in your spine. You will be awake but will not be able to feel anything below your waist.\nGeneral anesthesia\n. You will be asleep and pain-free.\nRegional nerve block (femoral or adductor canal block). This is another type of regional anesthesia. The pain medicine is injected around the nerve in your groin or leg. You will be asleep during the operation."}

This is another type of regional anesthesia. The pain medicine is injected around the nerve in your groin or leg. You will be asleep during the operation. This type of anesthesia will block out pain so that you need less general anesthesia.\nA cuff-like device may be put around your thigh to help control bleeding during the procedure.\nThe surgeon will make 2 or 3 small cuts around your knee. Fluid (saline) will be pumped into your knee to inflate the knee.\nA narrow tube with a tiny camera on the end will be inserted through one of the cuts. The camera is attached to a video monitor that lets the surgeon see inside the knee.\nThe surgeon may put other small surgery tools inside your knee through the other cuts. The surgeon will then fix or remove the problem in your knee.\nAt the end of your surgery, the saline will be drained from your knee. The surgeon will close your cuts with sutures (stitches) and cover them with a dressing. Many surgeons take pictures of the procedure from the video monitor."}

You may be able to view these pictures after the operation so that you can see what was done.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nArthroscopy may be recommended for these knee problems:\nTorn\nmeniscus\n. Meniscus is cartilage that cushions the space between the bones in the knee. Surgery is done to repair or remove it.\nTorn or damaged\nanterior cruciate\nligament (ACL) or\nposterior cruciate\nligament (PCL).\nSwollen (inflamed) or damaged lining of the joint. This lining is called the synovium.\nKneecap (patella) that is out of position (misalignment).\nSmall pieces of broken cartilage in the knee joint.\nRemoval of a\nBaker cyst\n. This is a swelling behind the knee that is filled with fluid."}

These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), and other blood thinners.\nAsk which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\nTell your provider if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol (more than 1 drink per day for women or 2 drinks per day for men).\nIf you smoke, try to stop. Ask your provider for help. Smoking can slow down wound and bone healing. It also leads to a higher rate of surgical complications.\nAlways let your provider know about any cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness you have before your surgery.\nOn the day of your surgery:\nYou will most often be asked not to drink or eat anything for 6 to 12 hours before the procedure.\nTake the medicines you have been told to take with a small sip of water.\nYou will be told when to arrive at the hospital.\nAfter the Procedure\nYou will have an ace bandage on your knee over the dressing.\nMost people go home the same day\nthey have surgery."}

You may also be referred to a physical therapist.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nFull recovery after knee arthroscopy will depend on what type of problem was treated.\nProblems such as a torn meniscus, broken cartilage, Baker cyst, and problems with the synovium are often easily fixed. Many people stay active after these surgeries.\nRecovery from simple procedures is fast in most cases. You may need to use crutches for a while after some types of surgery. Your provider may also prescribe pain medicine.\nRecovery will take longer if you have had a more complex procedure. If parts of your knee have been repaired or rebuilt, you may not be able to walk without crutches or a knee brace for several weeks."}
