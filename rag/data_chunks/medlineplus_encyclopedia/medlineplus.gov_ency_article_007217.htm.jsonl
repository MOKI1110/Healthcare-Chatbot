Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nCA-125 is a protein that is found more in ovarian cancer cells than in other cells.\nThis blood test is often used to monitor women who have been diagnosed with\novarian cancer\n. The test is useful if the CA-125 level was high when the cancer was first diagnosed."}

The test is useful if the CA-125 level was high when the cancer was first diagnosed. In these cases, measuring the CA-125 over time is a good tool to determine if ovarian cancer treatment is working.\nThe CA-125 test may also be done if a woman has symptoms or findings on ultrasound that suggest ovarian cancer.\nIn general, this test is not used to screen healthy women for ovarian cancer when a diagnosis has not yet been made.\nNormal Results\nA level above 35 units/milliliter (U/mL) is considered abnormal.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different lab. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIn a woman who has ovarian cancer, a rise in CA-125 usually means that the disease has progressed or come back (recurred). A decrease in CA-125 usually means the disease is responding to current treatment.\nIn a woman who has not been diagnosed with ovarian cancer, a high CA-125 level may mean a number of things."}

While it may mean that she has ovarian cancer, it can also indicate other types of cancer, as well as several other diseases, such as\nendometriosis\n, which are not cancer.\nIn healthy women, an elevated CA-125 usually does not mean ovarian cancer is present. Most healthy women with an elevated CA-125 do not have ovarian cancer, or any other cancer.\nAny woman with an abnormal CA-125 test needs further tests. Sometimes surgery is needed to confirm the cause.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
