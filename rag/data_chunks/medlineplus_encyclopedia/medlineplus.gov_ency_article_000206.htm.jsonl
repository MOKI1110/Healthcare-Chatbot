But if the lining breaks down, the result may be:\nSwollen and inflamed tissue (\ngastritis\n)\nAn ulcer\nWatch this video about:\nStomach ulcer\nMost ulcers occur in the first, inner surface, layer of the inner lining. A hole in the stomach or duodenum is called a\nperforation\n. This is a medical emergency.\nThe most common cause of ulcers is infection of the stomach by bacteria called\nHelicobacter pylori\n(\nH pylori\n). Most people with peptic ulcers have these bacteria living in their digestive tract."}
