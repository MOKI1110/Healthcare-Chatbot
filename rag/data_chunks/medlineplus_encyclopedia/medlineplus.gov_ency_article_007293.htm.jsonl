Iontophoresis has a variety of uses in medicine. This article discusses the use of iontophoresis to decrease sweating by blocking sweat glands.\nDescription\nThe area to be treated is placed into water. A gentle current of electricity passes through the water. A technician carefully and gradually increases the electrical current until you feel a light tingling sensation.\nThe therapy lasts about 30 minutes and requires several sessions each week.\nHow iontophoresis works is not exactly known. It is thought that the process somehow plugs the sweat glands and temporarily prevents you from sweating.\nIontophoresis units are also available for home use."}
