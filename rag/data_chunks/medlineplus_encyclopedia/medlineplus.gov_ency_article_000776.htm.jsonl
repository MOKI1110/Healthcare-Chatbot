These functions include blood pressure, heart rate, sweating, bowel and bladder emptying, and digestion. The nerves are part of the autonomic nervous system.\nCauses\nAutonomic neuropathy has a group of symptoms. It is not a specific disease. There are many causes.\nAutonomic neuropathy involves damage to the nerves that carry information from the brain and spinal cord. The information is then carried to the heart, blood vessels, bladder, intestines, sweat glands, and pupils.\nAutonomic neuropathy may be seen with:\nAlcohol overuse\nDiabetes\n(diabetic neuropathy)\nDisorders involving scarring of tissues around the nerves\nGuillain BarrÃ© syndrome\nor other diseases that inflame nerves\nHIV/AIDS\nInherited nerve disorders\nMultiple sclerosis\nParkinson disease\nSpinal cord injury\nSurgery or injury involving the nerves\nSymptoms\nSymptoms vary, depending on the nerves affected."}

Early symptoms might include:\nBecoming faint or lightheaded when standing\nChanges in bowel, bladder, or sexual function\nUnexplained nausea and vomiting when eating\nEarly diagnosis and treatment may control symptoms.\nAutonomic neuropathy may hide the warning signs of a heart attack. Instead of feeling chest pain, if you have autonomic neuropathy, during a heart attack you may only have:\nSudden fatigue\nSweating\nShortness of breath\nNausea and vomiting\nPrevention\nPrevent or regulate associated disorders to reduce the risk for neuropathy. For example, people with diabetes should closely\nregulate blood sugar levels\n.\nAlternative Names\nNeuropathy - autonomic; Autonomic nerve disease\nImages\nAutonomic Nerves\nCentral nervous system and peripheral nervous system\nReferences\nKatirji B.
