A ventral hernia is a sac (pouch) formed from the inner lining of your belly (abdomen) that pushes through a hole in the abdominal wall.\nVentral hernias often occur at the site of an old surgical cut (incision). This type of hernia is also called an incisional hernia.\nDescription\nYou will probably receive\ngeneral anesthesia\nfor this surgery. This will make you asleep and pain free.\nIf your hernia is small, you may receive a spinal or\nepidural block\nand medicine to relax you. You will be awake, but pain-free.\nYour surgeon will make a surgical cut in your abdomen.\nYour surgeon will find the hernia and separate it from the tissues around it. Then the contents of the hernia, such as intestines, will be gently pushed back into the abdomen."}

Then the contents of the hernia, such as intestines, will be gently pushed back into the abdomen. Your surgeon will only cut the intestines if they have been damaged.\nStrong stitches will be used to repair the hole or weak spot caused by the hernia.\nYour surgeon may also lay a piece of mesh over the weak area to make it stronger. Mesh helps prevent the hernia from coming back.\nYour surgeon may use a laparoscope to repair the hernia. This is a thin, lighted tube with a camera at the end. It lets your surgeon see inside your belly. Your surgeon inserts the laparoscope through a small cut in your belly and inserts the instruments through other small cuts. This type of procedure often heals faster, and with less pain and scarring. Not all hernias can be repaired with laparoscopic surgery.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nVentral hernias are fairly common in adults."}

Not all hernias can be repaired with laparoscopic surgery.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nVentral hernias are fairly common in adults. They tend to get bigger over time and there may be more than one in number.\nRisk factors include:\nA large abdominal incision\nBeing overweight\nDiabetes\nStraining when using the bathroom\nCoughing a lot\nHeavy lifting\nPregnancy\nSometimes, smaller hernias with no symptoms can be watched. Surgery may pose greater risks for people with serious medical problems.\nWithout surgery, there is a risk that some fat or part of the intestine will get stuck (incarcerated) in the hernia and become impossible to push back in. This is usually painful. The blood supply to this area may become cut off (strangulation). You may experience nausea or vomiting, and the bulging area may turn blue or a darker color due to loss of blood supply."}

This is a medical emergency and urgent surgery is needed.\nTo avoid this problem, surgeons often recommend repairing the ventral hernia.\nGet medical care right away if you have a hernia that does not get smaller when you are lying down or a hernia that you cannot push back in.\nRisks\nThe risks of ventral hernia repair are usually very low, unless the patient also has other serious medical problems.\nRisks of having any anesthesia and surgery are:\nReactions to medicines\nBreathing problems\n, such as\npneumonia\nHeart problems\nBleeding\nBlood clots\nInfection\nA specific risk of ventral hernia surgery is injury to the bowel (small or large intestine). This is rare.\nBefore the Procedure\nYour surgeon will see you and give you instructions.\nAn anesthesiologist will discuss your medical history to decide the right amount and type of anesthesia to use. You may be asked to stop eating and drinking 6 to 8 hours before surgery."}

Make sure you tell your surgeon or nurse about any medicines, allergies, or history of bleeding problems.\nSeveral days before surgery, you may be asked to stop taking:\nAspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn)\nOther blood-thinning medicines\nCertain vitamins and supplements\nAfter the Procedure\nMost ventral hernia repairs are done on an outpatient basis. This means that you will likely go home on the same day. If the hernia is very large, you may need to stay in the hospital for a couple of days.\nAfter surgery, your vital signs such as pulse, blood pressure, and breathing will be monitored. You will stay in the recovery area until you are stable. Your surgeon will prescribe pain medicine if you need it.\nYour surgeon or nurse may advise you to drink plenty of fluids along with a fiber-rich diet. This will help prevent straining during bowel movements.\nEase back into activity."}

However, to reduce the risk of getting another hernia, you need to maintain a healthy lifestyle, such as maintaining a healthy weight.\nReferences\nMiller HJ, Novitsky YW.
