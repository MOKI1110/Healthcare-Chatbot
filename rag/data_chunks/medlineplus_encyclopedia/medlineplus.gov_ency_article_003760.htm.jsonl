The Gram stain method is one of the most commonly used techniques to quickly diagnose bacterial infections.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYour health care provider will remove a sample of tissue from the skin sore (lesion). This can be done with a simple swab, a needle or syringe, or with a\nbiopsy\n. If you have a biopsy, your provider will numb the area of skin so you don't feel anything.\nThe sample is sent to a lab. There, it is applied in a very thin layer to a glass slide. A series of different colored stains are applied to the sample. The stained slide is examined under a microscope to check for bacteria. The color, size, shape, and organization of the cells help identify the germ causing the infection.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo preparation is needed for the lab test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThere will be a sting when the anesthetic is given."}

You should only feel pressure or discomfort similar to a pinprick during the biopsy.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order this test if you have signs of an infected skin sore. The test is done to determine which bacteria caused the infection.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means no bacteria are present on the Gram stain. Other tests may be done to help diagnose the problem.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result means bacteria have been found in the skin lesion. Further tests may be needed to confirm the results. This allows your provider to prescribe the appropriate antibiotic or other treatment.\nRisks\nRisks of a skin biopsy may include:\nInfection\nScar\nYou will bleed slightly during the procedure.\nConsiderations\nskin or mucosal culture\nmay be done along with this test."}
