A bowel obstruction occurs when the contents of the intestines cannot pass through and exit the body. A complete obstruction is a surgical emergency.\nDescription\nIntestinal obstruction repair is done while you are under\ngeneral anesthesia\n. This means you are asleep and do not feel pain.\nYour surgeon makes a cut in your belly to see your intestines. Sometimes, the surgery can be done using a laparoscope, which means smaller cuts are used.\nYour surgeon locates the area of your intestine (bowel) that is blocked and unblocks it.\nAny damaged parts of your bowel will be repaired or removed. This procedure is called\nbowel resection\n. If a section is removed, the healthy ends will be reconnected with stitches or staples. Sometimes, when part of the intestine is removed, the ends cannot be reconnected. If this happens, your surgeon will bring one end out through an opening in the abdominal wall."}

This may be done using a\ncolostomy\nor\nileostomy\n.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThis procedure is done to relieve a blockage in your intestine. A blockage that lasts for a long time can reduce or block blood flow to the area. This can cause the bowel to die.\nRisks\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general include:\nReactions to medicines\nBreathing problems\nBleeding, blood clots, infection\nRisks of this procedure:\nBowel obstruction after surgery\nDamage to nearby organs in the body\nFormation of scar tissue (\nadhesions\n)\nMore scar tissue forming in your belly and causing a blockage of your intestines in the future\nOpening of the edges of your intestines that are sewn together (anastomotic leak), which may cause life-threatening problems\nProblems with the colostomy or ileostomy\nTemporary paralysis (freezing up) of the bowel (\nparalytic ileus\n)\nAfter the Procedure\nHow long it takes to recover depends on your overall health and the type of operation.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome is usual"}
