The person is unable to fully absorb dietary fats through their intestines.\nCauses\nBassen-Kornzweig syndrome is caused by changes in the\nMTTP\ngene that tells the body to create lipoproteins (molecules of fat combined with\nprotein\n). These variants make it hard for the body to properly digest fat and essential vitamins.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nBalance and coordination difficulties\nCurvature of spine\nDecreased vision that gets worse over time\nDevelopmental delay\nFailure to thrive (grow) in infancy\nMuscle weakness\nPoor muscle coordination that usually develops after age 10\nProtruding abdomen\nSlurred speech\nStool abnormalities, including fatty stools that appear pale in color, frothy stools, and abnormally foul-smelling stools\nExams and Tests\nThere may be damage to the retina of the eye (\nretinitis pigmentosa\n).\nTests that may be done to help diagnose this condition include:\nApolipoprotein B\nblood test\nBlood tests to look for"}

Diet changes are needed to prevent stomach problems. This may involve limiting intake of some types of fat.\nSupplements of medium-chain triglycerides are taken under the supervision of a health care provider."}

They should be used with caution, because they may cause liver damage.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well a person does depends on the amount of brain and nervous system problems.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nBlindness\nMental deterioration\nLoss of function of peripheral nerves, uncoordinated movement (ataxia)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your infant or child has symptoms of this disease. Genetic counseling can help families understand the condition and the risks of inheriting it, and learn how to care for the person.\nPrevention\nHigh doses of fat-soluble vitamins may slow the progression of some problems, such as retina damage and decreased vision.\nAlternative Names\nAbetalipoproteinemia; Acanthocytosis; Apolipoprotein B deficiency\nReferences\nKliegman RM, St. Geme JW, Blum NJ, Shah SS, Tasker RC, Wilson KM.
