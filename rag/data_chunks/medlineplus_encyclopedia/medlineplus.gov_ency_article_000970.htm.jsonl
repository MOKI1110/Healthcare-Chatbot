This is called the pylorus. This article describes the condition in infants.\nCauses\nNormally, food passes easily from the stomach into the first part of the small intestine through a valve called the pylorus. With pyloric stenosis, the muscles of the pylorus are thickened. This prevents the stomach from emptying into the small intestine.\nThe exact cause of the thickening is unknown. Genes may play a role, since children of parents who had pyloric stenosis are more likely to have this condition. Other risk factors include:\nCertain antibiotics\nToo much acid in the first part of the\nsmall intestine\n(duodenum)\nCertain diseases a baby is born with, such as diabetes\nPyloric stenosis occurs most often in infants younger than 6 months."}

The surgery is called pyloromyotomy.\nIf it is not safe to put the infant to sleep for surgery, an\nendoscope\nis used. This is a long, flexible tube with a camera and a tiny balloon at the end. The balloon is inflated to widen the pylorus.\nIn infants who cannot have surgery, tube feeding or medicine to relax the pylorus is tried.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSurgery usually relieves all symptoms. As soon as several hours after surgery, the infant can start small, frequent feedings.\nPossible Complications\nIf pyloric stenosis isn't treated, a baby won't get enough nutrition and fluid."}
