This test is  done along with\nelectromyography\n(EMG) to assess the muscles for abnormalities.\nHow the Test is Performed\nAdhesive patches called surface electrodes are placed on the skin over nerves or muscles at different spots. A very mild electrical impulse is applied via other patches or a handheld stimulator to stimulate the nerve.\nThe resulting electrical activity of the nerve is recorded by the electrodes. The distance between electrodes and the time it takes for electrical impulses to travel between electrodes are used to measure the speed of the nerve signals. It is normal for several different nerves to be tested.\nEMG is the recording from needles placed into the muscles. This is often done during the same visit as NCV.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou must stay at a normal body temperature."}

Being too cold alters nerve conduction and can give false results.\nTell your health care provider if you have a cardiac defibrillator or pacemaker, or other implanted device such as a deep brain stimulator. Special steps may need to be taken before the test if you have one of these devices.\nDo not wear any lotions, sunscreen, perfume, or moisturizer on your body on the day of the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe impulse may feel like an electric shock. You may feel some discomfort depending on how strong the impulse is. You should feel no pain once the test is finished.\nOften, the nerve conduction test is followed by EMG. In this test, a needle is placed into a muscle and you are told to contract that muscle. This process can be uncomfortable during the test. You may have muscle soreness or bruising after the test at the site where the needle was inserted.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is used to diagnose nerve damage or destruction."}

Newborn infants have values that are approximately half that of adults. Adult values are normally reached by age 3 or 4.\nNote: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs."}
