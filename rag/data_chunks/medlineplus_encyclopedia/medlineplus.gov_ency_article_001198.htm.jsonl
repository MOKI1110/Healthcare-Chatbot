It is a type of brain disease called leukodystrophy.\nCauses\nA defect in the\nGALC\ngene causes Krabbe disease. People with this gene defect do not make enough of a substance (\nenzyme\n) called galactocerebroside beta-galactosidase (galactosylceramidase).\nThe body needs this enzyme to make myelin. Myelin surrounds and protects nerve fibers. Without this enzyme, myelin breaks down, brain cells die, and nerves in the brain and other body areas do not work properly.\nKrabbe disease can develop at various ages:\nEarly-onset Krabbe disease appears in the first months of life. Most children with this form of the disease die before they reach age 2.\nLate-onset Krabbe disease begins in late childhood or early adolescence.\nKrabbe disease is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry the nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease."}

If both parents carry the nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease. It is an\nautosomal recessive disorder\n.\nThis condition is very rare. It is most common among people of Scandinavian descent.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of early-onset Krabbe disease are:\nChanging muscle tone from floppy to rigid\nHearing loss that leads to deafness\nFailure to thrive\nFeeding difficulties\nIrritability and sensitivity to loud sounds\nSevere\nseizures\n(may begin at a very early age)\nUnexplained fevers\nVision loss that leads to blindness\nVomiting\nWith late onset Krabbe disease, vision problems may appear first, followed by walking difficulties and rigid muscles. Symptoms vary from person to person."}

Other symptoms may also occur.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms.\nTests that may be done include:\nBlood test to look for galactosylceramidase levels in white blood cells\nCSF total protein\n-- tests the amount of protein in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)\nGenetic testing for the GALC genetic variant\nMRI of the head\nNerve conduction velocity\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for Krabbe disease.\nSome people have had a bone marrow transplant in the early stages of the disease, but this treatment has risks.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with Krabbe disease and their families can be found at:\nNational Organization for Rare Disorders --\nrarediseases.org/rare-diseases/leukodystrophy-krabbes/\nNIH Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center --\nrarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/6844/krabbe-disease\nUnited Leukodystrophy Foundation --\nulf.org\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome is likely to be poor."}

It can cause:\nBlindness\nDeafness\nSevere problems with muscle tone\nThe disease is usually life-threatening.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your child develops symptoms of this disorder."}
