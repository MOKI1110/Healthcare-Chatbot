Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMuscle function loss\nMuscle function loss\nMuscle function loss is when a muscle does not work or move normally. The medical term for complete loss of muscle function is paralysis.\nConsiderations\nLoss of muscle function may be caused by:\nA disease of the muscle itself (myopathy)\nA disease of the area where the muscle and nerve meet (neuromuscular junction)\nA disease of the nervous system: Nerve damage (neuropathy), spinal cord injury (myelopathy), or brain damage (\nstroke\nor other brain injury)\nThe loss of muscle function after some of these types of events can be severe. In some cases, muscle strength may not completely return, even with treatment.\nParalysis can be temporary or permanent. It can affect a small area (localized or focal) or be widespread (generalized). It may affect one side (unilateral) or both sides (bilateral).\nIf the paralysis affects the lower half of the body and both legs it is called paraplegia. If it affects both arms and legs, it is called quadriplegia."}

If the paralysis affects the muscles that cause breathing, it is quickly life threatening.\nCauses\nDiseases of the muscles that cause muscle-function loss include:\nAlcohol-associated myopathy\nCongenital myopathies (most often due to a genetic disorder)\nDermatomyositis\nand\npolymyositis\nDrug-induced myopathy (statins, steroids)\nMuscular dystrophy\nDiseases of the nervous system that cause muscle function loss include:\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n(ALS, or Lou Gehrig disease)\nBell palsy\nBotulism\nGuillain-BarrÃ© syndrome\nMyasthenia gravis\nor Lambert-Eaton Syndrome\nNeuropathy\nParalytic\nshellfish\npoisoning\nPeriodic paralysis\nFocal nerve injury\nPolio\nor other viruses\nSpinal cord or brain injury\nStroke\nHome Care\nSudden loss of muscle function is a medical emergency."}

Get medical help right away.\nAfter you have received medical treatment, your health care provider may recommend some of the following measures:\nFollow your prescribed therapy.\nIf the nerves to your face or head are damaged, you may have difficulty chewing and swallowing or closing your eyes. In these cases, a soft diet may be recommended. You will also need some form of eye protection, such as a patch over the eye while you are asleep.\nLong-term immobility can cause serious complications. Change positions often and take care of your skin. Range-of-motion exercises may help to maintain some muscle tone.\nSplints\nmay help prevent muscle contractures, a condition in which a muscle becomes permanently shortened.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nMuscle paralysis always requires immediate medical attention."}
