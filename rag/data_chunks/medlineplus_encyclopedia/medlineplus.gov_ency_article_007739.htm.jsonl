Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPanniculectomy\nPanniculectomy\nPanniculectomy is a surgery done to remove stretched out, excess fat and overhanging skin from your abdomen. This can occur after a person undergoes massive weight loss. The skin may hang down and cover your thighs and genitals. Surgery to remove this skin helps improve your health and appearance.\nPanniculectomy is different from abdominoplasty. In\nabdominoplasty\n, your surgeon will remove extra fat and also tighten your abdominal (belly) muscles. Sometimes, both types of surgery are performed at the same time.\nDescription\nThe surgery will take place in a hospital or a surgery center. This surgery may take several hours.\nYou will receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n."}

This will keep you asleep and pain-free during the procedure.\nThe surgeon may make a cut from under your breast bone to just above your pelvic bone.\nA horizontal cut is made in your lower belly, just above the pubic area.\nThe surgeon will remove the overhanging extra skin and fat, called an apron or pannus.\nThe surgeon will close your cut with sutures (stitches).\nSmall tubes, called drains, may be inserted to allow fluid to drain out of the wound as the area heals. These will be removed later.\nA dressing will be placed over your abdomen. You may need to wear a binder.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nWhen you lose a lot of weight, such as 100 pounds (45 kg) or more after bariatric surgery, your skin may not be elastic enough to shrink back to its natural shape. This can cause the skin to sag and hang. It may cover your thighs and genitals. This extra skin can make it hard to keep yourself clean and to walk and perform daily activities. It also can cause rashes or sores."}

You may need to stay longer if your surgery is more complex.\nAfter you recover from the anesthesia, you will be asked to get up to walk a few steps.\nYou will have pain and swelling for days after surgery. Your surgeon will give you pain killers to help relieve the pain. You may also experience numbness, bruising, and tiredness during that time. It may help to rest with your legs and hips bent during recovery to reduce pressure on your abdomen.\nAfter a day or so, your surgeon may have you wear an elastic support, like a girdle, to provide extra support while you heal. You should avoid strenuous activity and anything that makes you strain for 4 to 6 weeks. You will probably be able to return to work in about 4 weeks.\nIt takes about 3 months for swelling to go down and wounds to heal.
