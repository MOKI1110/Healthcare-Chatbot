These chains of molecules are called glycosaminoglycans (formerly called mucopolysaccharides). As a result, the molecules build up in different parts of the body and cause various health problems.\nThe condition belongs to a group of diseases called\nmucopolysaccharidoses\n(MPSs). MPS II is also known as Hunter syndrome.\nThere are several other types of MPSs, including:\nMPS I\n(Hurler syndrome; Hurler-Scheie syndrome; Scheie syndrome)\nMPS III\n(Sanfilippo syndrome)\nMPS IV\n(Morquio syndrome)\nCauses\nMPS II is a genetic disorder. This means it can be passed down through families. The affected gene is on the X chromosome. Boys are most often affected because they have only one X chromosome, which they inherit from their mothers."}

The affected gene is on the X chromosome. Boys are most often affected because they have only one X chromosome, which they inherit from their mothers. Their mothers do not have symptoms of the disease because although they carry one nonworking copy of the gene, they also have a second copy of the X chromosome.\nMPS II is caused by a lack of the enzyme iduronate sulfatase. Without this enzyme, chains of sugar molecules build up in various body tissues, causing damage.\nThe early-onset, severe form of the disease begins shortly after age 2. A late-onset, mild form causes less severe symptoms to appear later in life.\nSymptoms\nIn the early-onset, severe form, symptoms include:\nAggressive behavior\nHyperactivity\nMental function gets worse over time\nSevere\nintellectual disability\nJerky body movements\nIn the late (mild) form, there can be mild to no mental deficiency.\nIn both forms, symptoms include:\nCarpal tunnel syndrome\nCoarse features of the face\nDeafness\n(gets worse over time)\nIncreased hair growth\nJoint stiffness\nLarge head\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam and tests may show:\nAbnormal\nretina\n(back of the eye)\nDecreased iduronate sulfatase"}
