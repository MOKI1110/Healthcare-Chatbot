Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAcidosis\nAcidosis\nAcidosis is a condition in which there is too much acid in the body fluids. It is the opposite of\nalkalosis\n(a condition in which there is too much base in the body fluids).\nCauses\nThe kidneys and lungs maintain the balance (proper pH level) of chemicals called acids and bases in the body. Acidosis occurs when acid builds up or when bicarbonate (a base) is lost. Acidosis is classified as either\nrespiratory\nor\nmetabolic acidosis\n.\nRespiratory acidosis develops when there is too much carbon dioxide (an acid) in the body. This type of acidosis is usually caused when the body is unable to remove enough carbon dioxide through breathing. Other names for respiratory acidosis are hypercapnic acidosis and carbon dioxide acidosis."}

It can also occur when the kidneys cannot remove enough acid from the body. There are several types of metabolic acidosis:\nDiabetic acidosis\n(also called diabetic ketoacidosis and DKA) develops when substances called ketone bodies (which are acidic) build up during uncontrolled\ndiabetes\n(usually type 1 diabetes).\nHyperchloremic acidosis is caused by the loss of too much sodium bicarbonate from the body, which can happen with severe diarrhea.\nKidney disease (uremia,\ndistal renal tubular acidosis\nor\nproximal renal tubular acidosis\n).\nLactic acidosis.\nPoisoning by aspirin, ethylene glycol (found in antifreeze), or methanol.\nSevere\ndehydration\n.\nLactic acidosis\nis a buildup of\nlactic acid\n.

Many causes of metabolic acidosis can be prevented, including diabetic ketoacidosis and some causes of lactic acidosis.
