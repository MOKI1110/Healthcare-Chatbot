Avoiding your triggers may help you prevent or reduce flare-ups.\nSome things you can do to help ease or prevent symptoms include:\nAvoid sun exposure. Use sunscreen every day.\nAvoid a lot of activity in hot weather.\nTry to reduce stress. Try deep breathing, yoga, or other relaxation techniques.\nLimit spicy foods, alcohol, and hot beverages.\nOther triggers may include wind, hot baths, cold weather, specific skin products, exercise, or other factors.\nAntibiotics taken by mouth or applied to the skin may control acne-like skin problems. Ask your provider.\nIsotretinoin is a strong drug that your provider might consider. It is used in people who have severe rosacea that hasn't improved after treatment with other medicines.\nRosacea is not acne and will not improve with over-the-counter acne treatment.\nIn very bad cases, laser surgery may help reduce the redness."}
