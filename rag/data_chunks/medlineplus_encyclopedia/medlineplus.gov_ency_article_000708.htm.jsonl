Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHorner syndrome\nHorner syndrome\nHorner syndrome is a rare condition that affects the nerves to the eyes and face.\nCauses\nHorner syndrome can be caused by any interruption in a set of nerve fibers that start in the part of the brain called the hypothalamus and travel to the face and eyes. These nerve fibers are involved with sweating, the pupils in your eyes, and the upper and lower eyelid muscles.\nDamage of the nerve fibers can result from:\nInjury to the carotid artery, one of the main arteries to the brain\nInjury to nerves at the base of the neck called the brachial plexus or nerve roots\nMigraine\nor\ncluster headaches\nStroke\n, tumor, or other damage to a part of the brain called the brainstem\nTumor or infection in the top of the lung, between the lungs, and neck\nInjections or surgery done to interrupt the nerve fibers and relieve pain (sympathectomy)\nSpinal cord injury\nIn rare cases, Horner syndrome is present at birth."}

There is no treatment for Horner syndrome itself. Ptosis is very mild and in rare cases affects vision in Horner syndrome. This can be corrected by cosmetic surgery or treated with eyedrops. Your provider can tell you more.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome depends on whether treatment of the cause is successful.\nPossible Complications\nThere are no direct complications of Horner syndrome itself. But, there may be complications from the disease that caused Horner syndrome or from its treatment.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of Horner syndrome.\nAlternative Names\nOculosympathetic paresis; Horner's syndrome\nImages\nCentral nervous system and peripheral nervous system\nReferences\nBalcer LJ.
