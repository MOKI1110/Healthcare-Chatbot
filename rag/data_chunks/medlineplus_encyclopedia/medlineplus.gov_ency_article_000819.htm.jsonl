But, your body's immune system may produce a substance (antibody) against that drug. The next time you take the drug, the antibody may tell your white blood cells to make a chemical called histamine. Histamines and other chemicals cause your allergy symptoms. The reaction of the body when a drug allergy is present generally involves special cells called B and T cell lymphocytes.\nCommon\nallergy-causing\ndrugs include:\nDrugs used to treat seizures\nInsulin (mainly insulin from animal sources)\nSubstances containing iodine, such as x-ray contrast dyes (these can cause allergy-like reactions)\nPenicillin and related antibiotics\nSulfa drugs\nMost side effects of drugs are not due to an allergic reaction caused by the formation of IgE antibodies."}

For example, aspirin can cause\nhives\nor trigger\nasthma\nwithout involving the immune system. Many people confuse an unpleasant, but not serious, side effect of a medicine (such as nausea) with a drug allergy.\nSymptoms\nMost drug allergies cause minor skin rashes and hives. These symptoms may occur right away or hours after receiving the drug.\nSerum sickness\nis a delayed type of reaction that occurs a week or more after you are exposed to a medicine or vaccine."}

There are no good skin or blood tests to help diagnose other drug allergies.\nIf you have had allergy-like symptoms after taking a medicine or receiving contrast (dye) before getting an x-ray, your health care provider will often tell you that this is proof of a drug allergy."}

You do not need more testing.\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent a severe reaction.\nTreatment may include:\nAntihistamines to relieve mild symptoms such as rash, hives, and itching\nBronchodilators such as albuterol to reduce asthma-like symptoms (moderate wheezing or cough)\nCorticosteroids applied to the skin, given by mouth, or given through a vein (intravenously)\nEpinephrine by injection to treat anaphylaxis\nThe offending medicine and similar drugs should be avoided. Make sure all your providers -- including dentists and hospital staff -- know about any drug allergies that you or your children have.\nIn some cases, drug allergy responds to desensitization. This treatment involves being given very small doses at first, followed by larger and larger doses of a medicine to improve your tolerance of the drug."}

This treatment involves being given very small doses at first, followed by larger and larger doses of a medicine to improve your tolerance of the drug. This process should be done only by an allergist, when there is no alternative drug for you to take.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost drug allergies respond to treatment. But sometimes, they can lead to severe asthma, anaphylaxis, or death.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you are taking a medicine and seem to be having a reaction to it.\nGo to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have difficulty breathing or develop other symptoms of severe asthma or anaphylaxis. These are emergency conditions.\nPrevention\nThere is generally no way to prevent a drug allergy.\nIf you have a known drug allergy, avoiding the drug is the best way to prevent an allergic reaction. You may also be told to avoid similar medicines.\nIn some cases, a provider may approve the use of a drug that causes an allergy if you are first treated with medicines that slow or block the immune response."}
