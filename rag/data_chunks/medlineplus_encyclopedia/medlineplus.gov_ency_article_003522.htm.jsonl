After the test, you may have some throbbing at the site.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou will need the test if you have symptoms of a previous infection by group A streptococcus. Some illnesses caused by these bacteria are:\nBacterial endocarditis, an infection of the inner lining of your heart\nGuttate psoriasis\nA kidney problem called\nglomerulonephritis\nRheumatic fever\n, which can affect the heart, joints, or bones\nScarlet fever\nStrep throat\nThe ASO antibody may be found in the blood weeks or months after the strep infection has gone away.\nNormal Results\nA negative test result means that you do not have strep infection. Your health care provider may do the test again in 2 to 4 weeks. At times, a test that was negative the first time may be positive (meaning it finds ASO antibodies) when done again.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal or positive test result means you recently had a strep infection, even if you had no symptoms.\nRisks\nVeins and arteries vary in size from person to person, and from one side of the body to the other."}
