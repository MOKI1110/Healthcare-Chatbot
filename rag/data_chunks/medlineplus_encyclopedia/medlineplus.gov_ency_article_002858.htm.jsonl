They are usually found in barns, sheds, stone walls, fences, woodpiles, porch furniture, and other outdoor structures. They are usually, but not always, found near ground level, or within a few feet of the ground. They make irregular, asymmetrical, \"disorganized\" looking webs.\nThis genus of spider species is found worldwide. They are most plentiful in temperate and subtropical climates, especially during the summer months, and are common throughout the southern United States.\nWear protective clothing when traveling through areas where these spiders live. DO NOT put your hands or feet in their nests or in their preferred hiding places, such as dark, sheltered areas under logs or underbrush, or other damp, moist areas.\nSymptoms\nThe first symptom of a black widow bite is usually pain similar to a pinprick. This is felt when the bite is made. Some people may not feel it."}
