The person may pluck other hairy areas, such as the eyebrows, eyelashes, or body hair.\nThese symptoms are most often seen in children:\nAn uneven appearance to the hair\nBare patches or all around (diffuse) loss of hair\nBowel blockage (obstruction) if people eat the hair they pull out\nConstant tugging, pulling, or twisting of hair\nDenying the hair pulling\nHair regrowth that feels like stubble in the bare spots\nIncreasing sense of tension before the hair pulling\nOther self-injury behaviors\nSense of relief, pleasure, or gratification after the hair pulling\nMost people with this disorder also have problems with:\nFeeling sad or depressed\nAnxiety\nPoor self-image\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine your skin, hair, and scalp.

A piece of tissue may be removed (\nbiopsy\n) to find other causes, such as a scalp infection, and to explain the hair loss.\nTreatment\nExperts don't agree on the use of medicine for treatment. However, naltrexone and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have been shown to be effective in reducing some symptoms. Behavioral therapy and habit reversal may also be effective.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nTrichotillomania that begins in younger children (less than 6 years old) may go away without treatment. For most people, the hair pulling ends within 12 months.\nFor others, trichotillomania is a lifelong disorder. However, treatment often improves the hair pulling and the feelings of depression, anxiety, or poor self-image.\nPossible Complications\nPeople can have complications when they eat the pulled-out hair (trichophagia). This can cause a blockage in the intestines or lead to poor nutrition.\nPrevention\nEarly detection is the best form of prevention because it leads to early treatment."}
