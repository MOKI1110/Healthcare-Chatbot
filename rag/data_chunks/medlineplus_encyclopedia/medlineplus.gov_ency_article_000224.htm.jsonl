It is a type of bacterial food poisoning.\nCauses\nCampylobacter enteritis is a common cause of\nintestinal infection\n. These bacteria are also one of the many causes of traveler's diarrhea or\nfood poisoning\n.\nPeople most often get infected by eating or drinking food or water that contains the bacteria. The most commonly contaminated foods are raw poultry, fresh produce,  and unpasteurized milk.\nA person can also be infected by close contact with infected people or animals.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms start 2  to 4 days after being exposed to the bacteria. They often last a week, and may include:\nCramping\nabdominal pain\nFever\nNausea and vomiting\nWatery\ndiarrhea\n, sometimes bloody\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

These tests may be done:\nComplete blood count (CBC)\nwith differential\nStool sample testing for white blood cells\nStool culture\nfor\nCampylobacter jejuni\nTreatment\nThe infection almost always goes away on its own, and often does not need to be treated with antibiotics. Severe symptoms may improve with antibiotics.\nThe goal is to make you feel better and avoid\ndehydration\n. Dehydration is a loss of water and other fluids in the body.\nThese things may help you feel better if you have diarrhea:\nDrink 8 to 10 glasses of clear fluids every day. For people who do not have diabetes, fluids should contain salts and simple sugars. For those with diabetes, sugar-free fluids should be used with careful monitoring of blood sugars.\nDrink at least 1 cup (240 milliliters) of liquid every time you have a loose bowel movement.\nEat small meals throughout the day instead of 3 big meals.\nEat some salty foods, such as pretzels, soup, and sports drinks."}
