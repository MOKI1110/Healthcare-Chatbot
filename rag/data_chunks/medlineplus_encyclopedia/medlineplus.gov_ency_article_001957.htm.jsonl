Plaque begins to build up on teeth within a few minutes after eating. If teeth are not cleaned well each day, plaque will lead to tooth decay or gum disease. If you do not remove plaque, it turns into a hard deposit called tartar that becomes trapped at the base of the tooth. Plaque and tartar irritate and inflame the gums. Bacteria and the body's inflammatory response to it cause the gums to become:\nInfected\nSwollen\nTender\nBy taking good care of your teeth and gums, you can help prevent problems such as tooth decay (caries) and\ngum disease (gingivitis or periodontitis)\n."}

Flossing removes plaque that is left behind after brushing from between the teeth and on the gums.\nBrush your teeth twice a day with a soft-bristled toothbrush. Brush for at least 2 minutes each time.\nUse fluoride toothpaste. The fluoride helps strengthen tooth enamel and helps prevent tooth decay.\nReplace your toothbrush every 3 to 4 months or sooner if needed. A worn-out toothbrush will not clean your teeth as well.  If you use an electric toothbrush, change heads every 3 to 4 months as well.\nEat a healthy diet. You are less likely to get gum disease if you eat healthy foods.\nAvoid sweets and sweetened drinks. Eating and drinking a lot of sweets increases your risk of cavities. If you do eat or drink sweets, brush your teeth soon after.\nDo not smoke. Smokers have more teeth and gum problems than non-smokers.\nKeep dentures, retainers, and other appliances clean. This includes brushing them regularly."}

Many dentists recommend having the teeth professionally cleaned every 6 months for optimal oral health. Seeing the dentist every 3 to 4 months may be needed if your gums become unhealthy.\nRegular teeth cleaning by a dentist or dental hygienist removes plaque that may develop, even with careful brushing and flossing. This is very important for getting at areas that are hard to reach on your own. Professional cleaning includes scaling and polishing. This procedure uses instruments to loosen and remove deposits from the teeth. Routine exams may include\ndental x-rays\n. Your dentist can catch problems early, so they do not become more serious and expensive to fix.\nAsk your dentist or dental hygienist:\nWhat kind of toothbrush you should use, and how to\nbrush your teeth well\n.
