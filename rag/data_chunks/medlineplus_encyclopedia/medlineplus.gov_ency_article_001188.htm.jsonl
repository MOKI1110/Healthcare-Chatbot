Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nParathyroid adenoma\nParathyroid adenoma\nA parathyroid adenoma is a noncancerous (\nbenign\n) tumor of the parathyroid glands. The parathyroid glands are located in the neck, near or attached to the back side of the thyroid gland.\nCauses\nThe parathyroid glands in the neck help regulate calcium absorption, use, and removal by the body. They do this by producing parathyroid hormone, or PTH. PTH helps regulate calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the blood and bone. It is important for healthy bones.\nParathyroid adenomas are common. Most parathyroid adenomas do not have an identified cause. Sometimes a genetic problem is the cause. This is more common if the diagnosis is made when you are young.\nParathyroid adenomas may occur in people without a family history of the disease, or as part of 3 inherited syndromes:\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) IIA\nIsolated familial hyperparathyroidism\nIn people with an inherited syndrome, a changed (variant) gene is passed down through the family."}

You only need to get the gene from one parent to develop the condition.\nIn MEN I, problems in the parathyroid glands occur, as well as tumors in the pituitary gland and pancreas.\nIn MEN IIA, overactivity of the parathyroid glands occurs, along with tumors in the adrenal or thyroid gland.\nConditions that stimulate the parathyroid glands to get bigger can also cause an adenoma. These include:\nGenetic disorders\nTaking the medicine lithium\nChronic kidney disease\nWomen over age 60 have the highest risk for developing this condition. Radiation to the head or neck also increases the risk.\nSymptoms\nMany people have no symptoms. The condition is often discovered when blood tests are done for another medical reason.\nParathyroid adenomas are the most common cause of\nhyperparathyroidism\n(overactive parathyroid glands), which leads to an increased blood calcium level."}

But, some people choose to only have regular checkups with their health care provider if the condition is mild.\nTo help improve the condition, your provider may ask you to stop taking calcium and vitamin D supplements. Women who have gone through menopause may want to discuss treatment with estrogen or other medicines to prevent bone loss.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWhen treated, outlook is generally good.\nPossible Complications\nOsteoporosis\nand the increased risk for bone fractures is the most common concern.\nOther complications are less common, but may include:\nCalcium deposits in the kidneys that can reduce kidney function (\nnephrocalcinosis\n)\nSoftened, weak areas in the bones (\nosteitis fibrosa\n)\nComplications from surgery include:\nDamage to a nerve that controls your voice\nDamage to the parathyroid glands, which causes\nhypoparathyroidism\n(lack of enough parathyroid hormone) and low calcium level\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of this con"}
