Soft tissue connects, supports, or surrounds other body parts. In adults, STS is rare.\nThere are many different types of soft tissue cancers. The type of sarcoma depends on the tissue it forms in:\nMuscles\nTendons\nFat\nBlood vessels\nLymph vessels\nNerves\nTissues in and around joints\nThe cancer can form almost anywhere, but is most common in the:\nHead\nNeck\nArms\nLegs\nTrunk\nAbdomen\nCauses\nIt is not known what causes most sarcomas. But there are certain risk factors:\nSome inherited diseases, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome\nRadiation therapy\nfor other cancers\nExposure to certain chemicals, such as vinyl chloride or certain herbicides\nHaving swelling in the arms or legs for a long time (\nlymphedema\n)\nSymptoms\nIn early stages, there are often no symptoms. As the cancer grows, it may cause a lump or swelling that keeps growing over time."}

As the cancer grows, it may cause a lump or swelling that keeps growing over time. Most lumps are not due to cancer.\nOther symptoms include:\nPain, if it presses on a nerve, organ, blood vessel, bone, or muscle\nBlockage or bleeding in the stomach or intestines\nBreathing problems\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will ask you about your medical history and do a physical exam. Other tests may include:\nX-rays\nCT scan\nMRI\nPET scan\nIf your provider suspects cancer, you might have a\nbiopsy\nto check for cancer. In a biopsy, your provider collects a tissue sample to examine in the lab.\nThe biopsy will show if cancer is present and help show how quickly it is growing. Your provider may ask for more tests to\nstage the cancer\n. Staging can tell how much cancer is present and whether it has spread.\nTreatment\nSurgery is the most common treatment for STS.\nIn early stages, the tumor and some healthy tissue around it is removed.\nSometimes, just a small amount of tissue needs to be removed."}

Other times, a wider area of tissue must be removed.\nWith advanced cancers that form in an arm or leg, surgery may be followed by radiation therapy or\nchemotherapy\n. Rarely, the limb may need to be amputated.\nYou also may have radiation therapy or chemotherapy:\nUsed before surgery to help shrink the tumor to make it easier to remove the cancer\nUsed after surgery to kill any remaining cancer cells\nChemotherapy may be used to help kill cancer that has\nmetastasized\n. This means it has spread to different areas of the body.\nSupport Groups\nCancer affects how you feel about yourself and your life. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a\ncancer support group\n. Sharing with others who have had the same experiences and problems can help you feel less alone.\nAsk your provider to help you find a support group for people who have been diagnosed with STS.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook for people whose cancer is treated early is very good."}

Most people who survive 5 years can expect to be cancer-free at 10 years.\nPossible Complications\nComplications include side effects from surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nSee your provider about any lump that grows in size or is painful.\nPrevention\nThe cause of most STSs isn't known and there is no way to prevent it. Knowing your risk factors and telling your provider when you first notice symptoms can increase your chance of surviving this type of cancer.\nAlternative Names\nSTS; Leiomyosarcoma; Hemangiosarcoma; Kaposi's sarcoma; Lymphangiosarcoma; Synovial sarcoma; Neurofibrosarcoma; Liposarcoma; Fibrosarcoma; Malignant fibrous histiocytoma; Dermatofibrosarcoma; Angiosarcoma\nImages\nTendons and muscles\nReferences\nContreras CM, Heslin MJ.
