It occurs when immune cells mistake the liver's normal cells for harmful invaders and attack them.\nCauses\nThis form of hepatitis is an\nautoimmune disease\n. The body's immune system cannot tell the difference between healthy body tissue and harmful, outside substances. The result is an immune response that destroys normal body tissues.\nLiver inflammation, or hepatitis, may occur along with other autoimmune diseases. These include:\nGraves disease\nInflammatory bowel disease\nRheumatoid arthritis\nScleroderma\nSjÃ¶gren syndrome\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\nThyroiditis\nType 1 diabetes\nUlcerative colitis\nAutoimmune hepatitis may occur in family members of people with autoimmune diseases."}
