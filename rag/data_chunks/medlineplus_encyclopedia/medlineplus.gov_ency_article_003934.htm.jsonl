Bone marrow is the soft tissue inside bones that helps form blood cells. It is found in the hollow part of most bones.\nBone marrow biopsy is not the same as\nbone marrow aspiration\n. An aspiration removes a small amount of marrow in liquid form for examination.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA bone marrow biopsy may be done in your health care provider's office or in a hospital. The sample may be taken from the pelvic or breast bone. Sometimes, another area is used.\nMarrow is removed in the following steps:\nIf needed, you are given medicine to help you relax.\nYour provider cleans the skin and injects numbing medicine into the area and surface of the bone.\nA biopsy needle is inserted into the bone. The center of the needle is removed and the hollowed needle is moved deeper into the bone."}

The center of the needle is removed and the hollowed needle is moved deeper into the bone. This captures a tiny sample, or core, of bone marrow within the needle.\nThe sample and needle are removed.\nPressure and then a bandage are applied to the skin.\nA bone marrow aspiration may also be done, usually before the biopsy is taken. After the skin is numbed, the needle is inserted into the bone, and a syringe is used to withdraw the liquid bone marrow. If this is done, the needle will be removed and repositioned. Or, another needle may be used for the biopsy.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nTell your provider:\nIf you are allergic to any medicines\nWhat medicines you are taking\nIf you have bleeding problems\nIf you are pregnant\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will feel a sharp sting when the numbing medicine is injected. The biopsy needle may also cause a brief, usually dull, pain."}

The biopsy needle may also cause a brief, usually dull, pain. Since the inside of the bone cannot be numbed, this test may cause some discomfort.\nIf a bone marrow aspiration is also done, you may feel a brief, sharp pain as the bone marrow liquid is removed.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order this test if you have abnormal types or numbers of red or white blood cells or platelets on a\ncomplete blood count\n(CBC).\nThis test is used to diagnose:\nAnemia\n(some types)\nCertain infections\nLeukemia\nOther blood cancers and disorders\nIt may also be used to help determine if a\ncancer\nhas spread or responded to treatment.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means the bone marrow contains the proper number and types of blood-forming (hematopoietic) cells, fat cells, and connective tissues.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be due to cancers of the bone marrow (leukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, or other cancers).\nThe results may detect the cause of anemia (too few red blood cells), abnormal white blood cells, or\nthrombocytopenia\n(too"}
