The term \"extremity\" often refers to a human limb.\nX-rays are a form of radiation that passes through the body to form an image on film or a digital image recorder. Structures that are dense (such as bone) will appear white. Air will be black, and other structures will be shades of gray.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is done in a hospital radiology department or in the health care provider's office. The x-ray is done by an x-ray technologist.\nYou will need to hold still as the x-ray is taken. You may be asked to change position, so more x-rays can be taken.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nTell your provider if you are pregnant. Remove all jewelry from the area being imaged.\nIn general, there is no discomfort."}
