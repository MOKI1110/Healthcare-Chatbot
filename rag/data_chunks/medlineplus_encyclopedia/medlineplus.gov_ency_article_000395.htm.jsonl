Causes include:\nCertain medicines, including glucocorticoids, ketoconazole, chemotherapy, and opioid pain medicines\nDiseases that affect the testicle, including\nhemochromatosis\n,\nmumps\n,\norchitis\n,\ntesticular cancer\n,\ntesticular torsion\n, and\nvaricocele\nInjury or trauma to the testicles\nObesity\nGenetic diseases, such as\nKlinefelter syndrome\nor\nPrader-Willi syndrome\nOther diseases, such as\ncystic fibrosis\nThe following can increase the risk of testicular failure:\nActivities that cause constant, low-level injury to the\nscrotum\n, such as riding a motorcycle or bicycle\nFrequent or heavy use of\nmarijuana\nUndescended testicles\nat birth\nSymptoms\nSymptoms depend on the age when testicular failure develops, either before or after puberty.\nSymptoms may include:\nDecrease in height\nEnlarged breasts\n(gynecomastia)\nInfertility\nLoss of muscle mass\nLack of sex drive (libido)\nLoss of armpit a"}

Blood tests may show a low level of\ntestosterone\nand high levels of prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone (\nFSH\n), and luteinizing hormone (\nLH\n)."}

Blood tests may show a low level of\ntestosterone\nand high levels of prolactin, follicle-stimulating hormone (\nFSH\n), and luteinizing hormone (\nLH\n). These hormone levels determine if testicular failure primary or secondary (due to a pituitary gland problem).\nIf your concern is fertility, your health care provider may also order a\nsemen analysis\nto examine the number of healthy sperm you are producing.\nSometimes, an ultrasound of the testes will be ordered.\nTesticular failure and low testosterone level may be hard to diagnose in older men because testosterone level normally decreases slowly with age.\nTesticular failure and low testosterone level also may be hard to diagnose in obese men. This is because obesity lowers a carrier molecule for testosterone called sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). The free testosterone level in the blood is usually normal in obese men who do not have testicular failure.\nTreatment\nMale hormone supplements may treat some forms of testicular failure. This treatment is called testosterone replacement therapy (TRT)."}

TRT can help reverse symptoms, although it may not restore fertility.\nMen who are having chemotherapy that can cause testicular failure should discuss freezing sperm samples before starting treatment.\nPossible Complications\nTesticular failure that begins before puberty will stop normal body growth. It can prevent adult male characteristics (such as deep voice and beard) from developing. This can be treated with TRT.\nMen who take TRT need to be carefully monitored by their provider."}
