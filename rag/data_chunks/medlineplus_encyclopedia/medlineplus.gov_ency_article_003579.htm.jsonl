It involves a number of tests to detect and measure various compounds that pass through the urine.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA urine sample is needed. Your health care provider will tell you what type of urine sample is needed. Two common methods of collecting urine are a\n24-hour urine collection\nand a\nclean catch urine specimen\n.\nThe sample is sent to a lab, where it is examined for the following:\nPHYSICAL COLOR AND APPEARANCE\nHow the urine sample looks to the naked eye:\nIs it clear or cloudy?\nIs it pale, or dark yellow, or another color?\nMICROSCOPIC APPEARANCE\nThe urine sample is examined under a microscope to:\nCheck if there are any cells, urine crystals,\nurinary casts\n, mucus, and other substances.\nIdentify any bacteria or other germs.\nCHEMICAL TESTS (\nurine chemistry\n)\nA special strip (dipstick) is used to test for substances in the urine sample."}

The strip has pads of chemicals that change color when they come in contact with substances of interest.\nExamples of specific urinalysis tests that may be done to check for problems include:\nRed blood cell urine test\nGlucose urine test\nProtein urine test\nUrine pH level test\nKetones urine test\nBilirubin urine test\nUrine specific gravity test\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nCertain medicines change the color of urine, but this is not a sign of disease."}

Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may mean you have an illness, such as:\nKidney disease\nUrinary tract infection\nKidney stones\nPoorly controlled diabetes\nBladder\nor\nkidney cancer\nYour provider can discuss the results with you.\nRisks\nThere are no risks with this test.\nConsiderations\nIf a home test is used, the person reading the results must be able to tell the difference between colors, because the results are interpreted using a color chart.\nAlternative Names\nUrine appearance and color; Routine urine test; Cystitis - urinalysis; Bladder infection - urinalysis; UTI - urinalysis; Urinary tract infection - urinalysis; Hematuria - urinalysis\nImages\nFemale urinary tract\nMale urinary tract\nR"}
