In most cases, only permanent teeth are replanted into the mouth. Baby teeth are not replanted.\nCauses\nTooth accidents are commonly caused by:\nAccidental falls\nSports-related trauma\nFighting\nCar accidents\nBiting on hard food\nFirst Aid\nSave any tooth that has been knocked out. Bring it to your dentist as soon as possible. The longer you wait, the less chance there is for your dentist to fix it. Hold the tooth only by the crown (chewing edge).\nYou can take the tooth to the dentist in one of these ways:\nTry to place the tooth back in your mouth where it fell out, so it is level with other teeth. Bite down gently on a gauze or a wet tea bag to help keep it in place."}

Bite down gently on a gauze or a wet tea bag to help keep it in place. Be careful not to swallow the tooth.\nIf you cannot do the above step, place the tooth in a container and cover it with a small amount of cow's milk or saliva.\nYou can also hold the tooth between your lower lip and gum or under your tongue.\nA tooth-saving storage device (Save-a-Tooth, EMT Tooth Saver) may be available at your dentist's office. This type of kit contains a travel case and fluid solution. Consider buying one for your\nhome first aid kit\n.\nAlso follow these steps:\nApply a cold compress on the outside of your mouth and gums to ease pain.\nApply direct pressure using gauze to control bleeding.\nAfter your tooth has been replanted, you will most likely need a root canal to remove the cut nerve that is inside your tooth.\nYou may not need an emergency visit for a simple chip or a broken tooth that is not causing you discomfort."}

You should still have the tooth fixed to avoid sharp edges that can cut your lips or tongue.\nDO NOT\nIf a tooth breaks or is knocked out:\nDo not handle the roots of the tooth. Handle only the chewing edge -- the crown (top) portion of the tooth.\nDo not scrape or wipe the root of the tooth to remove dirt.\nDo not brush or clean the tooth with alcohol or peroxide.\nDo not let the tooth dry out.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your dentist right away when a tooth is broken or knocked out. If you can find the tooth, bring it with you to the dentist. Follow the steps in the First Aid section above.\nIf you cannot close your upper and lower teeth together, your jaw may be broken."}
