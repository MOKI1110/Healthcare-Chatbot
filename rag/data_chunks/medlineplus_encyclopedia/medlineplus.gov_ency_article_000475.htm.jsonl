It may lead to\nkidney failure\n.\nCauses\nGlomerulonephritis\nis an inflammation of the glomeruli. The glomeruli of the kidney help filter wastes and fluids from the blood to form urine.\nMembranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) is a form of glomerulonephritis caused by an abnormal\nimmune response\n. Deposits of\nantibodies\nbuild up in a part of the kidneys called the glomerular basement membrane. This membrane helps filter wastes and extra fluids from the blood.\nDamage to this membrane affects the kidney's ability to create urine normally. It may allow blood and protein to leak into the urine. If enough protein leaks into the urine, fluid may leak out of the blood vessels into body tissues, leading to swelling (\nedema\n)."}

It may allow blood and protein to leak into the urine. If enough protein leaks into the urine, fluid may leak out of the blood vessels into body tissues, leading to swelling (\nedema\n). Nitrogen waste products may also build up in the blood (\nazotemia\n).\nThe 2 forms of this disease are MPGN I and MPGN II.\nMost people with the disease have type I. MPGN II is much less common. It also tends to get worse faster than MPGN I.\nCauses of MPGN may include:\nAutoimmune diseases (\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\n,\nscleroderma\n,\nSjÃ¶gren syndrome\n,\nsarcoidosis\n)\nCancer (leukemia, lymphoma)\nInfections (\nhepatitis B\n,\nhepatitis C\n,\nendocarditis\n,\nmalaria\n)\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nBlood in the urine\nChanges in mental status\nsuch as\ndecreased alertness\nor decreased concentration\nCloudy urine\nDark urine\n(smoke, cola, or tea colored)\nDecrease in urine volume\nSwelling\nof any part of the body\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms."}

The provider may find that you have signs of too much fluid in the body, such as:\nSwelling, often in the legs\nAbnormal sounds when listening to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope\nYou may have high blood pressure\nThe following tests help confirm the diagnosis:\nBUN\nand\ncreatinine\nblood test\nBlood complement levels\nUrinalysis\nUrine protein\nKidney biopsy\n(to confirm membranoproliferative GN I or II)\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the symptoms. The goals of treatment are to reduce symptoms, prevent complications, and slow the progression of the disorder.\nYou may need a change in diet. This may include limiting sodium, fluids, or protein to help control high blood pressure, swelling, and the buildup of waste products in the blood.\nMedicines that may be prescribed include:\nBlood pressure medicines\nDipyridamole, with or without aspirin\nDiuretics\nMedicines to suppress the immune system, such as cyclophosphamide\nSteroids\nTreatment is more effective in children than in adults."}

Dialysis or\nkidney transplant\nmay eventually be needed to manage kidney failure.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe disorder often slowly gets worse and eventually results in\nchronic kidney failure\n.\nHalf of people with this condition develop long-term (chronic) kidney failure within 10 years. This is more likely in those who have higher levels of protein in their urine.\nPossible Complications\nComplications that may result from this disease include:\nAcute nephritic syndrome\nAcute renal failure\nChronic kidney disease\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nYou have symptoms of this condition\nYour symptoms get worse or do not go away\nYou develop new symptoms, including decreased urine output\nPrevention\nPreventing infections such as hepatitis or managing diseases such as lupus may help prevent MPGN.\nAlternative Names\nMembranoproliferative GN I; Membranoproliferative GN II; Mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis; Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis; Lobular GN; Glomerulone"}
