It involves rapid, uncontrolled eye movements, head bobbing, and sometimes, holding the neck in an abnormal position.\nCauses\nMost cases of spasmus nutans begin between age 6 months and 1 year. It usually lasts about 2 years but can go on as long as 5 years.\nThe cause is unknown, although it may be associated with other medical conditions. A link with iron or vitamin D deficiency has been suggested. In very rare cases, symptoms similar to spasmus nutans may be due to certain types of brain tumors or other serious conditions.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of spasmus nutans include:\nSmall, quick, side-to-side eye movements called\nnystagmus\n(both eyes are involved, but each eye may move differently)\nHead nodding\nHead tilting\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam of your child."}

You may be asked about your child's symptoms.\nTests may include:\nCT scan of the head\nMRI scan of the head\nElectroretinography\n, a test that measures the electrical response of the retina (the back part of the eye)\nTreatment\nSpasmus nutans that isn't related to another medical problem, such as brain tumor, requires no treatment. If the symptoms are caused by another condition, your provider will recommend appropriate treatment.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nUsually, this disorder goes away on its own within 1 to 2 years without treatment. Some children have residual eye symptoms that need follow-up care.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your child's provider if your child has rapid, movements of the eyes, or head nodding. Your provider will need to perform an exam to check for other possible causes for the symptoms.\nReferences\nHertle RW, Hanna NN.
