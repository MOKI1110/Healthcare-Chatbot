Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBezoar\nBezoar\nA bezoar is a ball of swallowed foreign material most often composed of hair or fiber. It collects in the stomach and fails to pass through the intestines.\nCauses\nChewing on or eating hair or fuzzy materials (or indigestible materials such as plastic bags) can lead to the formation of a bezoar. The rate is very low. The risk is greater among people with intellectual disability or emotionally disturbed children. Generally, bezoars are mostly seen in females aged 10 to 19 years.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nIndigestion\nStomach upset or distress\nNausea\nand vomiting\nDiarrhea\nPain\nGastric ulcers\nExams and Tests\nThe child may have a\nlump in the abdomen\nthat can be felt by the health care provider. A\nbarium swallow x-ray\nwill show the mass in the stomach. Sometimes, a scope is used (endoscopy) to directly view the bezoar in the stomach.\nTreatment\nThe bezoar may need to be surgically removed, especially if it is large. In some cases, small bezoars may be removed through a scope placed through the mouth into the stomach."}

Keep indigestible materials away from a child who has a tendency to put items in the mouth.\nBe sure to remove the child's access to fuzzy or fiber-filled materials.\nAlternative Names\nTrichobezoar; Hairball\nReferences\nKliegman RM, St. Geme JW, Blum NJ, Shah SS, Tasker RC, Wilson KM.
