Small amounts of selenium are good for your health.\nFunction\nSelenium is a trace element. Your body only needs it in small amounts.\nSelenium helps your body make special proteins, called antioxidant enzymes. These play a role in preventing cell damage.\nSome research suggests that selenium may help with the following:\nPrevent certain cancers\nProtect the body from the poisonous effects of heavy metals and other harmful substances\nMore studies on the benefits of selenium are needed. Taking a selenium supplement in addition to food sources of selenium is not currently recommended for these conditions.\nFood Sources\nPlant foods, such as vegetables, are the most common food sources of selenium. How much selenium is in the vegetables you eat depends on how much of the mineral was in the soil where the plants grew.\nBrazil nuts are a very good source of selenium."}

How much selenium is in the vegetables you eat depends on how much of the mineral was in the soil where the plants grew.\nBrazil nuts are a very good source of selenium. Fish, shellfish, red meat, grains, eggs, chicken, liver, and garlic are also good sources. Meats produced from animals that ate grains or plants found in selenium-rich soil have higher levels of selenium.\nBrewer's yeast, wheat germ, and enriched breads are also good sources of selenium.\nSide Effects\nLack of selenium is rare in people in the United States. However, deficiency may occur when a person is fed through a vein (IV line) for long periods of time.\nKeshan disease is caused by a lack of selenium. This leads to an abnormality of the heart muscle. Keshan disease caused many childhood deaths in China until the link to selenium was discovered and supplements were given.\nTwo other diseases have been linked to selenium deficiency:\nKashin-Beck disease, which results in joint and bone disease\nMyxedematous endemic cretinism, which results in\nintellectual disability\nSevere gastrointestinal disorders may affect the body's ability to absorb selenium."}

Such disorders include Crohn disease.\nToo much selenium in the blood can cause a condition called selenosis. Selenosis can cause hair loss, nail problems, nausea, irritability, fatigue, and mild nerve damage. However, selenium toxicity is rare in the United States.\nRecommendations\nDosages for selenium, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people.\nHow much of each vitamin you need depends on your age and sex.
