It usually grows and spreads more slowly than\nsmall cell lung cancer\n.\nThere are three common types of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC):\nAdenocarcinomas are often found in an outer area of the lung.\nSquamous cell carcinomas are usually found in the center of the lung next to an air tube (bronchus).\nLarge cell carcinomas can occur in any part of the lung.\nThere are other uncommon types of lung cancer that are also called non-small.\nCauses\nLung cancer is the deadliest type of cancer for both men and women. Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of breast, colon, and prostate cancers combined.\nLung cancer is more common in older adults. It is rare in people under age 45.\nSmoking\ncauses most cases (around 80%) of non-small cell lung cancer. The risk depends on the number of cigarettes you smoke each day and for how long you have smoked."}

The risk depends on the number of cigarettes you smoke each day and for how long you have smoked. Being around the smoke from other people (secondhand smoke) also raises your risk of lung cancer. The risk decreases with time after you stop smoking. There is no evidence that smoking low-tar cigarettes lowers the risk. Some people who have never smoked do develop lung cancer.\nResearch shows that\nsmoking marijuana\nmay help cancer cells grow. But there is no direct link between smoking marijuana and developing lung cancer.\nConstant exposure to high levels of air pollution and drinking water that has a high level of arsenic can increase your risk of lung cancer. A history of radiation therapy to the lungs can also increase risk.\nWorking with or living near cancer-causing chemicals or materials can also increase the risk of developing lung cancer."}

You will also be asked about other things that may have put you at risk of lung cancer, such as exposure to certain chemicals.\nWhen listening to your chest with a stethoscope, your provider may hear fluid around your lungs. This may suggest cancer.\nTests that may be done to diagnose lung cancer or to see if it has spread include:\nBone scan\nChest x-ray\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nComprehensive metabolic panel\nCT scan of the chest\nand abdomen\nMRI of the chest\nPositron emission tomography\n(PET) scan\nSputum test\nto look for cancer cells\nThoracentesis\n(sampling of fluid buildup around the lung)\nIn most cases, a piece of tissue is removed from your lungs for examination under a microscope.

More imaging tests are done to find out the\nstage of the cancer\n. Stage means how big the tumor is and how far it has spread. NSCLC is divided into 5 stages:\nStage 0 -- The cancer has not spread beyond the inner lining of the lung.\nStage I -- The cancer is small and has not spread to the lymph nodes.\nStage II -- The cancer has spread to some lymph nodes near the original tumor.\nStage III -- The cancer has spread to nearby tissue or to far away lymph nodes.\nStage IV -- The cancer has spread to other organs of the body, such as the other lung, brain, or liver.\nTreatment\nThere are many different types of treatment for NSCLC."}

The surgeon may remove:\nOne of the lobes of the lung (lobectomy)\nOnly a small part of the lung (wedge or segment removal)\nThe entire lung (pneumonectomy)\nSome people need\nchemotherapy\n. Chemotherapy uses medicines to kill cancer cells and stop new cells from growing. Treatment may be done in the following ways:\nChemotherapy is often used when the cancer has spread outside the lung (stage IV).\nIt may also be given before surgery.

Targeted therapy uses medicines to zero in on specific target molecules in or on cancer cells. These targets play a role in how cancer cells grow and survive. Using these targets, the medicine disables the cancer cells so they cannot spread.\nRadiation therapy\ncan be used with chemotherapy if surgery is not possible.
