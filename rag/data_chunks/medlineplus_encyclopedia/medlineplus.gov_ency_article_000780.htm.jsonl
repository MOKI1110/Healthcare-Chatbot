Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMononeuropathy\nMononeuropathy\nMononeuropathy is damage to a single nerve, which results in\nloss of movement\n, sensation, or other function of that nerve.\nCauses\nMononeuropathy is due to damage to a nerve outside the brain and spinal cord (\nperipheral neuropathy\n).\nMononeuropathy is most often caused by injury. Diseases affecting the entire body (\nsystemic\ndisorders) can also cause isolated nerve damage.\nLong-term pressure on a nerve due to swelling or injury can result in mononeuropathy. The covering of the nerve (\nmyelin\nsheath) or part of the nerve cell (the axon) may be damaged. This damage slows or prevents signals from traveling through the damaged nerves.\nMononeuropathy may involve any part of the body."}
