Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHypospadias\nHypospadias\nHypospadias is a birth (congenital) defect in which the opening of the urethra is on the underside of the penis. The urethra is the tube that carries urine and semen through the penis and outside the body. In males, the opening of the urethra is normally at the end of the penis.\nCauses\nHypospadias occurs in about 1 in 200 newborn boys in the United States. The cause is often unknown.\nCertain factors may be associated with the condition, such as:\nFamily history\nGenetic factors that affect how the urethra develops\nMaternal age over 35\nMaternal\noverweight\nor\nobesity\nPremature birth\nLow birth weight\nOther factors may also play a role:\nExposure to certain hormones\nExposure to substances in the environment\nSymptoms\nSymptoms depend on how severe the problem is.\nMost often, boys with this condition have the opening of the urethra near the tip of the penis on the underside.\nMore severe forms of hypospadias occur when the opening is in the middle or base of the penis."}

Rarely, the opening is located in or behind the scrotum.\nThis condition may cause the penis to curve down during an erection. Erections are common in infant boys.\nOther symptoms include:\nProblems peeing without it spraying to the side or down (this can make it difficult to urinate while standing)\nForeskin that makes the penis looks like it has a \"hood\"\nSome boys with hypospadias have one or both testicles that have not moved down into the scrotum (undescended testicle).\nExams and Tests\nThis problem is usually diagnosed soon after birth during a physical exam."}

Imaging tests may be done to look for other congenital defects.\nInfants with hypospadias who have one or both testicles that have not moved down into the scrotum may need genetic testing (\nkaryotyping\n) to check for genetic conditions.\nTreatment\nThe goals of treatment are:\nTo ensure that urine and semen can pass normally through the urethra\nTo have the opening of the urethra at or near the tip of the penis\nTo correct any curvature so the penis is straight during an erection\nInfants with hypospadias should not be\ncircumcised\n. The foreskin should be kept intact for use in later surgical repair.\nIn most cases, surgery is done before the child starts school. Most urologists recommend repair when the child is between 6 and 12 months and before 18 months old. During the surgery, the penis is straightened and the opening is corrected using tissue grafts from the foreskin."}

During the surgery, the penis is straightened and the opening is corrected using tissue grafts from the foreskin. For more complex cases, the repair may require several surgeries.\nIn some cases, if the hypospadias is very mild and there is no curve in the penis, surgery may be optional. However, even very mild cases may need to be repaired to prevent possible future problems. It's important to discuss the benefits and risks of treatment with your health care provider when deciding what is best for your child.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nResults after surgery are most often good. In some cases, more surgery is needed to correct:\nFistulas\n(abnormal connection between the urethra and skin)\nNarrowing of the urethra\nA return of the abnormal penis curve\nMost males can have normal adult sexual activity.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your son has:\nA curved penis during an erection\nOpening to the urethra that is not on the tip of the penis\nIncomplete (hooded) foreskin\nPatient Instructions\nHypospadias repair - discharge\nReferences\nChan Y-M, Hannema SE, Achermann JC, Hughes IA."}
