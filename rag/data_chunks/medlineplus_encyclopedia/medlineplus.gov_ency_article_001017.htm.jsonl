The cornea is the crystal clear (transparent) tissue that covers the front of the eye. It works with the lens of the eye to focus images on the retina.\nCauses\nInjuries to the cornea are common.\nInjuries to the outer surface may be due to:\nAbrasions -- Includes scratches or scrapes on the surface of the cornea\nChemical injuries -- Caused by almost any fluid that gets into the eye\nContact lens problems -- Overuse, poor fit, or sensitivity to contact lens care solutions\nForeign bodies -- Exposure to something in the eye such as sand or dust\nUltraviolet injuries-- Caused by sunlight, sun lamps, snow or water reflections, or arc-welding\nInfections\nmay also damage the cornea.\nYou are more likely to develop a corneal injury if you:\nAre exposed to sunlight or artificial ultraviolet light for long periods of time\nHave ill-fitting contact lenses or overuse your contact lenses\nHave very\ndry eyes\nWork in a dusty environment\nUse a hammer or power tools without wearing safety"}

Rarely, they may penetrate deeper into the eye.\nWatch this video about:\nCorneal injury\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nBlurred vision\nEye pain\nor stinging and burning in the eye\nFeeling like something is in your eye (may be caused by a scratch or something in your eye)\nLight sensitivity\nRedness of the eye\nSwollen eyelids\nWatery eyes or increased tearing\nExams and Tests\nYou will need to have a complete eye exam. The health care provider may use eye drops containing fluorescein dye to help look for injuries.\nTests may include:\nStandard eye exam\nSlit lamp examination\nTreatment\nFirst aid for\neye emergencies\n:\nDo not try to remove an object that is stuck in your eye without professional medical help.\nIf chemicals are splashed in the eye, immediately flush the eye with water for 15 minutes."}

The person should be quickly taken to the nearest emergency room.\nAnyone with severe eye pain needs to be seen in an emergency care center or examined by an ophthalmologist right away.\nTreatment for corneal injuries may involve:\nRemoving foreign material from the eye\nWearing an eye patch or temporary bandage contact lens\nUsing eye drops or ointments prescribed by the provider\nNot wearing contact lenses until the eye has healed\nTaking pain medicines\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost of the time, injuries that affect only the surface of the cornea heal very quickly with treatment. The eye should be back to normal within 2 to 3 days. For more serious injuries or when there may be delayed healing, placement of an amniotic membrane (from purified placental tissue) can be very helpful.\nInjuries that penetrate the cornea are much more serious."}

The outcome depends on the specific injury.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if the injury is not better after 2 to 3 days of treatment.\nPrevention\nThings you can do to prevent corneal injuries include:\nWear safety goggles at all times when using hand or power tools or chemicals, during high impact sports, or during other activities where you may get an eye injury.\nWear sunglasses that screen ultraviolet light when you are exposed to sunlight or are in the vicinity of arc welding. Wear this type of sunglasses even during the winter.\nBe careful when using household cleaners. Many household products contain strong chemicals. Drain and oven cleaners are very dangerous. They can lead to blindness if not used properly.\nAlternative Names\nAbrasion - corneal; Scratch - corneal; Eye pain - corneal\nImages\nCornea\nReferences\nFowler GC.
