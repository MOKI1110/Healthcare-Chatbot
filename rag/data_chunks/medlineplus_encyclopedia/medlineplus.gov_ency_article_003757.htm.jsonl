Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nStool Gram stain\nStool Gram stain\nA stool Gram stain is a laboratory test that uses different chemical stains to detect and identify bacteria in a stool sample.\nThe Gram stain method is sometimes used to quickly diagnose bacterial infections.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will need to collect a stool sample.\nThere are many ways to collect the sample.\nYou can catch the stool on plastic wrap that is loosely placed over the toilet bowl and held in place by the toilet seat. Then you put the sample in a clean container.\nA test kit is available that supplies a special toilet tissue that you use to collect the sample. After collecting the sample, you put it in a container.\nDo not take stool samples from the water in the toilet bowl. Doing this can cause an inaccurate test result.\nDo not mix urine, water, or toilet tissue with the sample.\nFor children wearing diapers:\nLine the diaper with plastic wrap.\nPosition the plastic wrap so that it will prevent urine and stool from mixing."}

This will provide a better sample.\nYour health care provider will give you instructions on when and how to return the sample.\nThe sample is sent to a laboratory. A small amount is spread in a very thin layer on a glass slide. This is called a smear. A series of special stains are added to the sample. The lab team member looks at the stained smear under the microscope to check for bacteria. The color, size, and shape of the cells help identify the specific bacteria.\nHow the Test will Feel\nA lab smear is painless and does not directly involve the person who is being tested.\nThere is no discomfort when a stool sample is collected at home because it only involves normal bowel functions.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order this test to help diagnose an intestinal infection or illness, sometimes involving\ndiarrhea\n.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means only normal or \"friendly\" bacteria were seen on the stained slide."}

Everyone has \"friendly\" bacteria in their intestines.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result means that an\nintestinal infection\nmay be present.
