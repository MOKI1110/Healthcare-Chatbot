This means that it does not spread to other parts of the body. It does not invade nearby tissue. Sometimes, a condition is called benign to suggest it is not dangerous or serious.\nIn general, a benign tumor grows slowly and is not harmful. However, this is not always the case.\nA benign tumor may grow big enough or be found near blood vessels, the brain, nerves, or organs. As a result, it can cause problems locally without spreading to another part of the body. Sometimes, these problems can be serious.\nThe opposite of benign is\nmalignant\n.\nImages\nBenign tumor of the skin\nReferences\nHall JE, Hall ME.
