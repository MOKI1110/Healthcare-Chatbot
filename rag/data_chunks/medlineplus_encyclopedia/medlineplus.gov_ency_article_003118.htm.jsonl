Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nVomiting blood\nVomiting blood\nVomiting blood is regurgitating (throwing up) contents of the stomach that contains blood.\nVomited blood may appear bright red, dark red, or look like coffee grounds. The vomited material may be mixed with food or it may be blood only.\nConsiderations\nIt may be hard to tell the difference between vomiting blood and\ncoughing up blood\n(from the lung) or a\nnosebleed\n.\nConditions that cause vomiting blood can also cause\nblood to appear in the stool\n.\nCauses\nThe upper GI (gastrointestinal) tract includes the mouth, throat, esophagus (swallowing tube), stomach and the duodenum (first part of the small intestine). Blood that is vomited may come from any of these places.\nVomiting that is very forceful or continues for a very long time may cause a tear in the small blood vessels of the throat. This may produce streaks of blood in the vomit.\nSwollen veins in the walls of the lower part of the esophagus, and sometimes the stomach, may begin to bleed."}
