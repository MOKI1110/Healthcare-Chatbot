The normal position of the pancreas is next to, but not surrounding the duodenum.\nCauses\nAnnular pancreas is problem present at birth (congenital defect). Symptoms occur when the ring of pancreas squeezes and narrows the small intestine so that food cannot pass easily or at all.\nNewborns may have symptoms of complete blockage of the intestine. However, up to one half of people with this condition do not have symptoms until adulthood. There are also cases that are not detected because the symptoms are mild.\nConditions that may be associated with annular pancreas include:\nDown syndrome\nExcess amniotic fluid during pregnancy\n(polyhydramnios)\nOther congenital gastrointestinal problems\nPancreatitis\nSymptoms\nNewborns may not feed well."}

Adults with an annular pancreas are at increased risk for pancreatic or biliary tract cancer.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nObstructive jaundice\nPancreatic cancer\nPancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)\nPeptic ulcer\nPerforation (tearing a hole) of the intestine due to obstruction\nPeritonitis\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you or your child has any symptoms of annular pancreas.\nImages\nDigestive system\nEndocrine glands\nAnnular pancreas\nReferences\nMaqbool A, Bales C, Liacouras CA."}
