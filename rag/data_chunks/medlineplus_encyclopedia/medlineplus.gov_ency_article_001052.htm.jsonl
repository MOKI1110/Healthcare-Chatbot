It may be due to a virus or bacteria.\nCauses\nGingivostomatitis is common among children. It may occur after infection with the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), which also causes\ncold sores\n.\nThe condition may also occur after infection with a\ncoxsackie virus\n.\nIt may occur in people with poor oral hygiene.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms can be mild or severe and may include:\nBad breath\nFever\nGeneral discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (malaise)\nSores on the inside of the cheeks or gums\nVery sore mouth with no desire to eat\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will check your mouth for small ulcers. These sores are similar to mouth ulcers caused by other conditions. Cough, fever, or muscle aches may indicate other conditions.\nMost of the time, no special tests are needed to diagnose gingivostomatitis. However, the provider may take a swab from the sore to check for a viral or bacterial infection. This is called a culture."}

A\nbiopsy\nmay be done to rule out other types of mouth ulcers.\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce symptoms.\nThings you can do at home include:\nPractice good\noral hygiene\n. Brush your gums well to reduce the risk of getting another infection.\nUse mouth rinses that reduce pain if your provider recommends them.\nRinse your mouth with salt water (1/2 tsp [3 g] salt in 1 cup [240 mL] of water) or mouthwashes with hydrogen peroxide or Xylocaine to ease discomfort.\nEat a healthy diet. Soft, bland (non-spicy) foods may reduce discomfort during eating.\nYou may need to take antibiotics.\nYou may need to have the infected tissue removed by the dentist (called debridement).\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nGingivostomatitis infections range from mild to severe and painful. The sores often get better in 2 or 3 weeks with or without treatment."}
