Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMyoglobin blood test\nMyoglobin blood test\nThe myoglobin blood test measures the level of the protein myoglobin in the blood.\nMyoglobin can also be measured with a\nurine test\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nMyoglobin is a protein in heart and skeletal muscles. When you exercise, your muscles use up available oxygen. Myoglobin has oxygen attached to it, which provides extra oxygen for the muscles to keep at a high level of activity for a longer period.\nWhen muscle is damaged, myoglobin in muscle cells is released into the bloodstream. The kidneys help remove myoglobin from the blood into the urine."}

The kidneys help remove myoglobin from the blood into the urine. When the level of myoglobin is too high, it can damage the kidneys.\nThis test is ordered when your health care provider suspects you have muscle damage, most often of the skeletal muscles. It may also be ordered if you have\nacute kidney failure\nwithout any clear cause.\nNormal Results\nThe normal range is 0 to 72 ng/mL (0 to 4.19 nmol/L) for males and 0 to 58 ng/mL (0 to 3.37 nmol/L) for females.\nNote: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn increased level of myoglobin may be due to:\nHeart attack\nMalignant hyperthermia\n(very rare)\nDisorder that causes muscle weakness and loss of muscle tissue (\nmuscular dystrophy\n)\nBreakdown of muscle tissue that leads to the release of muscle fiber contents into the blood (\nrhabdomyolysis\n)\nSkeletal muscle\nmyositis\n(inflammation)\nSkeletal muscle ischemia (oxygen deficiency)\nSkeletal muscle trauma\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.
