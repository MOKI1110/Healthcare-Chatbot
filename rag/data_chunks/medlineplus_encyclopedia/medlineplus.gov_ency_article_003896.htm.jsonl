This space is called the abdominal cavity or peritoneal cavity.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis test may be done in a health care provider's office, treatment room, or hospital.\nThe puncture site will be cleaned and hair clipped, if necessary. You then receive a local numbing medicine. The tap needle is inserted 1 to 2 inches (2.5 to 5 cm) into the abdomen. Sometimes, a small cut is made to help insert the needle. The fluid is pulled out into a syringe.\nThe needle is removed. A dressing is placed on the puncture site. If a cut was made, one or two stitches may be used to close it.\nSometimes, ultrasound is used to guide the needle. An ultrasound uses sound waves to make the image and not x-rays."}

It does not hurt.\nThere are 2 kinds of abdominal taps:\nDiagnostic tap -- A small amount of fluid (25 to 50 milliliters) is taken and sent to the lab for testing.\nLarge volume tap -- Up to several liters may be removed to relieve abdominal pain and shortness of breath caused by a large volume of ascites.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nLet your provider know if you:\nHave any allergies to medicines or numbing medicine\nAre taking any medicines (including herbal remedies)\nHave any bleeding problems\nMight be pregnant\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel a slight sting from the numbing medicine, or pressure as the needle is inserted.\nIf a large amount of fluid is taken out, you may feel dizzy or lightheaded. Tell your provider if you feel dizzy or lightheaded.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nNormally, the abdominal cavity contains only a small amount of fluid if any."}

Tell your provider if you feel dizzy or lightheaded.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nNormally, the abdominal cavity contains only a small amount of fluid if any. In certain conditions, large amounts of fluid can build up in this space.\nAn abdominal tap can help diagnose the cause of fluid buildup or the presence of an infection. It may also be done to remove a large amount of fluid to reduce belly pain or shortness of breath.\nNormal Results\nNormally, there should be little or no fluid in the abdominal space.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn exam of abdominal fluid may show:\nCancer that has spread to the abdominal cavity (\nmost often cancer of the ovaries\n)\nCirrhosis of the liver\nDamaged bowel\nHeart failure\nInfection\nKidney disease\nPancreatic disease (inflammation or cancer)\nRisks\nThere is a slight chance that the needle could puncture the bowel, bladder, or a blood vessel in the abdomen. If a large quantity of fluid is removed, there is a slight risk of lowered blood pressure and kidney problems. You may receive certain IV medicines after the test if you are at high risk for this problem."}
