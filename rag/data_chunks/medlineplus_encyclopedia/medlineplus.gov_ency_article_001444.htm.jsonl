If all or part of the infection is due to a fungus, it tends to occur more slowly.\nNail changes\nmay occur. For example, the nail may look detached, abnormally shaped, or have an unusual color.\nIf the infection spreads to the rest of the body, symptoms may include:\nFever, chills\nDevelopment of red streaks along the skin\nGeneral ill feeling\nJoint pain\nMuscle pain\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can usually diagnose this condition by simply looking at the sore skin.\nPus or fluid may be drained and sent to a laboratory to determine what type of bacteria or fungus is causing the infection.\nTreatment\nIf you have paronychia, soaking your nail in warm water 2 or 3 times a day helps reduce swelling and pain.\nYour provider may prescribe oral antibiotics. In severe cases, your provider may cut and drain the sore with a sharp instrument. Part of the nail may need to be removed.\nIf you have chronic fungal paronychia, your provider may prescribe antifungal medicine.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nParonychia often responds well to treatment."}

Gloves with cotton liners are best.\nBring your own manicure tools to nail salons. Do not allow the manicurist to work on your cuticles.\nTo minimize the risk for damage to your nails:\nKeep fingernails smooth and trim them weekly.\nTrim toenails about once a month.\nUse sharp manicure scissors or clippers for trimming fingernails and toenails, and an emery board for smoothing the edges.\nTrim nails after bathing, when they are softer.\nTrim fingernails with a slightly rounded edge. Trim toenails straight across and do not cut them too short.\nDo not trim cuticles or use cuticle removers. Cuticle removers can damage the skin around the nail. The cuticle is needed to seal the space between the nail and skin. Trimming the cuticle weakens this seal, which can allow germs to enter the skin and lead to infection.\nAlternative Names\nInfection - skin around the nail\nImages\nParonychia - candidial\nNail infection - candidal\nReferences\nAndre J, Sass U, Theunis A.
