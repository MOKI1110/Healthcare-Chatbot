Because it is widespread (and often hidden), lead can easily contaminate food and water without being seen or tasted. In the United States, it is estimated that half a million children ages 1 through 5 years have unhealthy levels of lead in their bloodstream.\nFood Sources\nLead can be found in canned goods if there is lead\nsolder\nin the cans. Lead may also be found in some containers (metal, glass, and ceramic or glazed clay) and\ncooking utensils\n.\nOld paint poses the greatest danger for lead poisoning, especially in young children."}

Lead may also be found in some containers (metal, glass, and ceramic or glazed clay) and\ncooking utensils\n.\nOld paint poses the greatest danger for lead poisoning, especially in young children. Tap water from lead pipes or pipes with lead solder is also a source of hidden lead.\nImmigrant and refugee children are at much greater risk for lead poisoning than children born in the United States because of diet and other exposure risks before arriving in the US.\nSide Effects\nWhen enough is taken in, lead can damage the gastrointestinal system, nervous system, kidneys, and blood system and can even lead to death. Continuous low-level exposure causes lead to accumulate in the body and cause damage. It is particularly dangerous for babies, before and after birth, and for small children, because their bodies and brains are growing rapidly.\nMany federal agencies study and monitor lead exposure. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) monitors lead in food, beverages, food containers, and tableware."}

The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) monitors lead in food, beverages, food containers, and tableware. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) monitors lead levels in drinking water.\nRecommendations\nTo reduce the risk for lead poisoning:\nRun tap water for a minute before drinking or cooking with it.\nIf your water has tested high in lead, consider installing a filtering device or switching to bottled water for drinking and cooking.\nAvoid canned goods from foreign countries until the ban on lead soldered cans goes into effect.\nIf imported wine containers have a lead foil wrapper, wipe the rim and neck of the bottle with a towel moistened with lemon juice, vinegar, or wine before using.\nDO NOT store wine, spirits, or vinegar-based salad dressings in lead crystal decanters for long periods of time, as lead can leach out into the liquid.\nOther important recommendations:\nPaint over old leaded paint if it is in good condition, or remove the old paint and repaint with lead-free paint."}

If the paint needs to be sanded or removed because it is chipping or peeling, get advice on safe removal from the National Lead Information Center (800) 424-LEAD [5323].\nKeep your home as dust-free as possible and have everyone wash their hands before eating.\nDispose of old painted toys if you do not know whether they have lead-free paint.\nAlternative Names\nLead poisoning - nutritional considerations; Toxic metal - nutritional considerations\nReferences\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention website.
