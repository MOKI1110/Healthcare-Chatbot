Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEthylene glycol poisoning\nEthylene glycol poisoning\nEthylene glycol is a colorless, odorless, sweet-tasting chemical. It is poisonous if swallowed.\nEthylene glycol may be swallowed accidentally, or it may be taken deliberately in a suicide attempt or as a substitute for drinking alcohol (ethanol). Most ethylene glycol poisonings occur due to the ingestion of antifreeze.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure."}

Within a few hours, more toxic effects become apparent. Symptoms may include nausea, vomiting, convulsions, stupor (decreased level of alertness), or even coma.\nEthylene glycol toxicity should be suspected in anyone who is severely ill after drinking an unknown substance, especially if they at first appear drunk and you can't smell alcohol on their breath.\nAn overdose of ethylene glycol can damage the brain, lungs, liver, and kidneys. The poisoning causes disturbances in the body's chemistry, including\nmetabolic acidosis\n(increased acids in the bloodstream and tissues). The disturbances may be severe enough to cause profound\nshock\n, organ failure, and death.\nAs little as 120 milliliters (approximately 4 fluid ounces) of ethylene glycol may be enough to kill an average-sized man.\nHome Care\nSeek medical help right away."}

This is uncommon.\nIn severe cases, dialysis (kidney machine) may be used to directly remove the ethylene glycol and other poisonous substances from the blood. Dialysis reduces the time needed for the body to remove the toxins. Dialysis is also needed by people who develop severe kidney failure as a result of poisoning.
