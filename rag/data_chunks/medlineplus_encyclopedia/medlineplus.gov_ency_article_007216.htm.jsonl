Benign tumor means it is not a cancer.\nCauses\nThe cause of fibroadenomas is not known. They may be related to hormones. Girls who are going through puberty and women who are pregnant are most often affected. Fibroadenomas are found much less often in older women who have gone through menopause.\nFibroadenoma is the most common benign tumor of the breast. It is the most common breast tumor in women under age 30.\nA fibroadenoma is made up of breast gland tissue and tissue that helps support the breast gland tissue.\nSymptoms\nFibroadenomas are usually single lumps. Some women have several lumps that may affect both breasts.\nThe lumps may be any of the following:\nEasily moveable under the skin\nFirm\nPainless\nRubbery\nThe lumps have smooth, well-defined borders. They may grow in size, especially during pregnancy."}

They may grow in size, especially during pregnancy. Fibroadenomas often get smaller after menopause (if a woman is not taking hormone therapy).\nExams and Tests\nAfter a physical exam, one or both of the following tests are usually done:\nBreast ultrasound\nMammogram\nA biopsy may be done to get a definite diagnosis. Different types of biopsies include:\nExcisional (removal of the lump by a surgeon)\nStereotactic\n(needle biopsy using a machine like a mammogram)\nUltrasound-guided\n(needle biopsy using ultrasound)\nWomen in their teens or early 20s may not need a biopsy if the lump goes away on its own or if the lump does not change over a long period.\nTreatment\nIf a needle biopsy shows that the lump is a fibroadenoma, the lump may be left in place or removed.\nYou and your health care provider can discuss whether or not to\nremove the lump\n."}

Reasons to have it removed include:\nResults of needle biopsy are not definitive\nPain or other symptom\nConcern about cancer\nThe lump gets larger over time\nIf the lump is not removed, your provider will watch to see if it changes or grows. This may be done using:\nMammogram\nPhysical examination\nUltrasound\nSometimes, the lump is destroyed without removing it:\nCryoablation destroys the lump by freezing it. A probe is inserted through the skin, and ultrasound helps the provider guide it to the lump. Gas is used to freeze and destroy the lump.\nRadiofrequency ablation destroys the lump using high-frequency energy. The provider uses ultrasound to help focus the energy beam on the lump."}
