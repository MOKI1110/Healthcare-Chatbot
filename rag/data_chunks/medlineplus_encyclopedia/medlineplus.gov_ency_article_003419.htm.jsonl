Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCardiac catheterization\nCardiac catheterization\nCardiac catheterization involves passing a thin flexible tube (catheter) into the right or left side of the heart. The catheter is most often inserted from the groin or the arm.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will get medicine before the test to help you relax.\nA member of the team doing this procedure will clean a site on your arm, neck, or groin and insert a small catheter into one of your veins. This is called an intravenous (IV) line.\nA larger thin plastic tube called a sheath is placed into a vein or artery in your leg or arm. Then longer plastic tubes called catheters are carefully moved up into the heart using live\nx-rays\n(fluoroscopy) as a guide."}

Then the doctor (usually a cardiologist or heart specialist) doing the cardiac catheterization can:\nCollect blood samples from the heart\nMeasure pressure and blood flow in the heart's chambers and in the large arteries around the heart\nMeasure the oxygen levels in different parts of your heart\nExamine the arteries of the heart\nPerform a\nbiopsy on the heart muscle\nFor some procedures, you may be injected with a dye that helps your doctor to visualize the structures and vessels within the heart.\nIf you have a blockage of one of the heart arteries, you may have angioplasty and a stent placed during the procedure.\nThe test may last 30 to 60 minutes. If you also need special procedures, the test may take longer."}

The test takes place in a hospital or specialized procedure unit  and you will be asked to wear a hospital gown. Sometimes, you will need to spend the night before the test in the hospital. Otherwise, you will come to the hospital the morning of the procedure.\nYour health care provider will explain the procedure and its risks."}
