Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNatural short sleeper\nNatural short sleeper\nA natural short sleeper is someone who sleeps a lot less in a 24-hour period than is expected for people of the same age, without being abnormally sleepy.\nCauses\nAlthough each person's need for sleep varies, the typical adult needs an average of 7 to 9 hours of sleep each night. Short sleepers sleep less than 75% of what is normal for their age.\nNatural short sleepers do not restrict the number of hours they sleep on purpose. Scientists believe that genetic variation allows natural short sleepers to function well with less sleep than normal.\nNatural short sleepers are different from people who chronically do not get enough sleep because of work or family demands, or those who have medical or mental health conditions that disrupt sleep.\nSymptoms\nNatural short sleepers are not overly tired or sleepy during the day.\nTreatment\nNo specific treatment is needed.\nAlternative Names\nSleep - natural short sleeper\nImages\nNatural short sleeper\nSleep patterns in the young and aged\nReferences\nAvidan AY."}
