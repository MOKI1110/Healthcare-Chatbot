The process is called irradiation. It is used to remove germs from food. It does not make the food itself radioactive.\nThe benefits of irradiating food include the ability to control insects and bacteria, such as salmonella. The process can give foods (especially fruits and vegetables) a longer shelf life, and it reduces the risk for\nfood poisoning\n.\nFood irradiation is used in many countries."}
