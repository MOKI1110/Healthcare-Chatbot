Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSex-linked recessive\nSex-linked recessive\nSex-linked diseases are passed down through families through one of the X or Y chromosomes. X and Y are sex chromosomes.\nDominant inheritance occurs when a variant gene from one parent causes disease, even though the matching gene from the other parent is normal. The variant gene dominates.\nBut in recessive inheritance, both matching genes must be variant to cause disease. If only one gene in the pair is variant, the disease does not occur or it is mild. Someone who has one variant gene (but no symptoms) is called a carrier. Carriers can pass variant genes to their children.\nThe term \"sex-linked recessive\" most often refers to X-linked recessive.\nInformation\nX-linked recessive diseases most often occur in males. Males have only one X chromosome. A single recessive gene on that X chromosome will cause the disease.\nThe Y chromosome is the other half of the XY gene pair in the male. However, the Y chromosome doesn't contain most of the genes of the X chromosome. Because of that, it doesn't protect the male."}

A variant gene on the X chromosome from each parent would be required, since a female has two X chromosomes."}

A variant gene on the X chromosome from each parent would be required, since a female has two X chromosomes. This could occur in the two scenarios below.\nIn each pregnancy, if the mother is a carrier and the father has the disease, the expected outcomes are:\n25% chance of a healthy boy\n25% chance of a boy with the disease\n25% chance of a carrier girl\n25% chance of a girl with the disease\nIf both the mother and the father have the disease, the expected outcomes are:\n100% chance of the child having the disease, whether boy or girl\nThe odds of either of these two scenarios are so low that X-linked recessive diseases are sometimes referred to as male only diseases. However, this is not technically correct.\nFemale carriers can have a normal X chromosome that is abnormally inactivated. This is called skewed X-inactivation. These females may have symptoms similar to those of males, or they may have only mild\nsymptoms\n."}
