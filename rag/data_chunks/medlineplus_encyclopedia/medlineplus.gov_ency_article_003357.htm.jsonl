Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPyruvate kinase blood test\nPyruvate kinase blood test\nThe pyruvate kinase test measures the level of pyruvate kinase enzyme in the blood.\nPyruvate kinase is an\nenzyme\nfound in red blood cells. It helps change sugar in the blood (glucose) to energy when oxygen levels are low.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed. In the laboratory, white blood cells are removed from the blood sample because they can alter test results. The level of pyruvate kinase is then measured.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary.\nIf your child is having this test, it may help to explain how the test will feel and even demonstrate on a doll. Explain the reason for the test. Knowing the how and why may reduce your child's anxiety.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to detect an abnormally low level of pyruvate kinase."}

Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to detect an abnormally low level of pyruvate kinase. Without enough of this enzyme, red blood cells break down faster than normal. This is called\nhemolytic anemia\n.\nThis test helps diagnose\npyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD)\n.\nNormal Results\nResults vary depending on the testing method used. In general, a normal value is 5.5 to 12.4 U/g Hb.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA low level of pyruvate kinase confirms PKD.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
