Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSpinal muscular atrophy\nSpinal muscular atrophy\nSpinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a group of disorders of the motor neurons (motor cells). These disorders are passed down through families (inherited) and can appear at any stage of life. The disorder leads to muscle weakness and atrophy.\nCauses\nSMA is a collection of different motor nerve (or neuron) diseases. The disease is caused by a lack of a protein (SMN) due to defective genes.\nMost of the time, a person must get one copy of the defective gene from both parents to be affected. The most severe form is SMA type I, also called Werdnig-Hoffman disease. Infants with SMA type II have less severe symptoms during early infancy, but they become weaker with time. SMA type III is a less severe form of the disease.\nIn rare cases, SMA begins in adulthood."}

Infants with SMA type II have less severe symptoms during early infancy, but they become weaker with time. SMA type III is a less severe form of the disease.\nIn rare cases, SMA begins in adulthood. This is the mildest form of the disease.\nA family history of SMA in an immediate family member (such as brother or sister) is a risk factor for all types of the disorder.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of SMA may vary depending on the SMA type.\nInfants with SMA type I are born with very little muscle tone, weak muscles, and feeding and breathing problems.\nIn infants with SMA type II, symptoms may not appear until age 6 months to 2 years.\nType III SMA is a milder disease that starts in childhood or adolescence and slowly gets worse.\nType IV is even milder, with weakness starting in adulthood.\nOften,\nweakness\nis first felt in the shoulder and leg muscles."}

However, there are now three drugs approved by the FDA that slow how fast the muscle weakness progresses:\nOnasemnogene abeparvovec-xioi (Zolgensma)\nRisdiplam (Evrysdi)\nNusinersen (Spinraza)\nThese drugs work by increasing the amount of the SMN protein produced. Talk with your provider to see if either of these medicines is right for you or your child.\nSupportive care is important. Breathing complications are common in the more severe forms of SMA. To help with breathing, a device or machine called a ventilator may be needed.\nPeople with SMA also need to be watched for choking. This is because the muscles that control swallowing are weak.\nPhysical therapy is important to prevent contractions of muscles and tendons and abnormal curvature of the spine (\nscoliosis\n). Bracing may be needed."}

Surgery may be needed to correct skeletal deformities, such as scoliosis.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWithout treatment, children with SMA type I rarely live longer than 2 to 3 years because of respiratory problems and infections. Survival time with type II is longer, but the disease kills most of those who are affected while they are still children. New therapies that increase the amount of SMN protein have resulted in infants and children living much longer.\nChildren with type III disease may survive into early adulthood. But, people with all forms of the disease have weakness and disability that gets worse over time."}
