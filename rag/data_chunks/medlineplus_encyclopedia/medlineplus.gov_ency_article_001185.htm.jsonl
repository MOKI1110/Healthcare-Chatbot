In some cases, early testes do not develop in males before 8 weeks into the pregnancy. These babies will be born with female sex organs.\nIn some cases, the testes disappear between 8 and 10 weeks. These babies will be born with\nambiguous genitalia\n. This means the child will have parts of both male and female sex organs.\nIn some cases, the testes may disappear between 12 and 14 weeks. These babies will have a normal penis and scrotum. However, they will not have any testes. This is known as congenital anorchia. It is also called the \"vanishing testes syndrome.\"\nThe cause is unknown."}
