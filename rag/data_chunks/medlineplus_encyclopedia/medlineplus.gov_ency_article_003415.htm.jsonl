Polyps are commonly found in organs with many blood vessels. Such organs include the\nuterus\n,\ncolon\n, stomach, and\nnose\n.\nSome polyps are cancerous (malignant) and the cancer cells are likely to spread. Most polyps are noncancerous (benign). The most common site of polyps that are precancerous and are treated is the colon.\nHow a polyp biopsy is done depends on the location:\nColonoscopy\nor\nflexible sigmoidoscopy\nexamines the large bowel\nColposcopy-directed biopsy\nexamines the vagina and cervix\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy\n(EGD) or other\nendoscopy\nis used for the throat, stomach, and small bowel\nLaryngoscopy is used for the nose and throat\nFor areas of the body that can be seen or where the polyp can be felt, a numbing medicine is applied to the skin. Then a small piece of the tissue that appears to be abnormal is removed."}

Then a small piece of the tissue that appears to be abnormal is removed. This tissue is sent to a lab. There, it is tested to see if it is cancerous.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nIf the biopsy is in the nose or another surface that is open or can be seen, no special preparation is needed. Your health care provider will tell you if you need to not eat or drink anything (fast) before the biopsy.\nMore preparation is needed for biopsies inside the body. For example, if you have a biopsy of the stomach, you should not eat anything for several hours before the procedure.  If you are having a colonoscopy, drinking a solution to clean your bowels is needed before the procedure.\nFollow your provider's preparation instructions exactly.\nHow the Test will Feel\nNumbing medicine is given locally before removing polyps on the surface of the skin. You may feel tugging while the biopsy sample is being taken. After the numbing medicine wears off, the area may be sore for a few days.\nBiopsies of polyps inside the body are done during procedures such as EGD or colonoscopy."}

Usually, you will not feel anything during or after the biopsy.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is done to determine if the growth is cancerous (malignant). The procedure may also be done to relieve symptoms, such as with the removal of nasal polyps.\nNormal Results\nExamination of the biopsy sample shows the polyp to be benign (not cancerous).\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nCancer cells are present. This may be a sign of a cancerous\ntumor\n. Further tests may be needed. Often, the polyp may need more treatment. This is to ensure it is completely removed.\nRisks\nRisks include:\nBleeding\nHole (perforation) in the organ from which the polyp was removed\nInfection\nAlternative Names\nBiopsy - polyps\nReferences\nBachert C, Zhang N, Gevaert P.
