Some aneurysms are present at birth (congenital). Defects in some parts of the artery wall may be a cause.\nCommon locations for aneurysms include:\nMajor artery from the heart such as the thoracic or abdominal\naorta\nBrain (\ncerebral aneurysm\n)\nBehind the knee (popliteal artery aneurysm)\nIntestine (mesenteric artery aneurysm)\nArtery in the spleen (splenic artery aneurysm)\nCertain factors or conditions may increase the risk for aneurysms including:\nHigh blood pressure (thoracic, abdominal and cerebral aneurysms)\nHigh cholesterol\nCigarette smoking\nIllicit drug use (cocaine, amphetamines, methamphetamine)\nPregnancy (often linked to splenic artery aneurysms)\nFamily history (sibling, parent, or child)\nInherited disorders that may increase the risk include:\nFibromuscular dysplasia (abnormal cell growth in artery walls)\nMarfan syndrome"}

If the aneurysm occurs near the body's surface, pain and swelling with a throbbing lump is often seen.\nAneurysms in the body or brain often cause no symptoms. Aneurysms in the brain may expand without breaking open (rupturing). The expanded aneurysm may press on nerves and cause double vision, dizziness, or headaches. Some aneurysms may cause ringing in the ears.\nIf an aneurysm ruptures, pain, low blood pressure, a rapid heart rate, and lightheadedness may occur."}

Some aneurysms may cause ringing in the ears.\nIf an aneurysm ruptures, pain, low blood pressure, a rapid heart rate, and lightheadedness may occur. When a brain aneurysm ruptures, there is a sudden severe headache that some people say is the \"worst headache of my life.\" The risk of neurologic injury,\ncoma\n, or death after a rupture is high.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam.\nTests used to diagnose an aneurysm include:\nCT scan\nCT angiogram\nMRI\nMRA (\nmagnetic resonance angiogram\n)\nUltrasound\nAngiogram\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the size and location of the aneurysm. Your provider may only recommend regular checkups to see if the aneurysm is growing.\nSurgery may be done. The type of surgery that is done and when you need it depend on your symptoms and the size and type of aneurysm.\nSurgery may involve a large (open) surgical cut. Many times, a procedure called\nendovascular embolization\nis done. Coils or stents of metal are inserted into a brain aneurysm to make the aneurysm clot. This reduces the risk for rupture while keeping the artery open."}

Other brain aneurysms may need to have a clip placed on them to close them off and prevent a rupture.\nAneurysms of the aorta may be reinforced with surgery to strengthen the blood vessel wall.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop a lump on your body, whether or not it is painful and throbbing.\nGo to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have:\nPain in your belly or back that is very bad or does not go away\nA sudden  loss of consciousness (\nfainting\n) or severe headache, especially if you also have nausea, vomiting,\nseizures\n, or any other nervous system symptom\nIf you are diagnosed with an aneurysm that has not bled, you will need to have regular testing to detect if it increases in size. In some cases, your provider will suggest early treatment because the aneurysm is large enough.\nPrevention\nControlling high blood pressure may help prevent many aneurysms."}

Follow a healthy diet, get regular exercise, and keep your cholesterol at a healthy level to help prevent aneurysms or their complications.\nDo not smoke.
