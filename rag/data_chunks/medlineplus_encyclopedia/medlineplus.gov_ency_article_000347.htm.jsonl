These are tumors most often of the small intestine, colon, appendix, pancreas, or bronchial tubes in the lungs.\nCauses\nCarcinoid syndrome is the pattern of symptoms sometimes seen in people with carcinoid tumors. These tumors are rare, and often slow growing. Most carcinoid tumors are found in the gastrointestinal tract and lungs.\nCarcinoid syndrome occurs in very few people with carcinoid tumors, typically after the tumor has spread to the liver or lung.\nThese tumors release too much of the hormone serotonin, as well as several other chemicals. These hormones cause the blood vessels to open (dilate)."}

These hormones cause the blood vessels to open (dilate). This causes carcinoid syndrome.\nSymptoms\nThe carcinoid syndrome is made up of four main symptoms including:\nFlushing (face, neck, or upper chest), or widened blood vessels seen on the skin (\ntelangiectasias\n)\nDifficulty breathing, such as wheezing\nDiarrhea\nHeart problems, such as leaking heart valves, blood pressure changes, and heart palpitations\nSymptoms are sometimes brought on by physical exertion, or eating or drinking things such as blue cheese, chocolate, or red wine.\nExams and Tests\nOften these tumors are found due to symptoms such as weight loss, abdominal pain, and diarrhea."}
