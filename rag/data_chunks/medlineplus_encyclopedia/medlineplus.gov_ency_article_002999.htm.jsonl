A\nhydrocele\nis a collection of fluid around a testicle.\nBaby boys sometimes have a hydrocele at birth. Hydroceles also occur in older boys and men. Sometimes they form when there is also a hernia (an abnormal bulging of tissue) present. Hydroceles are fairly common.\nDescription\nSurgery to repair a hydrocele is often done at an outpatient clinic. General anesthesia is used so you will be asleep and pain-free during the procedure.\nIn a baby or child:\nThe surgeon makes a small surgical cut in the fold of the groin, and then drains the fluid. The sac (hydrocele) holding the fluid may be removed. If needed, the surgeon strengthens the muscle wall with stitches. This is called a\nhernia repair\n.\nSometimes the surgeon uses a laparoscope to do this procedure. A laparoscope is a tiny camera that the surgeon inserts into the area through a small surgical cut. The camera is attached to a video monitor."}

The surgeon makes the repair with small instruments that are inserted through other small surgical cuts.\nIn adults:\nThe cut is most often made on the scrotum. The surgeon then drains the fluid after removing part of the hydrocele sac.\nNeedle drainage of the fluid is not done very often because the problem will always come back.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nHydroceles often go away on their own in children, but not in adults."}

These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\nLet your surgeon know about any illness you may have before your surgery. This includes\nCOVID-19\n, a\ncold\n,\nflu\n,\nfever\n, herpes breakout, or other illness. If you do get sick, your surgery may need to be postponed.\nAfter the Procedure\nRecovery is quick in most cases."}

Children should limit activity and get extra rest in the first few days after surgery. In most cases, normal activity can start again in about 4 to 7 days.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe success rate for hydrocele repair is very high. The long-term outlook is excellent. However, another hydrocele may form over time, especially if a hernia was present.\nAlternative Names\nHydrocelectomy\nImages\nHydrocele\nHydrocele repair - series\nReferences\nDi Carlo HN, Crigger CB.
