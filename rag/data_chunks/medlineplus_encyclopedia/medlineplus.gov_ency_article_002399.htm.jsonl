This means that these vitamins are required for the body to work properly. They are:\nVitamin A\nVitamin C\nVitamin D\nVitamin E\nVitamin K\nVitamin B1 (\nthiamine\n)\nVitamin B2 (\nriboflavin\n)\nVitamin B3 (\nniacin\n)\nVitamin B6\n(pyridoxine)\nVitamin B12\n(cyanocobalamin)\nPantothenic acid\n(B5)\nBiotin\n(B7)\nFolate (folic acid or B9)\nVitamins are grouped into two categories:\nFat-soluble vitamins are stored in the body's liver, fatty tissue, and muscles. The four fat-soluble vitamins are vitamins A, D, E, and K. These vitamins are absorbed more easily by the body in the presence of dietary fat.\nWater-soluble vitamins are not stored in the body. The nine water-soluble vitamins are vitamin C and all the B vitamins. Any leftover or excess amounts of these leave the body through the urine. They have to be consumed on a regular basis to prevent shortages or deficiencies in the body."}

Any leftover or excess amounts of these leave the body through the urine. They have to be consumed on a regular basis to prevent shortages or deficiencies in the body. The exception to this is vitamin B12, which can be stored in the liver for many years.\nSome vitamin-like nutrients are also needed by the body such as:\nCholine\nCarnitine\nFunction\nEach of the vitamins listed below has an important job in the body. A vitamin deficiency occurs when you do not get enough of a certain vitamin. Vitamin deficiency can cause health problems.\nNot eating enough fruits, vegetables, beans, lentils, whole grains and fortified dairy foods may increase your risk for health problems, including heart disease, cancer, and poor bone health (\nosteoporosis\n).\nVitamin A\nhelps form and maintain healthy teeth, bones, soft tissue,  mucous membranes, skin, and tissue in the retina (the back of the eye, which creates vision).\nVitamin B6\nis also called pyridoxine. Vitamin B6 helps form red blood cells and maintain brain function. This vitamin also plays an important role in the proteins that are part of many chemical reactions in the body."}

The more\nprotein\nyou eat the more pyridoxine your body requires.\nVitamin B12\n, like the other B vitamins, is important for metabolism. It also helps form red blood cells and maintain the central and peripheral nervous systems.\nVitamin C\n, also called ascorbic acid, is an antioxidant that promotes healthy teeth and gums. It helps the body absorb iron and maintain healthy tissue. It is also essential for wound healing.\nVitamin D\nis also known as the \"sunshine vitamin,\" since it is made by the body after being in the sun. Some experts have suggested that a few minutes of sunlight directly on the skin of your face, arms, back, and legs (without sunscreen) every day can produce the body's requirement of vitamin D. However, the amount of vitamin D produced by sunlight exposure can vary greatly from person to person. It is very hard to get enough vitamin D from food sources alone. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium."}

It also helps maintain proper blood levels of\ncalcium\nand\nphosphorus\n.\nVitamin E\nis an antioxidant also known as tocopherol. It helps the body form red blood cells and use vitamin K.\nVitamin K\nis needed because without it blood would not coagulate normally. Some studies suggest that it is important for bone health.\nBiotin\nis essential for the metabolism of proteins and carbohydrates, and in the production of hormones and cholesterol.\nNiacin\nis a B vitamin that helps maintain healthy skin and nerves. It also has triglyceride-lowering effects at higher doses.\nFolate\nworks with vitamin B12 to help form red blood cells. It is needed for the production of DNA, which controls tissue growth and cell function. Any woman who is pregnant should be sure to get enough folate. Low levels of folate are linked to birth defects such as\nspina bifida\n."}

It also plays a role in the production of hormones and cholesterol.\nRiboflavin\n(vitamin B2) works with the other B vitamins.

DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)\n: The average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people. An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence.\nAdequate Intake (AI)\n: This level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA. It is set at a level that is thought to ensure enough nutrition.\nThe best way to get all the daily vitamins you need is to eat a balanced diet that contains a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, fortified dairy foods, legumes (dried beans), lentils, and whole grains.\nDietary supplements are another way to get the vitamins you need if the food you eat is not supplying enough vitamins. Supplements can be helpful during pregnancy and for special medical problems.\nSupplements come in different forms, including liquid, gummy, powder, and pill form. The type you use depends on your needs and convenience."}

Or you may prefer a pill form to avoid the added sugar found in gummies. Whatever type you choose, always check the label so you know type and dose of the vitamins in the product. Also, check for added sugars or other additives such as gluten or soy if that's a concern.\nIf you take supplements, do not take more than 100% of the RDA unless you are under a provider's supervision. Be very careful about taking large amounts of fat-soluble vitamin supplements. These include vitamins A, D, E, and K. These can build up in your body and may cause harmful effects.\nImages\nFruits and vegetables\nReferences\nHopkins AC. Nutrition and growth.
