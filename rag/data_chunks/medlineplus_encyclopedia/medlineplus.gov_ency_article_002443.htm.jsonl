It may also be found in some medicines. When a person with\nceliac disease\neats or drinks anything containing gluten, the immune system responds by damaging the lining of the small intestine. This affects the body's ability to absorb nutrients.\nCarefully following a gluten-free diet helps prevent symptoms of the disease.\nFood Sources\nTo follow a gluten-free diet means, you need to avoid all foods, drinks, and medicines made with gluten. This means not eating anything made with barley, rye, and wheat."}

Items that are naturally gluten-free may become contaminated if they are made on the same production line, or moved together in the same place, as foods containing gluten.\nEating at restaurants, work, school, and social gatherings can be challenging. Call ahead and plan. Due to the widespread use of wheat and barley in foods, it is important to read labels before buying food or eating.\nDespite its challenges, maintaining a healthy, balanced gluten-free diet is possible with education and planning.\nRecommendations\nTalk to a registered dietitian who specializes in celiac disease and the gluten-free diet to help you plan your diet. This is especially helpful because gluten contamination can happen even if a restaurant or label assures you a product is gluten-free. A dietician can help recommend products that will be safe.\nYou may also want to join a\nlocal support group\n."}
