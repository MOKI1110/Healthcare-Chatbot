As a result, you may become infected or pass the infection to your partner without knowing it.\nYou are more likely to become infected with chlamydia if you:\nHave sex without wearing a male or female condom\nHave more than one sexual partner\nUse drugs or alcohol and then have sex\nSymptoms\nSome common symptoms are:\nDifficulty urinating, which includes\npainful urination\nor burning during urination\nDischarge from the penis\nRedness, swelling, or itching of the opening of the urethra at the tip of the penis\nSwelling and tenderness of one or both testicles\nChlamydia and\ngonorrhea\noften occur together. The symptoms of chlamydia infection may be similar to symptoms of gonorrhea, but they continue even after treatment for gonorrhea is finished.\nExams and Tests\nIf you have symptoms of a chlamydia infection, your health care provider may suggest a lab test called PCR. Your provider will take a sample of discharge from the penis. This discharge is sent to a lab to be tested."}

Your provider will take a sample of discharge from the penis. This discharge is sent to a lab to be tested. Results will take 1 to 2 days to come back. Alternatively, your provider may collect a urine sample for a test called nucleic acid amplification.\nYour provider may also check you for other types of infections, such as gonorrhea,\nsyphilis\n, and HIV.\nMen who do not have symptoms of a chlamydia infection may sometimes be tested.\nTreatment\nChlamydia can be treated with a variety of antibiotics. Common side effects of these antibiotics are:\nNausea\nUpset stomach\nDiarrhea\nYou and your sexual partner must be treated to avoid passing the infections back and forth. Even partners without symptoms need to be treated. You and your partner should finish all of the antibiotics, even if you feel better.\nBecause gonorrhea often occurs with chlamydia, treatment for gonorrhea is often given at the same time.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nTreatment with antibiotics is almost always successful."}

If your symptoms do not improve quickly, make sure you are also being treated for gonorrhea and other infections spread through sexual contact.\nSevere infections or infections that are not treated quickly may rarely cause scarring of the urethra. This problem can make it harder to pass urine and may require surgery.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of a chlamydia infection.\nPrevention\nTo prevent infection, practice\nsafer sex\n. This means taking steps before and during sex that can help prevent you from getting an infection, or from giving one to your partner.\nBefore having sex:\nGet to know your partner and discuss your sexual histories.\nDon't feel forced into having sex.\nDon't have sexual contact with anyone but your partner.\nBe sure that your sexual partner does not have any sexually transmitted infection (STI). Before having sex with a new partner, each of you should get screened for STIs."}

Share the test results with each other.\nIf you have an STI such as HIV or herpes, let any sexual partner know before you have sex. Allow them to decide what to do. If you both agree to have sexual contact, use latex or polyurethane condoms.\nRemember to:\nUse condoms for all vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse.\nMake sure that the condom is in place from the beginning to the end of the sexual activity. Use it every time you have sex.\nKeep in mind that STIs can be spread by contact with surrounding skin areas. A condom reduces your risk but does not fully eliminate it.\nOther tips include:\nUse lubricants. They may help reduce the chance that a condom will break.\nUse only water-based lubricants."}

Oil-based or petroleum-type lubricants can cause latex to weaken and tear.\nPolyurethane condoms are less prone to breaking than latex condoms, but they cost more.\nUsing condoms with nonoxynol-9 (a spermicide) may irritate vaginal or penile tissue and thus increase the chance of HIV transmission.\nStay sober. Alcohol and drugs impair your judgment. When you are not sober, you might not choose your partner as carefully. You may also forget to use condoms, or use them incorrectly.\nAlternative Names\nSTD - chlamydia male; Sexually transmitted disease - chlamydia male; Urethritis - chlamydia\nImages\nMale reproductive anatomy\nReferences\nBabu TM, Urban MA, Augenbraun MH.
