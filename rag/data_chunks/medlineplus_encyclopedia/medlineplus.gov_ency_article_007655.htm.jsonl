It is not the same as\nendometrial cancer\n, a much more common cancer that starts in the lining of the uterus. Uterine sarcoma most often starts in the muscle underneath that lining.\nCauses\nThe exact cause is not known. But there are certain risk factors:\nPrior radiation therapy for another pelvic cancer, usually 5 to 25 years later.\nPast or current treatment with tamoxifen for breast cancer.\nAfrican American women have twice the risk that white or Asian women have.\nThe same variant gene that causes an eye cancer called\nretinoblastoma\n.\nNever having been pregnant.\nSymptoms\nThe most common symptom of uterine sarcoma is bleeding after menopause. Let your health care provider know as soon as you can about:\nAny bleeding that is not part of your menstrual period\nAny bleeding that happens after menopause\nMost likely, the bleeding will not be from cancer."}

But you should always tell your provider about unusual bleeding.\nOther possible symptoms of uterine sarcoma include:\nVaginal discharge that does not get better with antibiotics and may occur without bleeding\nA mass or lump in the vagina or uterus\nSome of the symptoms of uterine sarcoma are similar to those of a\nfibroid\n(a non-cancerous tumor of the muscle of the uterus). The only way to tell the difference between sarcoma and fibroids is with tests, such as a biopsy of tissue taken from the uterus.\nExams and Tests\nYour provider will take your medical history. You will also have a physical exam and a pelvic exam. Other tests may include:\nEndometrial biopsy\nto collect a sample of tissue to look for signs of cancer\nDilation and curettage (D and C)\nto collect cells from the uterus to look for cancer\nImaging tests are needed to create a picture of your reproductive organs.\nUltrasound of the pelvis\nis often done first."}

Yet, it often cannot tell the difference between a fibroid and a sarcoma. An\nMRI scan of the pelvis\nmay also be needed.\nA biopsy using ultrasound or MRI to guide the needle may be used to make the diagnosis.\nIf your provider finds signs of cancer, other tests are needed for\nstaging the cancer\n. These tests will show how much cancer there is. They will also show if it has spread to other parts of your body.\nTreatment\nSurgery is the most common treatment for uterine cancer. Surgery may be used to diagnose, stage, and treat uterine sarcoma all at one time."}

Surgery may be used to diagnose, stage, and treat uterine sarcoma all at one time. After surgery, the cancer will be examined in a lab to see how advanced it is.\nDepending on the results, you may need\nradiation therapy\nor\nchemotherapy\nto kill any cancer cells that remain after surgery.\nYou also may have\nhormone therapy\nfor certain kinds of tumors that respond to hormones.\nFor advanced cancer that has spread outside the pelvis, you may want to join a\nclinical trial\nfor uterine cancer.\nWith cancer that has come back, radiation may be used for\npalliative treatment\n. Palliative care is meant to relieve symptoms and improve a person's quality of life.\nSupport Groups\nCancer affects how you feel about yourself and your life. You can ease the stress of illness by joining a\ncancer support group\n."}

Sharing with others who have the same experiences and problems can help you feel less alone.\nAsk your provider or the staff at the cancer treatment center to help you find a support group for people who have been diagnosed with uterine cancer.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nYour prognosis depends on the type and stage of uterine sarcoma you had when treated. The 5-year survival rate for uterine sarcoma that has not spread ranges between 60% to 100%, depending in the type of uterine sarcoma.\nThe survival rate drops once the cancer has started to spread and becomes harder to treat.\nUterine sarcoma is often not found early, therefore, the prognosis may be poor."}
