The red blood cells that are normally shaped like a disk take on a sickle or crescent shape. Red blood cells carry oxygen throughout the body.\nCauses\nSickle cell disease is caused by an abnormal type of hemoglobin called hemoglobin S. Hemoglobin is a protein inside red blood cells that carries oxygen.\nHemoglobin S changes the red blood cells. The red blood cells become fragile and shaped like crescents or sickles.\nThe abnormal cells deliver less oxygen to the body's tissues.\nThey can also easily get stuck in small blood vessels and break into pieces. This can interrupt healthy blood flow and cut down even more on the amount of oxygen flowing to body tissues.\nSickle cell disease is inherited from both parents. If you get the sickle cell gene from only one parent, you will have\nsickle cell trait\n."}

If you get the sickle cell gene from only one parent, you will have\nsickle cell trait\n. People with sickle cell trait do not have the symptoms of sickle cell disease.\nSickle cell disease is much more common in people of African and Mediterranean descent. It is also seen in people from South and Central America, the Caribbean, and the Middle East.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms usually do not occur until after the age of 4 months.\nAlmost all people with sickle cell disease have painful episodes called crises. These can last from hours to days. Crises can cause pain in the lower back, leg, joints, and chest.\nSome people have one episode every few years. Others have many episodes each year."}
