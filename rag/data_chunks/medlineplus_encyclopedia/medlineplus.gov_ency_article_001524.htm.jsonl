The condition often improves without treatment.\nSymptoms\nThe man ejaculates before he would like (prematurely). This may range from before penetration to a point just after penetration. It may leave the couple feeling unsatisfied.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will do a physical exam and talk with you about your sex life and medical history. Your provider also may do blood or urine tests to rule out any physical problems.\nTreatment\nPractice and relaxation can help you deal with the problem. There are helpful techniques you can try.\nThe \"stop and start\" method:\nThis technique involves sexually stimulating the man until he feels like he is about to reach orgasm. Stop the stimulation for about 30 seconds and then start it again. Repeat this pattern until the man wants to ejaculate."}

The last time, continue stimulation until the man reaches orgasm.\nThe \"squeeze\" method:\nThis technique involves sexually stimulating the man until he recognizes that he is about to ejaculate. At that point, the man or his partner gently squeezes the end of the penis (where the glans meets the shaft) for several seconds. Stop sexual stimulation for about 30 seconds, and then start it again. The person or couple may repeat this pattern until the man wants to ejaculate. The last time, continue stimulation until the man reaches orgasm.\nAntidepressants, such as fluoxetine (Prozac) and other selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), are often prescribed. These medicines can increase the time it takes to reach ejaculation.\nYou can apply a local anesthetic cream or spray to the penis to reduce stimulation. Decreased feeling in the penis may delay ejaculation. Condom use also may have this effect for some men.\nOther medicines used for\nerectile dysfunction\nmay help."}

Some studies show that using a combination of behavioral techniques and medicines may be most effective.\nEvaluation by a sex therapist, psychologist, or psychiatrist may help some couples.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn most cases, the man can learn how to control ejaculation. Education and practicing simple techniques are often successful. Chronic premature ejaculation may be a sign of anxiety or depression. A psychiatrist or psychologist can help treat these conditions.\nPossible Complications\nIf a man ejaculates very early, before entering the vagina, it may prevent a couple from getting pregnant.\nA continued lack of control over ejaculation may cause one or both partners to feel sexually dissatisfied."}
