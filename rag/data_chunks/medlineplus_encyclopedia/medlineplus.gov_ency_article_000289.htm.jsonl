Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEsophageal spasm\nEsophageal spasm\nEsophageal spasms are abnormal contractions of the muscles in the esophagus, the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. These\nspasms\nmay not move food effectively to the stomach.\nCauses\nThe cause of esophageal spasm is unknown. Very hot or very cold foods may trigger spasms in some people.  Muscle or nerve problems in the esophagus may cause the spasm.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nProblems swallowing\nor pain with swallowing\nPain in the chest\nor upper abdomen\nIt can be hard to tell a spasm from\nangina\npectoris, a symptom of heart disease. The pain may spread to the neck, jaw, arms, or back\nExams and Tests\nTests you may need to look for the condition include:\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy\n(EGD)\nEsophageal manometry\nEsophagogram (barium swallow x-ray)\nHeart evaluation if there is concern that the spasm sensation stems from heart disease\nTreatment\nNitroglycerin given under the tongue (sublingual) may help a sudden episode of esophageal spasm."}

Long-acting nitroglycerin and calcium channel blockers are also used for the problem.\nLong-term (chronic) cases are sometimes treated with low-dose antidepressants such as trazodone or nortriptyline to reduce symptoms.\nOccasionally, spasm may improve with medicines that block acid production.\nBotulinum toxin injections may be done into the esophagus for some conditions that may cause esophageal spasm, such as achalasia, and for distal esophageal spasm.\nRarely, certain cases may need dilation (widening) of the esophagus by endoscopic myotomy (cutting the affected muscles in the esophagus). Surgery may be needed to control symptoms in the case of spastic achalasia.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAn esophageal spasm may come and go (intermittent) or last for a long time (\nchronic)\n. Medicine can help relieve symptoms in many cases."}

Medicine can help relieve symptoms in many cases.  However, other treatments may be needed, especially in the case of achalasia.\nPossible Complications\nThe condition may not respond to treatment.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have symptoms of esophageal spasm that don't go away. The symptoms may actually be due to heart problems. Your provider can help decide if you need heart tests.\nPrevention\nAvoid very hot or very cold foods if you get esophageal spasms.  If the spasm also causes trouble swallowing, avoiding difficult foods such as meat, dry breads, and rice may help.\nAlternative Names\nSpasm of the esophagus; Distal esophageal spasm; Jackhammer esophagus; Achalasia\nImages\nDigestive system\nThroat anatomy\nEsophagus\nReferences\nFalk GW, Katzka DA.
