Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAchilles tendinitis\nAchilles tendinitis\nAchilles tendinitis occurs when the tendon that connects the back of your leg to your heel becomes swollen and painful near the bottom of the foot. This tendon is called the Achilles tendon. It allows you to push your foot down. You use your Achilles tendon when walking, running, and jumping.\nCauses\nThere are two large muscles in the calf. These create the power needed to push off with the foot or go up on the toes. The large Achilles tendon connects these muscles to the heel.\nHeel pain\nis most often due to overuse of the foot. Rarely, it is caused by an injury.\nTendinitis\ndue to overuse is most common in younger people."}

Rarely, it is caused by an injury.\nTendinitis\ndue to overuse is most common in younger people. It can occur in walkers, runners, or other athletes.\nAchilles tendinitis may be more likely to occur if:\nThere is a sudden increase in the amount or intensity of an activity.\nYour calf muscles are very tight (not stretched out).\nYou run on hard surfaces, such as concrete.\nYou run too often.\nYou jump a lot (such as when playing basketball).\nYou do not wear shoes that give your feet proper support.\nYour foot suddenly turns in or out.\nTendinitis from arthritis is more common in middle-aged and older adults. A bone spur or growth may form in the back of the heel bone. This may irritate the Achilles tendon and cause pain and swelling. Flat feet will put more tension on the tendon.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include pain in the heel and along the length of the tendon when walking or running. The area may feel painful and stiff in the morning.\nThe tendon may be painful to touch or move. The area may be swollen and warm. You may have trouble standing up on your toes."}

You may also have trouble finding shoes that fit comfortably due to pain in the back of your heel.\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam. They will look for tenderness along the tendon and pain in the area of the tendon when you stand on your toes.\nX-rays can help diagnose bone problems.\nAn\nmagnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI)  scan of the foot may be done if you are considering surgery or there is a chance that you have a tear in the Achilles tendon.\nTreatment\nThe main treatments for Achilles tendinitis do not involve surgery. It is important to remember that it may take at least 2 to 3 months for the pain to go away.\nTry putting ice on the Achilles tendon area for 15 to 20 minutes, 2 to 3 times per day."}

Remove the ice if the area gets numb.\nChanges in activity may help manage the symptoms:\nDecrease or stop any activity that causes pain.\nRun or walk on smoother and softer surfaces.\nSwitch to biking, swimming, or other activities that put less stress on the Achilles tendon.\nYour provider or physical therapist can show you stretching exercises or eccentric loading exercises for the Achilles tendon.\nYou may also need to make changes in your footwear, such as:\nUsing a brace, boot or cast to keep the heel and tendon still and allow the swelling to go down\nPlacing heel lifts in the shoe under the heel\nWearing shoes that are softer in the areas over and under the heel cushion\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and ibuprofen, can help ease pain or swelling.\nOther treatments include injections, such as platelet rich plasma or steroids, to reduce the inflammation."}

However, the tendon can become even weaker following injection and should be protected after the injections.\nIf these treatments do not improve symptoms, you may need surgery to remove inflamed tissue and abnormal areas of the tendon. If there is a bone spur irritating the tendon, surgery can be used to remove the spur.\nExtracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) may be an alternative to surgery for people who have not responded to other treatments. This treatment uses low-dose sound waves.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn most cases, lifestyle changes help improve symptoms. Keep in mind that symptoms may return if you do not limit activities that cause pain, or if you do not maintain the strength and flexibility of the tendon.\nPossible Complications\nAchilles tendinitis may make you more likely to have an Achilles rupture. This condition most often causes a sharp pain that feels as if you have been hit in the back of the heel with a stick. Surgical repair is often necessary."}

However, the surgery may  not be as successful as usual because there is already damage to the tendon due to pre-existing tendonitis.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nYou have pain in the heel around the Achilles tendon that is worse with activity.\nYou have sharp pain and are unable to walk or push-off without extreme pain or weakness.\nPrevention\nExercises to keep your calf muscles strong and flexible will help reduce the risk for tendinitis. Overusing a weak or tight Achilles tendon makes you more likely to develop tendinitis.\nAlternative Names\nTendinitis of the heel; Heel pain - Achilles\nImages\nInflamed Achilles tendon\nReferences\nBiundo JJ, Canoso JJ.
