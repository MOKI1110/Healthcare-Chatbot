Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCervix\nCervix\nThe cervix is the lower end of the womb (uterus). It is at the top of the\nvagina\n. It is about 2.5 to 3.5 centimeters (1 to 1.3 inches) long. The cervical canal passes through the cervix. It allows blood from a menstrual period and a baby (fetus) to pass from the womb into the vagina. Sperm travel from the vagina up the cervical canal into the uterine cavity, then into the fallopian tubes to fertilize the egg.\nConditions that affect the cervix include:\nCervical cancer\nCervical infection\nCervical inflammation\nCervical intraepithelial neoplasia\n(CIN) or dysplasia\nCervical polyps\nCervical pregnancy\nCervical incompetence in pregnancy\nCervical cancer screening involves a\nPap smear\nand an\nHPV test\n. For both these tests, the cells are taken from the cervix. A Pap test checks for premalignant (precancerous) changes in the cervix, and the HPV test checks for infection with human papillomavirus (HPV) that may lead to cervical cancer.\nImages\nFemale reproductive anatomy\nUterus\nReferences\nBaggish MS.
