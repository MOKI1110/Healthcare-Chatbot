The surgery is only one part of a complex, long-term process.\nSeveral experts will help you prepare for the procedure, and make sure you are comfortable before, during, and after surgery.\nInformation\nTransplant surgery is most often done to replace a diseased body part with a healthy one.\nSOLID ORGAN TRANSPLANTS\nAuto islet cell transplant is done after a person has their pancreas removed due to long-term (chronic) pancreatitis. The procedure takes insulin-producing cells from the pancreas and returns them to the person's body.\nCorneal transplant\nreplaces a damaged or diseased cornea. The cornea is the clear tissue on the front of the eye that helps focus light on the retina."}

Most types of organ transplants have guidelines detailing what type of person is most likely to benefit from a transplant and will be able to manage the challenging process.\nIf the transplant team believes you are a good candidate for a transplant, you will be put on a national waiting list. Your place on a waiting list is based on a number of factors, which depend on the type of transplant you are receiving.\nOnce you are on the waiting list, the search for a matching donor begins. Types of donors depend on your specific transplant:\nA living related donor is related to you, such as a parent, sibling, or child.\nA living unrelated donor is a person, such as a friend or spouse.\nA deceased donor is someone who has recently died."}
