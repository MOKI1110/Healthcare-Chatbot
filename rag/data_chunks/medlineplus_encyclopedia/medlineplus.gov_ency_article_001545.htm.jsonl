To develop language, a child must be able to hear, see, understand, and remember. Children must also be physically able to form speech.\nUp to 1 of every 14 children has symptoms of a language disorder. When the cause is unknown, it is called a developmental language disorder.\nProblems with receptive language skills usually begin before age 4. Some mixed language disorders are caused by a brain injury."}

Some mixed language disorders are caused by a brain injury. These conditions are sometimes misdiagnosed as developmental disorders.\nLanguage disorders may occur in children with:\nOther developmental problems\nAutism spectrum disorder\nHearing loss\nLearning disabilities\nDamage to the central nervous system, which is called aphasia\nLanguage disorders are rarely caused by a lack of intelligence.\nLanguage disorders are not the same as delayed language. With delayed language, the child develops speech and language in the same way as other children, but later. In language disorders, speech and language do not develop normally. The child may have some language skills, but not others. Or, the way in which these skills develop will be different than usual.\nSymptoms\nChildren with language disorders may have one, two, or many of the symptoms listed below. Symptoms can range from mild to severe.\nChildren with a receptive language disorder have problems understanding language."}

They may have:\nA hard time understanding what other people have said\nProblems following directions that are spoken to them\nProblems organizing their thoughts\nChildren with an expressive language disorder have problems using language to express what they are thinking or need. These children may:\nHave a hard time putting words together into sentences\nUse short and simple sentences and the word order may be off\nHave difficulty finding the right words when talking, and often use placeholder words such as \"um\"\nHave a vocabulary that is below the level of other children the same age\nLeave words out of sentences when talking\nUse certain phrases over and over again, and repeat (echo) parts or all of questions\nUse tenses (past, present, future) improperly\nChildren with language problems may have difficulty in social settings."}

At times, language disorders may be part of the cause of severe behavioral problems.\nExams and Tests\nA medical history may reveal that the child has close relatives who have also had speech and language problems.\nAny child suspected of having this disorder can have standardized receptive and expressive language tests. A speech and language therapist or neuropsychologist will administer these tests.\nA hearing test called\naudiometry\nshould also be done to check for hearing impairment, which is one of the most common causes of language problems.\nTreatment\nSpeech and language therapy is the best approach to treating this type of language disorder.\nCounseling, such as talk therapy, is also recommended because of the possibility of related emotional or behavioral problems.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome varies, based on the cause. Children with brain injury or other structural problems may have long-term problems with language."}

They may also have reading disorders.\nPossible Complications\nDifficulty understanding and using language can cause problems with social interaction and the ability to function independently as an adult.\nReading may be a problem.\nDepression, anxiety, and other emotional or behavioral problems may complicate language disorders.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIf you are concerned that your child's speech or language is delayed, see your child's health care provider."}
