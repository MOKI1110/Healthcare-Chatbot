Other factors may include:\nDecreased blood flow to the area\nToo much tension in the sphincter muscles that control the anus\nThe condition affects males and females equally. Anal fissures are also common in women after childbirth and in people with\nCrohn disease\n.\nSymptoms\nAn anal fissure can be seen as a crack in the anal skin when the area is stretched slightly. The fissure is almost always in the middle. Anal fissures may cause painful bowel movements and bleeding. There may be blood on the outside of the stool or on the toilet paper (or baby wipes) after a bowel movement.\nSymptoms may begin suddenly or develop slowly over time.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a\nrectal exam\nand look at the anal tissue."}

But not having bowel movements will only cause the stools to become even harder, which can make the anal fissure worse.\nPrevent hard stools and constipation by:\nMaking dietary changes -- eating more fiber or\nbulk\n, such as fruits, vegetables, and grains\nDrinking more fluids\nUsing stool softeners\nAsk your provider about the following ointments or creams to help soothe the affected skin:\nNumbing cream, if pain interferes with normal bowel movements\nPetroleum jelly\nZinc oxide, 1% hydrocortisone cream, Preparation H, and other products\nsitz bath\nis a warm water bath used for healing or cleansing.
