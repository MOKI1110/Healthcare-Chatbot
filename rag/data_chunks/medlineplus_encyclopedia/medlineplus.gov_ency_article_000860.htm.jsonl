Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nImpetigo\nImpetigo\nImpetigo is a common infection of the outermost layer of the skin.\nCauses\nImpetigo is caused by streptococcus (strep) or staphylococcus (staph) bacteria. Methicillin-resistant staph aureus (\nMRSA\n) is an increasing cause.\nSkin typically has many types of bacteria on it. When there is a break in the skin, bacteria can enter the body and grow there. This causes inflammation and infection. Breaks in the skin may occur from injury or trauma to the skin or from insect, animal, or human bites.\nImpetigo may also occur on the skin, where there is no visible break.\nImpetigo is most common in children who live in unhealthy conditions.\nIn adults, it may occur following another skin problem. It may also develop after a cold or other virus.\nImpetigo can spread to others. You can catch the infection from someone who has it if the fluid that oozes from their skin\nblisters\ntouches an open area on your skin.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of impetigo are:\nOne or many blisters that are filled with pus and easy to pop."}

In infants, the skin is reddish or raw-looking where a blister has broken.\nBlisters that itch are filled with yellow or honey-colored fluid and ooze and crust over.\nRash\nthat may begin as a single spot but spreads to other areas due to scratching.\nSkin sores on the face, lips, arms, or legs that spread to other areas.\nSwollen lymph nodes\nnear the infection.\nPatches of impetigo on the body (in children).\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will look at your skin to determine if you have impetigo.\nYour provider may take a sample of bacteria from your skin to grow in the lab. This can help determine if MRSA is the cause. Specific antibiotics are needed to treat this type of bacteria.\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to get rid of the infection and relieve your symptoms.\nYour provider will prescribe an antibacterial cream. You may need to take antibiotics by mouth if the infection is severe.\nGently wash (do not scrub) your skin several times a day."}

Use an antibacterial soap to remove crusts and drainage.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe sores of impetigo heal slowly. Scars are rare.  The cure rate is very high, but the problem often comes back in young children.\nPossible Complications\nImpetigo may lead to:\nSpread of the infection to other parts of the body (common)\nKidney inflammation or failure\n(rare)\nPermanent skin damage and scarring (very rare)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of impetigo.\nPrevention\nPrevent the spread of infection.\nIf you have impetigo, always use a clean washcloth and towel each time you wash.\nDo not share towels, clothing, razors, and other personal care products with anyone.\nAvoid touching blisters that are oozing.\nWash your hands thoroughly after touching infected skin.\nKeep your skin clean to prevent getting the infection.
