Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTesticular torsion\nTesticular torsion\nTesticular torsion is twisting of the spermatic cord, which supports the testes in the scrotum. When this occurs, blood supply is cut off to the testicles and nearby tissue in the\nscrotum\n. This may cause permanent damage to the testicle.\nCauses\nSome men are more prone to this condition because of defects in the connective tissue within the scrotum. The problem may also occur after an injury to the scrotum that results in a lot of swelling, or following heavy exercise. In some cases, there is no clear cause.\nThe condition is more common during the first year of life and at the beginning of adolescence (puberty). However, it may happen in older men.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nSudden severe pain in one testicle."}

However, it may happen in older men.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nSudden severe pain in one testicle. The pain may occur without a clear reason.\nSwelling within one side of the scrotum (\nscrotal swelling\n).\nNausea or vomiting.\nAdditional symptoms that may be associated with this disease:\nTesticle lump\nBlood in the semen\nTesticle pulled to a higher position in scrotum than normal (high riding)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you. The exam may show:\nExtreme tenderness and swelling in the testicle area.\nThe testicle on the affected side is higher.\nYou may have a Doppler ultrasound of the testicle to check the blood flow. There will be no blood flowing through the area if you have complete torsion. Blood flow may be reduced if the spermatic cord is partly twisted.\nTreatment\nMost of the time, surgery is needed to correct the problem. The procedure involves untwisting the cord and sewing the testicle to the inside wall of the scrotum. Surgery should be done as soon as possible after symptoms begin."}

The procedure involves untwisting the cord and sewing the testicle to the inside wall of the scrotum. Surgery should be done as soon as possible after symptoms begin. If it is performed within 6 hours, most of the testicle can be saved.\nDuring surgery, the testicle on the other side is often secured into place as well. This is because the unaffected testicle is at risk of testicular torsion in the future.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe testicle may continue to function properly if the condition is found early and treated right away. The chances that the testicle will need to be removed increase if blood flow is reduced for more than 6 hours. However, sometimes it may lose its ability to function even if torsion has lasted fewer than 6 hours.\nPossible Complications\nThe testicle may shrink if blood supply is cut off for an extended time. It may need to be surgically removed. Shrinkage of the testicle may occur days to months after the torsion has been corrected."}

Severe infection of the testicle and scrotum is also possible if the blood flow is limited for a long period.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nGet emergency medical attention if you have symptoms of testicular torsion as soon as possible. It is better to go to an emergency room instead of an urgent care in case you need to have surgery right away.\nPrevention\nTake steps to avoid injury to the scrotum.
