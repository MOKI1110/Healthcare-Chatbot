It helps to maintain normal nerve and muscle function, supports a healthy immune system, keeps the heartbeat steady, and helps bones remain strong. It also helps adjust blood glucose levels. It aids in the production of energy and protein.\nThere is ongoing research into the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as high blood pressure, heart disease, and diabetes. However, taking magnesium supplements is not currently advised. Diets high in protein, calcium, or vitamin D will increase the need for magnesium.\nFood Sources\nMost dietary magnesium comes from dark green, leafy vegetables."}

Other foods that are good sources of magnesium are:\nFruits (such as bananas, dried apricots, and avocados)\nNuts (such as almonds and cashews)\nPeas and beans (legumes), seeds\nSoy products (such as soy flour and tofu)\nWhole grains (such as brown rice and millet)\nMilk\nSide Effects\nSide effects from high magnesium intake are not common, except in people with significantly reduced kidney function.  The body generally removes extra amounts. Magnesium excess most often occurs when a person is:\nTaking in too much of the mineral in supplement form\nTaking laxatives that contain magnesium\nAlthough you may not get enough magnesium from your diet, it is rare to be truly lacking in magnesium."}
