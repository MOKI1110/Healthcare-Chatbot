Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSeizures\nSeizures\nA seizure is the physical changes in behavior that occurs during an episode of specific types of abnormal electrical activity in the brain.\nThe term \"seizure\" is often used interchangeably with \"convulsion.\" During convulsions a person has uncontrollable shaking that is rapid and rhythmic, with the muscles contracting and relaxing repeatedly. There are many different types of seizures. Some have mild symptoms without shaking.\nConsiderations\nIt may be hard to tell if someone is having a seizure. Some seizures only cause a person to have\nstaring spells\n. These may go unnoticed.\nSpecific symptoms depend on which part of the brain is involved."}

There may be a family history of epilepsy or seizures.\nIf seizures continue repeatedly after any underlying problem is treated, the condition is called epilepsy.\nHome Care\nMost seizures stop by themselves. But during a seizure, the person can be hurt.\nWhen a seizure occurs, the main goal is to protect the person from injury:\nTry to prevent a fall. Lay the person on the ground in a safe area.
