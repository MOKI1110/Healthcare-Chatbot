It occurs when there is no outside source of the sounds.\nTinnitus is often called \"ringing in the ears.\" It may also sound like blowing, roaring, buzzing, hissing, humming, whistling, or sizzling. The noises heard can be soft or loud. The person may even think they're hearing air escaping, water running, the inside of a seashell, or musical notes.\nConsiderations\nTinnitus is common. Almost everyone notices a mild form of tinnitus once in a while. It usually lasts a few minutes. However, constant or recurring tinnitus may be stressful and may make it harder to focus or sleep.\nTinnitus can be:\nSubjective, which means that the sound is only heard by the person\nObjective, which means that the sound is heard by both the affected person and the examiner (using a stethoscope near the person's ear, head, or neck)\nCauses\nIt is not known exactly what causes a person to \"hear\" sounds with no outside source of the noise."}

However, tinnitus can be a symptom of almost any ear problem, including:\nEar infections\nForeign objects or\nwax in the ear\nHearing loss\nMeniere disease\n-- an inner ear disorder that involves hearing loss and dizziness\nProblem with the eustachian tube (tube that runs between the middle ear and the throat)\nAntibiotics, aspirin, or other drugs may also cause ear noises. Alcohol, caffeine, or smoking may worsen tinnitus if the person already has it.\nSometimes, tinnitus is a sign of high blood pressure, an allergy, or\nanemia\n. In rare cases, tinnitus is a sign of a serious problem such as a tumor or\naneurysm\n. Other risk factors for tinnitus include\ntemporomandibular joint disorder\n(TMJ), diabetes, thyroid problems, obesity, and head injury.\nTinnitus is common in war veterans and in adults age 65 years or older."}

Children can also be affected, especially those with severe hearing loss.\nHome Care\nTinnitus is often more noticeable when you go to bed at night because your surroundings are quieter.  To  mask tinnitus and make it less irritating, background noise using the following may help:\nWhite noise machine\nRunning a humidifier or dishwasher\nHome care of tinnitus mainly includes:\nLearning ways to relax. It is not known if stress causes tinnitus, but feeling stressed or anxious can worsen it.\nAvoiding things that may make tinnitus worse, such as caffeine, alcohol, and smoking.\nGetting enough rest.

(For example, your provider may remove ear wax.) If TMJ is the cause, your dentist may suggest dental appliances or home exercises to treat teeth clenching and grinding.\nTalk to your provider about all your current medicines to see if a medicine may be causing the problem. This may include over-the-counter medicines, vitamins, and supplements. Do not stop taking any medicine without talking to your provider.\nMany medicines are used to relieve symptoms of tinnitus, but no medicine works for everyone. Your provider may have you try different medicines or combinations of medicines to see what works for you.\nA tinnitus masker worn like a hearing aid helps some people. It delivers low-level sound directly into the ear to cover the ear noise.\nA hearing aid may help reduce ear noise and make outside sounds louder.\nCounseling may help you learn to live with tinnitus."}
