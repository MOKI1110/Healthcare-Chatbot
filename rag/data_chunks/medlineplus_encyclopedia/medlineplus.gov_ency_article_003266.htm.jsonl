Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHeart murmurs\nHeart murmurs\nA heart murmur is a blowing, whooshing, or rasping sound heard during a heartbeat. The sound is caused by turbulent (rough) blood flow through the heart valves or near the heart.\nConsiderations\nThe heart has 4 chambers:\nTwo upper chambers (atria)\nTwo lower chambers (ventricles)\nThe heart has valves that close with each heartbeat, causing blood to flow in only one direction. Two of the valves are located between the chambers (mitral and tricuspid). The other two valves (aortic and pulmonic) are located at the exit from the heart chambers into the aorta and pulmonary artery, respectively.\nWatch this video about:\nHeartbeat\nMurmurs can happen for many reasons, such as:\nWhen a valve does not close tightly and blood leaks backward (regurgitation)\nWhen blood flows through a narrowed or stiff heart valve (stenosis)\nThere are several ways in which your health care provider may describe a murmur:\nMurmurs are classified (\"graded\") depending on how loud the murmur sounds with a stethoscope. The grading is on a scale."}

The grading is on a scale. Grade I can barely be heard and is intermittent. An example of a murmur description is a \"grade II/VI murmur.\" (This means the murmur is grade 2 on a scale of 1 to 6).\nIn addition, a murmur is described by the stage of the heartbeat when the murmur is heard. A heart murmur may be described as systolic or diastolic. (Systole is when the heart is squeezing out blood and diastole is when it is filling up with blood.)\nWhen a murmur is more noticeable, the provider may be able to feel it with the palm of the hand over the heart. This is called a \"thrill\" and means the murmur is grade 4 or higher.\nThings the provider will look for in the exam include:\nDoes the murmur occur when the heart is resting or contracting?\nDoes it last throughout the heartbeat?\nDoes it change when you move?\nCan it be heard in other parts of the chest, on the back, or in the neck?\nWhere is the murmur heard the loudest?\nCauses\nMany heart murmurs are harmless. These types of murmurs are called innocent murmurs."}

Innocent murmurs do not need treatment.\nOther heart murmurs may indicate an abnormality in the heart. These abnormal murmurs can be caused by:\nProblems of the aortic valve (\naortic regurgitation\n, aortic stenosis)\nProblems of the mitral valve (\nchronic\nor acute mitral regurgitation,\nmitral stenosis\n)\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nPulmonary regurgitation (backflow of blood into the right ventricle, caused by failure of the pulmonary valve to close completely)\nPulmonary valve stenosis\nProblems of the tricuspid valve (\ntricuspid regurgitation\n, tricuspid stenosis)\nSignificant murmurs in children are more likely to be caused by:\nAnomalous pulmonary venous return (an abnormal formation of the pulmonary veins)\nAtrial septal defect\n(ASD)\nCoarctation of the aorta\nPatent ductus arteriosus\n(PDA)\nVentricular septal defect\n(VSD)\nMultiple murmurs may result from a combination of heart problems.\nChildren often have murmurs as a normal part of development."}

You will be asked questions about your medical history and symptoms, such as:\nHave other family members had murmurs or other abnormal heart sounds?\nDo you have a family history of heart problems?\nDo you have chest pain, fainting, shortness of breath, or other breathing problems?\nHave you had swelling, weight gain, or bulging veins in the neck?\nDoes your skin have a bluish color?\nThe provider may ask you to squat, stand, or hold your breath while bearing down or gripping something with your hands to listen to your heart.\nThe following tests may be done:\nChest x-ray\nElectrocardiogram (ECG)\nEchocardiography\nAlternative Names\nChest sounds - murmurs; Heart sounds - abnormal; Murmur - innocent; Innocent murmur; Systolic heart murmur; Diastolic heart murmur\nImages\nHeart - s"}
