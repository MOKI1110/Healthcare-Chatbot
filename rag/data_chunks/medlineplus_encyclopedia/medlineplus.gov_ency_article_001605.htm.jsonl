It affects many parts of the body. People with this condition feel hungry all the time and become obese. They also have poor muscle tone, reduced mental ability, and underdeveloped sex organs.\nCauses\nPrader-Willi syndrome is caused by a missing gene on chromosome 15. Normally, parents each pass down a copy of this chromosome. The syndrome can occur in a couple of ways:\nThe father's genes are missing on chromosome 15\nThere are variations with the father's genes on chromosome 15\nThere are two copies of the mother's chromosome 15 and none from the father\nThese genetic changes occur randomly."}

People who have this syndrome usually do not have a family history of the condition.\nSymptoms\nSigns of Prader-Willi syndrome may be seen at birth.\nNewborns are often small and floppy with reduced muscle tone\nMale infants may have undescended testicles\nOther symptoms may include:\nTrouble feeding as an infant, with poor weight gain\nAlmond-shaped eyes\nDelayed muscle and motor function development\nNarrowed head at the temples\nRapid weight gain\nShort stature\nSlow mental development\nVery small hands and feet in comparison to the child's body\nChildren have an intense craving for food. They will do almost anything to get food, including hoarding. This can result in rapid weight gain and morbid obesity."}

Morbid obesity may lead to:\nType 2 diabetes\nHigh blood pressure\nJoint and lung problems\nExams and Tests\nGenetic testing is available to test children for Prader-Willi syndrome.\nAs the child grows older, lab tests may show signs of morbid obesity, such as:\nAbnormal glucose tolerance\nHigh insulin level in the blood\nLow oxygen level in the blood\nChildren with this syndrome may not respond to luteinizing hormone-releasing factor. This is a sign that their sex organs are not producing hormones. There also may be signs of right-sided heart failure and knee and hip problems.\nTreatment\nObesity is the greatest threat to health. Limiting calories will control weight gain. It is also important to control your child's environment to prevent access to food. Your child's family, neighbors, and school must work together, because your child will try to get food wherever possible. Exercise can help a child with Prader-Willi syndrome gain muscle.\nGrowth hormone is used to treat Prader-Willi syndrome."}

Exercise can help a child with Prader-Willi syndrome gain muscle.\nGrowth hormone is used to treat Prader-Willi syndrome. It can help:\nBuild strength and agility\nImprove height\nIncrease muscle mass and decrease body fat\nImprove weight distribution\nIncrease stamina\nIncrease bone density\nTaking growth hormone therapy may lead to\nsleep apnea\n. A child who takes hormone therapy needs to be monitored for sleep apnea.\nLow levels of sex hormones may be corrected at puberty with hormone replacement.\nMental health and behavioral counseling are also important. This can help with common problems such as skin picking and compulsive behaviors. Sometimes, medicine to treat mental health conditions may be needed.\nSupport Groups\nThe following organizations can provide resources and support:\nPrader-Willi Syndrome Association --\nwww.pwsausa.org\nFoundation for Prader-Willi Research --\nwww.fpwr.org\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe child will need the right education for their IQ level. The child will also need speech, physical, and occupational therapy as early as possible."}

The disorder is frequently suspected at birth.\nReferences\nCooke DW, DiVall SA, Radovick S. Normal and aberrant growth in children.
