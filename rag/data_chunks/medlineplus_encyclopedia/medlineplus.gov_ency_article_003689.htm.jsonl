Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRadioactive iodine uptake\nRadioactive iodine uptake\nRadioactive iodine uptake (RAIU) tests thyroid function. It measures how much radioactive iodine is taken up by your thyroid gland in a certain time period.\nA similar test is the\nthyroid scan\n. The 2 tests are commonly performed together, but they can be done separately.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is done in this way:\nYou are given a pill that contains a tiny amount of radioactive iodine. After swallowing it, you wait as the iodine collects in the thyroid.\nThe first uptake is usually done 4 to 6 hours after you take the iodine pill. Another uptake is usually done 24 hours later. During the uptake, you lie on your back on a table. A device called a gamma probe is moved back and forth over the area of your neck where the thyroid gland is located.\nThe probe detects the location and intensity of the rays given off by the radioactive material."}

A computer displays how much of the tracer is taken up by the thyroid gland.\nThe test takes less than 30 minutes, but you will need to come back twice to have the scans performed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nFollow instructions about not eating before the test. You may be told not to eat after midnight the night before your test.\nYour health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking medicines before the test that may affect your test results. Do not stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.\nTell your provider if you have:\nDiarrhea (may decrease absorption of the radioactive iodine)\nHad recent\nCT scans\nusing intravenous or oral iodine-based contrast (within the past 2 weeks)\nToo little or too much iodine in your diet\nHow the Test will Feel\nThere is no discomfort. You can eat beginning about 1 to 2 hours after swallowing the radioactive iodine."}

You can eat beginning about 1 to 2 hours after swallowing the radioactive iodine. You can go back to a normal diet after the test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to check thyroid function. It is often done when blood tests of thyroid function show that you may have an\noveractive thyroid gland\n.\nNormal Results\nThese are normal results at 6 and 24 hours after swallowing the radioactive iodine:\nAt 6 hours: 5% to 15%\nAt 24 hours: 10% to 30%\nSome testing centers measure only at 24 hours. Values may vary depending on the amount of iodine in your diet. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nHigher-than-normal uptake may be due to an overactive thyroid gland. The most common cause is\nGraves disease\n.\nOther conditions can cause some areas of higher-than-normal uptake in the thyroid gland."}

The most common cause is\nGraves disease\n.\nOther conditions can cause some areas of higher-than-normal uptake in the thyroid gland. These include:\nAn enlarged thyroid gland that contains nodules producing too much thyroid hormone (\ntoxic nodular goiter\n)\nA single thyroid nodule that is producing too much thyroid hormone (toxic adenoma)\nThese conditions often result in normal uptake, but the uptake is concentrated into a few (hot) areas while the rest of the thyroid gland does not take up any iodine (cold areas). This can only be determined if the scan is done along with the uptake test.\nLower-than-normal uptake may be due to:\nFactitious hyperthyroidism\n(taking too much thyroid hormone medicine or supplements)\nIodine overload\nSubacute thyroiditis\n(swelling or inflammation of the thyroid gland)\nSilent (or painless) thyroiditis\nAmiodarone (medicine to treat some kinds of heart disease that may also have effects on the thyroid gland)\nRisks\nAll radiation has possible side effects."}

The amount of radiation in this test is very small, and there have been no documented side effects.\nWomen who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not have this test.\nTalk to your provider if you have concerns about this test.\nConsiderations\nThe radioactive iodine leaves your body through your urine. You need not take special precautions, such as flushing twice after urinating, for 24 to 48 hours after the test because the dose of radioactive iodine is very low. Ask your provider or the radiology/nuclear medicine team performing the scan about taking precautions.\nAlternative Names\nThyroid uptake; Iodine uptake test; RAIU\nImages\nThyroid uptake test\nReferences\nFaix JD.
