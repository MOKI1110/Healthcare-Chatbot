Atherosclerosis is the buildup of fatty material, called plaque, along the walls of the arteries. This causes arteries to become narrowed and less flexible. The narrowing can reduce blood flow to the heart, causing chest pain (angina).\nUnstable angina is a special subset of angina and is defined below.\nPeople with unstable angina are at higher risk of having a heart attack.\nLess common causes of angina are:\nAbnormal function of tiny branch arteries without narrowing of larger arteries (called microvascular dysfunction or Syndrome X)\nCoronary artery spasm\nRisk factors for coronary artery disease include:\nDiabetes\nFamily history of early coronary heart disease (a close relative such as a sibling or parent had heart disease before age 55 in a man or before age 65 in a woman)\nHigh blood pressure\nHigh LDL cholesterol\nLow HDL cholesterol\nMale sex\nSedentary lifestyle (not getting enough exercise)\nObesity\nOlder age\nSmoking\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of angina may include:\nChest pain that you may also feel in the shoulder, arm, jaw, neck, back, or other area\nDiscomfort that feels like tightness, squeezing, crushing, burning, choking, or aching\nDiscomfort th"}

The pain does not occur more often or get worse over time.\nUnstable angina is chest pain that is sudden and often gets worse over a short period of time. You may be developing unstable angina if your chest pain:\nStarts to feel different, is more severe, comes more often, or occurs with less activity or while you are at rest\nLasts longer than 15 to 20 minutes\nOccurs without cause (for example, while you are asleep or sitting quietly)\nDoes not respond well to a medicine called nitroglycerin (especially if this medicine worked to relieve chest pain in the past)\nOccurs with a drop in blood pressure or shortness of breath\nUnstable angina is a warning sign that a heart attack may happen soon and needs to be treated right away."}
