Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCeliac disease - sprue\nCeliac disease - sprue\nCeliac disease is an autoimmune condition that damages the lining of the small intestine. This damage comes from a reaction to eating gluten. This is a substance that is found in wheat, rye, barley, and possibly oats. It is also found in food made from these ingredients.\nThe damaged intestine is not able to fully absorb nutrients from food.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of celiac disease is not known. The lining of the intestines have small areas called villi which project outward into the opening of the intestine. These structures help absorb nutrients.\nWhen people with celiac disease eat foods with gluten, their immune system reacts by damaging the villi. Because of the damage, the villi are unable to properly absorb iron, vitamins, and other nutrients. This may cause a number of symptoms and other health problems.\nThe disease can develop at any point in life, from infancy to late adulthood.\nPeople who have a family member with celiac disease are at greater risk of developing the disease."}

Those who test negative for the common genetic variant are unlikely to have celiac disease.\nA follow-up biopsy or blood test may be ordered several months after the diagnosis and treatment. These tests assess how well treatment is working. Normal results mean that you have responded to treatment. This confirms the diagnosis. However, this does not mean that the disease has been cured.\nTreatment\nCeliac disease cannot be cured.

You should NOT begin the gluten-free diet before you are diagnosed. Starting the diet will affect testing for the disease.\nIn most cases, following a well-balanced, gluten-free diet is the only treatment you need to stay well. Your provider may need to prescribe vitamin and mineral supplements.\nSometimes, short-term use of corticosteroids (such as prednisone) may be needed if celiac disease does not respond to treatment.\nWhen you are diagnosed, get help from a registered dietitian who specializes in celiac disease and the gluten-free diet.
