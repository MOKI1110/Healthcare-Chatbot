Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEar barotrauma\nEar barotrauma\nEar barotrauma causes discomfort in the ear due to pressure differences between the inside and outside of the eardrum. It may include damage to the ear.\nCauses\nThe air pressure in the middle ear is most often the same as the air pressure outside of the body. The eustachian tube is a connection between the middle ear and the back of the nose and upper throat.\nSwallowing or yawning opens the eustachian tube and allows air to flow into or out of the middle ear. This helps equalize pressure on either side of the ear drum. If the eustachian tube is blocked, the air pressure in the middle ear is different than the pressure on the outside of the eardrum. This can cause barotrauma.\nMany people have barotrauma at some time. The problem often occurs with altitude changes, such as flying, scuba diving, or driving in the mountains. If you have a congested nose from allergies, colds, or an upper respiratory infection, you are more likely to develop barotrauma.\nBlockage of the eustachian tube could also be present before birth (congenital)."}

It may also be caused by swelling in the throat.\nSymptoms\nCommon symptoms include:\nDizziness\nEar discomfort\nor pain in one or both ears\nHearing loss\n(slight)\nSensation of fullness or stuffiness in the ears\nOther symptoms may develop if the condition is very bad or goes on for a long time, such as:\nEar pain\nFeeling of pressure in the ears (as if underwater)\nModerate to severe hearing loss\nNosebleed\nExams and Tests\nDuring an exam of the ear, the health care provider may see a slight outward bulge or inward pull of the eardrum. If the condition is severe, there may be blood or bruising behind the eardrum.\nSevere barotrauma may cause the eardrum to look similar to an\near infection\n.\nTreatment\nTo relieve ear pain or discomfort, you can take steps to open the eustachian tube and relieve the pressure, such as:\nChew gum\nInhale, and then gently exhale while holding the nostrils closed and the mouth shut\nSuck on candy\nYawn\nWhen flying, DO NOT sleep as the plane prepares to land."}

Repeat the listed steps to open the eustachian tube. For infants and small children, nursing or taking sips of a drink may help.\nScuba divers should go down and come up slowly. Diving while you have congestion from allergies or a respiratory infection is dangerous. Barotrauma may be severe in these situations.\nIf self-care steps do not ease discomfort within a few hours or the problem is severe, you may need to see a provider.\nYou may need medicine to relieve nasal congestion and allow the eustachian tube to open. These include:\nDecongestants taken by mouth, or by a nose spray\nSteroids taken by mouth, or by a nose spray\nYou may need antibiotics to prevent or treat an ear infection if barotrauma is severe.\nRarely, surgery may be needed if other treatments do not work to open the tube."}

In this procedure, a surgical cut is made in the eardrum to allow pressure to become equal and fluid to drain (\nmyringotomy\n).\nIf you must change altitude often or you are prone to barotrauma, you may need to have surgery to place tubes in the ear drum. This is not an option for scuba diving.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nBarotrauma is usually a\nbenign\n, self-limited condition that responds to self-care. Hearing loss is almost always temporary.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nAcute ear infection\nHearing loss\nRuptured or perforated eardrum\nVertigo\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nTry home care measures first. Contact your provider if the discomfort does not ease after a few hours.\nContact your provider if you have barotrauma and new symptoms develop, especially:\nDrainage or bleeding from the ear\nFever\nSevere ear pain\nPrevention\nYou can use nasal decongestants (spray or pill form) before altitude changes."}
