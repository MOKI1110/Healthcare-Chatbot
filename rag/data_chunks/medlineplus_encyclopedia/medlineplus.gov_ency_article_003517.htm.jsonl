In general, test results are not affected by other medicines you may be taking. However, certain supplements including biotin (vitamin B7) can affect the results. Tell your provider if you are taking biotin.\nPregnancy and some diseases, including kidney and liver disease, can also affect the results of this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain.

Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nThe normal range is based on a large population and is not necessarily normal for an individual. You may be having symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism even though your free T4 is in the normal range. The TSH test may help determine if your symptoms are related to thyroid disease. Talk to your provider about your symptoms.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nTo fully understand results of the free T4 test, results of other thyroid blood tests, such as TSH or T3, may be needed.\nTest results may also be affected by pregnancy, estrogen level, liver problems, more severe body-wide illnesses, and inherited changes in a protein that binds T4.\nA higher than normal level of T4 may be due to conditions that involve an overactive thyroid, including:\nGraves disease\nTaking too much thyroid hormone medicine\nThyroiditis\nToxic goiter or toxic thyroid nodules\nSome tumors of the testes or ovaries (rare)\nGetting medical imaging tests"}
