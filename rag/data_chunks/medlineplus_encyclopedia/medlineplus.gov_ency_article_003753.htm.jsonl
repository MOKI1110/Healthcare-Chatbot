This is done using a special series of stains.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis test requires a sample of secretions from the lining of the cervical canal (the opening to the uterus).\nYou lie on your back with your feet in stirrups. The health care provider will insert an instrument called a speculum into your vagina. This instrument is used during regular female pelvic exams. It opens the vagina to better view certain pelvic structures.\nAfter the\ncervix\nis cleaned, a dry, sterile swab is inserted through the speculum to the cervical canal and gently turned. It may be left in place for a few seconds to absorb as many germs as possible.\nThe swab is removed and sent to a laboratory, where it will be smeared on a slide. A series of stains called a Gram stain is applied to the sample. A laboratory technician looks at the stained smear under the microscope for the presence of bacteria."}

The color, size, and shape of the cells help identify the type of bacteria.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nDo not douche for 24 hours before the procedure.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel minor discomfort during specimen collection. This procedure feels very much like a routine\nPap test\n.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is used to detect and identify abnormal bacteria in the cervix area. If you develop signs of an infection or think that you have a sexually transmitted disease (such as gonorrhea), this test can help confirm the diagnosis. It can also identify the germ that is causing the infection.\nThis test is rarely done because it has been replaced with more accurate ones.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means no abnormal bacteria are seen in the sample.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal result may indicate:\nBacterial vaginosis\nChlamydia\nGonorrhea\nYeast infection\nThe test may also be performed for\ngonococcal arthritis\n, to determine the site of the initial infection.\nRisks\nThere is virtually no risk.\nConsiderations\nIf you have gonorrhea or another sexually transmitted disease, it is very important that all of your sexual partners also receive treatment, even if they have no symptoms.\nAlternative Names\nGram stain of cervix; Gram stain of cervical secretions\nImages\nGram stain\nReferences\nAbdallah M, Augenbraun MH, McCormack W.
