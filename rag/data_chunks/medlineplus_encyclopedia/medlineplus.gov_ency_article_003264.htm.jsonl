Bleeding is more common in the first 3 months (first trimester), especially with twins.\nCauses\nA small amount of light spotting or bleeding may be noted 10 to 14 days after conception. This spotting results from the fertilized egg attaching itself to the lining of the uterus. Assuming it is light and does not last very long, this finding is most often nothing to be concerned about.\nDuring the first 3 months\n, vaginal bleeding may be a sign of a miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy."}
