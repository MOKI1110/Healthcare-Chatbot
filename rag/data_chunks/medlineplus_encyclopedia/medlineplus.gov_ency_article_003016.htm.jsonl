Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMastoidectomy\nMastoidectomy\nA mastoidectomy is surgery to remove cells in the hollow, air-filled spaces in the skull behind the ear within the mastoid bone. These spaces are called mastoid air cells.\nDescription\nThis surgery used to be a common way to treat an infection in mastoid air cells. In most cases, the condition was caused by an ear infection that spread to the bone in the skull. This surgery is not often performed now.\nYou will receive general anesthesia, so you will be asleep and pain free. The surgeon will make a cut behind the ear. A bone drill will be used to gain access to the middle ear cavity that is behind the mastoid bone in the skull. The infected parts of the mastoid bone or ear tissue will be removed and the cut is stitched and covered with a bandage. The surgeon may put a drain behind the ear to prevent fluid from collecting around the incision."}
