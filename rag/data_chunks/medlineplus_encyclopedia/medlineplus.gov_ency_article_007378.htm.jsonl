Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nIleostomy\nIleostomy\nAn ileostomy is used to move waste out of the body. This surgery is done when the colon or rectum is not working properly.\nThe word \"ileostomy\" comes from the words \"ileum\" and \"stoma.\" Your ileum is the lowest part of your small intestine. \"Stoma\" means \"opening.\" To make an ileostomy, the surgeon makes an opening in your belly wall and brings the end of the ileum through the opening. The ileum is then attached to the skin.\nDescription\nBefore you have surgery to create an ileostomy, you may have surgery to remove all of your colon and rectum, or just part of your small intestine.\nThese surgeries include:\nSmall bowel resection\nTotal abdominal colectomy\nTotal proctocolectomy\nTo create the ileostomy, your surgeon makes a small surgical cut in the wall of your belly. Part of your small intestine that is farthest from your stomach is brought up and used to make an opening. This is called a stoma. When you look at your stoma, you are actually looking at the lining of your intestine. It looks a lot like the inside of your cheek."}

This is called a stoma. When you look at your stoma, you are actually looking at the lining of your intestine. It looks a lot like the inside of your cheek. An ileostomy may be used for a short or long time.\nWhen your ileostomy is temporary, it most often means all of your large intestine was removed. However, you still have at least part of your rectum. If you have surgery on part of your large intestine, your surgeon may want the remainder of your intestine to rest for a while. You will use the ileostomy while you recover from this surgery. When you do not need it anymore, you will have another surgery. This surgery will be done to reattach the ends of the small intestine. You will no longer need the ileostomy after this.\nYou will need to use an ileostomy long term if all of your\nlarge intestine\nand rectum have been removed.\nSometimes, an ileostomy is done as the first step in forming an\nileal anal reservoir\n(called a J-pouch).\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nIleostomy is done when problems with your large intestine can only be treated with surgery.\nThere are many problems that may lead to the need for this surgery."}
