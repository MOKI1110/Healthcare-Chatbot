Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) I\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type I is a disease in which one or more of the endocrine glands are overactive or forms a tumor. It is passed down through families.\nEndocrine glands most commonly involved include:\nPancreas\nParathyroid\nPituitary\nCauses\nMEN I is caused by a defect in a gene that carries the code for a protein called menin. The condition causes tumors of various glands to appear in the same person, but not necessarily at the same time.\nThe disorder may occur at any age, and it affects men and women equally. A family history of this disorder raises your risk.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms vary from person to person, and depend on which gland is involved."}

The following tests may be done:\nBlood cortisol level\nCT scan of the abdomen\nCT scan of the head\nFasting blood sugar\nGenetic testing\nInsulin test\nMRI of the abdomen\nMRI of the head"}

However, it is difficult for the body to regulate calcium levels without these glands, so a total parathyroid removal is not done first in most cases.\nMedicine is available to decrease the excess stomach acid production caused by some tumors (gastrinomas), and to reduce the risk of ulcers.\nHormone replacement therapy is given when entire glands are removed or do not produce enough hormones.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPituitary and parathyroid tumors are  usually noncancerous (\nbenign\n), but some pancreatic tumors may become cancerous (malignant) and spread to the liver. These can lower life expectancy.\nThe symptoms of\npeptic ulcer\ndisease, low blood sugar, excess calcium in the blood, and pituitary dysfunction usually respond well to appropriate treatment.\nPossible Complications\nThe tumors can keep coming back. Symptoms and complications depend on which glands are involved."}
