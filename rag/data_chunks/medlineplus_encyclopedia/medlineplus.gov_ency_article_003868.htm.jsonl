Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nElectrocardiogram\nElectrocardiogram\nAn electrocardiogram (ECG) is a test that records the electrical activity of the heart.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will be asked to lie down. A technician will clean several areas on your arms, legs, and chest, and then will attach small patches called electrodes to those areas. It may be necessary to shave or clip some hair so the patches stick to the skin. The number of patches used may vary.\nThe patches are connected by wires to a machine that turns the heart's electrical signals into wavy lines, which are often printed on paper. The health care provider reviews the test results.\nYou will need to remain still during the procedure. The technician may also ask you to hold your breath for a few seconds as the test is being done.\nIt is important to be relaxed and warm during an ECG recording because any movement, including shivering, can alter the results.\nSometimes this test is done while you are exercising or under light stress to look for changes in the heart."}

This type of ECG is often called a stress test.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nMake sure your provider knows about all the medicines you are taking. Some medicines can interfere with test results.\nDo not exercise or drink cold water immediately before an ECG because these actions may cause false results.\nHow the Test will Feel\nAn ECG is painless. No electricity is sent through the body. The electrodes may feel cold when first applied. In rare cases, some people may develop a rash or irritation where the patches were placed.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nAn ECG is used to measure:\nAny damage to your heart\nHow fast your heart is beating and whether it is beating normally\nThe effects of medicines or devices used to control your heart (such as a\npacemaker\n)\nThe size and position of your heart chambers\nAn ECG is often the first test done to determine whether a person has\nheart disease\n."}
