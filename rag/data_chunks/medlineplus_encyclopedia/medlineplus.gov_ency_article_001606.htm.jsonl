Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNeonatal conjunctivitis\nNeonatal conjunctivitis\nConjunctivitis is swelling or infection of the membrane that lines the eyelids and covers the white part of the eye.\nConjunctivitis may occur in a newborn child.\nCauses\nSwollen or inflamed eyes are most commonly caused by:\nblocked tear duct\nEye drops with antibiotics, given right after birth\nInfection by bacteria or viruses\nBacteria that normally live in a woman's vagina may be passed to the baby during childbirth. More serious eye damage may be caused by:\nGonorrhea and chlamydia: These are infections spread from sexual contact.\nThe viruses that cause genital and oral herpes: These may lead to severe eye damage. Herpes eye infections are less common than those caused by gonorrhea and chlamydia.\nThe mother may not have symptoms at the time of delivery."}

Herpes eye infections are less common than those caused by gonorrhea and chlamydia.\nThe mother may not have symptoms at the time of delivery. She still may carry bacteria or viruses that can cause this problem.\nSymptoms\nInfected newborn infants develop drainage from the eyes within 1 day to 2 weeks after birth.\nThe eyelids become puffy, red, and tender.\nThere may be watery, bloody, or thick pus-like drainage from the infant's eyes.\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform an eye exam on the baby. If the eye does not appear normal, the following tests may be done:\nCulture of the drainage from the eye to look for bacteria or viruses\nSlit-lamp exam\nto look for damage to the surface of the eyeball\nTreatment\nEye swelling that is caused by the eye drops given at birth should go away on its own.\nFor a blocked tear duct, gentle warm massage between the eye and nasal area may help. This is most often tried before starting antibiotics. Surgery may be needed if a blocked tear duct has not cleared up by the time the baby is 1 year old.\nAntibiotics are often needed for eye infections caused by bacteria."}

Eye drops and ointments may also be used. Salt water eye drops may be used to remove sticky yellow drainage.\nSpecial antiviral eye drops or ointments are used for herpes infections of the eye.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nQuick diagnosis and treatment often leads to good outcomes.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nBlindness\nInflammation of the iris (the colored part of the eye)\nScar or hole in the cornea -- the clear structure that is over the colored part of the eye\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nTalk to your provider if you have given birth (or expect to give birth) in a place where antibiotic or silver nitrate drops are not routinely placed in the infant's eyes. An example would be having an unsupervised birth at home."}

This is very important if you have or are  at risk for any sexually transmitted disease.\nPrevention\nPregnant women should get treatment for diseases spread through sexual contact to prevent newborn conjunctivitis caused by these infections.\nPutting eye drops into all infants' eyes in the delivery room right after birth can help prevent many infections. (Most states have laws requiring this treatment.)\nWhen a mother has active herpes sores at the time of delivery, a\nCesarean section\n(C-section) is recommended to prevent serious illness in the baby.\nAlternative Names\nNewborn conjunctivitis; Conjunctivitis of the newborn; Ophthalmia neonatorum; Eye infection - neonatal conjunctivitis\nReferences\nOlitsky SE, Marsh JD.
