Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAlkalosis\nAlkalosis\nAlkalosis is a condition in which the body fluids have excess base (alkali). This is the opposite of excess acid (\nacidosis\n).\nCauses\nThe kidneys and lungs maintain the proper balance (proper pH level) of chemicals called acids and bases in the body. Decreased carbon dioxide (an acid) level or increased bicarbonate (a base) level makes the body too alkaline, a condition called alkalosis. There are different types of alkalosis. These are described below.\nRespiratory alkalosis\nis caused by a low carbon dioxide level in the blood. This can be due to:\nFever\nBeing at a high altitude\nLack of oxygen\nLiver disease\nLung disease, which causes you to breathe faster (\nhyperventilate\n)\nAspirin poisoning\nMetabolic alkalosis is caused by too much bicarbonate in the blood. It can also occur due to certain kidney diseases.\nHypochloremic alkalosis is caused by an extreme lack or loss of chloride, such as from prolonged vomiting.\nHypokalemic alkalosis is caused by the kidneys' response to an extreme lack or loss of potassium."}

This can occur from taking certain water pills (diuretics).\nCompensated alkalosis occurs when the body returns the acid-base balance to near normal in cases of alkalosis, but bicarbonate and carbon dioxide levels remain abnormal.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of alkalosis can include any of the following:\nConfusion\n(can progress to stupor or coma)\nHand tremor\nLightheadedness\nMuscle twitching\nNausea, vomiting\nNumbness or tingling in the face, hands, or feet\nProlonged\nmuscle spasms\n(tetany)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.\nLaboratory tests that may be ordered include:\nArterial or venous blood gas analysis\n.\nElectrolytes test, such as\nbasic metabolic panel\nto confirm alkalosis and show whether it is respiratory or metabolic alkalosis.\nOther blood tests may be needed to determine the cause of the alkalosis.\nOther tests may be needed to determine the cause of the alkalosis."}

These may include:\nChest x-ray\nUrinalysis\nUrine pH\nTreatment\nTo treat alkalosis, your provider needs to first find the underlying cause.\nFor alkalosis caused by hyperventilation, breathing into a paper bag allows you to keep more carbon dioxide in your body, which improves the alkalosis. If your oxygen level is low, you may receive oxygen.\nMedicines may be needed to correct chemical loss (such as chloride and potassium)."}
