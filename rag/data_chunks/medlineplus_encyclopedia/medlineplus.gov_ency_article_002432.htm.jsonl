Another term for this is bioengineered foods.\nFunction\nGenetic engineering can be done with plants, animals, or bacteria and other very small organisms. With genetic engineering, scientists take the gene for a desired trait in one plant or animal, and they insert that gene into the DNA of another plant or animal. Genes can also be moved from an animal to a plant or vice versa.\nThe process to create GMOs is different than selective breeding. This involves selecting plants or animals with desired traits and breeding them. Over time, this results in offspring with those desired traits. One of the problems with selective breeding is that it can also result in traits that are not desired.\nGenetic engineering allows scientists to select one specific gene to implant. This avoids introducing other genes with undesirable traits."}

This avoids introducing other genes with undesirable traits. Genetic engineering also helps speed up the process of creating new foods with desired traits.\nGenome editing is a newer method that involves adding, removing, or changing the DNA of a plant or animal in a targeted way.\nThe possible benefits of genetic engineering include:\nMore nutritious food\nTastier food\nDisease- and drought-resistant plants that require fewer environmental resources (such as water and fertilizer)\nInsect-resistant plants that allows less use of pesticides\nIncreased supply of food with reduced cost and longer shelf life\nFaster growing plants and animals\nFood with more desirable traits, such as potatoes that produce less of a cancer-causing substance when fried\nSome people have expressed concerns about GE foods, such as:\nCreation of foods that can cause an allergic or toxic reaction\nUnexpected or harmful genetic changes\nInadvertent transfer of genes from one GM plant or animal to another plant or animal not intended for genetic modification\nFoods that are less nutritio"}

None of the GMOs used today have caused any of these problems. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) assesses all GMOs to make sure they are safe before allowing them to be sold. In addition to the FDA, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) regulate bioengineered plants and animals. They assess the safety of GMOs to humans, animals, plants, and the environment.\nFood Sources\nCotton, corn, and soybeans are the main GMO crops grown in the United States."}
