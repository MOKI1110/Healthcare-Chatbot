This condition can lead to vision loss.\nCauses\nInterstitial keratitis is a serious condition in which blood vessels grow into the cornea. Such growth can cause loss of the normal clearness of the cornea. This condition is often caused by infections.\nSyphilis is the most common cause of interstitial keratitis, but rare causes include:\nAutoimmune diseases, like\nrheumatoid arthritis\nand\nsarcoidosis\nLeprosy\nLyme disease\nTuberculosis\nIn the United States, most cases of syphilis are recognized and treated before this eye condition develops.\nHowever, interstitial keratitis accounts for 10% of avoidable blindness in the least developed countries worldwide.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nEye pain\nExcessive tearing\nSensitivity to light (\nphotophobia\n)\nExams and Tests\nInterstitial keratitis can be easily diagnosed by\nslit-lamp examination\nof the eyes."}

Blood tests and\nchest x-rays\nwill most often be needed to confirm the infection or disease that is causing the condition.\nTreatment\nThe underlying disease must be treated. Treating the cornea with corticosteroid drops may minimize scarring and help keep the cornea clear.\nOnce the active inflammation has passed, the cornea may be left severely scarred and with abnormal blood vessels. The only way to restore vision at this stage is with a cornea transplant.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nDiagnosing and treating interstitial keratitis and its cause early can preserve the clear cornea and good vision.\nPossible Complications\nA corneal transplant is not as successful for interstitial keratitis as it is for most other corneal diseases."}

The presence of blood vessels in the diseased cornea brings white blood cells to the newly transplanted cornea and increases the risk of rejection.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nPeople with interstitial keratitis need to be followed closely by an ophthalmologist and a medical specialist with knowledge of the underlying disease.\nA person with the condition should be checked immediately if:\nPain gets worse\nRedness increases\nVision decreases\nThis is particularly crucial for people with corneal transplants.\nPrevention\nPrevention consists of avoiding the infection that causes interstitial keratitis. If you do get infected, get prompt and thorough treatment and follow-up.\nAlternative Names\nKeratitis interstitial; Cornea - keratitis\nImages\nEye\nReferences\nGauthier A-S, Noureddine S, Delbosc B.
