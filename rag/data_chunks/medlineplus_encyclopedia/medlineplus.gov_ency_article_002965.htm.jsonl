However, it can add up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of length to a leg.\nThe surgery is done under general anesthesia. This means the person is asleep and pain-free during surgery.\nThe bone to be lengthened is cut.\nMetal pins or screws are placed through the skin and into the bone. Pins are placed above and below the cut in the bone. Stitches are used to close the wound.\nA metal device is attached to the pins in the bone. It will be used later to very slowly (over months) pull the cut bone apart."}

Stitches are used to close the wound.\nA metal device is attached to the pins in the bone. It will be used later to very slowly (over months) pull the cut bone apart. This widens the space between the ends of the cut bone that will fill in with new bone.\nWhen the leg has reached the desired length and has healed, another surgery is done to remove the pins.\nIn recent years, several newer techniques have been developed for this procedure. These are based on the traditional leg lengthening surgery, but may be more comfortable or convenient for some people. Ask your surgeon about the different techniques that may be appropriate for you.\nBONE RESECTION OR REMOVAL\nThis is a complex surgery that can produce a very accurate amount of change.\nWhile under general anesthesia:\nThe bone to be shortened is cut. A section of bone is removed.\nThe ends of the cut bone will be joined."}

A section of bone is removed.\nThe ends of the cut bone will be joined. A metal plate with screws or a nail down the center of the bone is placed across the bone to hold it in place during healing.\nBONE GROWTH RESTRICTION\nBone growth takes place at the growth plates (physes) at each end of\nlong bones\nin younger people who are still growing.\nThe surgeon makes a cut over the growth plate at the end of the bone in the longer leg.\nGrowth at a growth plate can be stopped by scraping or drilling it.\nAnother method is to insert staples or plates on each side of the bony growth plate. These can be removed when both legs are close to the same length.\nREMOVAL OF IMPLANTED METAL DEVICES\nMetal pins, screws, staples, or plates may be used to hold the bone in place during healing. Most orthopedic surgeons will wait several months to a year before removing any large metal implants."}

The procedure is more likely to be recommended:\nFor children whose bones are still growing\nFor people of short stature\nFor children that have abnormalities in their growth plate\nFor people that had trauma and it resulted in a shortened or lengthened limb\nLeg shortening or restricting is considered for smaller differences in leg length (usually less than 5 cm or 2 inches). Shortening a longer leg may be recommended for children whose bones are no longer growing.\nBone growth restriction is recommended for children whose bones are still growing. It is used to restrict the growth of a longer bone, while the shorter bone continues to grow to match its length. Proper timing of this treatment is important for best results.\nCertain health conditions can lead to very unequal leg lengths."}

Sometimes, a cast is placed on the leg for 3 to 4 weeks.\nMuscle weakness is common, and muscle strengthening exercises are started soon after surgery.\nCrutches are used for 6 to 8 weeks.\nSome people take 6 to 12 weeks to regain normal knee control and function.\nA metal rod placed inside the bone is removed after 1 year.\nAfter bone lengthening:\nThe person will spend a few days in the hospital.\nFrequent visits to the health care provider are needed to adjust the lengthening device. The amount of time the lengthening device is used depends on the amount of lengthening needed. Physical therapy is needed to maintain normal range of motion.\nSpecial care of the pins or screws holding the device is needed to prevent infection.\nThe amount of time it takes the bone to heal depends on the amount of lengthening."}

Each centimeter of lengthening takes 36 days of healing.\nBecause the blood vessels, muscles, and skin are involved, it is important to check the skin color, temperature, and sensation of the foot and toes frequently. This will help find any damage to blood vessels, muscles, or nerves as early as possible.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nBone growth restriction (epiphysiodesis) is most often successful when it is done at the correct time in the growth period. However, it may cause short stature.\nBone shortening may be more exact than bone restriction, but it requires a much longer recovery period.\nBone lengthening is completely successful about 4 out of 10 times. It has a much higher rate of complications and need for further surgeries. Joint contractures may occur.\nAlternative Names\nEpiphysiodesis; Epiphyseal arrest; Correction of unequal bone length; Bone lengthening; Bone shortening; Femoral lengthening; Femoral shortening\nImages\nLeg lengthening  - series\nReferences\nGoodbody CM, Davidson RS."}
