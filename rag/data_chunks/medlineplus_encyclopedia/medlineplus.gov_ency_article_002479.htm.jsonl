Surgery may be required if the esophagus, stomach, or intestines have developed holes (perforations) from exposure to the acid.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed, how concentrated the poison is, and how quickly treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\nSevere damage to the mouth, gastrointestinal tract, or airway may occur and quickly cause death if not treated. Holes (perforations) in the esophagus and stomach may cause serious infections in both the chest and abdominal cavities, which may result in death. Surgery may be needed to repair the perforations.\nReferences\nHoyte C. Caustics. In: Walls RM, ed.\nRosen's Emergency Medicine: Concepts and Clinical Practice.\n10th ed.
