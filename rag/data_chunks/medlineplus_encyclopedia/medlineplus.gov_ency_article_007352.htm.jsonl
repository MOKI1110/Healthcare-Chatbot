Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLumbar MRI scan\nLumbar MRI scan\nA lumbar magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan uses energy from strong magnets to create pictures of the lower part of the spine (lumbar spine).\nAn MRI does not use radiation (x-rays).\nSingle MRI images are called slices. The images can be stored on a computer or printed on film. One exam produces many images.\nRelated exams include:\nCervical MRI scan\n(neck MRI)\nMRI\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will wear a hospital gown or clothes without metal snaps or zippers (such as sweatpants and a t-shirt). Make sure you take off your watch, jewelry and watches. MRIs can pull on any metallic objects. Some types of metal can cause blurry images.\nYou will lie on a narrow table that slides into a large tunnel-like tube.\nSome exams require a special dye (contrast). Most of the time, you will get the dye through a vein (IV) in your hand or arm before the test. You can also get the dye through an injection."}

Most of the time, you will get the dye through a vein (IV) in your hand or arm before the test. You can also get the dye through an injection. The dye helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly.\nDuring the MRI, the person who operates the machine will watch you from another room. The test most often lasts 30 to 60 minutes, but may take longer.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan.\nTell your health care provider if you are afraid of closed spaces (have claustrophobia). You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious."}

You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious. Your provider may suggest an \"open\" MRI, in which the machine is not as close to the body.\nBefore the test, tell your provider if you have:\nBrain aneurysm clips\nCertain types of artificial heart valves\nHeart defibrillator or pacemaker\nInner ear (cochlear) implants\nKidney disease or dialysis (you may not be able to receive contrast)\nRecently placed artificial joints or surgically implanted plates and screws\nCertain types of vascular\nstents\nWorked with sheet metal in the past (you may need tests to check for metal pieces in your eyes)\nBecause the MRI contains strong magnets, metal objects are not allowed into the room with the MRI scanner:\nPens, pocketknives, and eyeglasses may fly across the room.\nItems such as jewelry, watches, credit cards, and hearing aids can be damaged.\nPins, hairpins, metal zippers, and similar metallic items can distort the images.\nRemovable dental work should be taken out just before the scan.\nHow the Test will Feel\nAn MRI exam causes no pain."}

You will need to lie still as too much movement can blur MRI images and cause errors.\nThe table may be hard or cold, but you can ask for a blanket or pillow. The machine makes loud thumping and humming noises when turned on. You can wear ear plugs to help block out the noise.\nAn intercom in the room lets you to speak to someone at any time. Some MRIs have televisions and special headphones that you can use to help the time pass.\nThere is no recovery time, unless you were given a medicine to relax."}

There have been no reported side effects from the magnetic fields and radio waves.\nIt is also safe to have MRI performed during pregnancy. No side effects or complications have been proven.\nThe most common type of contrast (dye) used is gadolinium. It is very safe. Allergic reactions to this dye are rare. However, gadolinium can be harmful to people with kidney problems that need dialysis. If you have kidney problems, please tell your provider before the test.\nThe strong magnetic fields created during an MRI can cause heart pacemakers and other implants to not work as well. It can also cause other pieces of metal inside your body to move or shift."}
