It is a lifesaving procedure that is done when a child's breathing or heartbeat has stopped. This may happen after drowning, suffocation, choking, or an injury. CPR involves:\nRescue breathing, which provides oxygen to a child's lungs\nChest compressions, which keep the child's blood circulating\nPermanent brain damage or death can occur in as little as 4 minutes if a child's blood flow stops. Therefore, you must continue CPR until the child's heartbeat and breathing return, or trained medical help arrives.\nFor the purposes of CPR, puberty is defined as breast development in females and the presence of axillary (armpit) hair in males.\nConsiderations\nCPR is best done by someone trained in an accredited CPR course."}

The newest techniques emphasize compression over rescue breathing and airway management, reversing a long-standing practice.\nAll parents and those who take care of children should learn infant and child CPR if they have not already. See\ncpr.heart.org/en/course-catalog-search\nfor classes near you.\nTime is very important when dealing with an\nunconscious\nchild who is not breathing. Permanent brain damage begins after only 4 minutes without oxygen, and death can occur as soon as 4 to 6 minutes later.\nMachines called automated external defibrillators (AEDs) can be found in many public places, and are available for home use. These machines have pads or paddles to place on the chest during a life-threatening emergency. They use computers to automatically check the heart rhythm and give a sudden shock if, and only if, that shock is needed to get the heart back into the right rhythm."}

When using an AED, follow the instructions exactly.\nThe procedures described in this article are not a substitute for CPR training.\nCauses\nThere are many things that cause a child's heartbeat and breathing to stop. Some reasons you may need to do CPR on a child include:\nChoking\nDrowning\nElectrical shock\nExcessive bleeding\nHead trauma or other serious injury\nLung disease\nPoisoning\nSuffocation\nSymptoms\nCPR should be done if the child has any of the following symptoms:\nNo breathing\nNo pulse\nUnconsciousness\nFirst Aid\n1.\nCheck for alertness\n. Tap the child gently. See if the child moves or makes a noise. Shout, \"Are you OK?\"\n2.\nIf there is no response, shout for help\n. Tell someone to call 911 or the local emergency number and get an AED if available. Do not leave the child alone until you have done CPR for about 2 minutes.\n3.\nCarefully place the child on its back\n."}

If there is a chance the child has a spinal injury, two people should move the child to prevent the head and neck from twisting.\n4.\nPerform chest compressions\n:\nPlace the heel of one hand on the breastbone -- just below the nipples. Make sure your heel is not at the very end of the breastbone. You may need to use both hands depending on your size and the size of the child.\nKeep your other hand on the child's forehead, keeping the head tilted back.\nPress down on the child's chest so that it compresses about one third to one half the depth of the chest.\nGive 30 chest compressions. Each time, let the chest rise completely. These compressions should be fast and hard with no pausing. Count the 30 compressions quickly: \"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30, off''.\nRescuers, especially those who are trained in CPR, may also perform chest compressions by the two-thumb encircling hands technique."}

To do this, encircle the infant's chest with both hands, and compress the chest with both thumbs about one third to one half the depth of the chest.\n5.\nOpen the airway\n. Lift up the chin with one hand. At the same time, tilt the head by pushing down on the forehead with the other hand.\n6.\nLook, listen, and feel for breathing\n. Place your ear close to the child's mouth and nose. Watch for chest movement. Feel for breath on your cheek.\n7.\nIf the child is not breathing\n:\nCover the child's mouth tightly with your mouth.\nPinch the nose closed.\nKeep the chin lifted and head tilted.\nGive two rescue breaths. Each breath should take about a second and make the chest rise.\n8. After about 2 minutes of CPR, if the child still does not have normal breathing, coughing, or any movement, leave the child if you are alone and\ncall 911 or the local emergency number\n. If an AED for children is available, use it now.\n9."}

Children undergoing CPR should receive two breaths after every 30 chest compressions if there is a single rescuer. They should receive the two breaths after every 15 chest compressions if there are two rescuers.\nIf the child starts breathing again, place them in the recovery position. To do this, start with the child lying on their back. Then, pull the arm closest to you so that it makes a right angle to their body with palm up. Fold their other arm and place it under their cheek closest to you. You'll have to hold it there. With your free hand, bend the person's right knee that's farthest from you to a right angle. Carefully roll the person onto their left side by pulling on the bent knee toward you. Their bent arm should be supporting the head, and their extended arm will stop you from rolling them too far. Make sure their bent leg is at a right angle."}

Do not let the mouth close.\nIf the child has signs of normal breathing, coughing, or movement, do not begin chest compressions. Doing so may cause the heart to stop beating.\nUnless you are a health professional, do not check for a pulse. Only a health care professional is properly trained to check for a pulse.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIf you have help\n, tell one person to call 911 or the local emergency number while another person begins CPR.\nIf you are alone\n, shout loudly for help and begin CPR. After doing CPR for about 2 minutes, if no help has arrived, call 911 or the local emergency number.

If you have guns in your home, keep them locked in an isolated cabinet.\nTeach your child the meaning of \"don't touch.\"\nNever underestimate what a child can do. Assume the child can move and pick up things more than you think they can. Think about what the child may get into next, and be ready. Climbing and squirming are to be expected. Always use safety straps on high chairs and strollers.\nChoose age-appropriate toys. Do not give small children toys that are heavy or fragile.
