The\nchronic\nphase of a\nsubdural hematoma\nbegins several weeks after the first bleeding.\nCauses\nA subdural hematoma develops when bridging veins tear and leak blood. These are the tiny veins that run between the dura and surface of the brain. This is usually the result of a head injury.\nA collection of blood then forms over the surface of the brain. In a chronic subdural collection, blood leaks from the veins slowly over time, or a fast hemorrhage is left to clear up on its own.\nA subdural hematoma is more common in older adults because of normal brain shrinkage that occurs with aging. This shrinkage stretches and weakens the bridging veins. These veins are more likely to break in older adults, even after a minor head injury."}

You or your family may not remember any injury that might have caused a subdural hematoma.\nRisks include:\nLong-term heavy alcohol use\nLong-term use of aspirin, anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen, or blood thinning (anticoagulant) medicine such as warfarin\nDiseases that lead to reduced blood clotting\nHead injury\nOld age\nSymptoms\nIn some cases, there may be no symptoms. However, depending on the size of the hematoma and where it presses on the brain, any of the following symptoms may occur:\nDrowsiness,\nconfusion, or coma\nDecreased memory\nProblem speaking or\nswallowing\nProblems with balance or walking\nHeadache\nSeizures\nor loss of consciousness\nWeakness or numbness of arms, legs, face\nNausea and vomiting\nVision problems\nBehavioral changes or\npsychosis\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will ask about your medical history."}

Medicines may be used to control or prevent seizures.\nSurgery may be needed. This may include drilling small holes in the skull to relieve pressure and allow blood and fluids to be drained. Large hematomas or solid\nblood clots\nmay need to be removed through a larger opening in the skull (\ncraniotomy\n).\nHematomas that do not cause symptoms may not require treatment. Chronic subdural hematomas often come back after being drained."}

Therefore, it is sometimes better to leave them alone unless they are causing symptoms.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nChronic subdural hematomas that cause symptoms usually do not heal on their own over time. They often require surgery, especially when there are neurologic problems, seizures, or chronic headaches.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nPermanent brain damage\nPersistent symptoms, such as\nanxiety\n, confusion, difficulty paying attention,\ndizziness\n, headache, and memory loss\nSeizures\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider right away if you or a family member has symptoms of chronic subdural hematoma."}
