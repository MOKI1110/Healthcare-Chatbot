The virus can cause\ncroup\n,\nbronchiolitis\n,\nbronchitis\nand certain types of\npneumonia\n.\nThe exact number of parainfluenza cases is unknown. The number is suspected to be very high. Infections are most common in fall and winter. Parainfluenza infections are most severe in infants and become less severe with age. By school age, most children have been exposed to the parainfluenza virus. Most children and adults have antibodies against parainfluenza, although they can get repeat infections.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms vary depending on the type of infection.

Certain treatments are available for the symptoms of croup and bronchiolitis to make breathing easier.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost infections in adults and older children are mild and recovery takes place without treatment, unless the person is very old or has an abnormal immune system. Medical intervention may be necessary if\nbreathing difficulties\ndevelop.\nPossible Complications\nSecondary bacterial infections are the most common complication. Airway obstruction in croup and bronchiolitis can be severe and even life threatening, especially in younger children.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nYou or your child develops croup, wheezing, or any other type of breathing difficulty.\nA child under 18 months develops any type of upper respiratory symptom.\nPrevention\nThere are no vaccines available for parainfluenza."}
