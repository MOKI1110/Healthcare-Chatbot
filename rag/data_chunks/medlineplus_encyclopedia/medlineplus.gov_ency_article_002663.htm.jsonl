All local poison control centers in the United States use this national number. You should call if you have any questions about poisoning or poison prevention. It does NOT need to be an emergency. You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\nWhat to Expect at the Emergency Room\nTake the container to the hospital with you, if possible.\nThe provider will measure and monitor the person's\nvital signs\n, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated.\nThe person may receive:\nBlood and urine test\nFluids through a vein (by IV)\nLaxative\nMedicines to treat symptoms\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well someone does depends on how much lanolin was swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.\nMedical-grade lanolin is not very poisonous. Nonmedical grade lanolin sometimes causes a minor skin rash. Lanolin is similar to wax, so eating large amounts of it can cause a blockage in the intestines. Recovery is very likely.\nAlternative Names\nWool wax poisoning; Wool alcohol poisoning; Glossylan poisoning; Golden dawn poisoning; Sparklelan poisoning\nReferences\nAronson JK."}
