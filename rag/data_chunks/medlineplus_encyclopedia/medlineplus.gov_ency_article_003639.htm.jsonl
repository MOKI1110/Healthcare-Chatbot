Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHemoglobin electrophoresis\nHemoglobin electrophoresis\nHemoglobin\nis a protein that carries oxygen in the blood. It is present inside the red blood cells. Hemoglobin electrophoresis measures the levels of the different types of this protein in the blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nIn the lab, the technician places the blood sample on special paper and applies an electric current. The hemoglobins move on the paper and form bands that show the amount of each type of hemoglobin.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou may have this test if your health care provider suspects that you have a disorder caused by abnormal forms of hemoglobin (\nhemoglobinopathy\n).\nMany different types of hemoglobin (Hb) exist."}

The most common ones are HbA, HbA2, HbE, HbF, HbS, HbC, HbH, and HbM. Healthy adults only have significant levels of HbA and HbA2.\nSome people may also have small amounts of HbF. This is the main type of hemoglobin in an unborn baby's body. Certain diseases are associated with high HbF levels (when HbF is more than 2% of the total hemoglobin).\nHbS is an abnormal form of hemoglobin associated with\nsickle cell anemia\n. In people with this condition, the red blood cells sometimes have a crescent or sickle shape. These cells easily break down or can block small blood vessels.\nHbC is an abnormal form of hemoglobin associated with excessive red blood cell destruction and\nhemolytic anemia\n."}

The symptoms are much milder than they are in sickle cell anemia.\nOther, less common, abnormal Hb molecules cause other types of\nanemia\n.\nNormal Results\nIn adults, these are normal percentages of different hemoglobin molecules:\nHbA: 95% to 98% (0.95 to 0.98)\nHbA2: 2% to 3% (0.02 to 0.03)\nHbE: Absent\nHbF: 0.8% to 2% (0.008 to 0.02)\nHbS: Absent\nHbC: Absent\nIn infants and children, these are normal percentage of HbF molecules:\nHbF (newborn): 50% to 80% (0.5 to 0.8)\nHbF (6 months): 8%\nHbF (over 6 months): 1% to 2%\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories.

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nSignificant levels of abnormal hemoglobins may indicate:\nHemoglobin C disease\nInherited blood disorder in which the body makes an abnormal amount of some hemoglobin molecules (\nthalassemia\n)\nRare hemoglobinopathy\nSickle cell anemia\nYou may have false normal or abnormal results if you have had a blood transfusion within 12 weeks of this test.\nRisks\nThere is very little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
