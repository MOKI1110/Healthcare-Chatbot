They have nearly see-through bodies with long, finger-like structures called tentacles. Stinging cells inside the tentacles can hurt you if you come in contact with them. Some stings can cause serious harm. Almost 2000 species of animals found in the ocean are either venomous or poisonous to humans, and many can produce severe illness or fatalities.\nThis article is for information only.

Sometimes called \"sea wasps,\" box jellyfish are highly dangerous, and more than 8 species have caused deaths. Box jellyfish are found in the tropics including Hawaii, Saipan, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Caribbean, and Florida, and recently in a rare event in coastal New Jersey.\nThere are also other types of stinging jellyfish.\nIf you are unfamiliar with an area, be sure to ask local ocean safety staff about the potential for jellyfish stings and other marine hazards."}

Get medical attention right away if pain increases or there are any signs of breathing difficulty or chest pains.\nAs soon as possible, rinse the sting site with large amounts of household vinegar for at least 30 seconds. Vinegar is safe and effective for all types of jellyfish stings. Vinegar rapidly halts the thousands of tiny unfired stinging cells left on the surface of the skin after tentacle contact.\nIf vinegar is not available, the sting site can be washed with ocean water.\nProtect the affected area and do NOT rub sand or apply any pressure to the area or scrape the sting site.\nSoak the area in 107 °F  to 115 °F (42 °C to 45 °C) standard tap hot water, (not scalding) for 20 to 40 minutes.\nAfter soaking in hot water, apply antihistamine or steroid creams such as cortisone cream."}
