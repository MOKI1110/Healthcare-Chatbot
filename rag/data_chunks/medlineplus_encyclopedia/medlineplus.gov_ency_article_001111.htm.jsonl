Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTruncus arteriosus\nTruncus arteriosus\nTruncus arteriosus is a rare type of heart disease in which a single blood vessel (truncus arteriosus) comes out of the right and left ventricles, instead of the normal 2 vessels (pulmonary artery and aorta). It is present at birth (\ncongenital heart disease\n).\nThere are different types of truncus arteriosus.\nCauses\nIn normal circulation, the pulmonary artery comes out of the right ventricle and the aorta comes out of the left ventricle, which are separate from each other.\nWith truncus arteriosus, a single artery comes out of the ventricles. There is most often also a large hole between the 2 ventricles (\nventricular septal defect\n). As a result, the blue (without oxygen) and red (oxygen-rich) blood mix.\nSome of this mixed blood goes to the lungs, and some goes to the rest of the body. Often, more blood than usual ends up going to the lungs.\nIf this condition is not treated, two problems occur:\nToo much blood circulation in the lungs may cause extra fluid to build up in and around them."}

This makes it hard to breathe.\nIf left untreated and more than normal blood flows to the lungs for a long time, the blood vessels to the lungs become permanently damaged. Over time, it becomes very hard for the heart to force blood through them. This is called\npulmonary hypertension\n, which can be life threatening.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nBluish color to the skin (cyanosis)\ndue to low oxygen level in the blood\nDelayed growth or growth failure\nFatigue\nLethargy\nPoor feeding\nRapid breathing (tachypnea)\nShortness of breath (dyspnea)\nWidening of the finger tips (clubbing)\nExams and Tests\nA murmur is most often heard when listening to the heart with a stethoscope.\nTests include:\nECG\nEchocardiogram\nChest x-ray\nCardiac catheterization\nMRI\nor\nCT scan\nof the heart\nTreatment\nSurgery is needed to treat this condition. The surgery creates 2 separate arteries.\nIn most cases, the truncal vessel is kept as the new aorta."}

The branch pulmonary arteries are sewn to this new artery. The hole between the ventricles is closed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nComplete repair most often provides good results. Another procedure may be needed as the child grows, because the rebuilt pulmonary artery that uses tissue from another source will not grow with the child.\nUntreated cases of truncus arteriosus result in death, often during the first year of life.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nHeart failure\nHigh blood pressure in the lungs (pulmonary hypertension)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if your infant or child:\nAppears lethargic\nAppears overly tired or mildly short of breath\nDoes not eat well\nDoes not seem to be growing or developing normally\nIf the skin, lips, or nail beds look blue or if the child seems to be very short of breath, take the child to the emergency room or h"}

Early treatment can often prevent serious complications.\nWomen who plan to become pregnant should be immunized against rubella if they are not already immune. Rubella infection in a pregnant woman can cause congenital heart disease.\nWomen who are pregnant should get good prenatal care:\nAvoid alcohol and illegal drugs during pregnancy.\nTell your provider that you are pregnant before taking any new medicines.\nHave a blood test early in your pregnancy to see if you are immune to rubella. If you are not immune, avoid any possible exposure to rubella and get vaccinated right after delivery.\nPregnant women who have diabetes should try to get good control over their blood sugar level.\nSome inherited factors may play a role in congenital heart disease. Many family members may be affected."}
