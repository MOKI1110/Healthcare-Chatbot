The defects usually occur together.\nDescription\nThe esophagus is the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. The trachea (windpipe) is the tube that carries air into and out of the lungs.\nThe defects usually occur together. They may occur along with other problems as part of a syndrome (group of problems):\nEsophageal atresia\n(EA) occurs when the upper part of the esophagus does not connect with the lower esophagus and stomach.\nTracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) is an abnormal connection between the upper part of the esophagus and the trachea or windpipe.\nThis surgery is almost always done soon after birth. Both defects can often be repaired at the same time."}

Both defects can often be repaired at the same time. Briefly, the surgery takes place this way:\nMedicine (anesthesia) is given so that the baby is in a deep sleep and pain-free during surgery.\nThe surgeon makes a cut on the side of the chest between the ribs.\nThe fistula between the esophagus and windpipe is closed.\nThe upper and lower portions of the esophagus are sewn together if possible.\nOften the two parts of the esophagus are too far apart to sew together right away. In this case:\nOnly the fistula is repaired during the first surgery.\nA gastrostomy tube (a tube that goes through the skin into the stomach) may be placed to give your child nutrition.\nYour child will have another surgery later to repair the esophagus.\nSometimes the surgeon will wait 2 to 4 months before doing the surgery. Waiting allows your baby to grow or have other problems treated. If your child's surgery is delayed:\ngastrostomy tube\n(G-tube) will be placed through the abdominal wall into the stomach."}

Waiting allows your baby to grow or have other problems treated. If your child's surgery is delayed:\ngastrostomy tube\n(G-tube) will be placed through the abdominal wall into the stomach. Numbing medicines (local anesthesia) will be used so that your baby does not feel pain.\nAt the same time the tube is placed, the surgeon may lengthen your baby's esophagus with special techniques. This will make the future surgery easier. This process may need to be repeated, sometimes several times, before repair is possible.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nTracheoesophageal fistula and esophageal atresia are life-threatening problems. They need to be treated right away. If these problems are not treated:\nYour child may breathe saliva and fluids from the stomach into the lungs. This is called\naspiration\n."}

Your baby may need feeding therapy.\nIf only the TEF is repaired, a G-tube is used for feedings until the atresia can be repaired. Your baby may also need continuous or frequent suction to clear secretions from the upper esophagus.\nWhile your baby is in the hospital, the care team will show you how to use and replace the G-tube. You may also be sent home with an extra G-tube. The hospital staff will inform a home health supply company of your equipment needs.\nHow long your infant stays in the hospital depends on the type of defect your child has and whether there are other problems in addition to the TEF and EA. You will be able to bring your baby home once they are taking feedings by mouth or gastrostomy tube, is gaining weight, and safely breathing on their own.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSurgery can usually repair a TEF and EA. Once healing from the surgery is complete, your child may have these problems:\nThe part of the esophagus that was repaired may become narrower."}

GERD may cause breathing problems.\nDuring infancy and early childhood, many children will have problems with breathing, growth, and feeding, and will need to continue seeing both their primary care provider and specialists.\nBabies with TEF and EA who also have defects of other organs, most commonly the heart, may have long-term health problems.\nAlternative Names\nTEF repair; Esophageal atresia repair\nPatient Instructions\nBringing your child to visit a very ill sibling\nSurgical wound care - open\nImages\nTracheoesophageal fistula repair - series\nReferences\nDingledein M.
