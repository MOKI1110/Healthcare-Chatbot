Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAdhesion\nAdhesion\nAdhesions are bands of scar-like tissue that form between  two surfaces inside the body and cause them to stick together.\nCauses\nWith movement of the body, internal organs such as the bowel or uterus are normally able to shift and to slide past each other. This is because these tissues and organs in the abdominal cavity have smooth, slippery surfaces. Inflammation (swelling), surgery, or injury can cause adhesions to form and prevent this movement. Adhesions can occur almost anywhere in the body, including:\nJoints, such as the shoulder\nEyes\nInside the abdomen or pelvis\nAdhesions can become larger or tighter over time. Problems may occur if the adhesions cause an organ or body part to:\nTwist\nPull out of position\nBe unable to move normally\nThe risk of forming adhesions is high after bowel or female organ surgeries."}

Surgery using a laparoscope is less likely to cause adhesions than open surgery.\nOther causes of adhesions in the abdomen or pelvis include:\nAppendicitis\n, most often when the appendix breaks open (ruptures)\nCancer\nEndometriosis\nInfections in the abdomen and pelvis, such as appendicitis or fallopian tube infection\nRadiation treatment\nAdhesions around the joints may occur:\nAfter surgery or trauma\nWith certain types of arthritis\nWith overuse of a joint or tendon\nSymptoms\nAdhesions in joints, tendons, or ligaments make it harder to move the joint. They may also cause pain.\nAdhesions in the belly (abdomen) may cause a\nblockage of the intestines\n."}
