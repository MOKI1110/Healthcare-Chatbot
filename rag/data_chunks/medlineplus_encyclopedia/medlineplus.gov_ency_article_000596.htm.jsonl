The disease affects small mammals, mainly rodents, and humans.\nCauses\nPlague is caused by the bacteria\nYersinia pestis\n. Rodents, such as rats, carry the disease, which is spread by fleas.\nIn the Middle Ages in Europe, massive plague epidemics killed millions of people. These days, plague occurs sporadically but can be treated and usually cured if caught early. Plague can still be found on nearly all continents. Most human cases have occurred in Africa.\nToday, plague is rare in the United States. An average of about 7 cases occur every year. Plague was introduced in the 1900s by rats aboard steamships. It caused epidemics in many urban areas up until 1925. The disease spread to the rural rodent population in the Western United States."}

Plague was introduced in the 1900s by rats aboard steamships. It caused epidemics in many urban areas up until 1925. The disease spread to the rural rodent population in the Western United States. Now most cases of plague occur in rural areas primarily in these states:\nNorthern New Mexico and Arizona, and southern Colorado\nCalifornia, southern Oregon, and western Nevada\n\\\nWild animals affected by plague include:\nSquirrels\nRats\nPrairie dogs\nChipmunks\nMice\nVoles\nRabbits\nMarmots\nAnimals that eat other animals can get the disease by eating infected prey. Domestic animals, such as dogs and cats can contract plague if they are bitten by fleas that carry the disease or eat small rodents such as mice.\nPeople can get plague in the following ways:\nBeing bitten by a flea\nthat carries the plague bacteria from an infected animal. Dogs and cats can also carry infected fleas into the home and spread the disease.\nHandling an infected animal\nand coming into contact with body fluid or tissue.   For example, hunters who skin and prepare an infected animal could become infected.\nBreathing in respiratory droplets\nfrom an infected human or animal. Plague lung infection is called pneumonic plague."}

Plague lung infection is called pneumonic plague. When someone with pneumonic plague coughs, tiny droplets carrying the bacteria move through the air. Anyone who breathes in these particles may catch the disease. In the United States, there have been cases of owners becoming infected by their sick cat through respiratory droplets.\nSymptoms\nThere are three types of plague: bubonic, septicemic, and pneumonic.\nBubonic plague is an infection of the lymph nodes. It is the most common type of plague in the United States. Flea bites are usually the cause. Bubonic plague symptoms appear suddenly, usually 2 to 8 days after exposure to the bacteria. Symptoms include:\nFever and chills\nGeneral ill feeling (\nmalaise\n)\nHeadache\nMuscle pain\nSeizures\nSmooth, painful lymph gland swelling called\nbuboes\nthat are commonly found in the groin, but may occur in the armpits or neck, most often at the site of the infection (flea bite or animal scratch). Pain may start before the swelling appears\nSepticemic plague is an infection of the blood."}

It can also occur from untreated bubonic plague. Septicemic plague may cause death even before severe symptoms occur. Symptoms can include:\nAbdominal pain\nBleeding due to blood clotting problems\nDiarrhea\nFever\nNausea, vomiting\nExtreme weakness\nShock\nBleeding into the skin and organs\nTissue death (skin turns black and dies) on fingers, toes, and nose.\nPneumonic plague is an infection of the lungs. This is the most serious form and is what can cause epidemics to occur. It can occur from inhaling respiratory droplets from an infected human or animal (cat). It is the only type that spreads between humans. Untreated bubonic or septicemic plague can also develop into pneumonic plague when bacteria spread to the lungs.\nPneumonic plague symptoms appear suddenly, typically 1 to 3 days after exposure."}

People with plague need to be treated right away.  Treatment should be given if plague is suspected, even before test results come back. If treatment is not received within 24 hours of when the first symptoms occur, the risk for death increases.\nAntibiotics used to treat plague include:\nCiprofloxacin\nDoxycycline\nGentamicin\nLevofloxacin\nMoxifloxacin\nStreptomycin\nOxygen,\nintravenous\nfluids, and\nrespiratory\nsupport are usually also needed.\nPeople with pneumonic plague must be kept away from other patients and isolation procedures will be followed in the hospital. People who have had close contact with anyone infected by pneumonic plague should be given antibiotics as a preventive measure and watched carefully.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nBefore antibiotics, 60% of people with plague in the United States died. Now that plague can be treated with antibiotics, overall mortality is 11%. Almost everyone with septicemic or pneumonic plague dies if not treated right away.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop plague symptoms after exposure to fleas or rodents."}
