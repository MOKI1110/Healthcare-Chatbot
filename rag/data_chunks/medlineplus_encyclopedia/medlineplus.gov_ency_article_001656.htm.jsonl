In about 50% of cases, it is passed down through families (inherited).\nCauses\nNoonan syndrome is linked to variants in several genes. In general, certain proteins involved in growth and development become overactive as a result of these gene changes.\nNoonan syndrome is an\nautosomal dominant\ncondition. This means only one parent has to pass down the variant gene for the child to have the syndrome."}

This means only one parent has to pass down the variant gene for the child to have the syndrome. However, some cases may not be inherited and instead happen by chance (spontaneously).\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nDelayed puberty\nDown-slanting or widely-spaced eyes\nHearing loss\n(varies)\nLow-set or abnormally shaped ears\nMild intellectual disability (only in about 25% of cases)\nSagging eyelids (\nptosis\n)\nShort stature\nSmall penis\nUndescended testicles\nUnusual chest shape (most often a sunken chest called pectus excavatum)\nWebbed and short-appearing neck\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may show signs of heart problems the infant had from birth. These may include\npulmonary stenosis\nand\natrial septal defect\n.\nTests depend on the symptoms, but may include:\nPlatelet count\nBlood clotting factor test\nECG\n,\nchest x-ray\n, or\nechocardiogram\n(ECHO)\nHearing tests\nGrowth hormone levels\nRenal ultrasound\nGenetic testing can help diagnose this syndrome.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment."}

Growth hormone has been used successfully to treat short height in some people with Noonan syndrome.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with Noonan syndrome and their families can be found at --\nwww.teamnoonan.org\n, and\nwww.rasopathiesnet.org\n.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nAbnormal bleeding or bruising\nBuildup of fluid in tissues of body (lymphedema,\ncystic hygroma\n)\nFailure to thrive in infants\nLeukemia\nand other cancers\nLow self-esteem\nInfertility in males if both testes are undescended\nProblems with the structure and function of the heart\nShort height\nSocial problems due to physical symptoms\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nThis condition may be found during early infant exams."}
