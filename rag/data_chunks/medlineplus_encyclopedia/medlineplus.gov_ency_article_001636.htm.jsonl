The pain can last from a few seconds to a few minutes.\nCauses\nGPN is believed to be caused by irritation of the ninth cranial nerve, called the glossopharyngeal nerve. Symptoms usually begin in people over age 50.\nIn most cases, the source of irritation is never found. Possible causes for this type of nerve pain (neuralgia) are:\nBlood vessels pressing on the glossopharyngeal nerve\nGrowths at the base of the skull pressing on the glossopharyngeal nerve\nTumors\nor infections of the throat and mouth pressing on the glossopharyngeal nerve\nSymptoms\nThe pain usually occurs on one side of the head and may be jabbing. In rare cases, both sides are involved."}

In rare cases, both sides are involved. Symptoms include severe pain in areas connected to the ninth cranial nerve:\nBack of the nose and throat (nasopharynx)\nBack of the tongue\nEar\nThroat\nTonsil area\nVoice box (larynx)\nThe pain occurs in episodes and may be severe. The episodes can occur many times each day and awaken the person from sleep. It can sometimes be triggered by:\nChewing\nCoughing\nLaughing\nSpeaking\nSwallowing\nYawning\nSneezing\nCold beverages\nTouching (a blunt object to the tonsil of the affected side)\nExams and Tests\nTests will be done to identify problems, such as tumors, at the base of the skull."}

Tests may include:\nBlood tests to rule out any infection or tumor\nCT scan of the head\nMRI of the head\nX-rays of the head\nor neck\nSometimes the MRI may show swelling (inflammation) of the glossopharyngeal nerve.\nTo find out whether a blood vessel is pressing on the nerve, pictures of the brain arteries may be taken using:\nMagnetic resonance angiography\n(MRA)\nCT angiogram\nX-rays of the arteries with a dye (conventional angiography)\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to control pain. The most effective medicines are antiseizure medicines such as carbamazepine. Antidepressants may help certain people.\nIn severe cases, when pain is difficult to treat, surgery to take pressure off the glossopharyngeal nerve may be needed. This is called microvascular decompression. The nerve can also be cut (rhizotomy). Both surgeries are effective."}

If a cause of the neuralgia is found, treatment should control the underlying problem.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well you do depends on the cause of the problem and the effectiveness of the first treatment. Surgery is considered effective for people who do not benefit from medicines.\nPossible Complications\nComplications of GPN may include:\nSlow pulse and fainting may occur when pain is severe\nDamage to the carotid artery or internal jugular vein due to injuries, such as a stab wound, that may be associated with GPN\nDifficulty in swallowing food and speaking\nSide effects of the medicines used\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nSee your health care provider right away if you have symptoms of GPN.\nSee a pain specialist if the pain is severe, to be sure that you are aware of all your options for controlling pain.\nAlternative Names\nCranial mononeuropathy IX; Weisenberg syndrome; GPN\nImages\nGlossopharyngeal neuralgia\nReferences\nDigre KB.
