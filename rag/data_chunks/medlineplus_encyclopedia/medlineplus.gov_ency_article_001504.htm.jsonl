Functional cysts are not the same as\ncysts caused by cancer\nor other diseases. The formation of these cysts is a perfectly normal event and is a sign that the ovaries are working well.\nCauses\nEach month during your menstrual cycle, a follicle (cyst) grows on your ovary. The follicle is where an egg is developing.\nThe follicle makes the estrogen hormone. This hormone causes normal changes of the uterine lining as the uterus prepares for pregnancy.\nWhen the egg matures, it is released from the follicle. This is called ovulation.\nIf the follicle fails to break open and release an egg, the fluid stays in the follicle and forms a\ncyst\n. This is called a follicular cyst.\nAnother type of cyst occurs after an egg has been released from a follicle. This is called a corpus luteum cyst. This type of cyst may contain a small amount of blood."}

The condition is less common after menopause.\nTaking fertility medicines often causes the development of multiple follicles (cysts) in the ovaries. These cysts most often go away after a woman's period, or after a pregnancy.\nFunctional ovarian cysts are not the same as ovarian tumors or cysts due to hormone-related conditions such as\npolycystic ovary syndrome\n.\nSymptoms\nOvarian cysts often cause no symptoms.\nAn ovarian cyst is more likely to cause pain if it:\nBecomes large\nBleeds\nBreaks open\nInterferes with the blood supply to the ovary\nIs twisted or causes twisting (torsion) of the ovary\nSymptoms of ovarian cysts can also include:\nBloating or swelling in the abdomen\nPain during bowel movements\nPain in the pelvis shortly before or after beginning a menstrual period\nPain with intercourse or pelvic pain during movement\nPelvic pain -- constant, dull a"}

These are more common with corpus luteum cysts. Spotting or bleeding may occur with some cysts.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider may find a cyst during a pelvic exam, or when you have an ultrasound test for another reason.\nUltrasound may be done to detect a cyst. Your provider may want to check you again in 6 to 8 weeks to make sure it is gone.\nOther imaging tests that may be done when needed include:\nCT scan\nDoppler flow studies\nMRI\nThe following blood tests may be done:\nCA-125 test\n, to help establish a level of concern regarding the cyst if you have an abnormal ultrasound or are in menopause."}

They often go away on their own within 8 to 12 weeks.\nIf you have frequent ovarian cysts, your provider may prescribe birth control pills (oral contraceptives). These pills may reduce the risk of developing new cysts. Birth control pills do not decrease the size of current cysts.\nYou may need surgery to remove the cyst or ovary to make sure that it is not ovarian cancer."}

A complex cyst in a woman who is past menopause has a higher risk of being cancer. Cancer is very unlikely with a simple cyst.\nPossible Complications\nComplications have to do with the condition causing the cysts. Complications can occur with cysts that:\nBleed.\nBreak open.\nShow signs of changes that could be cancer.\nTwist, depending on size of the cyst."}

Bigger cysts carry a higher risk.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nYou have symptoms of an ovarian cyst\nYou have severe pain\nYou have bleeding that is not normal for you\nAlso contact your provider if you have had following on most days for at least 2 weeks:\nGetting full quickly when eating\nLosing your appetite\nLosing weight without trying\nThese symptoms may indicate ovarian cancer. Studies which encourage women to seek care for possible ovarian cancer symptoms have not shown any benefit. Unfortunately, there is no proven effective means of screening for ovarian cancer.\nPrevention\nIf you are not trying to get pregnant and you often get functional cysts, you can prevent them by taking birth control pills. These pills prevent follicles from growing.\nAlternative Names\nPhysiologic ovarian cysts; Functional ovarian cysts; Corpus luteum cysts; Follicular cysts\nImages\nFemale reproductive anatomy\nOvarian cysts\nUterus\nReferences\nBrown DL, Wall DJ."}
