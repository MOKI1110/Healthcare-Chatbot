Typically, they are low- or no-risk treatments. If you use an alternative treatment along with conventional medicine or therapy, it is considered complementary therapy.\nInformation\nThere are many forms of alternative medicine for pain relief. They include acupuncture, chiropractic, herbal medicine, massage, magnetic waves, hypnosis, biofeedback, meditation, yoga, and tai-chi.\nAcupuncture involves stimulating certain acupoints on the body using fine needles or other methods. How acupuncture works is not entirely clear. It is thought that acupoints lie near nerve fibers. When acupoints are stimulated, the nerve fibers signal the spinal cord and brain to release chemicals that relieve pain.\nAcupuncture is an effective means of relieving pain, such as for back pain and\nheadache\npain."}
