The\nGram stain method\nis one of the most commonly used ways to quickly diagnose bacterial infections.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA sample of joint fluid is needed. This may be done in your health care provider's office using a needle, or during an operating room procedure. Removing the sample is called\njoint fluid aspiration\n.\nThe fluid sample is sent to a lab where a drop of fluid is spread in a very thin layer onto a microscope slide. This is called a smear. Several different colored stains are applied to the sample. The lab team member will look at the stained smear under a microscope to see if bacteria are present. The color, size, and shape of the cells help identify the bacteria.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider will tell you how to prepare for the procedure. No special preparation is needed."}

The color, size, and shape of the cells help identify the bacteria.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider will tell you how to prepare for the procedure. No special preparation is needed. But, tell your provider if you're taking a blood thinner, such as aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin) or clopidogrel (Plavix). These medicines can affect test results or your ability to take the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nSometimes, your provider will first inject numbing medicine into the skin with a small needle, which may sting. A larger needle is then used to draw out the synovial fluid.\nThis test may also cause some discomfort if the tip of the needle touches bone. The procedure usually lasts less than 1 to 2 minutes.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is performed when there is unexplained swelling,\njoint pain\n, and inflammation of a joint, or to check for suspected joint infection.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means no bacteria are present on the Gram stain. Other tests may be done to help diagnose the problem.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results mean bacteria were seen on the Gram stain."}
