RSV is a common respiratory virus that usually causes mild, cold-like symptoms.\nRSV can cause illness in people of all ages but may be especially serious for infants and older adults.\nRSV is the most common cause of hospitalization in U.S. infants. Infants up to 12 months of age (especially those 6 months and younger) and children who were born prematurely, or who have chronic lung or heart disease, or a weakened immune system, are at increased risk of severe RSV disease.\nRSV infections can be dangerous for certain adults."}

Adults at highest risk for severe RSV disease include older adults, especially those with chronic heart or lung disease, a weakened immune system, certain other chronic medical conditions, or who live in nursing homes.\nRSV spreads through direct contact with the virus, such as when droplets from an infected person's cough or sneeze contact your eyes, nose, or mouth. It can also be spread by someone touching a surface, such as a doorknob, that has the virus on it, and then touching your face.\nSymptoms of RSV infection may include runny nose, decreased appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever, or wheezing. In very young infants, symptoms of RSV may also include irritability (fussiness), decreased activity, or apnea (pauses in breathing for more than 10 seconds).\nMost people recover in a week or two, but RSV can be more serious, resulting in shortness of breath and low oxygen levels."}

RSV can cause bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lung) and pneumonia (infection of the lungs). RSV can also lead to worsening of other medical conditions such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (a chronic disease of the lungs that makes it hard to breathe), or heart failure (when the heart cannot pump enough blood and oxygen throughout the body).\nInfants and older adults who get very sick from RSV may need to be hospitalized. Some may even die.\nRSV vaccine\nThere are two immunization options available for protecting infants against RSV: maternal vaccine for the pregnant woman or preventive antibodies given to the baby. Only one of these options is needed for most babies to be protected.\nCDC recommends a one-time dose of RSV vaccine for\npregnant women from week 32 through week 36 of pregnancy\nfor the prevention of RSV disease in their infants during the first 6 months of life."}
