Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFolate-deficiency anemia\nFolate-deficiency anemia\nFolate-deficiency anemia is a decrease in red blood cells (\nanemia\n) due to a lack of folate. Folate is a type of B vitamin. It is also called folic acid.\nAnemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues.\nCauses\nFolate (folic acid) is needed for red blood cells to form and grow. You can get folate by eating green leafy vegetables and liver. However, your body does not store folate in large amounts. So, you need to eat plenty of folate-rich foods to maintain normal levels of this vitamin.\nIn\nfolate-deficiency\nanemia, the red blood cells are abnormally large. Such cells are called macrocytes. They are also called megaloblasts, when they are seen in the bone marrow."}

Such cells are called macrocytes. They are also called megaloblasts, when they are seen in the bone marrow. That is why this anemia is also called a type of megaloblastic anemia.\nCauses of this type of anemia include:\nToo little folic acid in your diet\nHemolytic anemia\nLong-term\nalcoholism\nUse of certain medicines (such as phenytoin [Dilantin], methotrexate, sulfasalazine, triamterene, pyrimethamine, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and barbiturates)\nThe following raise your risk for this type of anemia:\nAlcoholism\nEating overcooked food\nPoor diet (often seen in the poor, the older people, and people who do not eat fresh fruits or vegetables)\nPregnancy\nWeight loss diets\nFolic acid is needed to help a baby in the womb grow properly. Too little\nfolic acid during pregnancy\nmay lead to birth defects in a baby.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nFatigue\nWeakness\nHeadache\nPallor\nSore mouth and tongue\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

If you have low folate levels because of a problem with your intestines, you may need treatment for the rest of your life.\nDiet changes can help boost your folate level. Eat more green, leafy vegetables and citrus fruits.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nFolate-deficiency anemia most often responds well to treatment within 3 to 6 months. It will likely get better when the underlying cause of the deficiency is treated.\nPossible Complications\nSymptoms of anemia can cause discomfort."}

In pregnant women, folate deficiency has been associated with neural tube or spinal defects (such as\nspina bifida\n) in the infant.\nOther more severe complications may include:\nCurly graying hair\nIncreased skin color (pigment)\nInfertility\nWorsening of heart disease or\nheart failure\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of folate deficiency anemia.\nPrevention\nEating plenty of folate-rich foods can help prevent this condition.\nExperts recommend that women take 400 to 800 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid every day before they get pregnant and through the first 3 months of their pregnancy.\nImages\nMegaloblastic anemia - view of red blood cells\nBlood cells\nReferences\nAntony AC.
