Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPulmonary embolus\nPulmonary embolus\nA pulmonary embolus is a blockage of an artery in the lungs. The most common cause of the blockage is a\nblood clot\n.\nCauses\nA pulmonary embolus is most often caused by a blood clot that develops in a vein outside the lungs. The most common blood clot is one in a deep vein of the thigh or in the pelvis (hip area). This type of clot is called a\ndeep vein thrombosis (DVT)\n. The blood clot breaks off and travels to the lungs where it lodges.\nLess common causes of a pulmonary embolus include air bubbles, fat droplets, amniotic fluid, or clumps of parasites or tumor cells.\nYou are more likely to get a pulmonary embolus if you or your family has a history of blood clots or certain clotting disorders."}

Wear them as instructed. They will improve blood flow in your legs and reduce your risk for blood clots.\nMoving your legs often during long plane trips, car trips, and other situations in which you are sitting or lying down for long periods can also help prevent DVT."}
