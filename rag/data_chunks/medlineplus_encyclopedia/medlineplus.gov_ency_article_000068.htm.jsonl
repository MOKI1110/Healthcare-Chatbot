Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHistiocytosis\nHistiocytosis\nHistiocytosis is a general name for a group of disorders or \"syndromes\" that involve an abnormal increase in the number of specialized white blood cells that are called\nhistiocytes\n.\nRecently, new knowledge about this family of diseases has led experts to develop a new classification. Five categories have been proposed:\nL group -- includes Langerhans cell histiocytosis and Erdheim-Chester disease\nC group -- includes non-Langerhans cell histiocytosis that involves the skin\nM group -- includes malignant histiocytosis\nR group -- includes Rosai-Dorfman disease\nH Group -- includes hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis\nThis article focuses only on the L group, which includes Langerhans cell histiocytosis and Erdheim-Chester disease.\nCauses\nThere has been debate as to whether Langerhans cell histiocytosis and Erdheim-Chester disease are inflammatory, immune disorders, or cancer-like conditions."}

Recently, through the use of genomics scientists have found that these forms of histiocytosis show gene changes (mutations) in early white blood cells. This leads to abnormal behavior in the cells. The abnormal cells then increase in various parts of body including the bones, skin, lungs, and other areas.\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis is a rare disorder that can affect people of all ages. The highest rate is among children ages 5 to 10. Some forms of the disorder are genetic, which means they are inherited.\nErdheim-Chester disease is a rare form of histiocytosis affecting mainly adults that involves multiple parts of the body.\nSymptoms\nBoth Langerhans cell histiocytosis and Erdheim-Chester disease can affect the whole body (systemic disorder).\nSymptoms can vary between children and adults, but they may have some of the same symptoms."}

Recent studies show that nearly all adults with widespread histiocytosis have gene mutations in the tumors, which appear to cause the disorder. Medicines that inhibit these gene mutations, such as vemurafenib are currently available. Other similar medicines are also in development.\nLangerhans cell histiocytosis and Erdheim-Chester disease are very rare disorders.
