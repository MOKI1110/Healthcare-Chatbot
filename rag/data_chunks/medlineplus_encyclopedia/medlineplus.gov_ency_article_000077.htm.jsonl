It may spread to other organs.\nCauses\nPulmonary TB is caused by the bacterium\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (M tuberculosis)\n. TB is contagious. This means the bacteria may spread from an infected person to someone else. You can get TB by breathing in air droplets from a cough or sneeze of an infected person. The resulting lung infection is called primary TB.\nMost people recover from a primary TB infection without further evidence of the disease. The infection may stay inactive (dormant) for years. In some people, it becomes active again (reactivates).\nMost people who develop symptoms of a TB infection first became infected in the past."}

Active pulmonary TB is treated with a combination of many medicines (usually 4 medicines). The person takes the medicines until lab tests show which medicines work best.\nYou may need to take many different pills at different times of the day for 6 months or longer. It is very important that you take the pills the way your provider instructed.\nWhen people do not take their TB medicines like they are supposed to, the infection can become much more difficult to treat. The TB bacteria can become resistant to treatment. This means the medicines no longer work.\nIf a person is not taking all the medicines as directed, a nurse or public health worker may need to watch the person take the prescribed medicines. This approach is called directly observed therapy."}

In this case, medicines may be given 2 or 3 times a week.\nYou may need to stay at home or be admitted to a hospital for 2 to 4 weeks to avoid spreading the disease to others until you are no longer contagious.\nYour provider is required by law to report your TB illness to the local health department. Your health care team will ensure that you receive the best care.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\nsupport group\n. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you feel more in control.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSymptoms often improve in 2 to 3 weeks after starting treatment. A chest x-ray will not show this improvement until weeks or months later. The outlook is excellent if pulmonary TB is diagnosed early and effective treatment is started quickly.\nPossible Complications\nPulmonary TB can cause permanent lung damage if not treated early."}

Skin testing for TB is used in high-risk populations or in people who may have been exposed to TB, such as health care workers.\nPeople who have been exposed to TB should have a skin test as soon as possible and have a follow-up test at a later date, if the first test is negative.\nA positive skin test means you have come into contact with the TB bacteria."}

It does not mean that you have active TB or are contagious. Talk to your provider about how to prevent developing active TB.\nPrompt treatment is very important in preventing the spread of TB from those who have active TB to those who have never been infected with TB.\nSome countries with a high incidence of TB give people a vaccine called BCG to prevent TB. But, the effectiveness of this vaccine is limited and it is not used in the United States for the prevention of TB.\nPeople who have had BCG may still be skin-tested for TB."}
