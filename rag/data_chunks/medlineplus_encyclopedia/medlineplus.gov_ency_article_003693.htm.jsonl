Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCortisol blood test\nCortisol blood test\nThe cortisol blood test measures the level of cortisol in the blood. Cortisol is a steroid (glucocorticoid or corticosteroid) hormone produced by the\nadrenal gland\n.\nCortisol can also be measured using a\nurine\nor saliva test.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample is needed\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour health care provider will likely have you do the test early in the morning. This is important because cortisol level varies throughout the day.\nYou may be asked not to do any vigorous exercise the day before the test.\nYou may also be told to temporarily stop taking medicines that can affect the test, including:\nAnti-seizure medicines\nEstrogen\nHuman-made (synthetic) glucocorticoids, such as hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone\nAndrogens\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is done to check for increased or decreased cortisol production. Cortisol is a glucocorticoid (steroid) hormone released from the adrenal gland in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). ACTH is a hormone released from the pituitary gland in the brain.\nCortisol affects many different body systems. It plays a role in:\nBone growth\nBlood pressure control\nImmune system function\nMetabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and protein\nNervous system function\nStress response\nDifferent diseases, such as\nCushing syndrome\nand\nAddison disease\n, can lead to either too much or too little production of cortisol. Measuring blood cortisol level can help diagnose these conditions. It is also measured to evaluate how well the pituitary and adrenal glands are working.\nThe test is often done before and 1 hour after injection of a medicine called ACTH (cosyntropin). This part of the test is called an\nACTH stimulation test\n."}

It is an important test that helps check the function of the pituitary and adrenal glands.\nThe test is often done in the morning after taking 1 milligram (mg) of dexamethasone the night before the test.\nOther conditions for which the test may be ordered include:\nAcute adrenal crisis\n, a life-threatening condition that occurs when there is not enough cortisol\nSepsis\n, an illness in which the body has a severe response to bacteria or other germs\nLow blood pressure\nNormal Results\nNormal values for a blood sample taken at 8 in the morning are 5 to 25 mcg/dL or 140 to 690 nmol/L.\nNormal values depend on the time of day and the clinical context. Normal ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens."}
