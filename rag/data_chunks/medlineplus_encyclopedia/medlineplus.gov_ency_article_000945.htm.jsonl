Most people feel this way once in a while.\nMajor depression is a mood disorder. It occurs when feelings of sadness, loss, anger, or frustration get in the way of your life over a long period of time. It also changes how your body works.\nCauses\nHealth care providers do not know the exact causes of depression. It is believed that chemical changes in the brain are responsible. This may be due to how your genes work. Or it may be triggered by certain stressful events. More likely, it is a combination of both.\nSome types of depression run in families. Other types occur even if you have no family history of the illness."}
