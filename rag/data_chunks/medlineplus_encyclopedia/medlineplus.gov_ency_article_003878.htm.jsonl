These patches are attached to an ECG monitor that follows the electrical activity of your heart during the test.\nYou will walk on a treadmill or pedal on an exercise bicycle. Slowly (about every 3 minutes), you will be asked to walk (or pedal) faster and on an incline or with more resistance. It is like walking fast or jogging up a hill.\nWhile you exercise, the activity of your heart is measured with an electrocardiogram (ECG)."}

The total time of the test is around 60 minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nWear comfortable shoes and loose clothing to allow you to exercise.\nAsk your provider if you should take any of your regular medicines on the day of the test. Some medicines may interfere with test results."}

Some medicines may interfere with test results. Never stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.\nTell your provider if you are taking sildenafil citrate (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), or vardenafil (Levitra) and have taken a dose within the past 24 to 48 hours.\nYou must not eat, smoke, or drink beverages containing caffeine or alcohol for 3 hours (or more) before the test. In most cases, you will be asked to avoid caffeine or caffeine-like substances for 24 hours before the test. This includes:\nTea and coffee\nAll sodas, even ones that are labeled caffeine-free\nChocolates\nCertain pain relievers that contain caffeine\nHow the Test will Feel\nElectrodes (conductive patches) will be placed on your chest to record the heart's activity. The preparation of the electrode sites on your chest may produce a mild burning or stinging sensation.\nThe blood pressure cuff on your arm will be inflated every few minutes. This produces a squeezing sensation that may feel tight."}
