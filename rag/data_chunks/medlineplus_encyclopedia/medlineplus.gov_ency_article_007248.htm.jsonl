This article addresses urinary catheters in babies. A catheter may be inserted and removed right away, or it may be left in place.\nInformation\nWHY IS A URINARY CATHETER USED?\nBabies may need urinary catheters while in the hospital if they are not making much urine. This is called low urine output. Babies can have low urine output because they:\nHave low blood pressure\nHave problems with their urinary system\nAre given medicines that will not allow them to move their muscles\nAre recovering from surgery or severe illness\nWhen your baby has a catheter, health care providers can measure how much urine is coming out. They can figure out how much fluid your baby needs.\nA baby may have a catheter inserted in a sterile fashion and then removed right away to help diagnose an infection in the bladders or kidneys.\nHOW IS A URINARY CATHETER PLACED?\nA provider puts the catheter into the urethra and up into the bladder."}

The urethra is an opening at the tip of the penis in boys and near the vagina in girls. The provider will:\nClean the tip of the penis or the area around the vagina.\nGently put the catheter into the bladder.\nThe catheter is usually taped into place.\nThe catheter is connected to a bag for the urine to go into.\nThis bag is emptied into a measuring cup to see how much urine your baby is making.\nWHAT ARE THE RISKS OF A URINARY CATHETER?\nThere is a small risk for injury to the urethra or the bladder when the catheter is inserted. Urinary catheters that are left in place for more than a few days increase the risk for a bladder or kidney infection.\nAlternative Names\nBladder catheter - infants; Foley catheter - infants; Urinary catheter - neonatal\nReferences\nJames RE, Fowler GC.
