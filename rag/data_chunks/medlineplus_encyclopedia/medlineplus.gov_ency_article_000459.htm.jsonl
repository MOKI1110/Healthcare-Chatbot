Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nReflux nephropathy\nReflux nephropathy\nReflux nephropathy is a condition in which the kidneys are damaged by the backward flow of urine into the kidney.\nCauses\nUrine flows from each kidney through tubes called ureters and into the bladder. When the bladder is full, it squeezes and sends the urine out through the urethra. No urine should flow back into the ureter when the bladder is squeezing. Each ureter has a one-way valve where it enters the bladder that prevents urine from flowing back up the ureter.\nBut in some people, urine flows back up to the kidney. This is called vesicoureteral reflux.\nOver time, the kidneys may be damaged or scarred by this reflux. This is called reflux nephropathy.\nReflux can occur in people whose ureters do not attach properly to the bladder or whose valves do not work well."}

Children may be born with this problem or may have other birth defects of the urinary system that cause reflux nephropathy.\nReflux nephropathy can occur with other conditions that lead to a blockage of urine flow, including:\nBladder outlet obstruction\n, such as an enlarged prostate in men\nBladder stones\nNeurogenic bladder\n, which can occur in people with multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury, diabetes, or other nervous system (neurological) conditions\nReflux nephropathy can also occur from swelling of the ureters after a kidney transplant or from injury to the ureter.\nRisk factors for reflux nephropathy include:\nAbnormalities of the urinary tract\nPersonal or family history of vesicoureteral reflux\nRepeat urinary tract infections\nSymptoms\nSome people have no symptoms of reflux nephropathy."}

If vesicoureteral reflux is discovered, the child's siblings may also be checked, because reflux can run in families.\nBlood pressure may be high, and there may be signs and symptoms of long-term (chronic) kidney disease.\nBlood and urine tests will be done, and may include:\nBUN\n-- blood\nCreatinine\n-- blood\nCreatinine clearance\n-- urine and blood\nUrinalysis\nor 24-hour urine studies\nUrine culture\nImaging tests that may be done include:\nAbdominal CT scan\nBladder ultrasound\nIntravenous pyelogram\n(IVP)\nKidney ultrasound\nRadionuclide cystogram\nRetrograde pyelogram\nVoiding cystourethrogram\nTreatment\nVesicoureteral reflux is separated into five different grades."}

Simple or mild reflux often falls into grade I or II. The severity of the reflux and amount of damage to the kidney help determine treatment.\nSimple, uncomplicated vesicoureteral reflux (called primary reflux) can be treated with:\nAntibiotics taken every day to prevent urinary tract infections\nCareful monitoring of kidney function\nRepeated urine cultures\nYearly\nultrasound\nof the kidneys\nControlling blood pressure is the most important way to slow kidney damage. Your health care provider may prescribe medicines to control high blood pressure. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) are often used.\nSurgery is usually only used in children who have not responded to medical therapy.\nMore severe vesicoureteral reflux may need surgery, especially in children who do not respond to medical therapy."}

Surgery to place the ureter back into the bladder (ureteral reimplantation) can stop reflux nephropathy in some cases.\nMore severe reflux may need reconstructive surgery. This type of surgery may reduce the number and severity of urinary tract infections.\nIf needed, people will be treated for chronic kidney disease.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nOutcome varies, depending on the severity of the reflux. Some people with reflux nephropathy will not lose kidney function over time, even though their kidneys are damaged. However, kidney damage may be permanent."}
