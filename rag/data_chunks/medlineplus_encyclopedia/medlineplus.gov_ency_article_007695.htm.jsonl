Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nDelayed puberty in boys\nDelayed puberty in boys\nDelayed puberty in boys is when puberty does not begin by 14 years of age.\nWhen puberty is delayed, these changes either don't occur or don't progress normally. Delayed puberty is more common in boys than in girls.\nCauses\nIn most cases, delayed puberty is simply a matter of growth changes beginning later than usual, sometimes called late bloomer. Once puberty begins, it progresses normally. This is called constitutional delayed puberty, and it runs in families. This is the most common cause of late maturity.\nDelayed puberty also may occur when the testes produce too little or no male hormones."}

Tests may include:\nBlood test to check for levels of certain growth hormones, sex hormones, and thyroid hormones\nLH response to GnRH blood test\nChromosomal analysis\nor other genetic testing\nMRI of head for tumors\nUltrasound of the pelvis or testicles\nAn x-ray of the left hand and wrist to evaluate bone age may be obtained at the initial visit to see if the bones are maturing. It may be repeated over time, if needed.\nTreatment\nThe treatment will depend on the cause of delayed puberty.\nIf there is a family history of late puberty, often no treatment is needed. In time, puberty will begin on its own.\nIf delayed puberty is due to a disease, such as underactive thyroid gland, treating it may help puberty to develop normally.\nHormone therapy may help start puberty if:\nPuberty fails to develop\nThe child is very distressed because of the delay\nThe provider will give a shot (injection) of testosterone (male sex hormone) in the muscle every 4 weeks. Growth changes will be monitored."}
