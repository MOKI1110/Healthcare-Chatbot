Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nDelayed puberty in girls\nDelayed puberty in girls\nDelayed puberty in girls occurs when breasts don't develop by age 13 or menstrual periods do not begin by age 16.\nPuberty changes\noccur when the body starts making sex hormones. These changes normally begin to appear in girls between ages 8 to 14 years.\nWith delayed puberty, these changes either don't occur at the normal age, or if they do, they don't progress normally. Delayed puberty is more common in boys than in girls.\nCauses\nIn most cases of delayed puberty, growth changes just begin later than usual, sometimes called a late bloomer. Once puberty begins, it progresses normally. This pattern runs in families. This is the most common cause of late maturity.\nAnother common cause of delayed puberty in girls is lack of body fat. Being too thin can disrupt the normal process of puberty."}

This is called\nhypogonadism\n.\nThis can occur when the ovaries are damaged or are not developing as they should.\nIt can also occur if there's a problem with the\nparts of the brain involved in puberty\n.\nCertain medical conditions or treatments can lead to hypogonadism, including:\nCeliac disease\nInflammatory bowel disease (IBD)\nHypothyroidism\nDiabetes mellitus\nCystic fibrosis\nSickle cell disease\nAnorexia nervosa\nLiver and kidney disease\nAutoimmune diseases\n, such as Hashimoto thyroiditis or Addison disease\nChemotherapy\nor radiation cancer treatment that damages the ovaries\nA tumor in the pituitary gland\nTurner syndrome\n, a genetic disorder\nSymptoms\nGirls begin puberty between ages 8 and 14."}
