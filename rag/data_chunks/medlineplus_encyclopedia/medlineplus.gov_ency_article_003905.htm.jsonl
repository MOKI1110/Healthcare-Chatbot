This is done by urinating into a special cup. The clean-catch method helps prevent germs from the penis or vagina from getting into a urine sample. To collect your urine, you will get a clean-catch kit from your provider. It will contain a cup with a lid and sterile wipes. Follow instructions exactly.\nThe urine sample can also be collected during\ncystoscopy\n. During this procedure, your provider uses a thin, tube-like instrument with a camera on the end to examine the inside of your bladder.\nThe urine sample is sent to a lab and examined under a microscope to look for abnormal cells.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThere is no discomfort with a clean catch urine specimen."}

During cystoscopy, there may be slight discomfort when the scope is passed through the urethra into the bladder.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is done to detect cancer of the urinary tract. It is often done when blood is seen in the urine.\nIt is also used to monitor people who have a history of urinary tract cancer. The test may be ordered for people who are at high risk for bladder cancer.\nThis test can also detect cytomegalovirus and other viral diseases.\nNormal Results\nThe urine shows normal cells.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal cells in the urine may be a sign of inflammation of the urinary tract or\ncancer of the kidney\n, ureters, bladder, or urethra. Abnormal cells may also be seen if the person has had radiation therapy near the bladder, such as for prostate cancer, uterine cancer, or colon cancer.\nThis test alone cannot diagnose cancer or inflammatory disease."}
