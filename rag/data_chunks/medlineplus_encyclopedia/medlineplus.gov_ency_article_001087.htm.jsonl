This swelling narrows the airways, which makes it harder to breathe. Other symptoms of bronchitis are a cough and coughing up mucus. Acute means the symptoms have been present only for a short time.\nCauses\nWhen acute bronchitis occurs, it almost always comes after having a cold or flu-like illness. The bronchitis infection is usually caused by a virus. At first, it affects your nose, sinuses, and throat. Then it spreads to the airways that lead to your lungs.\nSometimes, bacteria also infect your airways. This is more common in people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n(COPD).\nChronic bronchitis is a long-term condition."}

Your breathing may sound abnormal or rough.\nTests may include:\nChest x-ray\n, if your provider suspects pneumonia\nPulse oximetry, a painless test that helps determine the amount of oxygen in your blood by using a device placed on the end of your finger\nTreatment\nMost people DO NOT need antibiotics for acute bronchitis caused by a virus. The infection will almost always go away on its own within 1 week, though a mild cough may persist for up to 3 weeks. Doing these things may help you feel better:\nDrink plenty of fluids.\nIf you have\nasthma\nor another chronic lung condition, use your\ninhaler\n.\nGet plenty of rest.\nTake aspirin or acetaminophen if you have a fever. DO NOT give aspirin to people under age 18.\nBreathe moist air by using a\nhumidifier\nor steaming up the bathroom.\nCertain medicines that you can buy without a prescription can help break up or loosen mucus.
