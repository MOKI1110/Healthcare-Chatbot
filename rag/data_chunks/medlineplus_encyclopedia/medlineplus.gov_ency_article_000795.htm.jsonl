It may be passed down (inherited) in families.\nAlthough it has a similar name to\nneurofibromatosis type 1\n, it is a different and separate condition.\nCauses\nNF2 is caused by a change in the gene NF2. NF2 can be passed down through families in an\nautosomal dominant\npattern. This means that if one parent has NF2, any child of that parent has a 50% chance of inheriting the condition. Once someone carries the genetic change, their children have a 50% chance of inheriting it.\nSome cases of NF2 occur when the gene mutates on its own. This is called sporadic and is not inherited."}
