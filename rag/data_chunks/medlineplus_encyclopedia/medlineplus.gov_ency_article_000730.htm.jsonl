Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTransient ischemic attack\nTransient ischemic attack\nA transient ischemic attack (TIA) occurs when blood flow to a part of the brain stops for a brief time. A person will have stroke-like symptoms for up to 24 hours. In most cases, the symptoms last for 1 to 2 hours.\nA transient ischemic attack is a warning sign that a true\nstroke\nmay happen in the future (often near future) if something is not done to prevent it.\nCauses\nA TIA is different than a stroke. After a TIA, the blockage breaks up quickly and dissolves on its own. A TIA does not cause brain tissue to die.\nThe loss of blood flow to an area of the brain can be caused by:\nA blood clot in an artery of the brain\nA blood clot that travels to the brain from somewhere else in the body (for example, from the heart)\nAn injury to blood vessels\nNarrowing of a blood vessel in the brain or leading to the brain\nHigh blood pressure\nis the main risk factor for TIAs and stroke."}

A TIA diagnosis may be made based on your medical history alone.\nYour health care provider will do a complete physical exam to check for heart and blood vessel problems. You will also be checked for nerve and muscle problems.\nYour provider will use a stethoscope to listen to your heart and arteries. An abnormal sound called a bruit may be heard when listening to the carotid artery in your neck or other artery. A bruit is caused by irregular blood flow.\nTests will be done to check for a stroke or other disorders that may cause the symptoms:\nYou will likely have a\nhead CT scan\nor\nbrain MRI\n. A stroke may show changes on these tests, but TIAs will not.\nYou may have an\nangiogram\n, CT angiogram, or MR angiogram to see which blood vessel is blocked or bleeding.\nYou may have an\nechocardiogram\nif your provider thinks you may have a blood clot from the heart.\nYou may have a\ncarotid duplex ultrasound\n."}

You may have an\nEEG\ntest to check if your symptoms are not due to a\nseizure\n.\nTreatment\nIf you have had a TIA within the last 48 hours, you will likely be admitted to the hospital so that your providers can search for the cause and monitor you.\nHigh blood pressure, heart disease,\ndiabetes\n, high cholesterol, and blood disorders will be treated as needed.

Some people who have blocked neck arteries may need surgery (\ncarotid endarterectomy\n). If you have an irregular heartbeat (atrial fibrillation) or other heart problems, you will be treated to avoid future complications.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nTIAs do not cause lasting damage to the brain.\nBut, TIAs are a warning sign that you may have a true stroke in the coming days or months.

Call 911 or the local emergency number right away. Do not ignore symptoms just because they go away. They may be a warning of a future stroke.\nPrevention\nFollow your provider's instructions on how to prevent TIAs and strokes.
