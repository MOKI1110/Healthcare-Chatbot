MSG is the sodium salt of a common amino acid, glutamic acid. MSG is found naturally in our bodies and in many foods including cheese and tomatoes. MSG is added to many different types of foods as a flavor enhancer.\nCauses\nReports of reactions to MSG originated in 1968 in a letter published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Since then, reports of reactions to MSG have come from people claiming to experience symptoms after consuming food containing MSG. However, studies on MSG in foods have failed to find a conclusive link between MSG and the symptoms some people describe.\nThe US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did a study of the issue and found no evidence that MSG in food caused symptoms. The report did find minor reactions in people who consumed 3 or more grams of MSG alone without food."}
