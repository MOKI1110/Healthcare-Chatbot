Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAnterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury\nAnterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injury\nAn anterior cruciate ligament injury is the over-stretching or tearing of the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in the knee. A tear may be partial or complete.\nConsiderations\nThe knee joint is located where the end of the thigh bone (femur) meets the top of the shin bone (tibia).\nFour main ligaments connect these two bones:\nMedial collateral ligament (MCL) runs along the inside of the knee. It prevents the knee from bending inward.\nLateral collateral ligament (LCL) runs along the outside of the knee. It prevents the knee from bending outward.\nAnterior cruciate ligament (ACL) is in the middle of the knee. It prevents the shin bone from sliding out in front of the thigh bone.\nPosterior cruciate ligament (PCL) works with the ACL."}

It prevents the shin bone from sliding out in front of the thigh bone.\nPosterior cruciate ligament (PCL) works with the ACL. It prevents the shin bone from sliding backward under the femur.\nWomen are more likely to have an ACL tear than men.\nCauses\nAn ACL injury can occur if you:\nGet hit very hard on the side of your knee, such as during a football tackle\nOverextend your knee joint\nQuickly stop moving and change direction while running, landing from a jump, or turning\nBasketball, football, soccer, and skiing are common sports linked to ACL tears.\nACL injuries often occur with other injuries. For example, an ACL tear often occurs along with tears to the MCL and the shock-absorbing cartilage in the knee (meniscus).\nMost ACL tears occur in the middle of the ligament, or the ligament is pulled off the thigh bone."}

Do not play sports or other activities until you have seen your provider and have been treated.\nYour provider may send you to get an MRI of the knee. It can confirm the diagnosis."}

You are also less likely to be able to return to the same level of sports if you have a torn ACL.\nDO NOT\nDo NOT move your knee if you have had a serious injury.\nDo NOT use a splint to keep the knee straight until you see a provider.\nDo NOT return to play or other activities until you have been treated.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider right away if you have a serious knee injury.\nGet immediate medical attention if the foot is cool and blue after a knee injury. This means that the knee joint may be dislocated, and blood vessels to the foot may be injured. This is a medical emergency.\nPrevention\nUse proper techniques when playing sports or exercising. Some college sports programs teach athletes how to reduce stress placed on the ACL. This involves a series of warm up exercises and jumping drills."}
