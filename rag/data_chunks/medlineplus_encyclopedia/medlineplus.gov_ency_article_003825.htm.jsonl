Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLiver scan\nLiver scan\nA liver scan uses a radioactive material to check how well the liver or spleen is working and to assess masses in the liver.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe health care provider will inject a radioactive material called a radioisotope into one of your veins. After the liver has soaked up the material, you will be asked to lie on a table under the scanner.\nThe scanner can tell where the radioactive material has gathered in the body. Images are displayed on a computer. You may be asked to remain still, or to change positions during the scan.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will be asked to sign a consent form. You will be asked to remove jewelry, dentures, and other metals that can affect the scanner's functions.\nYou may need to wear a hospital gown.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will feel a sharp prick when the needle is inserted into your vein. You should not feel anything during the actual scan."}

You should not feel anything during the actual scan. If you have problems lying still or are very anxious, you may be given a mild medicine (sedative) to help you relax.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test can provide information about liver and spleen function. It is also used to help confirm other test results.\nThe most common use for a liver scan is to diagnose a condition called benign focal nodular hyperplasia, or FNH, which causes a non-cancerous mass in the liver.\nNormal Results\nThe liver and spleen should look normal in size, shape, and location. The radioisotope is absorbed evenly.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may indicate:\nFocal nodular hyperplasia or adenoma of the liver\nAbscess\nBudd-Chiari syndrome\nInfection\nLiver disease\n(such as\ncirrhosis\nor\nhepatitis\n)\nSuperior vena cava obstruction\nSplenic infarction\n(tissue death)\nTumors\nRisks\nRadiation from any scan is always a slight concern. The level of radiation in this procedure is less than that of most x-rays."}

The level of radiation in this procedure is less than that of most x-rays. It is not considered to be enough to cause harm to the average person.\nPregnant or nursing women should consult their provider before any exposure to radiation.\nConsiderations\nOther tests may be needed to confirm the findings of this test. These may include:\nAbdominal ultrasound\nAbdominal CT scan\nAbdominal MRI scan\nLiver biopsy\nThis test is used infrequently. Instead, MRI or CT scans are more often used to evaluate the liver and spleen.\nAlternative Names\nTechnetium scan; Liver technetium sulfur colloid scan; Liver-spleen radionuclide scan; Nuclear scan - technetium; Nuclear scan - liver or spleen\nImages\nLiver scan\nReferences\nMettler FA, Guiberteau MJ.
