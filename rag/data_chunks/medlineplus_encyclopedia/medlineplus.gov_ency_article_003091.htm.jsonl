The word can also refer to an episode of shivering along with paleness and feeling cold.\nConsiderations\nChills (shivering) may occur at the start of an infection. They are most often associated with a\nfever\n. Chills are caused by rapid muscle contraction and relaxation. They are the body's way of producing heat when it feels cold. Chills often predict the coming of a fever or an increase in the body's core temperature.\nChills are an important symptom with certain diseases such as\nmalaria\n.\nChills are common in young children. Children tend to develop higher fevers than adults. Even minor illness can produce high fevers in young children.\nInfants tend not to develop obvious chills. However, contact your health care provider right away about any fever in an infant 6 months or younger. Also contact for fevers in infants 6 months to 1 year unless you are sure of the cause.\n\"Goose bumps\" are not the same as chills. Goose bumps occur due to cold air."}

Also contact for fevers in infants 6 months to 1 year unless you are sure of the cause.\n\"Goose bumps\" are not the same as chills. Goose bumps occur due to cold air. They can also be caused by strong emotions such as shock or fear. With goose bumps, the hair on the body stick up from the skin to form a layer of insulation. When you have chills, you may or may not have goose bumps.\nCauses\nCauses may include:\nExposure to a cold environment\nAny infections\nHome Care\nFever (which can accompany chills) is the body's natural response to a variety of conditions, such as infections. If the fever is mild, 102 °F (38.8 °C) or less, with no side effects, you do not need to see a provider for treatment. You can treat the problem at home by drinking lots of fluids and getting plenty of rest.\nEvaporation cools the skin and reduces body temperature. Sponging with lukewarm water, about 70 °F (21.1 °C), may help reduce a fever. Cold water may increase the fever as it can trigger chills.\nMedicines such as acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen are helpful in fighting a fever and chills.\nDO NOT bundle up in blankets if you have a high temperature."}

DO NOT use fans or air conditioners either. These measures will only make the chills worse and may even cause the fever to rise.\nHOME CARE FOR A CHILD\nIf the child's temperature is causing the child to be uncomfortable, give pain-relieving tablets or liquid. Non-aspirin pain-relievers such as acetaminophen are recommended. Ibuprofen may also be used. Follow the dosage guidelines on the package label.\nNote:\nDO NOT give aspirin to treat fever in a child younger than 19 years old because of the risk for\nReye syndrome\n.\nOther things to help the child feel more comfortable include:\nDress the child in light clothing, provide liquids, and keep the room cool but not uncomfortable.\nDO NOT use ice water or rubbing alcohol baths to reduce a child's temperature. These can cause shivering and even\nshock\n.\nDO NOT bundle a child with a fever in blankets.\nDO NOT wake a sleeping child to give medicine or take a temperature."}
