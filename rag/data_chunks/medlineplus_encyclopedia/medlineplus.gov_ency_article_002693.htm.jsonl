The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.\nSkin problems will clear up when use of the product is stopped. If the lotion is swallowed, recovery normally occurs if the right treatment is received in time.\nMost home permanent kits that contain cold wave lotions are watered down to avoid poisoning. However, some hair salons may use stronger forms that need to be diluted before use. Exposure to this stronger cold wave lotion will cause much more damage than the ones used at home.\nAlternative Names\nThioglycolate poisoning\nReferences\nDraelos ZD. Cosmetics and cosmeceuticals.
