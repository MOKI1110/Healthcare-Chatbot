This area is called the subarachnoid space. Subarachnoid bleeding is an emergency and prompt medical attention is needed.\nCauses\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage can be caused by:\nBleeding from a tangle of blood vessels called an\narteriovenous malformation\n(AVM)\nBleeding disorder\nBleeding from a\ncerebral aneurysm\n(weak area in the wall of a blood vessel that causes the blood vessel to bulge or balloon out)\nHead injury\nSickle cell disease\nBrain tumors\nCerebral venous thrombosis (blood clot in the veins in the skull)\nUnknown cause (idiopathic)\nUse of blood thinners\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage caused by head injury in older people is often due to falls. Among the young, the most common injury leading to a subarachnoid hemorrhage is motor vehicle crashes."}

Among the young, the most common injury leading to a subarachnoid hemorrhage is motor vehicle crashes. When caused by trauma, subarachnoid hemorrhage commonly occurs with other types of bleeding in the head.\nRisk factors include:\nUnruptured aneurysm in the brain and other blood vessels\nFibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) and other connective tissue and autoimmune disorders\nHigh blood pressure\nHistory of\npolycystic kidney disease\nSmoking\nUse of illicit drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine\nUse of blood thinners such as warfarin\nA strong family history of aneurysms may also increase your risk.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom is a severe headache that starts suddenly (often called thunderclap headache). It is often worse near the back of the head. Many people often describe it as the \"worst headache ever\" and unlike any other type of headache pain."}
