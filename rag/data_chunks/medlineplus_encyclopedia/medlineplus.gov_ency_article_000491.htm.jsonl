You will receive medicines through a vein (IV) to reduce your blood pressure.\nIf there is fluid in your lungs, you will be given medicines called diuretics, which help the body remove fluid. Your doctor may give you medicines to protect your heart if you have signs of heart damage.\nAfter your severe high blood pressure is under control, blood pressure medicines taken by mouth can control blood pressure. Your medicine may need to be changed sometimes. High blood pressure can be difficult to control.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMany body systems are at serious risk from the extreme rise in blood pressure. Organs including the brain, eyes, blood vessels, heart, and kidneys may be damaged.\nThe blood vessels of the kidney are very likely to be damaged by high blood pressure. Kidney failure may develop, which may be permanent."}

If this happens, you may need\ndialysis\n(machine that removes waste products from blood).\nIf treated right away, malignant hypertension can often be controlled without causing permanent problems. If it is not treated right away, it can be fatal.\nPossible Complications\nThese complications may occur:\nBrain damage (stroke, seizures)\nHeart damage, including:\nheart attack\n,\nangina\n(chest pain due to narrowed blood vessels or weakened heart muscle), heart rhythm disturbances\nKidney failure\nPermanent blindness\nFluid in the lungs\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nGo to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have symptoms of malignant hypertension. This is an emergency condition that can be life threatening.\nContact your health care provider if you know you have poorly controlled high blood pressure.\nPrevention\nIf you have high blood pressure, carefully monitor your blood pressure and take your medicines properly to help reduce your risk."}
