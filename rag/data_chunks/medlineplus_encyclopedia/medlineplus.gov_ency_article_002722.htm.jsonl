Blood and urine tests will be done. Symptoms will be treated as needed. The person may receive:\nAirway and breathing support, including oxygen.

The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery. Nail polish tends to come in small bottles, so serious poisoning is unlikely if only one bottle was swallowed. However, always seek immediate emergency medical care.\nSome people sniff nail polish on purpose to get intoxicated (high) by the fumes."}

However, always seek immediate emergency medical care.\nSome people sniff nail polish on purpose to get intoxicated (high) by the fumes. Over time these people, as well as those working in poorly ventilated nail salons, can develop a condition known as \"painter syndrome.\" This is a permanent condition that causes walking problems, speech problems, and memory loss. Painter syndrome may also be called organic solvent syndrome, psycho-organic syndrome, and chronic solvent encephalopathy (CSE). CSE can also cause symptoms such as headache, fatigue, mood disturbances, sleep disorders, and possible behavioral changes.\nSudden death is possible in some nail polish poisoning cases.\nAlternative Names\nOrganic solvent syndrome; Psycho-organic syndrome; Chronic solvent encephalopathy\nReferences\nCrinion S.
