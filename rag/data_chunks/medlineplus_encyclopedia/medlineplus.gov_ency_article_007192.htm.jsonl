Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a serious form of\npneumonia\n. Infection with the SARS virus may cause\nacute\nrespiratory distress (severe breathing difficulty), and sometimes death.\nThis article is about the outbreak of SARS that occurred in 2003. For information about the\nCOVID-19 outbreak\ncaused by SARS-CoV-2, please see the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nwebsite.\nCauses\nSARS is caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV). It is one of the\ncoronavirus\nfamily of viruses (the same family that can cause the\ncommon cold\n). An epidemic of SARS started in 2003 when the virus spread from small mammals to people in China.  This outbreak quickly reached global proportions, but was contained in 2003. No new cases of SARS have been reported since 2004.\nWhen someone with SARS coughs or sneezes, infected droplets spray into the air. You can catch the SARS virus if you breathe in or touch these particles."}

You can catch the SARS virus if you breathe in or touch these particles. The SARS virus may live on hands, tissues, and other surfaces for up to several hours in these droplets. The virus may be able to live for months or years when the temperature is below freezing.\nWhile the spread of droplets through close contact caused most of the early SARS cases, SARS might also spread by hands and other objects the droplets has touched. Airborne transmission is a real possibility in some cases. Live virus has also been found in the stool of people with SARS, where it has been shown to live for up to 4 days.\nWith other coronaviruses, becoming infected and then getting sick again (reinfection) is common. This may also be the case with SARS.\nSymptoms usually occur 2 to 10 days after coming in contact with the virus. People with active symptoms of illness are contagious."}

There is evidence that the antiviral medicine, ribavirin, does not work. Newer antivirals have not been tried as the disease has not occurred recently.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn the 2003 outbreak, the death rate from SARS was 9% to 12% of those diagnosed. In people over age 65, the death rate was higher than 50%."}

And even more people had to be treated in hospital intensive care units.\nPublic health policies were effective at controlling outbreaks of SARS. Since 2004, there have been no cases of SARS reported anywhere in the world.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nRespiratory failure\nLiver failure\nHeart failure\nKidney problems\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you or someone you have been in close contact with has SARS.\nPrevention\nCurrently, there is no known SARS transmission anywhere in the world. If a SARS outbreak occurs, reducing your contact with people who have SARS lowers your risk for the disease. Avoid travel to places where there is an uncontrolled SARS outbreak."}

If a SARS outbreak occurs, reducing your contact with people who have SARS lowers your risk for the disease. Avoid travel to places where there is an uncontrolled SARS outbreak. When possible, avoid direct contact with people who have SARS until at least 10 days after their fever and other symptoms are gone.\nHand hygiene is the most important part of SARS prevention.\nWash your hands\nor clean them with an alcohol-based instant hand sanitizer.\nCover your mouth and nose when you sneeze or cough. Droplets that are released when a person sneezes or coughs are infectious.\nDO NOT share food, drink, or utensils.\nClean commonly touched surfaces with an EPA-approved disinfectant.\nMasks and goggles may be useful for preventing the spread of the disease. You may use gloves when handling items that may have touched infected droplets.\nAlternative Names\nSARS; Respiratory failure - SARS; SARS coronavirus; SARS-CoV\nImages\nLungs\nRespiratory system\nReferences\nHavers FP, Kirking H, Plumb ID.
