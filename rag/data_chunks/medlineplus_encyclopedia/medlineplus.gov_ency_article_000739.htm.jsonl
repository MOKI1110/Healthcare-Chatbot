It affects one or more brain functions such as memory, thinking, language, judgment, or behavior. Dementia may also be referred to as major\nneurocognitive disorder\n.\nCauses\nDementia usually occurs in older age. Most types are rare in people under age 60. The risk of dementia increases as a person gets older.\nMost types of dementia are nonreversible and degenerative. Nonreversible means the changes in the brain that are causing the dementia cannot be stopped or turned back.\nAlzheimer disease\nis the most common type of dementia.\nAnother common type of dementia is\nvascular dementia\n. It is caused by poor blood flow to the brain, such as with stroke.\nLewy body disease is another cause of dementia in older adults. People with this condition have abnormal protein structures in certain areas of the brain."}

Not everyone with MCI develops dementia.\nSymptoms of MCI include:\nDifficulty doing more than one task at a time\nDifficulty solving problems or making decisions\nForgetting names of familiar people, recent events, or conversations\nTaking longer to do more difficult mental activities\nEarly symptoms of dementia can include:\nDifficulty with tasks that take some thought, but that used to come easily, such as balancing a checkbook, playing games (such as bridge), and learning new information or routines\nGetting lost on familiar routes\nLanguage problems, such as trouble with the names of familiar objects\nLosing interest in things previously enjoyed, flat mood\nMisplacing items\nPersonality chang"}
