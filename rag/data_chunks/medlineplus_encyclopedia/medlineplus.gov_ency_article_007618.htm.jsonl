Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAnemia caused by low iron - infants and toddlers\nAnemia caused by low iron - infants and toddlers\nAnemia is a problem in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells bring oxygen to body tissues.\nIron helps make red blood cells, so a lack of iron in the body may lead to anemia. The medical name of this problem is iron deficiency anemia.\nCauses\nAnemia caused by a low iron level is the most common form of anemia. The body gets iron through certain foods. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells.\nA diet that does not have enough iron is the most common cause. During periods of rapid growth, even more iron is needed.\nBabies are born with iron stored in their bodies. Because they grow rapidly, infants and toddlers need to absorb a lot of iron each day. Iron deficiency anemia most commonly affects babies 9 through 24 months old.\nBreastfed babies need less iron because iron is absorbed better when it is in breast milk."}

Iron deficiency anemia most commonly affects babies 9 through 24 months old.\nBreastfed babies need less iron because iron is absorbed better when it is in breast milk. Formula with iron added (iron fortified) also provides enough iron.\nInfants younger than 12 months who drink cow's milk rather than breast milk or iron-fortified formula are more likely to have anemia. Cow's milk leads to anemia because it:\nHas less iron\nCauses small amounts of blood loss from the intestines\nMakes it harder for the body to absorb iron\nChildren older than 12 months who drink too much cow's milk may also have anemia if they do not eat enough other healthy foods that have iron.\nSymptoms\nMild anemia may have no symptoms. As the iron level and blood counts become lower, your infant or toddler may:\nAct irritable\nBecome short of breath\nCrave unusual foods (called pica)\nEat less food\nFeel tired or weak all the time\nHave a sore tongue\nHave headaches or dizziness\nWith more severe anemia, your child may have:\nBlue-tinged or pale whites of eyes\nBrittle nails\nPale skin color\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

All babies should have a blood test to check for anemia. Blood tests that measure iron level in the body include:\nHematocrit\nSerum ferritin\nSerum iron\nTotal iron binding capacity (TIBC)\nA measurement called iron saturation (serum iron/TIBC) often can show whether the child has enough iron in the body.\nTreatment\nSince children only absorb a small amount of the iron they eat, most children need to have 8 to 10 mg of iron per day.\nDIET AND IRON\nDuring the first year of life:\nDo not give your baby cow's milk until age 1 year. Babies under age 1 year have a difficult time digesting cow's milk. Use either breast milk or formula fortified with iron.\nAfter 6 months, your baby will start to need more iron in their diet."}

Babies under age 1 year have a difficult time digesting cow's milk. Use either breast milk or formula fortified with iron.\nAfter 6 months, your baby will start to need more iron in their diet. Start solid foods with iron-fortified baby cereal mixed with breast milk or formula.\nIron-rich pureed meats, fruits, and vegetables can also be started.\nAfter age 1 year, you may give your baby whole milk in place of breast milk or formula.\nEating healthy foods is the most important way to prevent and treat iron deficiency. Good sources of iron include:\nApricots\nChicken, turkey, fish, and other meats\nDried beans, lentils, and soybeans\nEggs\nLiver\nMolasses\nOatmeal\nPeanut butter\nPrune juice\nRaisins and prunes\nSpinach, kale and other greens\nIRON SUPPLEMENTS\nIf a healthy diet does not prevent or treat your child's low iron level and anemia, the provider will likely recommend iron supplements for your child. These are taken by mouth.\nDo not give your child iron supplements or vitamins with iron without checking with your child's provider. The provider will prescribe the right kind of supplement for your child."}

It is important that the provider find the cause of your child's iron deficiency.\nPossible Complications\nA low iron level can cause decreased attention span, reduced alertness and learning problems in children.\nA low iron level can cause the body to absorb too much lead.\nPrevention\nEating healthy foods is the most important way to prevent and treat iron deficiency.\nAlternative Names\nAnemia - iron deficiency - infants and toddlers\nImages\nHemoglobin\nReferences\nBaker RD, Baker SS.
