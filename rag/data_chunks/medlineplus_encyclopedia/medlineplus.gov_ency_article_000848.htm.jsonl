Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCutaneous skin tag\nCutaneous skin tag\nA cutaneous skin tag is a common skin growth. Most of the time, it is harmless.\nCauses\nA cutaneous tag most often occurs in older adults. They are more common in people who are overweight or who have diabetes. They are thought to occur from skin rubbing against skin.\nSymptoms\nThe tag sticks out of the skin and may have a short, narrow stalk connecting it to the surface of the skin. Some skin tags are as long as a half an inch (1 centimeter). Most skin tags are the same color as skin, or a little darker.\nIn most cases, a skin tag is painless and does not grow or change. However, it may become irritated from rubbing by clothing or other materials.\nPlaces where skin tags occur include:\nNeck\nUnderarms\nMiddle of the body, or under folds of skin\nEyelids\nInner thighs\nOther body areas\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can diagnose this condition by looking at your skin. Sometimes a skin biopsy is done.\nTreatment\nTreatment is often not needed."}

Sometimes a skin biopsy is done.\nTreatment\nTreatment is often not needed. Your provider may recommend treatment if the skin tag is irritating or you don't like how it looks. Treatment may include:\nSurgery to remove it\nFreezing it (\ncryotherapy\n)\nBurning it off (cauterization)\nTying string or dental floss around it to cut off the blood supply so that it will eventually fall off\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nA skin tag is most often harmless (\nbenign\n). It may become irritated if clothing rubs against it. In most cases, the growth usually does not grow back after it is removed. However, new skin tags may form on other parts of the body.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if the skin tag changes or if you want it removed. Do not cut it yourself, because it can bleed a lot.\nAlternative Names\nSkin tag; Acrochordon; Fibroepithelial polyp\nImages\nSkin tag\nReferences\nDinulos JGH. Benign skin tumors.
