It can lead to seizures (often associated with fever), ear infections, diarrhea, and pneumonia. Rarely, measles can cause brain damage or death.\nMUMPS (M)\ncauses fever, headache, muscle aches, tiredness, loss of appetite, and swollen and tender salivary glands under the ears."}

It can cause arthritis in up to half of teenage and adult women. If a woman gets rubella while she is pregnant, she could have a miscarriage or the baby could be born with serious birth defects.\nVARICELLA (V)\n, also called \"chickenpox,\" causes an itchy rash, in addition to fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, and headache. It can lead to skin infections, pneumonia, inflammation of the blood vessels, swelling of the brain and/or spinal cord covering, and infection of the blood, bones, or joints. Some people who get chickenpox get a painful rash called \"shingles\" (also known as herpes zoster) years later.\nMost people who are vaccinated with MMRV will be protected for life."}
