When the sinus openings become blocked or too much mucus builds up, bacteria and other germs can grow. This can lead to an infection and inflammation of the sinuses called\nsinusitis\n.\nA sinus x-ray is ordered when you have any of the following:\nSymptoms of sinusitis\nOther sinus disorders, such as a deviated septum (crooked or bent septum, the structure that separates the nostrils)\nSymptoms of another infection of that area of the head\nThese days, a sinus x-ray is not often ordered. This is because a\nCT scan of the sinuses\nshows more detail.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThe x-ray may detect an infection, blockages, bleeding or tumors.\nRisks\nThere is low radiation exposure. X-rays are monitored and regulated so that the lowest amount of radiation is used to produce the image.\nPregnant women and children are more sensitive to the risks of x-rays.\nAlternative Names\nParanasal sinus radiography; X-ray - sinuses\nImages\nSinuses\nReferences\nBeale T, Jawad S.
