Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBreast lump\nBreast lump\nA breast lump is swelling, growth, or mass in the breast.\nBreast lumps in both men and women raise concern for\nbreast cancer\n, even though most lumps are not cancer.\nConsiderations\nBoth males and females of all ages have normal breast tissue. This tissue responds to hormone changes. Because of this, lumps can come and go.\nBreast lumps may appear at any age:\nBoth male and female infants may have breast lumps from their mother's estrogen when they are born. The lump will most often go away on its own as the estrogen clears from the baby's body.\nYoung girls often develop \"breast buds,\" which appear just before the beginning of puberty. These bumps may be tender. They are common around age 9, but may happen as early as age 6.\nTeenage boys may develop breast enlargement and lumps because of hormone changes in mid-puberty."}

Although this may be upsetting to boys, the lumps or growth almost always go away on their own over a period of months.\nCauses\nLumps in a woman are most often either fibroadenomas or cysts, or just normal variations in breast tissue known as fibrocystic changes.\nFibrocystic changes\nare painful, lumpy breasts. This is a benign condition that does not increase your risk for breast cancer. Symptoms are most often worse right before your menstrual period, and then improve after your period starts.\nFibroadenomas\nare noncancerous lumps that feel rubbery.\nThey move easily inside the breast tissue and are usually not tender. They occur most often during the reproductive years.\nThese lumps do not have cancer or become cancerous except in rare cases.\nA health care provider may sometimes suspect a lump is a fibroadenoma based on an exam."}

Also, an ultrasound and a mammogram can often provide information to determine if a lump looks like a fibroadenoma.\nThe only way to be sure, however, is to have a needle biopsy or remove the whole lump.\nCysts\nare fluid-filled sacs that often feel like soft grapes. These can sometimes be tender, often just before your menstrual period. Ultrasound can determine if a lump is a cyst. It can also reveal whether it is a simple, complicated, or complex cyst.\nSimple cysts are just sacs filled with fluid. They do not need to be removed and may go away on their own. If a simple cyst is growing or causing pain, it can be aspirated.\nA complicated cyst has a little bit of debris in the fluid and can either be watched with ultrasound or the fluid can be drained.\nA complex cyst looks more worrisome on ultrasound. Your provider may recommend either a follow up ultrasound or a needle biopsy."}

Depending on the results, the cyst may be monitored with ultrasound exams or removed surgically.\nOther causes of breast lumps include:\nBreast cancer.\nInjury. Blood may collect and feel like a lump called a hematoma if your breast gets badly bruised. These lumps tend to get better on their own in a few days or weeks. If they do not improve, your provider may have to drain the blood.\nLipoma. This is a collection of fatty tissue.\nMilk cysts (sacs filled with milk). These cysts can occur with breastfeeding.\nBreast\nabscess\n. These typically occur if you are breastfeeding or have recently given birth, but can also occur in women who are not breastfeeding.\nHome Care\nSee your provider if you have any new lumps or breast changes."}

The fluid is usually discarded and does not need to be examined under a microscope.\nOrdering a\nneedle biopsy\n, which is often done by a radiologist.\nHow a breast lump is treated depends on the cause.\nSolid breast lumps are usually biopsied with a needle by the radiologist."}
