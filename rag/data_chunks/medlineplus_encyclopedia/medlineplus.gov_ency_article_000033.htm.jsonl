The bite from fire ants and the sting from bees, wasps, and hornets are most often painful. Bites caused by mosquitoes, fleas, and mites are more likely to cause itching than pain.\nInsect and spider bites cause more deaths from venom reactions than bites from snakes.  Most deaths from insect bites are due to allergic reaction to the venom, rather than the toxins in the venom itself.\nConsiderations\nIn most cases, bites and stings can be easily treated at home.\nSome people have extreme allergic reactions that require immediate treatment to prevent death.\nCertain spider bites, such as the\nblack widow\nor brown recluse, can cause serious illness or death. Most spider bites are harmless. If possible, bring the insect or spider that bit you with you when you go for treatment so it can be identified.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms depend on the type of bite or sting."}

They may include:\nPain\nRedness\nSwelling\nItching\nBurning\nNumbness\nTingling\nSome people have severe, life-threatening allergic reactions to bee stings or insect bites. This is called\nanaphylactic shock\n. This condition can occur very quickly and lead to rapid death if not treated quickly.\nSymptoms of anaphylaxis can occur quickly and affect the whole body. They include:\nAbdominal pain or vomiting\nChest pain\nDifficulty swallowing\nDifficulty breathing\nFace or mouth swelling\nFainting or lightheadedness\nRash or skin flushing\nFirst Aid\nFor severe reactions, first check the person's airways and breathing. If necessary, call 911 or the local emergency number and begin rescue breathing and\nCPR\n. Then, follow these steps:\nReassure the person. Try to keep them calm.\nRemove nearby rings and constricting items because the affected area may swell.\nUse the person's EpiPen or other emergency kit, if they have one."}

Remain with the person until medical help arrives.\nGeneral steps for most bites and stings:\nRemove the stinger by scraping the back of a credit card or other straight-edged object across the stinger. Do not use tweezers -- these may squeeze the venom sac and increase the amount of venom released.\nWash the site thoroughly with soap and water. Then, follow these steps:\nPlace ice (wrapped in a washcloth) on the site of the sting for 10 minutes and then off for 10 minutes."}
