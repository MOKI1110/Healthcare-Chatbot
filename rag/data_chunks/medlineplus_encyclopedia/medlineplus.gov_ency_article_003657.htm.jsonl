Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBlood differential test\nBlood differential test\nThe blood differential test measures the percentage of each type of white blood cell (WBC) that you have in your blood. It also reveals if there are any abnormal or immature cells.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nA lab specialist takes a drop of blood from your sample and smears it onto a glass slide. The smear is stained with a special dye, which helps tell the difference between various types of white blood cells.\nFive types of white blood cells, also called leukocytes, normally appear in the blood:\nNeutrophils\nLymphocytes (B cells and T cells)\nMonocytes\nEosinophils\nBasophils\nA special machine counts the number of each type of cell. The test shows if the number of cells are in proper proportion with one another, and if there is more or less of one cell type.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to diagnose an infection,\nanemia\n, or\nleukemia\n. It may also be used to monitor one of these conditions or to see if treatment is working.\nNormal Results\nThe different types of white blood cells are given as a percentage of all white cells:\nNeutrophils: 40% to 60%\nLymphocytes: 20% to 40%\nMonocytes: 2% to 8%\nEosinophils: 1% to 4%\nBasophils: 0.5% to 1%\nBand (young neutrophil): 0% to 3%\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAny infection or\nacute\nstress increases your number of white blood cells. High white blood cell counts may be due to inflammation, an\nimmune response,\nor blood diseases such as leukemia."}
