It mostly affects language skills and hand use.\nCauses\nRTT occurs almost always in girls. Due to similar symptoms, it may at first be diagnosed as autism or\ncerebral palsy\n.\nMost RTT cases are due to a variant in the gene called MECP2. This gene is on the X chromosome. Females have 2 X chromosomes. If one chromosome has this variant, the other X chromosome is normal enough for the child to survive.\nMales born with this variant gene do not have a second X chromosome to make up for the problem. Therefore, the defect usually results in a\nmiscarriage\n,\nstillbirth\n, or very early death.\nSymptoms\nAn infant with RTT usually has normal development for the first 6 to 18 months. Symptoms range from mild to severe.\nSymptoms may include:\nBreathing problems\n, which may get worse with stress."}

Symptoms range from mild to severe.\nSymptoms may include:\nBreathing problems\n, which may get worse with stress. Breathing is usually normal during sleep and abnormal while awake.\nChange in development.\nExcessive saliva and drooling.\nFloppy arms and legs, which is frequently the first sign.\nIntellectual disabilities and learning difficulties.\nScoliosis\n.\nShaky, unsteady, stiff gait or toe walking.\nSeizures\n.\nSlowing head growth beginning at 5 to 6 months of age.\nLoss of normal sleep patterns.\nLoss of purposeful hand movements: For example, the grasp used to pick up small objects is replaced by repetitive hand motions like hand wringing or constant placement of hands in mouth.\nLoss of social engagement.\nOngoing, severe constipation and\ngastroesophageal reflux (GERD\n).\nPoor circulation that can lead to cold and bluish arms and legs.\nSevere language development problems.\nNOTE: Problems with breathing patterns may be the most upsetting and difficult symptom for parents to watch. Why they happen and what to do about them is not well understood."}

Why they happen and what to do about them is not well understood. Most experts recommend that parents remain calm through an episode of irregular breathing like breath holding. It may help to remind yourself that normal breathing always returns and that your child will become used to the abnormal breathing pattern.\nExams and Tests\nGenetic testing may be done to look for the gene defect. But, since the defect is not identified in everyone with the disease, the diagnosis of RTT is based on symptoms.\nThere are several different types of RTT:\nAtypical\nClassical (meets the diagnostic criteria)\nProvisional (some symptoms appear between ages 1 and 3 years)\nRTT is classified as atypical if:\nIt begins early (soon after birth) or late (beyond 18 months of age, sometimes as late as 3 or 4 years old)\nSpeech and hand skill problems are mild\nIf it appears in a boy (very rare)\nTreatment\nTreatment may include:\nHelp with feeding and diapering\nMethods to treat constipation and GERD\nPhysical therapy to help prevent hand problems\nWeight bearing exercises with scoliosis"}

A feeding tube may be needed if the child breathes in (aspirates) food. A diet high in calories and fat combined with feeding tubes can help increase weight and height. Weight gain may improve alertness and social interaction.\nThe medicine, trofinetide, can be used to treat Rett syndrome. The medicine protects the brain from swelling and other injury resulting from the genetic variant.\nMedicines may be used to treat seizures. Supplements may be tried for constipation, alertness, or rigid muscles.\nStem cell therapy, alone or in combination with gene therapy, is another hopeful treatment.\nSupport Groups\nThe following groups can provide more information and support for people with Rett syndrome and their families:\nInternational Rett Syndrome Foundation --\nwww.rettsyndrome.org\nNational Organization for Rare Disorders --\nrarediseases.org/rare-diseases/rett-syndrome\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe disease slowly gets worse until the teen years."}

Then, symptoms may improve. For example, seizures or breathing problems tend to lessen in the late teens.\nDevelopmental delays vary. Usually, a child with RTT sits up properly, but may not crawl. For those who do crawl, many do so by scooting on their tummy without using their hands.\nSimilarly, some children walk independently within the normal age range, while others:\nAre delayed\nDo not learn to walk independently at all\nDo not learn to walk until late childhood or early adolescence\nFor those children who do learn to walk at the normal time, some keep that ability for their lifetime, while other children lose the skill.\nLife expectancies are not well studied, although survival at least until the mid-20s is likely.
