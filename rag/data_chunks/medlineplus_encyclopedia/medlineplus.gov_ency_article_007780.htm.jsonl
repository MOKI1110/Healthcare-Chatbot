These vaccines teach your child's body how to defend against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19.\nWHY CHILDREN AND TEENS SHOULD GET VACCINATED\nIt's true that most children and teens are at lower risk from becoming very sick from COVID-19. But low risk does not mean no risk. Children and teens can:\nBecome infected with COVID-19\nBecome seriously ill from COVID-19 and need to be hospitalized\nHave serious short- and long-term effects or complications from COVID-19\nDie from COVID-19, although this is very rare\nSpread COVID-19 to others, including those at risk for serious illness, such as grandparents\nChildren with underlying medical conditions are more at risk for severe illness from COVID-19."}

So, vaccination is very important to help protect against the virus.\nThere are many good reasons to have your child or teen get a COVID-19 vaccination:\nIt will protect your child from serious illness if they do get COVID-19.\nIt will protect other people in the family at risk for serious illness from COVID-19.\nIt is a safer way to build protection than from getting COVID-19.\nABOUT COVID-19 mRNA VACCINES FOR CHILDREN AND TEENS\nThere are two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines currently approved for use in the United States, the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines. These 2024-2025 mRNA vaccines protect against the current strains of the COVID-19 virus.\nChildren ages 6 months to 17 years can get either the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna mRNA vaccine.\nCOVID-19 mRNA vaccines use messenger RNA (mRNA) to tell cells in the body how to briefly create a harmless piece of spike protein that is unique to the SARS-CoV-2 virus."}

Cells then get rid of the mRNA.\nThis spike protein triggers an immune response inside the body, making antibodies that protect against COVID-19. Your child's immune system then learns to attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus if they are ever exposed to it.\nThe COVID-19 vaccine given to children and teens has the same active ingredients as the vaccine given to adults. Dosage is based on the child's age on the day of vaccination. It is not based on the child's size or weight.\nSUBUNIT VACCINE\nThe Novavax vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine. The vaccine includes harmless pieces of the spike protein that causes COVID-19. The vaccine triggers the body to develop antibodies to protect you from the virus."}

This is normal. These symptoms are a sign that your child's body is making antibodies against the virus. Common side effects include:\nPain, redness, or swelling on the arm (or leg up to age 3) where they got the shot\nTiredness\nHeadache\nMuscle pain\nChills\nFever\nLoss of appetite\nSwollen lymph nodes\nSome side effects from the shot may affect your child's ability to do daily activities, but any side effects will go away in a few days. Even if your child has side effects, they should get the second shot if needed."}
