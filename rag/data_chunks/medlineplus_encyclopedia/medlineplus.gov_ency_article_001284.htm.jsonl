Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nVaricocele\nVaricocele\nA varicocele is the swelling of the veins inside the scrotum. These veins are found along the cord that holds up a man's\ntesticles\n(spermatic cord).\nCauses\nA varicocele forms when valves inside the veins that run along the spermatic cord prevent blood from flowing properly. Blood backs up, leading to swelling and widening of the veins. (This is similar to\nvaricose veins\nin the legs.)\nMost of the time, varicoceles develop slowly. They are more common in men ages 15 to 25 and are most often seen on the left side of the\nscrotum\n.\nA varicocele in an older man that appears suddenly may be caused by a\nkidney tumor\n, which can block blood flow to a vein.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nEnlarged, twisted veins in the scrotum\nDull ache or discomfort\nPainless\ntesticle lump\n,\nscrotal swelling\n, or bulge in the scrotum\nPossible problems with fertility or decreased sperm count\nSome men do not have symptoms.\nExams and Tests\nYou will have an exam of your groin area, including the scrotum and testicles."}

Your health care provider may feel a twisted growth along the spermatic cord.\nSometimes the growth may not be able to be seen or felt, especially when you are lying down.\nThe testicle on the side of the varicocele may be smaller than the one on the other side.\nYou may also have an ultrasound of the scrotum and testicles, as well as an ultrasound of the kidneys.\nTreatment\nA jock strap or snug underwear may help ease discomfort. You may need other treatment if the pain does not go away or you develop other symptoms.\nSurgery to correct a varicocele is called varicocelectomy. For this procedure:\nYou will receive some form of anesthesia.\nThe urologist (surgeon) will make a cut, most often in the lower abdomen, and tie off the abnormal veins. This directs blood flow in the area to the normal veins."}

This directs blood flow in the area to the normal veins. The operation may also be done as a laparoscopic procedure (through small incisions with a camera).\nYou will be able to leave the hospital on the same day as your surgery.\nYou will need to keep an ice pack on the area for the first 24 hours after surgery to reduce swelling.\nAn alternative to surgery is varicocele embolization. For this procedure:\nA small hollow tube called a catheter (tube) is placed into a vein in your groin or neck area.\nThe provider moves the tube into the varicocele using x-rays as a guide.\nA tiny coil passes through the tube into the varicocele. The coil blocks blood flow to the abnormal vein and sends it to normal veins.\nYou will need to keep an ice pack on the area to reduce swelling and wear a scrotal support for a little while.\nThis method is also done without an overnight hospital stay."}

It uses a much smaller cut than surgery, so you will heal faster.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nA varicocele is often harmless and often does not need to be treated, unless there is a change in the size of your testicle or a problem with fertility.\nIf you have surgery, your sperm count will likely increase and it may improve your fertility. In most cases, testicular wasting (atrophy) does not improve unless surgery is done early in adolescence.\nPossible Complications\nInfertility\nis a complication of varicocele.\nComplications from treatment may include:\nAtrophic testis\nBlood clot\nformation\nInfection\nInjury to the scrotum or nearby blood vessel\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you discover a\ntesticle lump\nor need to treat a diagnosed varicocele.\nAlternative Names\nVaricose veins - scrotum\nImages\nVaricocele\nMale reproductive system\nReferences\nGoldstein M.
