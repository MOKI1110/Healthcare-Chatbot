The health care provider will explain the test to you.\nThere are several tests for color vision. During the most common, you will be shown several cards with colored dot patterns. These cards are called Ishihara plates. In the patterns, some of the dots will appear to form numbers or symbols. You will be asked to identify the symbols, if possible.\nAs you cover one eye, the tester will hold the cards 14 inches (35 centimeters) from your face and ask you to quickly identify the symbol found in each color pattern.\nDepending on the problem suspected, you may be asked to determine the intensity of a color, particularly in one eye compared to the other."}

This is often tested by using the cap of a red eyedrop bottle.\nA more detailed test is called the Farnsworth Munsell 100 hue test in which you arrange 100 tiles in order as the hue gradually changes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nIf your child is having this test performed, it may be helpful to explain how the test will feel, and to practice or demonstrate on a doll. Your child will feel less anxious about the test if you explain what will happen and why.\nUsually there is a sample card of multicolored dots that almost everyone can identify, even people with color vision problems.\nIf you or your child normally wears glasses, wear them during the test.\nSmall children may be asked to tell the difference between a red bottle cap and caps of a different color.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test is similar to a vision test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to determine whether you have any problems with your color vision.\nColor vision problems often fall into two categories:\nPresent fr"}
