Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPernicious anemia\nPernicious anemia\nAnemia\nis a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. There are many types of anemia.\nPernicious anemia is a decrease in red blood cells that occurs when the intestines cannot properly absorb vitamin B12.\nCauses\nPernicious anemia is a type of vitamin B12 anemia. The body needs vitamin B12 to make red blood cells. You get this vitamin from eating foods such as meat, poultry, shellfish, eggs, and dairy products.\nA special protein, called intrinsic factor (IF), binds vitamin B12 so that it can be absorbed in the intestines. This protein is released by cells in the stomach."}

This protein is released by cells in the stomach. When the stomach does not make enough intrinsic factor, the intestine cannot properly absorb vitamin B12.\nCommon causes of pernicious anemia include:\nWeakened stomach lining (atrophic gastritis)\nAn autoimmune condition in which the body's immune system attacks the actual intrinsic factor protein or the cells in the lining of your stomach that make it.\nIn rare cases, pernicious anemia is passed down through families. This is called congenital pernicious anemia. Babies with this type of anemia do not make enough intrinsic factor. Or they cannot properly absorb vitamin B12 in the small intestine.\nIn adults, symptoms of pernicious anemia are usually not seen until after age 30. The average age of diagnosis is age 60.\nYou are more likely to develop this disease if you:\nAre Scandinavian or Northern European\nHave a family history of the condition\nCertain diseases can also raise your risk."}

Symptoms may be mild.\nThey may include:\nDiarrhea\nor constipation\nNausea\nVomiting\nFatigue\n, lack of energy, or lightheadedness when standing up or with exertion\nLoss of appetite\nPale skin (mild jaundice)\nShortness of breath\n, mostly during exercise\nHeartburn\nSwollen, red tongue or bleeding gums\nIf you have a low vitamin B12 level for a long time, you can have nervous system damage."}

Nerve damage can be permanent if treatment does not start within 6 months of symptoms.\nPossible Complications\nPeople with pernicious anemia may have gastric polyps. They are also more likely to develop\ngastric cancer\nand gastric carcinoid tumors.\nPeople with pernicious anemia are more likely to have fractures of the back, upper leg, and upper forearm.\nBrain and nervous system problems may continue or be permanent if treatment is delayed.\nA woman with a low B12 level may have a false positive Pap smear."}
