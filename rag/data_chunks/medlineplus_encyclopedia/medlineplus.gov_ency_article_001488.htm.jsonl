Pregnancy losses after the 20th week are called\nstillbirths\n. Miscarriage is a naturally occurring event, unlike\nmedicine abortions\nor\nabortion procedures\n.\nA miscarriage may also be called a \"spontaneous abortion.\" Other terms for the early loss of pregnancy include:\nComplete abortion: All of the products (tissue) of conception leave the body.\nIncomplete abortion: Only some of the products of conception leave the body.\nInevitable abortion: Symptoms cannot be stopped and a miscarriage will happen.\nInfected (septic) abortion: The lining of the uterus and any remaining products of conception become infected.\nMissed abortion: The pregnancy has failed and the products of conception do not leave the body.\nYour health care provider may also use the term \"\nthreatened miscarriage\n.\" The symptoms of this condition are\nabdominal cramps\nwith or without vaginal bleeding."}

They are a sign that a miscarriage may occur.\nCauses\nMost miscarriages are caused by chromosome problems that make it impossible for the fetus to develop. In rare cases, these problems are related to the mother's or father's genes.\nOther possible causes of miscarriage may include:\nDrug or\nalcohol use\nBlood clotting disorders\nExposure to environmental toxins\nHormone problems\nInfection\nObesity\nPhysical problems with the mother's reproductive organs\nProblem with the body's immune response\nSerious body-wide (\nsystemic\n) diseases in the mother (such as uncontrolled\ndiabetes\n)\nSmoking\nAround half of all fertilized eggs die and are lost (aborted) spontaneously, usually before the woman knows she is pregnant. Among women who know they are pregnant, about 10% to 25% will have a miscarriage. Most miscarriages occur during the first 7 weeks of pregnancy."}

This is done to determine if it was a normal placenta or a rare condition known as a\nhydatidiform mole\n. It is also important to find out whether any pregnancy tissue remains in the uterus. In rare cases an ectopic pregnancy can look like a miscarriage. If you have passed tissue, ask your provider if the tissue should be sent for genetic testing. This can be helpful to determine if a treatable cause of miscarriage is present.\nIf the pregnancy tissue does not naturally leave the body, you may be closely watched for up to 2 weeks."}

Any further vaginal bleeding should be carefully monitored. It is often possible to become pregnant immediately. It is suggested that you wait one normal menstrual cycle before trying to become pregnant again.\nPossible Complications\nIn rare cases, complications of miscarriage can occur.\nAn infected abortion may occur if any tissue from the placenta or fetus remains in the uterus after the miscarriage. Symptoms of an infection include fever, vaginal bleeding that does not stop, cramping, and a foul-smelling vaginal discharge. Infections can be serious and need immediate medical attention.\nWomen who lose a fetus after 20 weeks of pregnancy receive different medical care. This is called\npremature delivery\nor fetal demise."}

If your feelings of sadness do not go away or get worse, seek advice from family and friends as well as your provider. However, for most couples, a history of a miscarriage doesn't reduce the chances of having a healthy baby in the future.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you:\nHave vaginal bleeding with or without cramping during pregnancy.\nAre pregnant and notice tissue or clot-like material that passes through your vagina. Collect the material and bring it to your provider for examination.\nPrevention\nEarly, complete prenatal care is the best prevention for complications of pregnancy, such as miscarriage.\nMiscarriages that are caused by systemic diseases can be prevented by detecting and treating the disease before pregnancy occurs.\nMiscarriages are also less likely if you avoid things that are harmful to your pregnancy."}

This means there is a risk for miscarriage. But it does not mean one will definitely occur. A pregnant woman who develops any signs or symptoms of\nthreatened miscarriage\nshould contact her prenatal provider instantly.\nTaking a prenatal vitamin which contains folic acid before you become pregnant and during pregnancy can greatly lower the chances of miscarriage and certain birth defects.\nAlternative Names\nAbortion - spontaneous; Spontaneous abortion; Abortion - missed; Abortion - incomplete; Abortion - complete; Abortion - inevitable; Abortion - infected; Missed abortion; Incomplete abortion; Complete abortion; Inevitable abortion; Infected abortion\nImages\nNormal uterine anatomy (cut section)\nReferences\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists website."}
