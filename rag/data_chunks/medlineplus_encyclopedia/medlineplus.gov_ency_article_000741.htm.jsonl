Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nOptic neuritis\nOptic neuritis\nThe optic nerve carries images of what the eye sees to the brain. When this nerve become swollen or inflamed, it is called optic neuritis. It may cause sudden, reduced vision in the affected eye.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of optic neuritis is unknown.\nThe optic nerve carries visual information from your eye to the brain. The nerve can swell when it becomes inflamed. The swelling can damage nerve fibers. This can cause short or long-term loss of vision.\nConditions that have been linked with optic neuritis include:\nAutoimmune diseases\n, including\nlupus\n,\nsarcoidosis\n, and BehÃ§et disease\nCryptococcosis\n, a fungal infection\nBacterial infections, including tuberculosis, syphilis,\nLyme disease\n, and\nmeningitis\nViral infections, including viral\nencephalitis\n,\nmeasles\n,\nrubella\n,\nchickenpox\n,\nherpes zoster\n,\nmumps\n, and mononucleosis\nRespiratory infections, including\nmycoplasma pneumonia\nand other common upper respiratory tract infections\nMultiple sclerosis\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nLoss of vision\nin one eye over an hour or a few hours"}

Tests may include:\nColor vision testing\nMRI of the brain\n, including special images of the optic nerve\nVisual acuity testing\nVisual field testing\nExamination of the optic disc using indirect\nophthalmoscopy\nTreatment\nVision often returns to normal within 2 to 3 weeks with no treatment.\nCorticosteroids given through a vein (IV) or taken by mouth (oral) may speed up recovery. However, the final vision is no better with steroids than without. Oral steroids may actually increase the chance of recurrence.\nIf tests suggest that there is also multiple sclerosis, other types of treatment may be helpful.\nFurther tests may be needed to try to find the cause of the neuritis."}

If there is a condition causing the problem, it may be able to be treated.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWhen optic neuritis occurs without other diseases, there is a better prognosis. An MRI is an important test because it can help predict if multiple sclerosis or other similar autoimmune diseases are present or may develop.\nOptic neuritis caused by multiple sclerosis or other autoimmune diseases has a poorer outlook."}
