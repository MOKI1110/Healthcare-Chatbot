Babies with this disorder are born with severe\njaundice\n.\nCauses\nTransient familial hyperbilirubinemia is an inherited disorder. It occurs when the body does not properly break down (metabolize) a certain form of\nbilirubin\n. Bilirubin levels rapidly build up in the body. The high levels are poisonous to the brain and can cause death.\nSymptoms\nThe newborn may have:\nYellow skin (jaundice)\nYellow eyes (icterus)\nLethargy\nIf untreated, seizures and neurologic problems (kernicterus) may develop.\nExams and Tests\nBlood tests for bilirubin levels can identify the severity of the jaundice.\nTreatment\nPhototherapy\nwith blue light is used to treat the high level of bilirubin. An\nexchange transfusion\nis sometimes necessary if the levels are extremely high.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nBabies who are treated can have a good outcome."}

If the condition is not treated, severe complications develop. This disorder tends to improve with time.\nPossible Complications\nDeath or severe brain and nervous system (neurological) problems can occur if the condition is not treated.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nThis problem is most often found immediately after delivery. However, contact your health care provider if you notice your baby's skin turning yellow. There are other causes for jaundice in the newborn that are easily treated.\nGenetic counseling can help families understand the condition, its risks of recurring, and how to care for the person.\nPrevention\nPhototherapy can help prevent serious complications of this disorder.\nAlternative Names\nLucey-Driscoll syndrome\nReferences\nKorenblat KM.
