Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMeningitis\nMeningitis\nMeningitis is an infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord. This covering is called the meninges.\nCauses\nThe most common causes of meningitis are viral infections. These infections usually get better without treatment. Bacterial meningitis infections, however, are very serious. They may result in death or brain damage, even if treated. A\nlumbar puncture\n(or spinal tap) is required to determine the specific cause.\nMeningitis may also be caused by:\nChemical irritation\nMedicine allergies\nFungi\nParasites\nTumors\nMany types of viruses can cause meningitis:\nEnteroviruses: These are viruses that also can cause intestinal illness.\nHerpes viruses: These are the same viruses that can cause\ncold sores\nand\ngenital herpes\n. However, people with cold sores or genital herpes do not have a higher chance of developing herpes meningitis.\nHIV: This virus can cause meningitis during the early stages of HIV infection.\nMumps virus\n: This virus causes a contagious disease that leads to painful swelling of the salivary glands."}

Meningitis is a complication of a mumps infection.\nWest Nile virus\n: This virus is spread by mosquito bites and is an important cause of viral meningitis in most of the United States.\nSymptoms\nEnteroviral meningitis occurs more often than bacterial meningitis and is milder. It usually occurs in the late summer and early fall. It most often affects children and adults under age 30. Symptoms may include:\nHeadache\nSensitivity to light (\nphotophobia\n)\nSlight fever\nUpset stomach and diarrhea\nFatigue\nBacterial meningitis is an emergency. You will need immediate treatment in a hospital."}

Antibiotics do not treat viral meningitis. However, antiviral medicine may be given to those with herpes meningitis.\nOther treatments will include:\nFluids through a vein (\nintravenous\n)\nMedicines to treat symptoms, such as brain swelling,\nshock\n, and\nseizures\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nEarly diagnosis and treatment of bacterial meningitis is essential to prevent permanent neurological damage."}
