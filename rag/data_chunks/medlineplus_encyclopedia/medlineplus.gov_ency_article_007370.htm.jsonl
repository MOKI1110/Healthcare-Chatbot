Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nImplantable cardioverter-defibrillator\nImplantable cardioverter-defibrillator\nAn implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is a device that detects a life-threatening, rapid heartbeat. This abnormal heartbeat is called an\narrhythmia\n. If it occurs, the ICD quickly sends an electrical shock to the heart. The shock changes the rhythm back to normal. This is called defibrillation.\nDescription\nAn ICD is made up of these parts:\nThe pulse generator is about the size of a large pocket watch. It contains a battery and electrical circuits that read the electrical activity of your heart.\nThe electrodes are wires, also called leads, that go through your veins to your heart. They connect your heart to the rest of the device. Your ICD may have 1, 2, or 3 electrodes.\nMost ICDs have a built-in\npacemaker\n. Your heart may need pacing if it is beating too slowly or too fast, or if you have had a shock from the ICD.\nThere is a special kind of ICD called a subcutaneous ICD."}

Your heart may need pacing if it is beating too slowly or too fast, or if you have had a shock from the ICD.\nThere is a special kind of ICD called a subcutaneous ICD. This device has a lead that is placed in the tissue to the left of the breastbone rather than in the heart. This type of ICD cannot also be a pacemaker.\nA cardiologist or surgeon most often will insert your ICD when you are awake. The area of your chest wall below your collarbone will be numbed with anesthesia, so you will not feel pain. The clinician will make an incision (cut) through your skin and create space under your skin and muscle for the ICD generator. In most cases, this space is made near your left shoulder.\nThe clinician will place the electrode into a vein, then into your heart. This is done using a special x-ray to see inside your chest. Then the clinician will connect the electrodes to the pulse generator and pacemaker.\nThe procedure most often takes 2 to 3 hours.\nSome people with certain conditions will have a special device that combines a defibrillator and biventricular pacemaker placed."}

These include\nventricular tachycardia\n(VT) or\nventricular fibrillation\n(VF).\nReasons you may be at high risk are:\nYou have had episodes of one of these abnormal heart rhythms.\nYour heart is weakened, too large, and does not pump blood very well."}

Even though a shock lasts a very short time, you can feel it in most cases.\nThis and other ICD problems can sometimes be prevented by changing how your ICD is programmed. It can also be set to sound an alert if there is a problem."}

You may be asked to wash your whole body below your neck with a special soap.\nYou may also be asked to take an antibiotic to guard against infection.\nOn the day of the surgery:\nYou will usually be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before your surgery. This includes chewing gum and breath mints."}

Rinse your mouth with water if it feels dry, but be careful not to swallow.\nTake the medicines you have been told to take with just a small sip of water.\nYou will be told when to arrive at the hospital.\nAfter the Procedure\nMost people who have an ICD implanted are able to go home from the hospital in 1 day. Most quickly they return to their normal activity level. Full recovery takes about 4 to 6 weeks.\nAsk your cardiologist or surgeon how much you can use the arm on the side of your body where the ICD was placed. You may be advised not to lift anything heavier than 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to  6.75 kilograms) and to avoid pushing, pulling, or twisting your arm for 2 to 3 weeks. You may also be told not to raise your arm above your shoulder for several weeks.\nWhen you leave the hospital, you will be given a card to keep in your wallet. This card lists the details of your ICD and has contact information for emergencies."}
