Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCatecholamine blood test\nCatecholamine blood test\nThis test measures the levels of catecholamines in the blood. Catecholamines are hormones made by the adrenal glands. The three catecholamines are epinephrine (adrenaline), norepinephrine, and dopamine.\nCatecholamines are more often measured with a\nurine test\nthan with a blood test.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will likely be told not to eat anything (fast) for 10 hours before the test. You may be allowed to drink water during this time.\nThe accuracy of the test can be affected by certain foods and medicines. Foods that can increase catecholamine levels include:\nCoffee\nTea\nBananas\nChocolate\nCocoa\nCitrus fruits\nVanilla\nYou should not eat these foods for several days before the test. This is especially true if both blood and urine catecholamines are to be measured.\nYou should also avoid stressful situations and vigorous exercise."}

Others feel a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nCatecholamines are released into the blood when a person is under physical or emotional stress."}

This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nCatecholamines are released into the blood when a person is under physical or emotional stress. The main catecholamines are dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine (which used to be called adrenalin).\nThis test is used to diagnose or check for certain rare tumors, such as\npheochromocytoma\nor\nneuroblastoma\n. It may also be done in people with those conditions to determine if treatment is working.\nNormal Results\nThe normal range for epinephrine is 0 to 140 pg/mL (0 to 764.3 pmol/L).\nThe normal range for norepinephrine is 70 to 1700 pg/mL (413.8 to 10048.7 pmol/L).\nThe normal range for dopamine is 0 to 30 pg/mL (0 to 195.8 pmol/L).\nNote: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}
