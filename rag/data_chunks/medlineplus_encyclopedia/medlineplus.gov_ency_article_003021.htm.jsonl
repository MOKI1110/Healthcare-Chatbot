This may just be normal, and the child may outgrow it.\nConsiderations\nChildren should have regular, well-baby check-ups with their health care providers. These checkups are usually scheduled at the following times:\n2 to 4 weeks\n2 ½ years\nAnnually thereafter\nRelated topics include:\nDevelopmental milestones record - 2 months\nDevelopmental milestones record - 4 months\nDevelopmental milestones record - 6 months\nDevelopmental milestones record - 9 months\nDevelopmental milestones record - 12 months\nDevelopmental milestones record - 18 months\nDevelopmental milestones record - 2 years\nDevelopmental milestones record - 3 years\nDevelopmental milestones record - 4 years\nDevelopmental milestones record - 5 years\nCauses\nConstitutional growth delay refers to children who are small for their age but are growing at a normal rate. Puberty is often late in these children.\nThese children continue to grow after most of their peers have stopped."}

Puberty is often late in these children.\nThese children continue to grow after most of their peers have stopped. Most of the time, they will reach an adult height similar to their parents' height. However, other causes of growth delay must be checked for.\nGenetics may also play a role. One or both parents may be short. Short but healthy parents may have a healthy child who is in the shortest 5% for their age. These children are short, but they should reach the height of one or both of their parents.\nDelayed or slower-than-expected growth can be caused by many different things, including:\nChronic disease\nEndocrine disorders\nEmotional health\nInfection\nPoor nutrition\nMany children with delayed growth also have delays in development.\nHome Care\nIf slow weight gain is due to a lack of calories, try feeding the child on demand. Increase the amount of food offered to the child. Offer nutritional, high-calorie foods.\nIt is very important to prepare formula exactly according to directions."}

Do not water down (dilute) ready-to-feed formula.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you are concerned about your child's growth. Medical evaluations are important even if you think developmental delays or emotional issues may be contributing to a child's delayed growth.\nIf your child is not growing due to a lack of calories, your provider can refer you to a nutrition expert who can help you choose the right foods to offer your child.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nThe provider will examine the child and measure height, weight, and\nhead circumference\n. You will be asked questions about your child's medical history, including:\nHas the child always been on the low end of the growth charts?\nDid the child's growth start out normal and then slow down?\nIs the child developing normal social skills and physical skills?\nDoes the child eat well?"}
