Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHis bundle electrography\nHis bundle electrography\nHis bundle electrography is a test that measures electrical activity in a part of the heart that carries the signals that control the time between heartbeats (contractions).\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe bundle of His is a group of fibers that carry electrical impulses through the center of the heart. If these signals are blocked, you will have problems with your heartbeat.\nWatch this video about:\nCardiac conduction system\nThe His bundle electrography is part of an\nelectrophysiology\nstudy (EPS). An\nintravenous\ncatheter (IV line) is inserted into your arm so that you can be given medicines during the test.\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG) leads are placed on your arms and legs. Your arm, neck, or groin will be cleaned and numbed with a local anesthetic. After the area is numb, the cardiologist (heart doctor) makes a small cut in a vein and inserts a thin tube called a catheter inside.\nThe catheter is carefully moved through the vein up into the heart."}

An\nx-ray\nmethod called fluoroscopy helps guide the doctor to the right place. During the test, you are watched for any abnormal heartbeats (\narrhythmias\n). The catheter has a sensor on the end, which is used to measure the electrical activity of the bundle of His.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will be told not to eat or drink anything for 6 to 8 hours before the test. The test will be done in a hospital. Some people may need to check into the hospital the night before the test. Otherwise, you will check in the morning of the test. Although the test may take some time, most people do not need to stay in the hospital overnight.\nYour health care provider will explain the procedure and its risks. You must sign a consent form before the test starts.\nAbout half an hour before the procedure, you will be given a mild sedative to help you relax. You will wear a hospital gown. The procedure may last from 1 to several hours.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou are awake during the test."}

You may feel some discomfort when the IV is placed into your arm, and some pressure at the site when the catheter is inserted.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test may be done to:\nDetermine if you need a pacemaker or other treatment\nDiagnose arrhythmias\nFind the specific location where electrical signals through the heart are blocked\nNormal Results\nThe time it takes for the electrical signals to travel through the bundle of His is normal.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA pacemaker may be needed if the test results are abnormal.\nRisks\nRisks of the procedure include:\nArrhythmias\nCardiac tamponade\nEmbolism from blood clots at the tip of the catheter\nHeart attack\nHemorrhage\nInfection\nInjury to the vein or artery\nLow blood pressure\nStroke\nAlternative Names\nHis bundle electrogram; HBE; His bundle recording; Electrogram - His bundle; Arrhythmia - His; Heart block - His\nImages\nECG\nReferences\nCurtis AB, Tomaselli GF.
