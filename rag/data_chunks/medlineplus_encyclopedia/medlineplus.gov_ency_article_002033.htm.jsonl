It forms around the hips, thighs, and buttocks. Cellulite deposits cause the skin to look dimpled.\nInformation\nEveryone has layers of fat under the skin, so even thin people can have cellulite. Collagen fibers that connect fat to the skin may stretch, break down, or pull tight. This allows fat cells to bulge out.\nYour genes may play a part in whether or not you have cellulite. Other factors may include:\nSex and race/ethnicity\nHow your body burns energy\nHormone changes\nDehydration\nCellulite is not harmful to your health. Most health care providers consider cellulite a normal condition for many women and some men.\nMany people seek treatment for cellulite because they are bothered by how it looks. Talk to your provider about treatment options."}
