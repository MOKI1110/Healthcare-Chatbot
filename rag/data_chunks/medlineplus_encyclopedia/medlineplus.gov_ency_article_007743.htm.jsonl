Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAcute flaccid myelitis\nAcute flaccid myelitis\nAcute flaccid myelitis (AFM) is a rare condition that affects the nervous system. Inflammation of the gray matter in the spinal cord leads to muscle weakness and paralysis.\nAFM is usually caused by an infection with a virus. While AFM is rare, there has been a slight increase in cases of AFM since 2014. Most new cases have occurred in children or young adults.\nCauses\nAFM usually occurs after a\ncold\n, fever, or gastrointestinal illness.\nDifferent kinds of viruses may be the cause of AFM. These include:\nEnteroviruses (\npoliovirus\nand non-poliovirus)\nWest Nile virus\nand similar viruses such as Japanese encephalitis virus and Saint Louis encephalitis virus\nAdenoviruses\nIt is unclear why certain viruses trigger AFM, or why some people develop the condition and others don't.\nEnvironmental toxins also can cause AFM."}

In many cases, a cause is never found.\nSymptoms\nA fever or a respiratory illness is often present before weakness and other symptoms begin.\nAFM symptoms often start with sudden muscle weakness and loss of reflexes in an arm or leg. Symptoms may progress rapidly over a few hours to days. Other symptoms may include:\nFacial droop or weakness\nDrooping eyelids\nDifficulty moving the eyes\nSlurred speech\nor\ndifficulty swallowing\nSome people may have:\nStiffness in the neck\nPain in the arms or legs\nInability to pass urine\nSevere symptoms include:\nRespiratory failure, when muscles involved in breathing become weak\nSerious nervous system problems, which may lead to death\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will take your medical history and vaccination history to know if you are up-to-date with your polio vaccines. Unvaccinated individuals who are exposed to poliovirus are at higher risk for AFM."}

Tests that may be done include:\nMRI of spine\nand\nMRI of the brain\nto view lesions in the gray matter\nNerve conduction velocity test\nElectromyography (EMG)\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis\nto check if white blood cells are elevated\nYour provider also may take stool, blood, and saliva samples to test.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for AFM. You may be referred to a doctor specializing in disorders of the nerves and nervous system (neurologist)."}
