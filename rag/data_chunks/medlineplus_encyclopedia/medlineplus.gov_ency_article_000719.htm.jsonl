Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCerebral amyloid angiopathy\nCerebral amyloid angiopathy\nCerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a condition in which proteins called amyloid build up on the walls of the arteries in the brain. CAA causes bleeding into the brain (\nhemorrhagic stroke\n) and\ndementia\n.\nCauses\nPeople with CAA have deposits of amyloid protein in the walls of blood vessels in the brain. The protein is usually not deposited anywhere else in the body.\nThe major risk factor is increasing age. CAA is more often seen in people older than 55. Sometimes, it is passed down through families.\nSymptoms\nCAA can cause bleeding into the brain. Bleeding often occurs in the outer parts of the brain, called the cortex, and not the deep areas. Symptoms occur because bleeding in the brain harms brain tissue. Some people have gradual memory problems. When a CT scan is done, there are often signs that they have had bleeding in the brain that they may not have realized.\nIf there is a lot of bleeding, immediate symptoms occur and resemble a stroke."}

This is usually done after death or when a biopsy of the blood vessels of the brain is done.\nA physical exam can be normal if the bleed is small. There may be some brain function changes. It is important for your health care provider to ask detailed questions about the symptoms and medical history."}

The goal of treatment is to reduce risk by modifying risk factors, such as hypertension, and to relieve symptoms. In some cases, rehabilitation is needed for weakness or clumsiness."}
