It is done while the bladder is emptying.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is performed in a hospital radiology department or in a health care provider's office.\nYou will lie on your back on the x-ray table. A thin, flexible tube called a catheter will be inserted into the urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body) and passed into the bladder.\nContrast dye flows through the catheter into the bladder. This dye helps the bladder show up better on x-ray images.\nThe x-rays are taken from various angles while the bladder is full of contrast dye. The catheter is removed so that you can urinate. Images are taken while you empty your bladder.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou must sign a consent form. You will be given a gown to wear.\nRemove all jewelry before the test."}
