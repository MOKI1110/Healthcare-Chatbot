Seizures are episodes of uncontrolled and abnormal electrical activity of brain cells that may cause changes in attention or behavior, such as bodily movements.\nCauses\nEpilepsy occurs when changes in the brain cause it to be too excitable or irritable. As a result, the brain cells send out abnormal electrical signals. This leads to repeated, unpredictable seizures. (A single seizure that does not happen again is not epilepsy.)\nEpilepsy may be due to a medical condition or injury that affects the brain."}

However, they're more common in young children and people age 65 years and older. There may be a family history of seizures or epilepsy.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms vary from person to person.

The type of seizure depends on the part of the brain that is affected.\nMost of the time, for people with epilepsy, their seizures are similar to ones before it. Some people with epilepsy have a strange sensation before each seizure. Sensations may be tingling, smelling an odor that is not actually there, or emotional changes. This is called an aura.\nYour health care provider can tell you more about the specific type of seizure you may have:\nAbsence seizures\n(also called non-motor seizures) include seizures involving a change in behavior but without changes in motor movement (such as staring spells). They may occur along with generalized seizures.\nFocal onset seizures\nmay occur with no change in awareness. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain is affected. These seizures may spread to the whole brain.\nGeneralized seizures\ninvolve both sides of the brain and cause impaired awareness. Abnormal movements involving the whole body are often present."}

In this case, your provider may recommend surgery to:\nRemove the abnormal brain cells causing the seizures.\nPlace a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS). This device is similar to a heart pacemaker. It can help reduce the number of seizures.\nSome children are placed on a special diet to help prevent seizures. The most popular one is the ketogenic diet.
