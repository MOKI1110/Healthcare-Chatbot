Removing the source of irritation may cause the patch to disappear.\nTreat dental causes such as rough teeth, irregular denture surface, or fillings as soon as possible.\nStop smoking or using other tobacco products.\nDo not drink alcohol.\nIf removing the source of the irritation does not work, your health care provider may suggest applying medicine to the patch or using surgery to remove it.\nFor oral hairy leukoplakia, taking antiviral medicine usually causes the patch to disappear. Your provider may also suggest applying medicine to the patch.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nLeukoplakia is usually harmless. Patches in the mouth often clear up in a few weeks or months after the source of irritation is removed.\nIn some cases, the patches may be an early sign of cancer.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider for an appointment if you have any patches that look like leukoplakia or hairy leukoplakia.\nPrevention\nStop smoking and do not use other tobacco products."}
