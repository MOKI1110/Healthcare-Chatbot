This tissue is called the pleura.\nHow the Test is Performed\nAn open pleural biopsy is done in the hospital using\ngeneral anesthesia\n. This means you will be asleep and pain free. A tube will be placed through your mouth down your throat into your windpipe (trachea) to help you breathe.\nThe surgery is done in the following way:\nAfter cleaning the skin, the surgeon makes a small cut in the left or right side of the chest.\nThe ribs are gently separated.\nA scope may be inserted to see the area to be biopsied.\nTissue is taken from inside the chest and sent to a lab for examination.\nAfter surgery, the wound is closed with stitches.\nYour surgeon may decide to leave a small plastic tube in your chest to prevent air and fluid from building up.\nYour breathing tube may not be able to be removed right after surgery."}

So, you may need to be on a\nbreathing machine\nfor some time.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou should tell your surgeon if you are pregnant, allergic to any medicines, or if you have a bleeding problem. Be sure to tell your surgeon about all the medicines you take, including herbs, supplements, and those bought without a prescription.\nFollow your surgeon's instructions for not eating or drinking before the procedure.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen you wake up after the procedure, you will feel drowsy for several hours.\nThere will be some tenderness and pain where the surgical cut is located. Most surgeons inject a long-acting local anesthetic at the surgical cut site so that you will have very little pain right afterward.\nYou may have a sore throat from the breathing tube. You can ease the pain by eating ice chips.\nYou may have a tube in your chest to remove air."}

This will be removed later.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis procedure is used when the surgeon needs a larger piece of tissue than can be removed with a\npleural needle biopsy\n. The test is most often done to check for\nmesothelioma\n, a type of tumor that affects the pleura.\nIt is also done when there is fluid in the chest cavity, or when a direct view of the pleura and the lungs is needed.\nThis procedure may also be done to examine a\nmetastatic pleural tumor\n."}
