The neurostimulator is like a heart pacemaker. It is usually placed under the skin below the collarbone, but may be placed under the skin in another area of the body\nIn some people another thin, insulated wire called an extension is added to connect the lead to the neurostimulator\nSurgery is done to place each part of the neurostimulator system. In adults, the whole system can be placed in 1 or 2 stages (two separate surgeries).\nStage 1 is usually done under local anesthesia, meaning you are awake, but pain-free."}

In adults, the whole system can be placed in 1 or 2 stages (two separate surgeries).\nStage 1 is usually done under local anesthesia, meaning you are awake, but pain-free. (In children, general anesthesia is given.)\nYour surgeon may shave some hair prior to making the skin incisions.\nYour head may be placed in a special frame using small screws to keep it still during the procedure. Numbing medicine is applied where the screws contact the scalp. Sometimes, the procedure is done in the\nMRI\nmachine and a frame is on top of your head rather than around your head.\nNumbing medicine is applied to your scalp at the site where the surgeon will open the skin, then drill a small opening (burr hole) in the skull and place the lead into a specific area of the brain.\nIf both sides of your brain are being treated, the surgeon makes an opening on each side of the skull, and two leads are inserted.\nElectrical impulses may need to be sent through the lead to make sure it is connected to the area of the brain responsible for your symptoms.\nYou may be asked questions, to read cards, or describe images. You may also be asked to move your legs or arms."}

You may also be asked to move your legs or arms. These are to make sure the electrodes are in the right positions and the expected effect is achieved.\nStage 2 is done under general anesthesia, meaning you are asleep and pain-free. The timing of this stage of surgery depends on where in the brain the stimulator will be placed.\nThe surgeon makes a small opening (incision), usually just below the collarbone and implants the neurostimulator under the skin. (Sometimes it is placed under the skin in the lower chest or belly area.)\nThe extension wire is tunneled under the skin of the head, neck, and shoulder and connected to the neurostimulator.\nThe incision is closed. The device and wires are under the skin and can appear as a slight bump.\nOnce connected, electric pulses travel from the neurostimulator, along the extension wire, to the lead, and into the brain."}

DBS does not cure Parkinson disease, but can help reduce symptoms such as:\nTremors\nRigidity\nStiffness\nSlow movements\nWalking problems\nDBS may also be used to treat the following conditions:\nMajor depression\nthat does not respond well to medicines\nObsessive-compulsive disorder\n(OCD)\nPain that does not go away (chronic pain)\nSevere\nobesity\nShaking movement that cannot be controlled and the cause is unknown (\nessential tremor\n)\nTourette syndrome\n(in rare cases)\nUncontrolled or slow movement (\ndystonia\n)\nEpilepsy\nRisks\nDBS is considered safe and effective when done in the right people.\nRisks of DBS placement may include:\nAllergic reaction to the DBS parts\nProblem concentrating\nDizziness\nInfection\nLeakage of cerebrospinal fluid, which can lead to he"}
