Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHeart MRI\nHeart MRI\nHeart\nmagnetic resonance imaging\nis an imaging method that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the heart. It does not use radiation (x-rays).\nSingle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images are called slices. The images can be stored on a computer or printed on film. One exam produces dozens or sometimes hundreds of images.\nThe test may be done as part of a\nchest MRI\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou may be asked to wear a hospital gown or clothing without metal fasteners (such as sweatpants and a t-shirt). Some types of metal can cause blurry images or be attracted to the powerful magnet.\nYou will lie on a narrow table, which slides into a large tunnel-like tube.\nSome exams require a special dye (contrast). The dye is most often given before the test through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. The dye helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly. This is different from the dye used for a CT scan.\nDuring the MRI, the person who operates the machine will watch you from another room."}

The test most often lasts 30 to 60 minutes but may take longer.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan.\nTell your health care provider if you are afraid of close spaces (have claustrophobia). You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious, or your provider may suggest an \"open\" MRI, in which the machine is not as close to the body.\nBefore the test, tell your provider if you have:\nBrain aneurysm clips\nCertain types of artificial heart valves\nHeart defibrillator or pacemaker\nInner ear (cochlear) implants\nKidney disease or dialysis (you may not be able to receive contrast)\nRecently placed artificial joints\nCertain types of vascular\nstents\nWorked with sheet metal in the past (you may need tests to check for metal pieces in your eyes)\nBecause the MRI contains strong magnets, metal objects are not allowed into the room with the MRI scanner:\nPens, pocketknives, and eyeglasses may fly across the room.\nIte"}

Some people may become anxious when inside the scanner. If you have a hard time lying still or are very anxious, you may be given medicine to relax. Too much movement can blur MRI images and cause errors.\nThe table may be hard or cold, but you can ask for a blanket or pillow. The machine produces loud thumping and humming noises when turned on. You may be given ear plugs to help reduce the noise.\nAn intercom in the scanner allows you to speak to the person operating the exam at any time. Some MRI scanners have televisions and special headphones to help pass the time.\nThere is no recovery time, unless sedation was necessary."}

(You will need someone to drive you home if sedation was given.) After an MRI scan, you can resume your normal diet, activity, and medicines, unless your provider tells you otherwise.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nMRI provides detailed pictures of the heart and blood vessels from many views. Often, it is used when more information is needed after you have had an echocardiogram or heart CT scan. MRI is more accurate than CT scan or other tests for certain conditions, but less accurate for others.\nHeart MRI may be used to evaluate or diagnose:\nHeart muscle damage after a heart attack\nBirth defects of the heart\nHeart tumors and growths\nWeakening or other problems with the heart muscle\nSymptoms of heart failure\nValve disease or shunts\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be due to many things, including:\nHeart valve disorders\nFluid in the sac-like covering around the heart (\npericardial effusion\n)\nTumor of the blood vessels or around the heart\nAtrial myxoma\nor another growth or tumo"}

The magnetic fields and radio waves used during the scan have not been shown to cause any significant side effects.\nAllergic reactions to the dye used during the exam are rare. The most common type of contrast (dye) used is gadolinium. It is very safe. The person operating the machine will monitor your heart rate and breathing as needed."}
