They may be noticed more when babies begin to eat solid foods.\nDiaper rashes caused by infection with a yeast (fungus) called candida are very common in children. Candida grows best in warm, moist places, such as under a diaper. Candida diaper rash is more likely to occur in babies who:\nAre not kept clean and dry\nAre taking antibiotics or whose mothers are taking antibiotics while breastfeeding\nHave more frequent stools\nOther causes of diaper rash include:\nAcids in the stool (seen more often when the child has diarrhea)\nAmmonia (a chemical produced when bacteria break down urine)\nDiapers that are too tight or rub the skin\nReactions to soaps and other products used to clean cloth diapers\nSymptoms\nYou may notice the following in your child's diaper area:\nBright red rash that gets bigger\nVery  red and scaly areas on the scrotum and penis in boys\nRed or scaly areas on the labia and vagina in girls"}

A\nKOH test\ncan confirm if it is candida.\nTreatment\nThe best treatment for a diaper rash is to keep the skin clean and dry. This also helps prevent new diaper rashes. Lay your baby on a towel without a diaper whenever possible. The more time the baby can be kept out of a diaper, the better.\nOther tips include:\nAlways wash your hands before and after changing a diaper.\nChange your baby's diaper often and as soon as possible after the baby urinates or passes stool.\nUse water and a soft cloth or cotton ball to gently clean the diaper area with every diaper change. Do not rub or scrub the area."}

Do not rub or scrub the area. A squirt bottle of water may be used for sensitive areas.\nPat the area dry or allow to air-dry.\nPut diapers on loosely. Diapers that are too tight do not allow enough air flow and may rub and irritate the baby's waist or thighs.\nUsing absorbent diapers helps keep the skin dry and reduces the chance of getting an infection.\nAsk your provider or nurse which creams, ointments, or powders are best to use in the diaper area.\nAsk if a diaper rash cream would be helpful. Zinc oxide or petroleum jelly-based products help keep moisture away from your baby's skin when applied to completely clean, dry skin.\nDo not use wipes that have alcohol or perfume. They may dry out or irritate the skin more.\nDo not use talc (talcum powder). It can get into your baby's lungs.\nCertain skin creams and ointments will clear up infections caused by yeast. Nystatin, miconazole, clotrimazole, and ketoconazole are commonly used medicines for yeast diaper rashes."}

Nystatin, miconazole, clotrimazole, and ketoconazole are commonly used medicines for yeast diaper rashes. For severe rashes, a steroid ointment, such as 1% hydrocortisone, may be applied. You can buy these without a prescription. But first ask your provider if these medicines will help.\nIf you use cloth diapers:\nDo not put plastic or rubber pants over the diaper. They do not allow enough air to pass through. Use breathable diaper covers instead.\nDo not use fabric softeners or dryer sheets. They may make the rash worse.\nWhen washing cloth diapers, rinse 2 or 3 times to remove all soap if your child already has a rash or has had one before.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe rash usually responds well to treatment.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your child's provider if:\nThe rash gets worse or does not go away in 2 to 3 days\nThe rash spreads to the abdomen, back, arms, or face\nYou notice pimples, blisters, ulcers, large bumps, or sores filled with pus\nYour baby also has a fever\nYour baby develops a rash during the first 6 weeks after birth\nAlternative Names\nDermatitis - diaper and Candi"}
