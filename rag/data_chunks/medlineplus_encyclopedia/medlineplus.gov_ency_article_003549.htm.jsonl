Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing where the needle was inserted.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to diagnose certain infections and find the cause of\nhemolytic anemia\n(a type of anemia that occurs when red blood cells are destroyed)."}

Knowing whether there are warm or cold agglutinins can help explain why the hemolytic anemia is occurring and direct treatment.\nNormal Results\nNormal results are:\nWarm agglutinins: no agglutination in titers at or below 1:80\nCold agglutinins: no agglutination in titers at or below 1:16\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}
