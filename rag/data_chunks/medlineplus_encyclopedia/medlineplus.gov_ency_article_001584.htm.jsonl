The cause is unknown. It is thought to be due to the effects of weight on the growth plate. The inner part of the shin bone, just below the knee, fails to develop normally.\nUnlike\nbowlegs\n, which tend to straighten as the child develops, Blount disease slowly gets worse. It can cause severe bowing of one or both legs.\nThis condition is more common among African American children. It is also associated with obesity and early walking.\nSymptoms\nOne or both of the lower legs turn inward. This is called \"bowing.\" It may:\nLook the same on both legs\nOccur just below the knee\nRapidly get worse\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will examine you. This will show that the lower legs turn inward."}

An\nx-ray of the knee\nand the lower leg confirms the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nBraces are used to treat children who develop severe bowing before the age of 3.\nSurgery is most often needed if braces do not work, or if the problem is not diagnosed until the child is older. Surgery may involve cutting the shin bone to place it in the proper position. Sometimes, the bone will be lengthened as well.\nOther times, surgery is done to restrict the growth of the outer half of the shin bone. This allows the child's natural growth to reverse the bowing process. This is a much smaller surgery. It works best in children with less severe symptoms who still have quite a bit of growing to do.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf the leg can be placed into the proper position, the outlook is good. The leg should work properly and look normal.\nPossible Complications\nFailure to treat Blount disease may lead to progressive deformity."}

The condition may lead to differences in leg lengths, which can result in disability if not treated.\nBlount disease may come back after surgery, especially in younger children.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your child's provider if your child's leg or legs appear to be bowing. Also contact the provider if your child has bowed legs that appear to be getting worse.\nPrevention\nWeight loss may be helpful for overweight children.\nAlternative Names\nBlount's disease; Tibia vara\nImages\nAnterior skeletal anatomy\nReferences\nSheffer BW.
