It is common in premature babies.\nCauses\nAny disorder that leads to high levels of calcium in the blood or urine may lead to nephrocalcinosis. In this disorder, calcium deposits in the kidney tissue itself. Most of the time, both kidneys are affected.\nNephrocalcinosis is related to, but not the same as,\nkidney stones\n(nephrolithiasis).\nConditions that can cause nephrocalcinosis include:\nAlport syndrome\nBartter syndrome\nChronic\nglomerulonephritis\nFamilial hypomagnesemia\nMedullary sponge kidney\nPrimary hyperoxaluria\nRenal transplant rejection\nRenal tubular acidosis\n(RTA)\nRenal\ncortical\nnecrosis\nOther possible causes of nephrocalcinosis include:\nEthylene glycol toxicity\nHypercalcemia\n(excess calcium in the blood) due to\nhyperparathyroidism\nor other medical conditions\nHypercalciuria (excess calcium in the urine)\nUse of certain medicines, such as acetazolamide, amphotericin B, and triamterene\nSarcoidosis\nTuberculosis\nof the kidney and infe"}

Options include making changes in your diet and taking medicines and supplements.\nIf you take medicine that causes calcium loss, your health care provider will tell you to stop taking it."}

Never stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.\nOther symptoms, including kidney stones, should be treated as appropriate.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWhat to expect depends on the complications and cause of the disorder.\nProper treatment may help prevent further deposits in the kidneys. In most cases, there is no way to remove deposits that have already formed. Many deposits of calcium in the kidneys do not always mean severe damage to the kidneys.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nAcute kidney failure\nLong-term (chronic) kidney failure\nKidney stones\nObstructive uropathy\n(acute or chronic, unilateral or bilateral)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you know you have a disorder that causes high levels of calcium in your blood and urine. Also call if you develop symptoms of nephrocalcinosis.\nPrevention\nPrompt treatment of disorders that lead to nephrocalcinosis, including RTA, may help prevent it from developing."}
