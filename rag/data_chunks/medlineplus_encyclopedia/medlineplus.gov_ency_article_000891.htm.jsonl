It may happen when you cough, sneeze, lift something heavy, change positions, or exercise.\nCauses\nStress incontinence occurs when the tissue that supports your urethra gets weak.\nThe bladder and urethra are supported by the pelvic floor muscles. Urine flows from your bladder through your urethra to the outside.\nThe urinary sphincter is a muscle around the opening of the bladder. It squeezes to prevent urine from leaking through the urethra.\nWhen either set of muscles become weak, urine can pass when pressure is placed on your bladder. You may notice it when you:\nCough\nSneeze\nLaugh\nExercise\nLift heavy objects\nHave sex\nWeakened pelvic floor muscles may be caused by:\nChildbirth\nInjury to the urethra area\nSome medicines\nSurgery in the pelvic area or the prostate (in men)\nBeing overweight\nUnknown causes\nStress incontinence is common in women."}

Some things increase your risk, such as:\nPregnancy and vaginal delivery.\nPelvic prolapse. This is when your bladder, urethra, or rectum slide into the vagina. Delivering a baby can cause nerve or tissue damage in the pelvic area. This can lead to pelvic prolapse months or years after delivery.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom of stress incontinence is leaking urine when you:\nAre physically active\nCough or sneeze\nExercise\nStand from a sitting or lying down position\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. This will include:\nGenital exam in men\nPelvic exam in women\nRectal exam\nTests may include:\nCystoscopy\nto look inside the bladder.\nPad weight test: You exercise while wearing a sanitary pad."}

Some providers may prescribe a medicine called duloxetine. This medicine is not approved by FDA for the treatment of stress incontinence.\nBEHAVIOR CHANGES\nMaking these changes may help:\nDrink less fluid (if you drink more than normal amounts of fluid)."}

Avoid drinking water before going to bed.\nAvoid jumping or running.\nTake fiber to avoid constipation, which can make stress urinary incontinence worse.\nQuit smoking. This can reduce coughing and bladder irritation. Smoking also increases your risk for bladder cancer.\nAvoid alcohol and caffeinated drinks such as coffee. They can make your bladder fill up quicker.\nLose excess weight.\nAvoid foods and drinks that may irritate your bladder. These include spicy foods, carbonated drinks, and citrus.\nIf you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar under good control.\nBLADDER TRAINING\nBladder training may help you control your bladder. You will be asked to urinate at regular intervals. Slowly, the time interval is increased."}

You will be asked to urinate at regular intervals. Slowly, the time interval is increased. This causes the bladder to stretch and hold more urine.\nPELVIC FLOOR MUSCLE TRAINING\nThere are different ways to strengthen the muscles in your pelvic floor.\nBiofeedback: This method can help you learn to identify and control your pelvic floor muscles.\nKegel exercises\n: These exercises can help keep the muscle around your urethra strong and working well. This may help keep you from leaking urine.\nVaginal cones: You place the cone into the vagina. Then you try to squeeze your pelvic floor muscles to hold the cone in place. You can wear the cone for up to 15 minutes at a time, two times a day. You may notice improvement in your symptoms in 4 to 6 weeks.\nPelvic floor physical therapy: Physical therapists specially trained in the area can fully evaluate the problem and help with exercises and therapies.\nSURGERIES\nIf other treatments do not work, your provider may suggest surgery. Surgery may help if you have bothersome stress incontinence."}

Surgery may help if you have bothersome stress incontinence. Most providers suggest surgery only after trying nonsurgical treatments.\nAnterior vaginal repair\nhelps restore weak and sagging vaginal walls. This is used when the bladder bulges into the vagina (prolapse). Prolapse may be associated with stress urinary incontinence.\nArtificial urinary sphincter\n: This is a device used to keep urine from leaking. It is used mainly in men. It is rarely used in women.\nBulking injections\nmake the area around the urethra thicker. This helps control leakage. The procedure may need to be repeated after a few months or years.\nUrethral sling is a mesh tape used to put pressure on the urethra. It can be used in men and women. It is easier to do than placing an artificial urinary sphincter.\nRetropubic suspensions lift the bladder and urethra. This is done less often due to the frequent use and success with urethral slings.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nGetting better takes time, so try to be patient. Symptoms most often get better with nonsurgical treatments."}
