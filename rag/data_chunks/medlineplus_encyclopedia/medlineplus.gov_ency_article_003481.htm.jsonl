These include:\nAntibiotics\nAntidepressants\nSome high blood pressure medicines\nLithium\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nWater pills (diuretics)\nDo not stop taking any medicine without talking to your provider.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nSodium is a substance that the body needs to work properly. Sodium is found in most foods."}

Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nSodium is a substance that the body needs to work properly. Sodium is found in most foods. The most common form of sodium is sodium chloride, which is table salt.\nThis test is usually done as part of an\nelectrolyte or basic metabolic panel blood test\n.\nYour blood sodium level represents a balance between the sodium and water in the food and drinks you consume and the amount in your urine. A small amount is lost through stool and sweat.\nMany things can affect this balance. Your provider may order this test if you:\nHave had a recent injury, surgery, or serious illness\nConsume usually large or small amounts of salt or fluid\nReceive intravenous (IV) fluids\nTake diuretics (water pills) or certain other medicines, including the steroid hormones such as hydrocortisone\nNormal Results\nThe normal range for blood sodium levels is 135 to 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal sodium level can be due to many different conditions.\nHigher than normal sodium level is called hypernatremia. It may be due to:\nAdrenal gland problems such as\nCushing syndrome\nor\nhyperaldosteronism\nDiabetes insipidus\n(type of diabetes in which kidneys are not able to conserve water)\nIncreased fluid loss due to excessive sweating, diarrhea, or burns\nToo much salt or sodium bicarbonate in the diet\nUse of certain medicines, including corticosteroids, laxatives, lithium, and medicines such as ibuprofen or naproxen\nLower than normal sodium level is called hyponatremia."}
