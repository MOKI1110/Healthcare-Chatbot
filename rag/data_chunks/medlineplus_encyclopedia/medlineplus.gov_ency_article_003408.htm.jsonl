Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFetal scalp pH testing\nFetal scalp pH testing\nFetal scalp pH testing is a procedure performed when a woman is in active labor to determine if the baby is getting enough oxygen.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe procedure takes about 5 minutes. The mother lies on her back with her feet in stirrups. If her cervix is dilated at least 3 to 4 centimeters, a plastic cone is placed in the vagina and fit snugly against the scalp of the fetus.\nThe scalp of the fetus is cleansed and a small blood sample is taken for examination. The blood is collected in a thin tube. The tube is either sent to the hospital lab or analyzed by a machine in the labor and delivery department. In either case, results are available in just a few minutes.\nIf the woman's cervix is not dilated enough, the test cannot be done.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour health care provider will explain the procedure and its risks."}

There isn't always a separate consent form for this procedure because many hospitals consider it part of the general consent for delivery form you signed at admission.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe procedure should feel like a long pelvic exam. At this stage of labor, many women have already had epidural anesthesia and may not feel the pressure of the procedure at all.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nSometimes fetal heart monitoring doesn't provide enough information about the well-being of a baby. In these cases, testing the scalp pH can help your provider decide whether the fetus is getting enough oxygen during labor."}

In these cases, testing the scalp pH can help your provider decide whether the fetus is getting enough oxygen during labor. This helps determine whether the baby is healthy enough to continue labor, or if a forceps delivery or\ncesarean birth\n(C-section) might be the best route of delivery.\nAlthough the test is not uncommon, most deliveries do not involve fetal scalp pH testing.\nThis test is not recommended for mothers with blood infections such as HIV/AIDS or\nhepatitis C\n.\nNormal Results\nNormal fetal blood sample results are:\nNormal pH: greater than 7.25\nBorderline pH: 7.20 to 7.25\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA fetal scalp blood pH level of less than 7.20 is considered abnormal.\nIn general, low pH suggests that the baby is not getting enough oxygen. This may mean that the baby is not tolerating labor very well."}
