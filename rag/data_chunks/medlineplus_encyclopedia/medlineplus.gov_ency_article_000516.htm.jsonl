It occurs most often in men 60 to 70 years old.\nThe exact cause is unknown.\nThe following may increase your risk of kidney cancer:\nSmoking\nObesity\nDialysis\ntreatment\nFamily history of the disease\nHigh blood pressure\nHorseshoe kidney\nLong-term use of certain medicines, such as pain pills or water pills (diuretics)\nPolycystic kidney disease\nVon Hippel-Lindau disease (a hereditary disease that affects blood vessels in the brain, eyes, and other body parts)\nBirt-Hogg-Dube syndrome (a genetic disease associated with\nbenign\nskin tumors and lung cysts)\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of this cancer may include any of the following:\nAbdominal pain\nand swelling\nBack pain\nBlood in the urine\nSwelling of the veins around a testicle (varicocele)\nFlank pain\nWeight loss\nFever\nLiver dysfunction\nElevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (\nESR\n)\nExces"}

This may reveal a mass or swelling of the abdomen.\nTests that may be ordered include:\nAbdominal CT scan\nBlood chemistry\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nIntravenous pyelogram\n(IVP)\nLiver function tests\nRenal arteriography\nUltrasound of the abdomen\nand kidney\nUrinalysis\nThe following tests may be done to see if the cancer has spread:\nAbdominal MRI\nBiopsy\nBone scan\nChest x-ray\nChest CT scan\nPET scan\nTreatment\nSurgery to remove all or part of the kidney (\nnephrectomy\n) is usually recommended. This may include removing the bladder, surrounding tissues, or lymph nodes. A cure is unlikely unless all of the cancer is removed with surgery. But even if some cancer is left behind, there may be a benefit from surgery.\nChemotherapy is generally not effective for treating kidney cancer in adults."}

Newer immune system medicines (immunotherapy) and targeted therapies may help some people. Your provider can tell you more.\nRadiation therapy is usually done only when the cancer spreads to the bone or brain.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\nsupport group\nwhose members share common experiences and problems.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSometimes, both kidneys are involved. The cancer spreads easily, most often to the lungs and other organs. In about one fourth of people, the cancer has already spread (metastasized) at the time of diagnosis.\nHow well someone with kidney cancer does depends on how much the cancer has spread and how well treatment works. The survival rate is highest if the tumor is in the early stages and has not spread outside the kidney."}

Also contact your provider if you have any other symptoms of this disorder.\nPrevention\nStop smoking.
