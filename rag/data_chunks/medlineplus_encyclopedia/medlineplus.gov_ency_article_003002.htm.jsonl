They drop down into the\nscrotum\nin the last months before birth.\nIn some cases, one or both testicles do not drop into the correct position. In about one half of babies, the testicles will descend within the first year of life without treatment.\nUndescended testicle repair surgery is recommended for males whose testicles do not descend on their own.\nThe surgery is done while the child is asleep (unconscious) and pain-free under general anesthesia. The surgeon makes a cut in the groin. This is where most undescended testes are located.\nAfter finding the cord that holds the testis in the scrotum, the surgeon unties it from the tissue around it. This allows the cord to extend to its full length. A small cut is made in the scrotum, and a pouch is created."}

This allows the cord to extend to its full length. A small cut is made in the scrotum, and a pouch is created. The testicle is pulled down into the scrotum and stitched into place. Stitches are used to close the surgical cuts.\nIn some cases, the procedure can be done laparoscopically. This involves smaller surgical cuts.\nWhen the testicle is located very high, correction may require two stages.   The separate surgeries are done several months apart.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThis surgery is recommended for infants older than 1 year whose\ntesticles\nhave not descended into the scrotum (cryptorchidism).\nAn undescended testicle is different from a \"retractile\" testicle. In this condition, the testicle drops into the scrotum and then pulls back."}

These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E."}

Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines your child should still take on the day of surgery.\nLet your surgeon know about any illness your child may have before their surgery. This includes\nCOVID-19\n, a\ncold\n,\nflu\n, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness. If they do get sick, their surgery may need to be postponed.\nAfter the Procedure\nUndescended testicle repair is successful in most cases. A small percentage of men will have fertility problems.\nMen who have had undescended testicles should do monthly self-exams for the rest of their lives to look for possible tumors. Men with undescended testes have higher rates of\ntesticular cancer\nthan those with normal testicle development, even if they have a fully descended testicle on the other side. There is also a higher risk for testicular cancer in the other testicle that descended normally."}

Bringing the testicles down will make it easier to monitor for tumor growth in the future.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe surgery may be done on an outpatient basis. Bed rest is recommended for the first 2 to 3 days. Avoid strenuous activity, including bicycling, for at least 1 month.\nAlternative Names\nOrchidopexy; Inguinal orchidopexy; Orchiopexy; Repair of undescended testicle; Cryptorchidism repair\nImages\nMale reproductive anatomy\nBefore and after testicular repair\nReferences\nBarthold JS, Hagerty JA.
