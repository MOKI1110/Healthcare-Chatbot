Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nWolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW)\nWolff-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW)\nWolff-Parkinson-White (WPW) syndrome is a condition in which there is an extra electrical pathway in the heart that leads to periods of rapid heart rate (\ntachycardia\n).\nWPW syndrome is one of the most common causes of fast heart rate problems in infants and children.\nCauses\nNormally, electrical signals follow a certain pathway through the heart. This helps the heart beat regularly. This prevents the heart from having extra beats or beats happening too soon.\nIn people with WPW syndrome, some of the heart's electrical signals go down an extra pathway. This may cause a very rapid heart rate called supraventricular tachycardia.\nMost people with WPW syndrome do not have any other heart problems. However, this condition has been linked with other cardiac conditions, such as\nEbstein anomaly\n. A form of the condition also runs in families.\nSymptoms\nHow often a rapid heart rate occurs varies depending on the person."}

A form of the condition also runs in families.\nSymptoms\nHow often a rapid heart rate occurs varies depending on the person. Some people with WPW syndrome have only a few episodes of rapid heart rate. Others may have the rapid heart rate once or twice a week or more. Also, there may be no symptoms at all, so that condition is found when a heart test is done for another reason.\nA person with this syndrome may have:\nChest pain\nor chest tightness\nDizziness\nLightheadedness\nFainting\nPalpitations\n(a sensation of feeling your heart beating, usually quickly or irregularly)\nShortness of breath\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam done during a tachycardia episode will show a heart rate faster than 100 beats per minute. A normal heart rate is 60 to 100 beats per minute in adults, and under 150 beats per minute in newborns, infants, and small children. Blood pressure will be normal or low in most cases.\nIf the person is not having tachycardia at the time of the exam, the results may be normal."}

Blood pressure will be normal or low in most cases.\nIf the person is not having tachycardia at the time of the exam, the results may be normal. The condition may be diagnosed with an\nelectrocardiogram\n(ECG) or with ambulatory ECG monitoring, such as a\nHolter monitor\n.\nA test called an\nelectrophysiologic study\n(EPS) is done using catheters that are placed in the heart. This test may help identify the location of the extra electrical pathway.\nTreatment\nMedicines, particularly antiarrhythmic drugs such as procainamide or amiodarone, may be used to control or prevent a rapid heartbeat.\nIf the heart rate does not return to normal with medical treatment, health care providers may use a type of therapy called electrical\ncardioversion\n(shock).\nThe long-term treatment for WPW syndrome is very often\ncatheter ablation\n. This procedure involves inserting a tube (catheter) into a vein through a small cut near the groin up to the heart area. When the tip reaches the heart, the small area that is causing the fast heart rate is destroyed using a special type of energy called radiofrequency or by freezing it (cryoablation)."}

In most cases, this procedure is done only if you need heart surgery for other reasons.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nCatheter ablation cures this disorder in most people. The success rate for the procedure ranges between 85% to 95%. Success rates will vary depending on the location and number of extra pathways.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nComplications of surgery\nHeart failure\nReduced blood pressure (caused by\nrapid heart rate\n)\nSide effects of medicines\nThe most severe form of a rapid heartbeat is\nventricular fibrillation\n(VF), which will rapidly lead to shock or death unless it is corrected."}
