Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTarsal tunnel syndrome\nTarsal tunnel syndrome\nTarsal tunnel syndrome is a condition in which the tibial nerve is being compressed. This is the nerve in the ankle that allows feeling and movement to parts of the foot. Tarsal tunnel syndrome can lead to pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, or muscle damage mainly in the bottom of the foot.\nCauses\nTarsal tunnel syndrome is an unusual form of\nperipheral neuropathy\n. It occurs when there is damage to the tibial nerve.\nThe area in the foot where the nerve enters the back of the inner side of the ankle is called the tarsal tunnel. This tunnel is normally narrow."}

When the tibial nerve is compressed, it results in the symptoms of tarsal tunnel syndrome.\nPressure on the tibial nerve may be due to any of the following:\nSwelling from an injury, such as a dislocated, sprained, or broken ankle\nAn abnormal growth, such as a bone spur, lump in the joint (ganglion cyst), swollen (varicose) vein\nFlat feet\nor a high arch\nDamage to the tibial nerve may result from body-wide (systemic) diseases, such as diabetes, low thyroid function (hypothyroidism), arthritis, or hereditary nerve problems."}
