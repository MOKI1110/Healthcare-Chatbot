This hormone is normally made in the\nadrenal glands\n.\nExogenous means caused by something outside the body. Exogenous Cushing syndrome occurs when a person takes man-made (synthetic) glucocorticoid medicines to treat a disease. These medicines act like cortisol in the body.\nGlucocorticoids are given for many diseases, such as lung diseases, skin conditions, inflammatory bowel disease, cancer, brain tumors, and joint disease."}
