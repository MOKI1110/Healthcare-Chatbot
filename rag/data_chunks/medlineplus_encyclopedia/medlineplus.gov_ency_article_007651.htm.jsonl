Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTubal ligation reversal\nTubal ligation reversal\nTubal ligation reversal is surgery done to allow a woman who has had her tubes tied (tubal ligation) to become pregnant again. The fallopian tubes are reconnected in this reversal surgery. A\ntubal ligation\ncannot always be reversed if there is too little tube left or if it is damaged.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nTubal ligation reversal surgery is done to allow a woman who has had her tubes tied to become pregnant. However, the surgery is rarely done any more. This is because the success rates with in vitro fertilization (IVF) have risen. Women who wish to become pregnant after having tubal ligation, are most often counselled to try IVF instead of surgical reversal."}
