This problem is also called dysphagia.\nCauses\nThe process of swallowing involves several steps. These include:\nChewing food\nMoving it into the back of the mouth\nMoving it down the esophagus (food pipe)\nThere are many nerves that help the muscles of the mouth, throat, and esophagus work together. Much of swallowing occurs without you being aware of what you are doing.\nSwallowing is a complex act."}

Many nerves work in a fine balance to control how the muscles of the mouth, throat, and esophagus work together.\nA brain or nerve disorder can alter this fine balance in the muscles of the mouth and throat.\nDamage to the brain may be caused by\nmultiple sclerosis\n,\nParkinson disease\n, or\nstroke\n.\nNerve damage may be due to spinal cord injuries,\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n(ALS or Lou Gehrig disease), or\nmyasthenia gravis\n.\nStress or anxiety may cause some people to feel tightness in the throat or feel as if something is stuck in the throat. This sensation is called globus sensation and is unrelated to eating. However, there may be some underlying cause.\nProblems that involve the esophagus often cause swallowing problems."}
