However, your health care provider may recommend you follow a high-fiber diet. You will likely be asked to avoid laxatives, enemas, and other medicines that change the way your bowels function.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will not feel the capsule move through your digestive system.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test helps determine bowel function."}

You may need this test done to evaluate the cause of constipation or other problems involving difficulty passing stool.\nNormal Results\nThe bowel transit time varies, even in the same person.\nThe average transit time through the colon in someone who is not constipated is 30 to 40 hours.\nUp to a maximum of 72 hours is still considered normal, although transit time in women may reach up to around 100 hours.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf more than 20% of the marker is present in the colon after 5 days, you may have slowed bowel function. The report will note in what area the markers appear to collect.\nRisks\nThere are no risks.\nConsiderations\nThe bowel transit time test is rarely done these days. Instead, bowel transit is often measured with a wireless motility capsule or colonic transit scintigraphy. Ask your provider what testing, if any, is best for you.\nImages\nLower digestive anatomy\nReferences\nCamilleri M. Disorders of gastrointestinal motility."}
