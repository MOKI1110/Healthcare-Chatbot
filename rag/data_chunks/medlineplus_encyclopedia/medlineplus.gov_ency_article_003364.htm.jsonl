You may then be placed in a room where you have no access to your personal items or water. This is so you cannot dilute the sample, or use someone else's urine for the test.\nThis test involves collecting a \"clean-catch\" (midstream) urine sample:\nWash your hands with soap and water. Dry your hands with a clean towel.\nMen and boys should wipe the head of the penis with a moist cloth or disposable towelette. Before cleaning, gently pull back (retract) the foreskin, if you have one.\nWomen and girls need to wash the area between the lips of the vagina with soapy water and rinse well. Or, if instructed, use a disposable towelette to wipe the genital area.\nAs you start to urinate, allow a small amount to fall into the toilet bowl."}

Or, if instructed, use a disposable towelette to wipe the genital area.\nAs you start to urinate, allow a small amount to fall into the toilet bowl. This clears the urethra of contaminants.\nThen, in the container you are given, catch about 1 to 2 ounces (30 to 60 milliliters) of urine. Remove the container from the urine stream.\nGive the container to the health care provider or assistant.\nWash your hands again with soap and water.\nThe sample is then taken to the lab for evaluation.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is performed to detect the presence of illegal drugs and some prescription medicines in your urine. Their presence may indicate that you recently used these substances. Some drugs may remain in your system for several weeks, so  the drug test needs to be interpreted carefully.\nNormal Results\nNo drugs in the urine, unless you are taking medicines prescribed by your provider.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf the test result is positive, another test called gas-chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) may be done to confirm the results."}

The GC-MS will help tell the difference between a false positive and a true positive.\nIn some cases, a positive test will be a false positive. This can result from interfering factors such as some foods, prescription medicines, and other drugs. Your provider will be aware of this possibility.\nAlternative Names\nDrug screen - urine\nImages\nUrine sample\nReferences\nBluth MH, Pincus MR, Abraham NZ.
