This cancer mostly affects children.\nCauses\nRhabdomyosarcoma can occur in many places in the body. The most common sites are the head or neck, the urinary or reproductive system, and the arms or legs.\nThe cause of rhabdomyosarcoma is unknown. It is a rare tumor with only several hundred new cases per year in the United States.\nSome children with certain birth defects are at an increased risk. Some families have a gene mutation that increases this risk."}

Some families have a gene mutation that increases this risk. Most children with rhabdomyosarcoma do not have any known risk factors.\nSymptoms\nThe most common symptom is a mass that may or may not be painful.\nOther symptoms vary depending on location of the tumor.\nTumors in the nose or throat may cause bleeding, congestion, swallowing problems, or nervous system problems if they extend into the brain.\nTumors around the eyes may cause bulging of the eye, problems with vision, swelling around the eye, or pain.\nTumors in the ears, may cause pain, hearing loss, or swelling.\nBladder and\nvaginal tumors\nmay cause trouble starting to urinate or having a bowel movement, or poor control of urine.\nMuscle tumors may lead to a painful lump, and can be mistaken for an injury.\nExams and Tests\nDiagnosis is often delayed because there aren't symptoms and because the tumor may appear at the same time as a recent injury. Early diagnosis is important because this cancer spreads quickly.\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

Early diagnosis is important because this cancer spreads quickly.\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam. Detailed questions will be asked about symptoms and medical history.\nTests that may be ordered include:\nChest x-ray\nCT scan\nof the chest to look for spread of the tumor\nCT scan of the tumor site\nBone marrow biopsy\n(may show the cancer has spread)\nBone scan\nto look for spread of the tumor\nMRI\nscan of the tumor site\nSpinal tap (\nlumbar puncture\n)\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the site and type of rhabdomyosarcoma.\nEither radiation or chemotherapy, or both, will be used before or after surgery. In general, surgery and radiation therapy are used to treat the primary site of the tumor. Chemotherapy is used to treat disease at all sites in the body.\nChemotherapy is an essential part of treatment to prevent spread and recurrence of the cancer. Many different chemotherapy drugs are active against rhabdomyosarcoma. Your provider will discuss these with you.\nSupport Groups\nThe stress of illness can be eased by joining a\ncancer support group\n."}

Cure depends on the specific type of tumor, its location, and how much it has spread.\nPossible Complications\nComplications of this cancer or its treatment include:\nComplications from chemotherapy\nLocation in which surgery is not possible\nSpread of the cancer (\nmetastasis\n)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your child has symptoms of rhabdomyosarcoma.\nAlternative Names\nSoft tissue cancer - rhabdomyosarcoma; Soft tissue sarcoma; Alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma; Embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma; Sarcoma botryoides\nReferences\nDome JS, Rodriguez-Galindo C, Spunt SL, Santana VM.
