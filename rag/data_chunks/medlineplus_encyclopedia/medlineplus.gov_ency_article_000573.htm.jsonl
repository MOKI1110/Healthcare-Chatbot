Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nDisseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)\nDisseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)\nDisseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is a serious disorder in which the proteins that control blood clotting become overactive.\nCauses\nWhen you are injured, proteins in the blood that form blood clots travel to the injury site to help stop bleeding. If these proteins become abnormally active throughout the body, you could develop DIC. The underlying cause is usually due to inflammation, infection, or cancer.\nIn some cases of DIC, small\nblood clots\nform in the blood vessels. Some of these clots can clog the vessels and cut off the normal blood supply to organs such as the liver, brain, or kidneys. Lack of blood flow can damage and cause major injury to the organs.\nIn other cases of DIC, the clotting proteins in your blood are consumed. When this happens, you may have a high risk of serious bleeding, even from a minor injury or without injury. You may also have bleeding that starts spontaneously (on its own)."}

When this happens, you may have a high risk of serious bleeding, even from a minor injury or without injury. You may also have bleeding that starts spontaneously (on its own). The disease can also cause your healthy red blood cells to fragment and break up when they travel through the small vessels that are filled with clots.\nRisk factors for DIC include:\nBlood transfusion reaction\nCancer, especially certain types of\nleukemia\nInflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)\nInfection in the blood, especially by bacteria or fungus\nLiver disease\nPregnancy complications (such as placenta tissue that is left behind after delivery)\nRecent surgery or anesthesia\nSevere tissue injury (as in burns and head injury)\nLarge hemangioma (a blood vessel that is not formed properly)\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of DIC may include any of the following:\nBleeding, from many sites in the body\nBlood clots\nBruising\nDrop in blood pressure\nShortness of breath\nConfusion, memory loss or change of behavior\nFever\nExams and Tests\nYou may have any of the following tests:\nComplete blood count\nwith blood smear exam\nPartial thromboplastin time\n(PTT)\nProthrombin time\n(PT)\nFibrinogen blood test\nD-dimer\nTreatm"}

The goal is to determine and treat the underlying cause of DIC.\nSupportive treatments may include:\nPlasma transfusions to replace blood clotting factors if a large amount of bleeding is occurring.\nBlood thinner medicine (heparin) to prevent blood clotting if a large amount of clotting is occurring.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome depends on what is causing the disorder. DIC can be life threatening.\nPossible Complications\nComplications from DIC may include:\nBleeding\nLack of blood flow to the arms, legs, or vital organs\nStroke\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nGo to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have bleeding that does not stop.\nPrevention\nGet prompt treatment for conditions known to bring on this disorder.\nAlternative Names\nConsumption coagulopathy; DIC\nImages\nBlood clot formation\nMeningococcemia on the calves\nBlood clots\nReferences\nLevi M.
