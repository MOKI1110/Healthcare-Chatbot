Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLiver cancer - hepatocellular carcinoma\nLiver cancer - hepatocellular carcinoma\nHepatocellular carcinoma is cancer that starts in the liver.\nCauses\nHepatocellular carcinoma is the most common type of liver cancer. It occurs more often in men than women. It is most often diagnosed in people age 50 or older.\nHepatocellular carcinoma is not the same as\nmetastatic liver cancer\n. Metastatic liver cancer starts in another organ (such as the breast or colon) and spreads to the liver.\nIn most cases, the cause of hepatocellular liver cancer is long-term damage and scarring of the liver (\ncirrhosis\n)."}

The physical exam may show an enlarged, tender liver or other signs of cirrhosis.\nIf your provider suspects liver cancer, tests that may be ordered include:\nAbdominal CT scan\nAbdominal MRI scan\nAbdominal ultrasound\nLiver biopsy\nLiver function tests\nSerum alpha fetoprotein\nSome people at risk for liver cancer may get regular blood tests and ultrasounds to see if tumors are developing.\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on how advanced the cancer is.\nSurgery may be done if the tumor has not spread. Before surgery, the tumor may be treated with\nchemotherapy\nto reduce its size. This is most often done by delivering the medicine straight into the liver with a tube (catheter).\nRadiation treatments\nin the area of the cancer may also be helpful.\nAblation is another method that may be used. Ablate means to destroy."}

Treatment instead focuses on improving and extending the person's life. Treatment in this case may use\ntargeted therapy\nwith drugs that can be taken as pills. Newer immunotherapy drugs may also be used.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\ncancer support group\n. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf the cancer can't be completely treated, the disease is usually fatal."}
