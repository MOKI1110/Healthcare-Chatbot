It forms when a volcano erupts and releases gases into the atmosphere.\nVolcanic smog can irritate the lungs and make existing lung problems worse.\nInformation\nVolcanoes release plumes of ash, dust, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and other harmful gases into the air. Sulfur dioxide is the most harmful of these gases. When the gases react with oxygen, moisture, and sunlight in the atmosphere, volcanic smog forms. This smog is a type of air pollution, which can be quite toxic.\nVolcanic smog also contains highly acidic aerosols (tiny particles and droplets), mainly sulfuric acid and other sulfur-related compounds. These aerosols are small enough to be breathed deep into the lungs.\nBreathing in volcanic smog irritates the lungs and mucous membranes. It can affect how well your lungs work."}

People who have lung conditions should limit physical activity outdoors. Keep windows and doors closed and the air conditioning on. Using an air cleaner/purifier can also help.\nWhen you do have to go outside, wear a paper or gauze surgical mask that covers your nose and mouth."}

Wet the mask with a solution of baking soda and water to further protect your lungs.\nWear goggles to protect your eyes from ash.\nTake your COPD or asthma medicines as prescribed.\nDo not smoke. Smoking can irritate your lungs even more.\nDrink a lot of fluids, especially warm fluids (such as tea).\nBend forward at the waist slightly to make it easier to breathe.\nPractice breathing exercises indoors to keep your lungs as healthy as possible. With your lips almost closed, breathe in through your nose and out through your mouth. This is called pursed-lip breathing. Or, breathe deeply through your nose into your belly without moving your chest. This is called diaphragmatic breathing.\nIf possible, leave or do not travel to the area where the volcanic smog is.\nEMERGENCY SYMPTOMS\nIf you have asthma or COPD and your symptoms suddenly get worse, try using your rescue inhaler."}
