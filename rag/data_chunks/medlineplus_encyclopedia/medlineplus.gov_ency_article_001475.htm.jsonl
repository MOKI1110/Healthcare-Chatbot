Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPort-wine stain\nPort-wine stain\nA port-wine stain is a birthmark in which swollen blood vessels create a reddish-purplish discoloration of the skin.\nCauses\nPort-wine stains are caused by an abnormal formation of tiny blood vessels in the skin.\nIn rare cases, port-wine stains are a sign of\nSturge-Weber syndrome\nor\nKlippel-Trenaunay-Weber syndrome\n.\nSymptoms\nEarly-stage port-wine stains are usually flat and pink. As the child gets older, the stain grows with the child and the color may deepen to dark red or purple. Port-wine stains occur most often on the face but can appear anywhere on the body. Over time, the area can become thickened and take on a cobblestone-like appearance.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can usually diagnose a port-wine stain by looking at your skin.\nIn a few cases, a skin biopsy is needed."}

Depending on the location of the birthmark and other symptoms, the provider may want to do an\nintraocular pressure\ntest of the eye or\nx-ray of the skull\n.\nAn MRI or CT scan of the brain may also be done.\nTreatment\nMany treatments have been tried for port-wine stains, including freezing, surgery, radiation, and tattooing.\nLaser therapy is most successful in removing port-wine stains. It is the only method that can destroy the tiny blood vessels in the skin without causing much damage to the skin. The exact type of laser used depends on the person's age, skin type, and particular port-wine stain.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nStains on the face respond better to laser therapy than those on the arms, legs, or middle of the body."}
