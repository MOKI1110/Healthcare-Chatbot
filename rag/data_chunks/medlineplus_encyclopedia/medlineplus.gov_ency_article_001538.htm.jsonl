Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPica\nPica\nPica is a pattern of eating non-food materials, such as  dirt or paper.\nCauses\nPica is seen more in young children than adults. Up to one third of children ages 1 to 6 years have these eating behaviors. It is unclear how many children with pica intentionally consume dirt (geophagy).\nPica can also occur during pregnancy. In some cases, a lack of certain nutrients, such as iron and zinc, may trigger the unusual cravings. Pica may also occur in adults who crave a certain texture in their mouth.\nSymptoms\nChildren and adults with pica may eat:\nAnimal feces\nClay\nDirt\nHairballs\nIce\nPaint\nSand\nThis pattern of eating must last for at least 1 month to fit the diagnosis of pica.\nDepending on what is being eaten and how much, symptoms of other problems may be present, such as:\nBelly pain, nausea, and bloating caused by blockage in the stomach or intestine\nFatigue\nBehavior problems, school problems and other findings of lead poisoning or poor nutrition\nExams and Tests\nThere is no single test for pica."}

Because pica can occur in people who have certain nutritional deficiencies, your health care provider may test blood levels of iron and zinc.\nBlood tests can also be done to test for\nanemia\n. Lead levels should always be checked in children who may have eaten paint or objects covered in lead paint dust to screen for lead poisoning.\nYour provider may also test for infection if contaminated soil or animal waste has been eaten.\nTreatment\nTreatment should first address any missing nutrients or other medical problems, such as lead poisoning.\nTreating pica involves behaviors, the environment, and family education. One form of treatment associates the pica behavior with negative consequences or punishment (mild aversion therapy). Then the person gets rewarded for eating normal foods.\nMedicines may help reduce the abnormal eating behavior if pica is part of a developmental disorder such as intellectual disability.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nTreatment success varies."}

In many cases, the disorder lasts several months and then disappears on its own. In some cases, it may continue into the teen years or adulthood, especially when it occurs with developmental disorders.\nPossible Complications\nComplications include:\nBezoar\n(a mass of undigestible material trapped inside the body, most often in the stomach)\nInfection\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you notice that your child (or an adult) is eating nonfood materials.\nPrevention\nThere is no specific prevention.
