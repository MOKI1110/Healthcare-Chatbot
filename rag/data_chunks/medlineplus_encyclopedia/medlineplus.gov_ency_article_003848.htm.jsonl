In some cases, a numbing shot may be used. A small piece of the tissue that appears abnormal is removed and checked for problems in the laboratory.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed. You may be asked to fast for a few hours before the biopsy.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel pressure or tugging when the tissue is removed. After the numbness wears off, the area may be sore for a few days.\nA small to moderate amount of bleeding after the procedure is common. If there is bleeding, the blood vessels may be sealed with an electric current, laser, or special chemical.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nNasal mucosal biopsy is most often done when abnormal tissue is seen during examination of the nose."}
