Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMalignant teratoma of the mediastinum\nMalignant teratoma of the mediastinum\nA teratoma is a type of tumor that contains one or more of the three layers of cells found in a developing baby (embryo). These cells are called germ cells. A teratoma is one type of germ cell tumor that can be benign or cancerous.\nThe mediastinum is located inside the front of the chest in the area that separates the lungs. The heart, large blood vessels, windpipe, thymus gland, lymph nodes and esophagus are found there.\nCauses\nMalignant mediastinal teratoma occurs most often in young men in their 20s or 30s. Most malignant teratomas can spread throughout the body, and have spread by the time of diagnosis.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nChest pain\nor pressure\nCough\nFatigue\nLimited ability to tolerate exercise\nReduced exercise tolerance\nShortness of breath\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms."}

The exam may reveal a blockage of the veins entering the center of the chest due to increased pressure in the chest area.\nThe following tests help diagnose the tumor:\nChest x-ray\nCT\n,\nMRI\n, or\nPET\nscans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis\nNuclear imaging to look for cancer that has spread to other parts of the body\nBlood tests to check\nbeta-HCG\n,\nalpha fetoprotein\n(AFP), and\nlactate dehydrogenase (LDH)\nlevels\nMediastinoscopy with biopsy\nTreatment\nSurgical removal is the mainstay of treatment.\nChemotherapy\nis used to treat the immature teratoma. A combination of medicines (usually cisplatin, etoposide, and ifosfamide) is commonly used.\nAfter chemotherapy is complete, CT scans are done again to see if any of the tumor remains."}
