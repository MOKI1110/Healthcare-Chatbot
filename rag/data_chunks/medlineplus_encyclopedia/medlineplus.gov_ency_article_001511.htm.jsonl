It is most often due to the fungus\nCandida albicans\n.\nCauses\nMost women have a vaginal yeast infection at some time.\nCandida albicans\nis a common type of fungus. It is often found in small amounts in the\nvagina\n, mouth, digestive tract, and on the skin. Most of the time, it does not cause infection or symptoms.\nCandida and the many other germs that normally live in the vagina keep each other in balance. Sometimes the number of candida increases. This leads to a yeast infection.\nThis can happen if:\nYou are taking antibiotics used to treat another infection. Antibiotics change the normal balance between germs in the vagina.\nYou are pregnant\nYou are obese\nYou have\ndiabetes\nYou are taking medicines or have an illness that suppresses your immune system.\nA yeast infection is not spread through sexual contact. However, some men may develop symptoms after having sexual contact with an infected partner."}

Avoid soap and rinse with water only. Sitting in a warm, but not hot, bath may help your symptoms.\nAvoid douching.

Douching removes healthy bacteria lining the vagina that protect against infection.\nEat yogurt with live cultures or take\nLactobacillus acidophilus\ntablets when you are on antibiotics."}
