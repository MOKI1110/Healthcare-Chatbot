Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFactor VII deficiency\nFactor VII deficiency\nFactor VII (seven) deficiency is a disorder caused by a lack of a protein called factor VII in the blood. It leads to problems with blood clotting (coagulation).\nCauses\nWhen you bleed, a series of reactions take place in the body that helps blood clots form. This process is called the coagulation cascade. It involves special proteins called coagulation, or clotting factors. You may have a higher chance of excess bleeding if one or more of these factors are missing or are not functioning as they should.\nFactor VII is one such coagulation factor. Factor VII deficiency runs in families (inherited) and is very rare. Both parents must have the variant gene to pass the disorder on to their children. A family history of a bleeding disorder can be a risk factor.\nFactor VII deficiency can also be due to another condition or use of certain medicines. This is called acquired factor VII deficiency."}

A family history of a bleeding disorder can be a risk factor.\nFactor VII deficiency can also be due to another condition or use of certain medicines. This is called acquired factor VII deficiency. It can be caused by:\nLow\nvitamin K\n(some babies are born with vitamin K deficiency)\nSevere liver disease\nUse of medicines that prevent clotting (anticoagulants such as warfarin)\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nBleeding from mucus membranes\nBleeding into joints\nBleeding into muscles\nBruising\neasily\nHeavy menstrual bleeding\nNosebleeds that do not stop easily\nUmbilical cord bleeding after birth\nExams and Tests\nFactor VII deficiency is associated with a normal\npartial thromboplastin time\n(PTT) clotting test but a prolonged prothrombin time (PT) clotting test.\nTests that may be done include:\nPartial thromboplastin time (PTT)\nPlasma\nfactor VII activity\nProthrombin time\n(PT)\nTreatment\nBleeding can be controlled by getting intravenous (IV) infusions of normal plasma, concentrates of factor VII, or genetically produced (recombinant) factor VII.\nYou will need frequent treatment during bleeding episodes because factor VII does not last for long inside the body."}
