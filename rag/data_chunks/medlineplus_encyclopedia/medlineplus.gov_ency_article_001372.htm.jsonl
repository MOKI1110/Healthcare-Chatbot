The disease is common in South and Central America.\nCauses\nChagas disease is caused by the parasite\nTrypanosoma cruzi.\nIt is spread by the bite of reduviid bugs, or kissing bugs, and is one of the major health problems in South America. Due to travel and immigration, the disease also affects people in the United States.\nRisk factors for Chagas disease include:\nLiving in a hut where reduviid bugs live in the walls\nLiving in Central or South America\nPoverty\nReceiving a blood transfusion or an organ donation from a person who carries the parasite, but does not have active Chagas disease\nSymptoms\nChagas disease has two phases:\nacute\nand\nchronic\n. The acute phase may have no symptoms or very mild symptoms, including:\nFever\nGeneral ill feeling\nSwelling of an eye if the bite is near the eye\nSwollen red area at the site of the insect bite\nAfter the acute phase, the disease goes into remission. There may be no other symptoms for many years."}

When symptoms finally develop, they may include:\nConstipation\nDigestive problems\nPain in the abdomen\nSwallowing difficulties\nPounding or racing heart\nHeart failure\nExams and Tests\nphysical exam\ncan confirm the symptoms. Signs of Chagas disease may include:\nDisease of the heart muscle\nEnlarged liver and spleen\nEnlarged lymph nodes\nIrregular heartbeat\nRapid heartbeat\nTests include:\nBlood culture\nto look for signs of infection\nChest x-ray\nEchocardiogram\n(uses sound waves to create pictures of the heart)\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG, tests electrical activity in the heart)\nEnzyme-linked immunoassay (\nELISA\n) to look for signs of infection\nBlood smear\nto look for signs of infection\nTreatment\nThe acute phase of reactivated Chagas disease should be treated. Infants born with the infection should also be treated.\nTreating the chronic phase is recommended for children and most adults."}

Adults with chronic phase Chagas disease should talk to their health care provider to decide whether treatment is needed.\nTwo medicines are used to treat this infection: benznidazole and nifurtimox.\nBoth medicines often have side effects. The side effects may be worse in older people. They may include:\nHeadaches and dizziness\nLoss of appetite and weight loss\nNerve damage\nProblems sleeping\nSkin rashes\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAbout one third of infected people who are not treated will develop chronic or\nsymptomatic\nChagas disease. It may take more than 20 years from the time of the original infection to develop heart or digestive problems.\nAbnormal heart rhythms may cause sudden death."}

Once heart failure develops, death usually occurs within several years.\nPossible Complications\nChagas disease can cause these complications:\nEnlarged colon\nEnlarged esophagus with swallowing difficulty\nHeart disease\nHeart failure\nMalnutrition\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider for an appointment if you think you may have Chagas disease.\nPrevention\nInsect control with insecticides and houses that are less likely to have high insect populations will help control the spread of the disease.\nBlood banks in Central and South America screen donors for exposure to the parasite. The blood is discarded if the donor has the parasite. Most blood banks in the United States began screening for Chagas disease in 2007.\nAlternative Names\nParasite infection - American trypanosomiasis\nImages\nKissing bug\nAntibodies\nReferences\nKirchoff LV.
