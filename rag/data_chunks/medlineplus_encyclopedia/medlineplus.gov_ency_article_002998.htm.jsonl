The numbing medicine may be injected at the base of the penis, in the shaft, or applied as a cream.\nThere are several ways to perform a circumcision. Most commonly, the foreskin is pushed from the head of the penis and clamped with a metal or plastic ring-like device.\nIf the ring is metal, the foreskin is cut off and the metal device is removed. The wound heals in 5 to 7 days.\nIf the ring is plastic, a piece of suture is tied tightly around the foreskin. This pushes the tissue into a groove in the plastic over the head of the penis. Within 5 to 7 days, the plastic covering the penis falls free, leaving a completely healed circumcision.\nThe baby may be given a sweetened pacifier during the procedure."}

Tylenol (acetaminophen) may be given afterward.\nIn older and adolescent boys, circumcision is most often done under general anesthesia so the boy is asleep and pain free. The foreskin is removed and stitched onto the remaining skin of the penis. Stitches that dissolve are used to close the wound. They will be absorbed by the body within 7 to 10 days. The wound may take up to 3 weeks to heal.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nCircumcision is often performed in healthy boys for cultural or religious reasons. In the United States, a newborn boy is often circumcised before he leaves the hospital. Jewish boys, however, are circumcised when they are 8 days old.\nIn other parts of the world, including Europe, Asia, and South and Central America, circumcision is rare in the general population.\nThe merits of circumcision have been debated. Opinions about the need for circumcision in healthy boys vary among providers."}

Opinions about the need for circumcision in healthy boys vary among providers. Some believe there is great value to having an intact foreskin, such as allowing for a more natural sexual response during adulthood.\nFamilies should weigh the health benefits and risks in light of their own personal and cultural preferences.\nRisks\nRisks related to circumcision:\nBleeding\nInfection\nRedness around the surgery site\nInjury to the penis\nSome research has suggested that uncircumcised male infants have an increased risk of certain conditions, including:\nCancer of the penis\nCertain sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV\nInfections of the penis\nPhimosis (tightness of the foreskin that prevents it from retracting)\nUrinary tract infections\nThe overall increased risk for these conditions is thought to be relatively small.\nProper hygiene of the penis and safe sexual practices can help prevent many of these conditions."}

Proper hygiene is especially important for uncircumcised males.\nAfter the Procedure\nFor newborns:\nHealing time is about 1 week.\nPlace petroleum jelly (Vaseline) onto the area after changing the diaper. This helps protect the healing area.\nSome swelling and yellow crust formation around the site is normal.\nFor older children and adolescents:\nHealing may take up to 3 weeks.\nIn most cases, the child will be released from the hospital on the day of the surgery.\nAt home, children should avoid vigorous exercise while the wound heals.\nIf bleeding occurs during the first 24 hours after surgery, use a clean cloth to apply pressure to the wound for 10 minutes.\nPlace an ice pack on the area (20 minutes on, 20 minutes off) for the first 24 hours after surgery. This helps reduce swelling and pain.\nBathing or showering is allowed most of the time. The surgical cut may be gently washed with mild, unscented soap.\nChange the dressing at least once a day and apply an antibiotic ointment."}
