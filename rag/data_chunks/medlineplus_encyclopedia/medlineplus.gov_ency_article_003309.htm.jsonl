There are 8 bones in the skull itself and 14 bones in the face area. They join together to form a solid, bony cavity that protects and supports the brain. The areas where the bones join together are called the sutures.\nThe bones are not joined together firmly at birth. This allows the head to change shape to help it pass through the birth canal. The sutures gradually gain minerals and harden, firmly joining the skull bones together. This process is called ossification.\nIn an infant, the space where 2 sutures join forms a membrane-covered \"soft spot\" called a fontanelle (fontanel). The fontanelles allow the brain and skull to grow during an infant's first year.\nThere are normally several fontanelles on a newborn's skull. They are located mainly at the top, back, and sides of the head."}

They are located mainly at the top, back, and sides of the head. Like the sutures, fontanelles harden over time and become closed, solid, bony areas.\nThe fontanelle in the back of the head (posterior fontanelle) most often closes by age 1 to 2 months.\nThe fontanelle at the top of the head (\nanterior\nfontanelle) most often closes within 7 to 19 months.\nThe fontanelles should feel firm and should curve inward slightly to the touch. A noticeably sunken fontanelle is a sign that the infant does not have enough fluid in their body.\nCauses\nReasons a child may have sunken fontanelles include:\nDehydration\n(not enough fluid in the body)\nMalnutrition\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nA sunken fontanelle can be a medical emergency. A health care provider should check the infant right away.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nThe provider will perform a\nphysical exam\nand ask questions about the child's symptoms and medical history, such as:\nWhen did you first notice that the fontanelle looked sunken?\nHow severe is it?"}
