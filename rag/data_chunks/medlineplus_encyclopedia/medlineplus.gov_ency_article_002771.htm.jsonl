You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\nWhat to Expect at the Emergency Room\nThe health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate.\nA visit to the emergency room, however, may not be needed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well the person does depends on the amount of chalk swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. People with kidney disease may be more affected if a very large amount of chalk is ingested. The faster the person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\nChalk is considered a fairly nonpoisonous substance, so recovery is likely.\nAlternative Names\nChalk poisoning; Chalk - swallowing\nReferences\nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics.
