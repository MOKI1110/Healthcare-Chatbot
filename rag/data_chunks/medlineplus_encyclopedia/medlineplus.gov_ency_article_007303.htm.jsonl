Early-onset sepsis is seen in the first week of life. Late onset sepsis occurs after 1 week through 3 months of age.\nCauses\nNeonatal sepsis can be caused by bacteria such as\nEscherichia coli\n(\nE coli\n),\nListeria\n, and some strains of streptococcus.\nGroup B streptococcus (GBS)\nhas been a major cause of neonatal sepsis. However, this problem has become less common because women are screened for GBS during pregnancy. The\nherpes simplex virus\n(HSV) can also cause a severe infection in a newborn baby. This happens most often when the mother is newly infected with HSV.\nEarly-onset neonatal sepsis most often appears within 24 to 48 hours of birth. The baby gets the infection from the mother before or during delivery."}

The following increase an infant's risk for sepsis after delivery:\nHaving a catheter in a blood vessel for a long time\nStaying in the hospital for an extended period of time\nSymptoms\nInfants with neonatal sepsis may have the following symptoms:\nBody temperature changes\nBreathing problems\nDiarrhea or decreased bowel movements\nLow blood sugar\nReduced movements\nReduced sucking\nSeizures\nSlow or fast heart rate\nSwollen belly area\nVomiting\nYellow skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\nExams and Tests\nLab tests can help diagnose neonatal sepsis and identify the cause of the infection."}

Blood tests may include:\nBlood culture\nC-reactive protein\nComplete blood count (CBC)\nIf a baby has symptoms of sepsis, a lumbar puncture (spinal tap) will be done to look at the spinal fluid for bacteria. Skin, stool, and urine cultures may be done for HSV, especially if the mother has a history of HSV infection.\nA chest x-ray will be done if the baby has a cough or problems breathing.\nUrine culture tests are done in babies older than a few days.\nTreatment\nBabies younger than 4 weeks old who have fever or other signs of infection are started on intravenous (IV) antibiotics right away. (It may take 24 to 72 hours to get lab results.) Newborns whose mothers had chorioamnionitis or who may be at high risk for other reasons will also get IV antibiotics at first, even if they have no symptoms.\nThe baby will get antibiotics for up to 3 weeks if bacteria are found in the blood or spinal fluid."}

Treatment will be shorter if no bacteria are found.\nAn antiviral medicine called acyclovir will be used for infections that may be caused by HSV. Older babies who have normal lab results and have only a fever may not be given antibiotics. Instead, the child may be able to leave the hospital and come back for checkups.\nBabies who need treatment and have already gone home after birth will most often be admitted to the hospital for monitoring.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMany babies with bacterial infections will recover completely and have no other problems.
