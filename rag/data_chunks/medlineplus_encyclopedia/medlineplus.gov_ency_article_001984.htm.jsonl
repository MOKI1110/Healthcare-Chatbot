This type of behavior is normal for their age. Providing lots of healthy active play for your child can sometimes help.\nParents may question whether the child is just more active than most children. They may also wonder if their child has hyperactivity that is part of\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder\n(ADHD) or another mental health condition.\nIt is always important to make sure that your child can see and hear well. Also, make sure there are no stressful events at home or school that may explain the behavior.\nIf your child has had troubling behaviors for a while, or the behaviors are getting worse, the first step is to see your child's health care provider."}
