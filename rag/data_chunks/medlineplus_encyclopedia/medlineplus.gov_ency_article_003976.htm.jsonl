Although they may keep bedding and clothing cleaner, these products allow urine or stool to be in constant contact with the skin. Over time, the skin breaks down. Special care must be taken to keep the skin clean and dry. This can be done by:\nCleaning and drying the area right away after urinating or having a bowel movement.\nCleaning the skin with mild, dilute soap and water then rinsing well and gently patting dry.\nUse soap-free skin cleansers that do not cause dryness or irritation. Follow the product's instructions. Some products do not require rinsing.\nMoisturizing creams can help keep the skin moist. Avoid products that contain alcohol, which may irritate the skin. If you are receiving radiation therapy, ask your health care provider if it is OK to use any creams or lotions.\nConsider using a skin sealant or moisture barrier. Creams or ointments that contain zinc oxide, lanolin, or petrolatum form a protective barrier on the skin. Some skin care products, often in the form of a spray or a towelette, create a clear, protective film over the skin."}

Your provider can recommend barrier creams to help protect the skin.\nEven if these products are used, the skin must still be cleaned each time after passing urine or stool. Reapply the cream or ointment after cleaning and drying the skin.\nIncontinence can cause a yeast infection on the skin. This is an itchy, red, pimple-like rash. The skin may feel raw. Products are available to treat a yeast infection:\nIf the skin is moist most of the time, use a powder with antifungal medicine, such as nystatin or miconazole. Do not use baby powder.\nA moisture barrier or skin sealant may be applied over the powder.\nIf severe skin irritation develops, contact your provider.\nIf bacterial infection occurs, antibiotics applied to the skin or taken by mouth may help.\nThe National Association for Continence (NAFC) has helpful information at\nwww.nafc.org\n.\nIF YOU ARE BEDRIDDEN OR USING A WHEELCHAIR\nCheck your skin for pressure sores every day.
