This common infection can be passed between a mother and baby during breastfeeding.\nCauses\nCertain germs normally live in our bodies. While most germs are harmless, some can cause infection.\nThrush occurs when too much of a yeast (a type of fungus) called\nCandida albicans\ngrows in a baby's mouth. Germs called bacteria and fungi naturally grow in our bodies. Our immune system helps keep these germs in check. But babies do not have fully-formed immune systems. That makes it easier for too much yeast to grow.\nThrush often occurs when mother or baby has taken antibiotics. Antibiotics treat infections from bacteria. They can also kill good bacteria, and this allows yeast to grow.\nThe yeast thrives in warm, moist areas. The baby's mouth and the mother's nipples are perfect places for a yeast infection.\nBabies can also get a yeast infection on the diaper area at the same time."}

The sores are easy to recognize.\nTreatment\nYour baby might not need any treatment. Thrush often goes away on its own in a few days.\nYour provider may prescribe antifungal medicine to treat thrush. You paint this medicine on your baby's mouth and tongue.\nIf you have a yeast infection on your nipples, your provider may recommend an over-the-counter or prescription antifungal cream."}
