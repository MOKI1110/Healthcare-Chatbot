When you are healthy, your body is able to balance the amount of water that enters or leaves your body.\nA fluid imbalance may occur when you lose more water or fluid than your body can take in. It can also occur when you take in more water or fluid than your body is able to get rid of.\nCauses\nYour body is constantly losing water through breathing, sweating, and urinating. If you do not take in enough fluids or water, you become\ndehydrated\n.\nYour body may also have a hard time getting rid of fluids. As a result, excess fluid builds up in the body. This is called fluid overload (volume overload)."}

As a result, excess fluid builds up in the body. This is called fluid overload (volume overload). This can lead to edema (excess fluid in the skin and tissues).\nMany medical problems can cause fluid imbalance:\nAfter surgery, the body often retains large amounts of fluid for several days, causing swelling of the body.\nIn people with\nheart failure\n, fluid collects in the lungs, liver, blood vessels, and body tissues because the heart does a poor job of pumping it to the kidneys.\nWhen the kidneys do not work well because of\nlong-term (chronic) kidney disease\n, the body cannot get rid of unneeded fluids.\nThe body may lose too much fluid due to\ndiarrhea\n, vomiting, severe blood loss, or high fever.\nLack of a hormone called antidiuretic hormone (ADH) can cause the kidneys to get rid of too much fluid. This results in extreme thirst, dehydration, and chemical imbalance of the blood.\nOften, in people with fluid imbalance, a high or low blood level of sodium or potassium is present as well.\nMedicines can also affect fluid balance."}
