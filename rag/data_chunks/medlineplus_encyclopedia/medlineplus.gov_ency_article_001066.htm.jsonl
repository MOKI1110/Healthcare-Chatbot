It may result from direct injury to the cord itself or indirectly from disease of the nearby bones, tissues, or blood vessels.\nCauses\nThe spinal cord contains nerve fibers and cells. These nerve fibers carry messages between your brain and body. The spinal cord is located in the spinal canal of your spine in your neck, chest, and back down to the first lumbar vertebra.\nSpinal cord injury (SCI) can be caused by any of the following:\nAssault\nFalls\nGunshot wounds\nIndustrial accidents\nMotor vehicle collisions (MVCs)\nDiving\nSports injuries\nA minor injury can damage the spinal cord. Conditions such as\nrheumatoid arthritis\n, infection, cancer, or\nosteoporosis\ncan weaken the spine, which normally protects the spinal cord. Injury can also occur if the spinal canal protecting the spinal cord has become too narrow (\nspinal stenosis\n)."}

Injury can also occur if the spinal canal protecting the spinal cord has become too narrow (\nspinal stenosis\n). This occurs due to osteoarthritis of spine joints, usually in older people.\nDirect injury or damage to the spinal cord can occur due to:\nBruises if the bones have been weakened, loosened, or fractured\nDisc herniation\n(when the disc pushes against the spinal cord)\nFragments of bone (such as from broken vertebrae, which are the spine bones) in the spinal cord\nFragments of metal (such as from a motor vehicle collision or gunshot)\nCompression from twisting of the head, neck or back during an accident such as a slip and fall, or intense chiropractic manipulation\nTight spinal canal (spinal stenosis) that squeezes the spinal cord\nWhen the spine is out of alignment\nBleeding, fluid buildup, infection, and swelling can occur inside the spinal canal. This can press on the spinal cord and damage it.\nMost high impact SCIs, such as from MVCs or sports injuries, are seen in healthy people.\nMost low impact SCIs, such as a slip and fall, occur in older individuals with spinal stenosis."}

Most of these people were not aware they had spinal stenosis.\nRisk factors include:\nParticipating in risky physical activities\nRiding in or on high-speed vehicles\nDiving into shallow water\nSymptoms\nSymptoms vary, depending on the location of the injury. SCI causes weakness and loss of feeling at, and below the injury. The severity of the symptoms depends on whether the entire cord is injured (complete) or only partially injured (incomplete). An injury to the upper (cervical) spinal cord will result in weakness or paralysis of the arms and legs. An injury to the middle (thoracic) spinal cord will result in weakness of the legs only.\nAn injury below the first lumbar vertebra does not cause SCI because the spinal cord turns into a group of nerve roots called the cauda equina. But such an injury may cause cauda equina syndrome, which is an injury to these nerve roots."}

Muscles that control the bowels and bladder can also be affected. Spine injuries can damage the spinal cord if they are at the upper portion of the lumbar spine or the lumbar and sacral nerve roots (cauda equina) if they are at the lower lumbar spine.\nExams and Tests\nSCI is a medical emergency that needs medical attention right away.\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam, including a brain and nervous system (neurological) exam.

Before sledding, skiing or snowboarding down a hill, check the area for obstacles. Use the right techniques and equipment when playing football or other contact sports.\nDefensive driving and wearing a seat belt reduce the risk of serious injury if there is a car accident.\nInstall and use grab bars in the bathroom, and handrails next to stairs to prevent falls.\nPeople who have poor balance may need to use a walker or cane.\nHighway speed limits should be observed.
