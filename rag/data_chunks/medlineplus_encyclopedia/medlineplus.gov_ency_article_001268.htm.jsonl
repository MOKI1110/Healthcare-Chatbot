The kidneys fail to develop properly as the baby is growing in the womb. The kidneys normally produce the amniotic fluid (as urine) that surrounds the unborn baby.\nPotter phenotype refers to a typical facial appearance that occurs in a newborn when there is no amniotic fluid. The lack of amniotic fluid is called oligohydramnios. Without amniotic fluid, the infant is not cushioned from the walls of the uterus."}

The lack of amniotic fluid is called oligohydramnios. Without amniotic fluid, the infant is not cushioned from the walls of the uterus. The pressure of the uterine wall leads to an unusual facial appearance, including widely separated eyes.\nPotter phenotype may also lead to abnormal limbs, or limbs that are held in abnormal positions or\ncontractures\n.\nOligohydramnios also stops development of the lungs, so the lungs do not work properly at birth.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nWidely separated eyes with\nepicanthal folds\n,\nbroad nasal bridge\n,\nlow set ears\n, and\nreceding chin\nAbsence of urine output\nDifficulty breathing\nExams and Tests\nA pregnancy\nultrasound\nmay show lack of amniotic fluid, absence of fetal kidneys, or severely abnormal kidneys in the unborn baby.\nThe following tests may be used to help diagnose the condition in a newborn:\nX-ray of the abdomen\nX-ray of the lungs\nTreatment\nResuscitation at delivery may be attempted pending the diagnosis. Treatment will be provided for any urinary outlet obstruction.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThis is a very serious condition. Most of the time it is deadly."}
