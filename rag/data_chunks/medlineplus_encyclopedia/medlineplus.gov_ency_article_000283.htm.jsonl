This is the tube through which food moves from the mouth to the stomach.\nCauses\nEsophageal cancer is not common in the United States. It occurs most often in men over age 50 years.\nThere are two main types of esophageal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. These two types look different from each other under the microscope.\nSquamous cell esophageal cancer is linked to smoking and\ndrinking too much alcohol.\nAdenocarcinoma is the more common type of esophageal cancer. Having\nBarrett esophagus\nincreases the risk for this type of cancer. Acid reflux disease (\ngastroesophageal reflux disease\n, or GERD) can develop into Barrett esophagus."}

Having\nBarrett esophagus\nincreases the risk for this type of cancer. Acid reflux disease (\ngastroesophageal reflux disease\n, or GERD) can develop into Barrett esophagus. Other risk factors include smoking, being male, or being obese.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nBackward movement of food through the esophagus and possibly mouth (regurgitation)\nChest pain not related to eating\nDifficulty swallowing solids or liquids\nHeartburn\nVomiting blood\nWeight loss\nExams and Tests\nTests used to help diagnose esophageal cancer may include:\nSeries of x-rays taken to examine the esophagus (\nbarium swallow\n)\nChest MRI\nor\nthoracic CT\n(usually used to help determine the stage of the disease)\nEndoscopic\nultrasound (also sometimes used to determine the stage of disease)\nTest to examine and remove a sample of the lining of the esophagus (\nesophagogastroduodenoscopy\n, EGD)\nPET scan\n(sometimes useful for determining the stage of disease, and whether surgery is possible)\nStool testing may show small amounts of blood in the stool.\nTreatment\nEGD will be used to obtain a tissue sample from the esophagus to diagnose cancer.\nWhen the cancer is only in the esop"}

The cancer and part, or all, of the esophagus is removed. The surgery may be done using:\nOpen surgery\n, during which 1 or 2 larger incisions are made.\nMinimally invasive surgery\n, during which 2 to 4 small incisions are made in the belly. A laparoscope with a tiny camera is inserted into the belly through one of the incisions.\nRadiation therapy may also be used instead of surgery in some cases when the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus.\nEither chemotherapy, radiation, or both may be used to shrink the tumor and make surgery easier to perform.\nIf the person is too ill to have major surgery or the cancer has spread to other organs, chemotherapy or radiation may be used to help reduce symptoms. This is called palliative therapy. In such cases, the disease is usually not curable.\nBesides a change in diet, other treatments that may be used to help the patient swallow include:\nDilating (widening) the esophagus using an endoscope."}

The light activates the medicine that attacks the tumor.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\ncancer support group\n. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWhen the cancer has not spread outside the esophagus, surgery may improve the chance of survival.\nWhen the cancer has spread to other areas of the body, a cure is generally not possible. Treatment is directed toward relieving symptoms.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nPneumonia\nSevere weight loss from not eating enough\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have difficulty swallowing with no known cause and it does not get better."}
