This is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells. The cancer grows from cells that would normally turn into white blood cells.\nAcute means the disease grows quickly and usually has an aggressive course.\nCauses\nAML is one of the most common types of\nleukemia\namong adults.\nAML is more common in men than women.\nThe bone marrow helps the body fight infections and makes other blood components. People with AML have many abnormal immature white blood cells inside their bone marrow. The cells grow very quickly, and replace healthy blood cells. As a result, people with AML are more likely to have infections. They also have an increased risk of bleeding as the numbers of healthy blood cells decrease.\nMost of the time, a health care provider cannot tell you what caused AML."}

However, the following things can lead to some types of leukemia, including AML:\nBlood disorders, including\npolycythemia vera\n,\nessential thrombocythemia\n, and myelodysplasia\nCertain chemicals (for example, benzene)\nCertain\nchemotherapy\ndrugs, including etoposide and drugs known as alkylating agents\nExposure to certain chemicals and harmful substances\nRadiation\nWeak immune system due to an organ transplant\nProblems with your genes may also cause AML to develop.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of AML are mainly due to the effects on blood elements. Symptoms of AML may include any of the following:\nBleeding from the nose\nBleeding\nand\nswelling\n(rare) in the gums\nBruising\nBone pain or tenderness\nFever and fatigue\nHeavy menstrual periods\nPale skin\nShortness of breath\n(gets worse with exercise)\nWeight loss\nExams and Tests\nThe provider will perform a physical exam. There may be signs of a swollen spleen, liver, or lymph nodes."}

There may be signs of a swollen spleen, liver, or lymph nodes. Tests done include:\nA complete blood count (\nCBC\n) may show anemia and a low number of platelets. A white blood cell count (\nWBC\n) can be high, low, or normal.\nBone marrow aspiration\nand\nbiopsy\nwill show if there are any leukemia cells.\nIf your provider learns you do have this type of leukemia, further tests will be done to determine the specific type of AML. Subtypes are based on specific changes in genes (mutations) and how the leukemia cells appear under the microscope.\nTreatment\nTreatment involves using medicines (\nchemotherapy\n) to kill the cancer cells. Most types of AML are treated with more than one chemotherapy medicine. Drugs that are targeted to specific mutations in the leukemic cells are also often used.\nChemotherapy kills normal cells, too."}

Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWhen a bone marrow biopsy shows no evidence of AML, you are said to be in remission. How well you do depends on your overall health and the genetic subtype of the AML cells.\nRemission is not the same as a cure. More therapy is usually needed, either in the form of more chemotherapy or a bone marrow transplant.\nWith treatment, younger people with AML tend to do better than those who develop the disease at an older age. The 5-year survival rate is much lower in older adults than in younger people. Experts say this is partly due to the fact that younger people are better able to tolerate strong chemotherapy medicines."}
