Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBrain herniation\nBrain herniation\nBrain herniation is the shifting of the brain tissue from one space in the skull to another through various folds and openings.\nCauses\nBrain herniation occurs when something inside the skull produces pressure that moves brain tissues. This is most often the result of brain swelling or bleeding from a head injury,\nstroke\n, or brain tumor.\nBrain herniation can be a side effect of tumors in the brain, including:\nMetastatic brain tumor\nPrimary brain tumor\nHerniation of the brain can also be caused by other factors that lead to increased pressure inside the skull, including:\nCollection of pus and other material in the brain, usually from a bacterial or fungal infection (\nabscess\n)\nBleeding in the brain (hemorrhage)\nBuildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling (\nhydrocephalus\n)\nStrokes that cause brain swelling\nSwelling after\nradiation therapy\nDefect in brain structure, such as a condition called Arnold-Chiari malformation\nSwelling due to loss of oxygen (\nhypoxia\n) to the brain\nBrain herniation can occur:\nFrom si"}

Treatment may involve:\nPlacing a drain into the brain to help remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)\nMedicines to reduce swelling, especially if there is a brain tumor,  such as mannitol, saline, or other diuretics\nPlacing a tube in the airway (\nendotracheal intubation\n) and increasing the breathing rate to reduce the levels of carbon dioxide (CO\n2\n) in the blood\nRemoving blood or blood clots if they are raising pressure inside the skull and causing herniation\nRemoving part of the skull to give the brain more room\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPeople who have a brain herniation usually have a serious brain injury. They may already have a low chance of recovery due to the injury that caused the herniation. When herniation occurs, it further lowers the chance of recovery.\nThe outlook varies, depending on where in the brain the herniation occurs.
