Blood samples are taken through an intravenous (IV) line instead of reinserting the needle each time. The test takes between 2 and 5 hours.\nThe procedure is done the following way:\nAn IV is usually placed in a vein, most often the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. The site is first cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic).\nThe first sample is drawn early in the morning.\nMedicine is given through the vein. This medicine stimulates the pituitary gland to release GH. Several medicines are available. Your health care provider will decide which medicine is best.\nAdditional blood samples are drawn over the next few hours.\nAfter the last sample is taken, the IV line is removed. Pressure is applied to stop any bleeding.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nDO NOT eat for 10 to 12 hours before the test."}

Eating food can change the test results.\nSome medicines can affect the test results. Ask your provider if you should stop taking any of your medicines before the test.\nIf your child will have this test, explain how the test will feel. You may want to demonstrate on a doll. The more familiar your child is with what will happen and the purpose of the procedure, the less anxiety they will feel.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is most often done to find out whether a\ngrowth hormone deficiency\n(GH deficiency) is causing slowed growth.\nNormal Results\nNormal results include:\nNormal peak value, at least 10 ng/mL (10  µg/L)\nIndeterminate, 5 to 10 ng/mL (5 to 10   µg/L)\nSubnormal, 5 ng/mL (5  µg/L)\nA normal value rules out hGH deficiency."}

In some laboratories, the normal level is 7 ng/mL (7  µg/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf this test does not raise GH levels, there is a reduced amount of hGH stored in the\nanterior\npituitary.\nIn children, this results in GH deficiency. In adults, it may be linked to adult GH deficiency.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
