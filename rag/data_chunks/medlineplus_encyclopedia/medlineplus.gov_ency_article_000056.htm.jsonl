Even a person who is in good shape can suffer heat illness if warning signs are ignored.\nThe following make it harder for the body to regulate its temperature, and make a heat emergency more likely:\nDrinking alcohol before or during exposure to heat or high humidity\nNot drinking enough fluids when you're active on warmer or hot days\nHeart disease\nCertain medicines: Examples are beta-blockers, water pills or diuretics, some medicines used to treat depression,\npsychosis\n, or\nADHD\nSweat gland problems\nWearing too much clothing\nSymptoms\nMuscle cramps are the first stage of heat illness. If heat exposure continues and these symptoms are not treated, they can lead to heat exhaustion and then heat stroke.\nHeat stroke occurs when the body is no longer able to regulate its temperature, and it keeps rising."}

Raise the person's feet about 12 inches (30 centimeters).\nApply cool, wet cloths (or cool water directly) to the person's skin and use a fan to lower body temperature. Place cold compresses on the person's neck, groin, and armpits.\nIf alert, give the person a beverage to sip (such as a sports drink), or make a salted drink by adding a teaspoon (6 grams) of salt per quart (1 liter) of water. Give a half cup (120 milliliters) every 15 minutes. Cool water will do if salt beverages are not available.\nFor muscle cramps, give beverages as noted above and massage affected muscles gently, but firmly, until they relax.\nIf the person shows signs of\nshock\n(\nbluish lips and fingernails\nand\ndecreased alertness\n), starts having seizures, or loses consciousness, call 911 or the local emergency number and give first aid as needed.\nDO NOT\nFollow these precautions:\nDo not give the person medicines that are used to treat fever (such as aspirin or acetaminophen)."}
