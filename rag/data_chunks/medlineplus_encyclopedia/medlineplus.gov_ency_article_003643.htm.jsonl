Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nWBC count\nWBC count\nA WBC count is a blood test to measure the number of white blood cells (WBCs) in the blood. It is a part of a complete blood count (CBC).\nWBCs are also called leukocytes. They help fight infections. There are\nfive major types of white blood cells\n:\nBasophils\nEosinophils\nLymphocytes (T cells, B cells, and Natural Killer cells)\nMonocytes\nNeutrophils\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nMost of the time, you do not need to take special steps before this test. Tell your health care provider the medicines you are taking, including the ones without a prescription. Some medicines may change the test results.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou will have this test to find out how many WBCs you have."}

Your provider may order this test to help diagnose conditions such as:\nAn infection\nAllergic reaction\nInflammation\nBlood cancer such as\nleukemia\nor lymphoma\nNormal Results\nThe normal number of WBCs in the blood is 4,500 to 11,000 WBCs per microliter (4.5 to 11.0 Ã 10\n9\n/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about your test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nLOW WBC COUNT\nA low number of WBCs is called leukopenia. A count less than 4,500 cells per microliter (4.5 Ã 10\n9\n/L) is below normal.\nNeutrophils are one type of WBC."}
