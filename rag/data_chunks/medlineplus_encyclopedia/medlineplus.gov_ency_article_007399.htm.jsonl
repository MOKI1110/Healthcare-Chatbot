A\nfemoral hernia\nis tissue that bulges out of a weak spot in the groin. Usually, this tissue is part of the intestine.\nDescription\nDuring surgery to repair the hernia, the bulging tissue is pushed back in. The weakened area is sewn closed or strengthened. This repair can be done with open or laparoscopic surgery. You and your surgeon can discuss which type of surgery is right for you.\nIn open surgery:\nYou may receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n. This is medicine that keeps you asleep and pain-free. Or, you may receive\nregional anesthesia\n, which numbs you from the waist to your feet. Or, your surgeon may choose to give you\nlocal anesthesia and medicine to relax you\n.\nYour surgeon makes a cut (incision) in your groin area.\nThe hernia is located and separated from the tissues around it. Some of the extra hernia tissue may be removed."}

Some of the extra hernia tissue may be removed. The rest of the hernia contents are gently pushed back inside your abdomen.\nThe surgeon then closes your weakened abdominal muscles with stitches.\nOften a piece of mesh is also sewn into place to strengthen your abdominal wall. This repairs the weakness in the wall.\nAt the end of the repair, the cuts are stitched, stapled, or glued.\nIn laparoscopic surgery:\nThe surgeon makes 3 to 5 small cuts in your groin and lower belly.\nA medical device called a laparoscope is inserted through one of the cuts. The scope is a thin, lighted tube with a camera on the end. It lets the surgeon see inside your belly.\nGas is pumped into your belly to expand the space. This gives your surgeon more room to see and work.\nOther tools are inserted through the other cuts. Your surgeon uses these tools to repair the hernia.\nThe same repair will be done as in open surgery.\nAt the end of the repair, the scope and other tools are removed."}

The cuts are stitched, stapled, or glued.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nA femoral hernia should be repaired, even if it does not cause symptoms. If the hernia is not repaired, the intestine can get trapped inside the hernia. This is called an incarcerated, or strangulated, hernia. It can cut off blood supply to the intestines. This can be life threatening. If this happens, you would need emergency surgery.\nRisks\nRisks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:\nReactions to medicines\nBreathing problems\nBleeding\n,\nblood clots\n, or infection\nNausea and vomiting\nRisks for this surgery are:\nDamage to blood vessels that go to the leg\nDamage to the nearby nerve\nDamage near the reproductive organs, for women\nLong-term pain\nReturn of the hernia\nDifficulty passing your urine\nBefore the Procedure\nTell your surgeon or nurse if:\nYou are or could be pregnant.\nYou are taking any medicines, including medicines, drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\nPlanning for your surgery:"}
