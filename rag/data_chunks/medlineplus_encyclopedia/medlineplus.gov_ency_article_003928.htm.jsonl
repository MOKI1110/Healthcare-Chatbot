Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNerve biopsy\nNerve biopsy\nA nerve biopsy is the removal of a small piece of a nerve for examination.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA nerve biopsy is most often done on a nerve in the ankle called the sural nerve. Other sites may be used, depending on the test.\nYour health care provider applies numbing medicine (local anesthetic) to the area before the procedure. The provider makes a small surgical cut and removes a piece of the nerve. The cut is then closed and a bandage is put on it. The nerve sample is sent to a lab, where it is examined under a microscope.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nFollow your provider's instructions on how to prepare for the procedure.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the numbing medicine is injected, you will feel a prick and a mild sting."}

The biopsy site  may be sore for a few days after the test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nNerve biopsy may be done to help diagnose:\nAxon degeneration (destruction of the axon portion of the nerve cell)\nDamage to the small nerves\nDemyelination (destruction of parts of the\nmyelin\nsheath covering the nerve)\nInflammatory nerve conditions (neuropathies)\nNerve biopsy is usually done to look for inflammation that could be damaging the nerve."}
