The medicine helps remove the fetus and placenta to leave the woman's womb (uterus). Medication abortion is also called the abortion pill.\nA medication abortion is not the same as a\nmiscarriage\n. Miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends on its own before the 20th week of pregnancy. Miscarriage is sometimes called a spontaneous abortion.\nAn abortion procedure uses a medical procedure to end a pregnancy.\nDescription\nA medication abortion can be done within 11 weeks of the first day of the woman's last period. A combination of two prescription hormone medicines is most often used to help the body expel the fetus and placenta tissue. Your health care provider may prescribe the medicines for you after doing a physical exam and asking questions about your medical history.\nMedicines used are mifepristone and misoprostol. Your provider will prescribe the medicines, and you will take them at home."}

Your provider will prescribe the medicines, and you will take them at home. Some providers may require you to take the mifepristone in their office before you leave.\nAfter you take the medicine, your body will expel the pregnancy tissue. Most women have moderate to heavy bleeding and cramping for several hours. You may have nausea, diarrhea, and sometimes vomiting from taking misoprostol. Your provider may prescribe medicine for pain and nausea to ease your discomfort during this process.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nReasons a medication abortion might be considered include:\nYou have made a personal decision to not carry the pregnancy.\nYour baby has a severe birth defect or genetic problem.\nYour pregnancy may be harmful to your health.\nThe pregnancy resulted after a traumatic event such as\nrape or incest\n.\nThe decision to end a pregnancy is very personal."}

This is to make sure the process was completed and all the tissue was expelled. The medicine may not work in a very small number of women. If this happens, another dose of the medicine or an\nabortion\nprocedure may be needed.\nPhysical recovery most often occurs within a few days. It will depend on the stage of the pregnancy. Expect some vaginal bleeding and mild cramping for a few days.\nTo relieve discomfort or pain in your abdomen:\nApply a heating pad set on low or a hot water bottle filled with warm water on your abdomen to help ease discomfort.\nTake over-the-counter painkillers as instructed.\nFollow these activity guidelines after your procedure:\nRest as needed.\nDo not do any vigorous activity for a few days."}
