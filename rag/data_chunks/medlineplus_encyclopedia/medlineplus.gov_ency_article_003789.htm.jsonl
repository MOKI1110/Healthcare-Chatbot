CT stands for computed tomography.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner. Most often, you will lie on your back with your arms raised above your head.\nOnce you are inside the scanner, the machine's\nx-ray\nbeam rotates around you. Modern spiral scanners can perform the exam without stopping. There is very little noise.\nA computer creates separate images of the belly area. These are called slices. These images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, printed on film or saved to a disk. Three-dimensional models of the belly area can be made by stacking the slices together.\nYou must be still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images."}

You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time.\nIn many cases, an abdominal CT is done with a\npelvis CT\n.\nThe scan should take less than 30 minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may need to have a special dye, called contrast, put into your body before some exams. Contrast helps certain areas show up better on the scans. Contrast can be administered in various ways. Such as:\nContrast can be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. If contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.\nYou may have to drink the contrast before the exam. When you drink it will depend on the type of exam being done. Contrast has a chalky taste, although some are flavored so they taste a little better."}

When you drink it will depend on the type of exam being done. Contrast has a chalky taste, although some are flavored so they taste a little better. The contrast you drink will pass out of your body through your stools and is harmless.\nRarely, the contrast may be given into your rectum using an enema.\nLet your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test to safely receive this substance.\nBefore receiving the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes medicine metformin (Glucophage). People taking this medicine may have to stop taking it for a while before the test.\nLet your provider know if you have any kidney problems. The IV contrast can worsen kidney function.\nToo much weight can damage the scanner."}

Find out if the CT machine has a weight limit if you weigh more than 300 pounds (136 kg).\nYou will need to take off your jewelry and wear a hospital gown during the study.\nHow the Test will Feel\nLying on the hard table may be a bit uncomfortable.\nIf you have contrast through a vein (IV), you may have:\nSlight burning sensation\nMetallic taste in the mouth\nWarm flushing of the body\nThese feelings are normal and go away within a few seconds.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nAn abdominal CT scan makes detailed pictures of the structures inside your belly very quickly.\nThis test may be used to look for:\nCause of blood in the urine\nCause of abdominal pain or swelling\nCause of abnormal blood test results such as liver or kidney problems\nHernia\nCause of a fever\nMasses and tumors, including cancer\nInfections or injury\nKidney stones\nAppendicitis\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThe abdominal CT scan may show some cancers, including:\nCancer of the renal pelvis or ureter\nColon cancer\nHepatocellular carcinoma\nLy"}

Many x-rays or CT scans over time may increase your risk for cancer. However, the risk from any one scan is small. Most modern scanners are able to reduce the radiation exposure. Talk to your provider about this risk and the benefit of the test for getting a correct diagnosis of your medical problem.\nSome people have allergies to contrast dye. Let your provider know if you have ever had an allergic reaction to injected contrast dye.\nThe most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. If you have an iodine allergy, you may have\nnausea or vomiting\n,\nsneezing\n,\nitching\n, or\nhives\nif you get this type of contrast. If you must be given such contrast, your provider may give you\nantihistamines\n(such as Benadryl) or steroids before the test.\nYour kidneys help remove IV dye from the body. You may need extra fluids after the test to help flush the iodine out of your body if you have kidney disease or diabetes.\nRarely, the dye may cause a life-threatening allergic response."}
