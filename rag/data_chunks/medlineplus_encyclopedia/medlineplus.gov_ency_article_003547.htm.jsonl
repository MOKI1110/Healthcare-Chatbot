Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCoccidioides complement fixation\nCoccidioides complement fixation\nCoccidioides complement fixation is a blood test that looks for substances (proteins) called\nantibodies\n, which are produced by the body in reaction to the fungus\nCoccidioides immitis\n. This fungus causes the disease\ncoccidioidomycosis\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample is needed\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no special preparation for the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain, while others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is used to detect infection with the fungus that causes coccidioidomycosis, or Valley fever. This condition can cause lung (localized) or widespread (disseminated) infection.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means no\nCoccidioides immitis\nantibodies are detected in the blood sample.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}

Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results mean that\nCoccidioides immitis\nantibodies are present. This can mean that you have a current or past infection.\nThe test may be repeated after several weeks to detect a rise in\ntiter\n(antibody concentration), which confirms an active infection.\nIn general, the worse the infection, the higher is the titer, except in people with a weakened immune system.\nThere can be false positive tests in people with other fungal diseases such as\nhistoplasmosis\nand\nblastomycosis\n, and false negative tests in people with single lung masses from coccidioidomycosis.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
