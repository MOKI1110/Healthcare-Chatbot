This means that each parent must pass on a copy of the defective gene in order for the child to have the disease.\nAlthough congenital means present from birth, with congenital nephrotic syndrome, symptoms of the disease occur in the first 3 months of life.\nCongenital nephrotic syndrome is a very rare form of nephrotic syndrome.\nNephrotic syndrome is defined by a set of abnormal findings that include:\nProtein in the urine\nLow blood protein levels in the blood\nHigh cholesterol levels\nHigh triglyceride levels\nSwelling\nChildren with this disorder have an abnormal form of a protein called nephrin."}

The kidney's filters (glomeruli) need this protein to function normally.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of nephrotic syndrome include:\nCough\nDecreased urine output\nFoamy appearance of urine\nLow birth weight\nPoor appetite\nSwelling\n(total body)\nExams and Tests\nAn ultrasound done on the pregnant mother may show a larger-than-normal placenta. The placenta is the organ that develops during pregnancy to feed the growing baby.\nPregnant mothers may have a screening test done during pregnancy to check for this condition. The test looks for higher-than-normal levels of alpha-fetoprotein in a sample of amniotic fluid. Genetic tests are then used to confirm the diagnosis if the screening test is positive.\nAfter birth, the infant will show signs of severe fluid retention and swelling. The health care provider will hear abnormal sounds when listening to the baby's heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Blood pressure may be high."}

It can lead to death by age 5, and many children die within the first year."}
