The medicines listed below, however, are more likely to cause diarrhea.\nLaxatives are meant to cause diarrhea.\nThey work either by drawing water into the gut or by causing the muscles of the intestines to contract.\nHowever, taking too much of a laxative can cause diarrhea that is a problem.\nAntacids that have magnesium in them may also cause diarrhea or make it worse.\nAntibiotics also can produce diarrhea.\nNormally, the intestines have many different bacteria. They keep each other in balance. Antibiotics destroy some of these bacteria, which allow other types to grow too much.\nIn some cases, antibiotics can allow a type of bacteria called\nClostridioides difficile\nto grow too much."}
