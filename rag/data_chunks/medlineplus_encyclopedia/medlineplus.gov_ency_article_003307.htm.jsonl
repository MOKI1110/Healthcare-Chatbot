There are 8 bones in the skull itself and 14 bones in the face area. They join together to form a solid, bony cavity that protects and supports the brain. The areas where the bones join together are called the sutures.\nIn an infant only a few minutes old, the pressure from delivery may compress the head. This makes the bony plates overlap at the sutures and creates a small ridge. This is normal in newborns. In the next few days, the baby's head expands. The overlap disappears and the edges of the bony plates meet edge-to-edge. This is the normal position.\nDiseases or conditions that cause an abnormal increase in the pressure within the head can cause the sutures to spread apart. These separated sutures can be a sign of pressure within the skull (\nincreased intracranial pressure\n).\nSeparated sutures may be associated with\nbulging fontanelles\n."}

This will include examining the fontanelles and scalp veins and feeling (palpating) the sutures to find out how far they are separated.\nThe provider will ask questions about the child's medical history and symptoms, including:\nDoes the child have other symptoms (such as abnormal\nhead circumference\n)?\nWhen did you first notice the separated sutures?\nDoes it seem to be getting worse?\nIs the child otherwise well? (For example, are eating and activity patterns normal?)\nThe following tests may be performed:\nMRI of the head\nCT scan of the head\nUltrasound\nof the head\nInfectious disease work-up, including\nblood cultures\nand possible\nspinal tap\nMetabolic work-up, such as blood tests to look at\nelectrolyte\nlevels\nStandard eye exam\nAlthough your provider keeps records from routine checkups, you might find it helpful to keep your own records of your child's development."}
