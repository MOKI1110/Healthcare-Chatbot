Aging of the skin, hair and nails is a natural process.\nFrequent or prolonged exposure to sunlight results in early skin wrinkles and dark areas (\nliver spots\n).

Wear hats and clothing that protect your skin and\nuse sunscreen\ndaily. Avoid smoking and secondhand smoke.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nWrinkles are not usually a cause for concern unless they occur at an early age. Talk to your health care provider if you think that your skin is getting wrinkled faster than normal for someone your age or if you would like to consider cosmetic treatments for normal wrinkles from aging."}
