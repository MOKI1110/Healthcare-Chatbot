Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEndoscopic ultrasound\nEndoscopic ultrasound\nEndoscopic ultrasound is a type of imaging test. It is used to see organs in and near the digestive tract.\nHow the Test is Performed\nUltrasound is a way to see the inside of the body using high-frequency sound waves. Endoscopic ultrasound does this with a thin, flexible tube called an endoscope.\nThis tube is passed either through the mouth or through the rectum and into the digestive tract.\nSound waves are sent out the end of the tube and bounce off the organs in the body.\nA computer receives these waves and uses them to create a picture of what is inside.\nThis test does not expose you to harmful radiation.\nIf a sample or\nbiopsy\nis needed, a thin needle can be passed through the tube to collect fluid or tissue. This does not hurt. Treatment of certain problems can also be done.\nThe test takes 30 to 90 minutes to complete. Often you will be given medicine to help you relax.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour health care provider will tell you what to do."}
