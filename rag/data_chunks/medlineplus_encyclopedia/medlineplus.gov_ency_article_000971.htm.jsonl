The condition is found in babies or young children.\nCauses\nThe hip is a ball and socket joint. The ball is called the femoral head. It forms the top part of the thigh bone (femur). The socket (acetabulum) forms in the pelvic bone.\nIn some newborns, the socket is too shallow and the ball (thigh bone) may slip out of the socket, either part of the way or completely. One or both hips may be involved.\nThe cause is unknown. Low levels of\namniotic fluid\nin the womb during pregnancy can increase a baby's risk for DDH. Other risk factors include:\nBeing the first child\nBeing female\nBreech position during pregnancy, in which the baby's bottom is down\nFamily history of the disorder\nLarge birth weight\nDDH occurs in about 1 to 1.5 of 1,000 births.\nSymptoms\nThere may be no symptoms."}

Symptoms that may occur in a newborn can include:\nThe leg with a hip problem may appear to turn out more\nReduced movement on the side of the body with the dislocation\nShorter leg on the side with the hip dislocation\nUneven skin folds of thigh or buttocks\nAfter 3 months of age, the affected leg may turn outward or be shorter than the other leg.\nOnce the child begins walking, symptoms can include:\nWaddling\nor limping while walking\nOne shorter leg, so the child walks on their toes on one side and not the other side\nThe child's lower back is rounded inward\nExams and Tests\nPediatric health care providers routinely screen all newborns and infants for hip dysplasia. There are several methods to detect a dislocated hip or a hip that is able to be dislocated.\nThe most common method of identifying the condition is a physical exam of the hips, which involves applying pressure while moving the hips."}

The provider listens for any clicks, clunks, or pops.\nUltrasound\nof the hip is used in younger infants to confirm the problem. An x-ray of the hip joint may help diagnose the condition in older infants and children.\nA hip that is truly dislocated in an infant should be detected at birth, but some cases are mild and symptoms may not develop until after birth, which is why multiple exams are recommended. Some mild cases are silent and cannot be found during a physical exam.\nTreatment\nWhen the problem is found during the first 6 months of life, a device or harness is used to keep the legs apart and turned outward (frog-leg position). This device will most often hold the hip joint in place while the child grows.\nThis harness works for most infants when it is started before age 6 months, but it is less likely to work for older children.\nChildren who do not improve or who are diagnosed after 6 months often need surgery."}

After surgery, a cast will be placed on the child's leg for a period of time.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf hip dysplasia is found in the first few months of life, it can almost always be treated successfully with a positioning device (bracing). In a few cases, surgery is needed to put the hip back in joint.\nHip dysplasia that is found after early infancy may lead to a worse outcome and may need more complex surgery to fix the problem.\nPossible Complications\nBracing devices may cause skin irritation."}
