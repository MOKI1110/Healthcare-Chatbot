The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\nSwallowing this type of poison can affect many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue death. Infection, shock, and death can follow, even several months after the poison has been swallowed. Scars may form in these tissues leading to long-term problems with breathing, swallowing and digestion.\nIf kerosene gets into the lungs (aspiration), serious and, possibly, permanent lung damage can occur.\nAlternative Names\nLamp oil poisoning; Coal oil poisoning\nReferences\nNelson LS, Calello DP.
