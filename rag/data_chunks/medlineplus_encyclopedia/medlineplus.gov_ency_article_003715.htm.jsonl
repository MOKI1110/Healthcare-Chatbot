The test is also done to check for abnormal forms of AAT.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no special preparation.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is helpful in identifying a rare form of\nemphysema\nin adults and a rare form of liver disease (\ncirrhosis\n) in children and adults caused by an\nAAT deficiency\n. AAT deficiency is passed down through families. The condition causes the liver to make too little of AAT, a protein that protects the lungs and liver from damage.\nEveryone has two copies of the gene that makes AAT. People with two variant copies of the gene have lower blood levels and are at risk for more severe disease."}

Different gene variants may cause differing severity of illness.\nNormal Results\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA lower-than-normal level of AAT may be associated with:\nDamage of the large airways in the lungs (\nbronchiectasis\n)\nScarring of the liver (cirrhosis)\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n(COPD)\nLiver tumors\nYellowing of the skin and eyes due to blocked bile flow (\nobstructive jaundice\n)\nHigh blood pressure in the large vein that leads to the liver (portal hypertension)\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other."}
