Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nGGT is an enzyme found in high levels in the liver, kidney, pancreas, heart, and brain. It is also found in lesser amount in other tissues."}

This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nGGT is an enzyme found in high levels in the liver, kidney, pancreas, heart, and brain. It is also found in lesser amount in other tissues. An enzyme is a protein that causes a specific chemical change in the body.\nThis test is used to detect diseases of the liver or\nbile\nducts. It is also done with other tests (such as the\nALT\n,\nAST\n,\nALP\n, and\nbilirubin\ntests) to tell the difference between liver or bile duct disorders and bone disease.\nIt may also be done to screen for, or monitor, alcohol use.\nNormal Results\nThe normal range for adults is 5 to 40 units per liter (U/L) or 0.08 to 0.67 micro-kat/liter ( µkat/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn increased GGT level may be due to any of the following:\nAlcohol use\nDiabetes\nFlow of bile from the liver is blocked (\ncholestasis\n)\nHeart failure\nLack of blood flow to the liver (liver ischemia)\nLiver tissue death\nLiver cancer or tumor\nLung disease\nPancreas disease\nScarring of the liver (\ncirrhosis\n)\nSwollen and inflamed liver (\nhepatitis\n)\nUse of medicines and drugs that are toxic to the liver, especially alcohol use\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
