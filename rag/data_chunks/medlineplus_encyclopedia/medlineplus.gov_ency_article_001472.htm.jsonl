They appear at birth or in the first few weeks of life.  Dermal melanocytosis was formerly called Mongolian blue spots.\nCauses\nDermal melanocytosis is  common among people of Asian, Native American, Hispanic, East Indian, and African descent.\nThe color of the birth mark is from a collection of melanocytes in the deeper layers of the skin. Melanocytes are cells that make the pigment (color) in the skin.\nSymptoms\nDermal melanocytosis is  not cancerous and is not associated with disease. The markings may cover a large area of the back.\nThe markings are usually:\nBlue or blue-gray spots on the back, buttocks, base of spine, shoulders, or other body areas\nFlat with irregular shape and unclear edges\nNormal in skin texture\n2 to 8 centimeters wide or larger\nDermal melanocytosis is  sometimes mistaken for\nbruises\n. This can raise a question about possible child abuse."}

Your health care provider can diagnose this condition by looking at the skin.\nIf your provider suspects an underlying disorder, further tests will be done.\nTreatment\nNo treatment is  needed when dermal melanocytosis  is a normal birthmark. If treatment is needed, lasers may be used.\nSpots  may be  a sign of an underlying disorder. If so,  treatment for that problem will likely be recommended. Your provider can tell you more.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSpots that are normal birthmarks often fade in a few years. They are almost always gone by the teen years.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nAll birthmarks should be examined by a provider during the routine newborn examination.\nAlternative Names\nMongolian spots; Congenital dermal melanocytosis\nImages\nMongolian blue spots\nNeonate\nReferences\nHaley A, Cummings K.
