Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSkin or nail culture\nSkin or nail culture\nA skin or nail culture is a laboratory test to look for and identify germs that cause problems with the skin or nails.\nIt is called a mucosal culture if the sample involves the mucous membranes.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYour health care provider may use a cotton swab or knife blade to collect a sample from an open skin rash or skin sore.\nA sample of skin may need to be taken. This is called a\nskin biopsy\n. Before the skin sample is removed, you will likely receive a shot (injection) of numbing medicine to prevent pain.\nA small sample of a fingernail or toenail may be taken. The sample is sent to a lab. There, it is placed in a special dish (culture). It is then watched to see if bacteria, viruses, or fungi grow. It may take up to 3 weeks to get results of a nail culture. Further tests can be done to identify the specific germ that is causing your problem. This can help your provider determine the best treatment.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no preparation needed for this test."}

This can help your provider determine the best treatment.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no preparation needed for this test. If a skin or\nmucosal\nsample is needed, your provider will tell you how to prepare.\nHow the Test will Feel\nIf a skin biopsy is done, you may feel a sting when the shot of numbing medicine is given.\nFor a nail sample, the provider scrapes the affected area of the nail or clips off a piece of the nail. There is usually no pain.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test may be done to diagnose the cause of:\nA bacteria or fungus infection of the skin, finger, or toenail\nskin rash\nor sore that appears to be infected\nA skin ulcer that is not healing\nNormal Results\nA normal result means no disease-causing germs are seen in the culture.\nSome germs normally live on the skin. These are not a sign of infection and are considered a normal finding.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}
