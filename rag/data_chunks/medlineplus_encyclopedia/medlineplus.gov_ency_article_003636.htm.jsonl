A low level of this substance causes a condition called\ngalactosemia\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some infants feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis is a screening test for galactosemia.\nIn normal diets, most galactose comes from the breakdown (\nmetabolism\n) of lactose, which is found in milk and dairy products. One out of 65,000 newborns lack a substance (enzyme) called GALT. Without this substance, the body cannot break down galactose, and the substance builds up in the blood."}

Continued use of milk products can lead to:\nClouding of the lens of the eye (\ncataracts\n)\nScarring of the liver (\ncirrhosis\n)\nFailure to thrive\nYellow color of the skin or eyes (\njaundice\n)\nLiver enlargement\nIntellectual disability\nThis can be a serious condition if not treated.\nEvery state in the United States provides newborn screening tests to check for this disorder.\nNormal Results\nThe normal range is less than 24.5 nmol/hour/mg of\nhemoglobin\n.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result suggests galactosemia. Further tests must be done to confirm the diagnosis.\nIf your child has galactosemia, a genetics specialist should be consulted promptly. The child should be put on a no-milk diet right away. This means no breast milk and no animal milk."}

The child should be put on a no-milk diet right away. This means no breast milk and no animal milk. Soy milk and infant soy formulas are generally used as substitutes.\nThis test is very sensitive, so it does not miss many infants with galactosemia. But, false-positives can occur. If your child has an abnormal screening result, follow-up tests must be done to confirm the result.\nRisks\nThere is little risk in taking blood from an infant. Veins and arteries vary in size from one infant to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some infants may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin, causing bruising)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nGalactosemia screen; GALT; Gal-1-PUT\nReferences\nMojica A, Weinstock RS.
