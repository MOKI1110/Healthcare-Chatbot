The surgery may also involve changing the position of the areola and nipple.\nDescription\nCosmetic breast surgery can be done at an outpatient surgery clinic or in a hospital.\nYou will likely receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n. This uses medicines that keep you asleep and pain-free. Or, you may receive medicine to help you relax and local anesthesia to numb the area around the breasts to block pain. You will be awake but unable to feel pain.\nThe surgeon will make 1 to 3 surgical cuts (incisions) in your breast. Extra skin, and sometimes some breast tissue, will be removed and your nipple and areola may be moved. The cuts may be around your nipple and areola, down the front of the breast, and under the breast. It depends how much lift is needed.\nSometimes, women have\nbreast augmentation\n(enlargement with implants) when they have a breast lift."}

You may feel better about your appearance and yourself.\nScars are permanent and are often very visible for up to a year after surgery. After a year, they may fade but will not become invisible. Your surgeon will try to place the cuts so that scars are hidden from view. Surgical cuts are usually made on the underside of the breast and around the edge of the areola. Your scars will generally not be noticeable, even in low-cut clothing."}
