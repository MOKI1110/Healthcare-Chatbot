These include:\nChronic\nhepatitis C or B infection\nAlcohol overuse\nover many years\nFatty liver disease (metabolic associated steatohepatitis (MASH) previously called non-alcoholic steatohepatitis or NASH)\nCirrhosis caused by genetic diseases\nPeople with certain cancers in the abdomen may develop ascites."}

These include cancer of the appendix, colon, ovaries, uterus, pancreas, bile ducts, and liver.\nOther conditions that can cause ascites include:\nClots in certain veins of the liver (portal vein thrombosis)\nCongestive heart failure\nPancreatitis\nThickening and scarring of the sac-like covering of the heart (pericarditis)\nKidney dialysis may also be linked to ascites.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may develop slowly or suddenly depending on the cause of ascites. You may have no symptoms if there is only a small amount of fluid in the belly.\nAs more fluid collects, you may have abdominal pain and bloating. Large amounts of fluid can cause shortness of breath."}

Large amounts of fluid can cause shortness of breath. This happens because the fluid pushes up on the diaphragm, which in turn compresses the lower lungs.\nMany other symptoms of liver failure may also be present.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will do a physical exam to determine if the swelling is likely due to fluid buildup in your belly.\nYou may also have the following tests to assess your liver and kidneys:\n24-hour urine collection\nElectrolyte levels\nKidney function tests\nLiver function tests\nTests to measure the risk of bleeding and protein levels in the blood\nUrinalysis\nAbdominal ultrasound\nCT or MRI scan of the abdomen\nBlood test to determine the cause of any liver failure leading to ascites.\nYour provider may also\nuse a thin needle\nto withdraw ascites fluid from your belly. This procedure is called an abdominal tap or paracentesis. The fluid is tested to look for the cause of ascites and to check if the fluid is infected."}
