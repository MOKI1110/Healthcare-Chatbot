Most of the time, blood is\ndrawn from a vein\nlocated on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will need to prepare for some drug level tests.\nYour health care provider will tell you if you need to change the times you take any of your medicines.\nDO NOT stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nWith most medicines, you need a certain level of the drug in your blood to get the proper effect."}

You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nWith most medicines, you need a certain level of the drug in your blood to get the proper effect. Some medicines are harmful if the level rises too high and do not work if the levels are too low.\nMonitoring the amount of the drug found in your blood allows your provider to make sure the drug levels are in the proper range.\nDrug level testing is important in people taking drugs such as:\nFlecainide, procainamide or digoxin, which are used to treat abnormal beating of the heart\nLithium, used to treat bipolar disorder\nPhenytoin or valproic acid, which are used to treat seizures or other conditions\nGentamicin or amikacin, which are antibiotics used to treat infections\nTacrolimus, sirolimus or cyclosporine, which are used to suppress immune system activity against transplanted organs\nTesting may also be done to determine how well your body breaks down the drug or how it interacts with other drugs you need.\nNormal Results\nFollowing are some of the drugs that are commonly checked and the normal target levels:\nAcetaminophen: varies with use\nAmikacin: 15 to 25 mcg/mL (25.62 to 42.70 micromol"}
