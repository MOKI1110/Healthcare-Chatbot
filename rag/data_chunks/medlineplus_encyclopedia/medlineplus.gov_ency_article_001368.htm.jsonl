Some mothers may not know they have HSV sores inside the vagina.\nSome women have had HSV infections in the past, but are not aware of it, and may pass the virus to their baby.\nHSV type 2 (the most common cause of genital herpes) is the most common cause of HSV infection in newborn babies. However, HSV type 1 (the most common cause of oral herpes) can also occur.\nSymptoms\nHerpes may only appear as a skin infection."}

These blisters break, crust over, and finally heal. A mild scar may remain.\nHSV infection may also spread throughout the body. This is called disseminated herpes. In this type, HSV can affect many parts of the body.\nHerpes infection in the brain is called herpes\nencephalitis\nThe liver, lungs, and kidneys may also be involved\nThere may or may not be blisters on the skin\nNewborn infants with HSV that has spread to the brain or other parts of the body are often very sick."}

This helps prevent an outbreak at the time of delivery.\nCesarean birth (C-section) is recommended for pregnant women who have an active outbreak of herpes sores and are in labor.\nYou may have some prodromal symptoms before a sore appears. You may experience itching in the affected area, tingling or pinching sensations, muscle tenderness, shooting pains in the buttocks, legs, or groin, and nerve pain in the leg. Be sure to notify your provider if you are having these sensations.\nFor women with a first-episode genital herpes infection during the third trimester of pregnancy, C-section may be offered due to the possibility of prolonged viral shedding.\nHSV infection in infants is generally treated with antiviral medicine given through a vein (\nintravenous\n)."}
