Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nRh incompatibility\nis a condition that occurs when the mother's blood type is Rh-negative (Rh-) and her unborn baby's blood type is Rh-positive (Rh+). If the mother is Rh+, or if both parents are Rh-, there is no reason to worry about Rh incompatibility.\nIf the baby's blood is Rh+ and gets into the mother's Rh- bloodstream, her body will produce antibodies."}

These antibodies could pass back through the placenta and harm the developing baby's red blood cells. This can cause mild to serious\nanemia\nin the unborn baby.\nThis test determines the amount of blood that has been exchanged between the mother and fetus. All Rh- pregnant women should get this test if they have bleeding or a risk of bleeding during the pregnancy.\nIn a woman whose blood is Rh incompatible with her infant, this test helps  find out  how much Rh immune globulin (RhoGAM) she must receive to prevent her body from producing abnormal proteins that attack the unborn baby in future pregnancies.\nNormal Results\nIn a normal value, no or few of the baby's cells are in the mother's blood. The standard dose of Rh immune globulin is enough in this case.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal test result means that blood from the unborn baby is leaking into the mother's blood circulation. The more of the baby's cells there are, the more Rh immune globulin the mother must receive.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
