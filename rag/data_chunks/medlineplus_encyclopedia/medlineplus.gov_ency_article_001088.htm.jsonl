BPD can also occur in infants who were on a breathing machine.\nBPD is more common in infants born early, whose lungs were not fully developed at birth.\nRisk factors include:\nCongenital heart disease\n(problem with the heart's structure and function that is present at birth)\nPrematurity, usually in infants born before 32 weeks gestation\nSevere respiratory or lung infection\nRisk of severe BPD has decreased in recent years.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nBluish skin\ncolor (cyanosis)\nCough\nRapid breathing\nShortness of breath\nExams and Tests\nTests that may be done to help diagnose BPD include:\nArterial blood gas\nChest CT scan\nChest x-ray\nPulse oximetry\nTreatment\nIN THE HOSPITAL\nInfant"}

This is a breathing machine that sends pressure to the baby's lungs to keep them inflated and to deliver more oxygen. As the baby's lungs develop, the pressure and oxygen are slowly reduced. The baby is weaned from the ventilator. The baby may continue to get oxygen by a mask or nasal tube for several weeks or months.\nInfants with BPD are usually fed by\ntubes inserted into the stomach (NG tube)\n. These babies need extra calories due to the effort of breathing. To keep their lungs from filling with fluid, their fluid intake may need to be limited. They may also be given medicines (diuretics) that remove water from the body. Other medicines can include corticosteroids, bronchodilators, and surfactant. Surfactant is a slippery, soapy-like substance in the lungs that helps the lungs fill with air and keeps the air sacs from deflating.\nParents of these infants need emotional support."}

Surfactant is a slippery, soapy-like substance in the lungs that helps the lungs fill with air and keeps the air sacs from deflating.\nParents of these infants need emotional support. This is because BPD takes time to get better and the infant may need to stay in the hospital for a long time.\nAT HOME\nInfants with BPD may need oxygen therapy for weeks to months after leaving the hospital. Follow your health care provider's instructions to ensure your baby gets enough nutrition during recovery. Your baby may need tube feedings or special formulas.\nIt is very important to prevent your baby from getting colds and other infections, such as\nrespiratory syncytial virus\n(RSV). RSV can cause a severe lung infection, especially in a baby with BPD.\nA simple way to help prevent RSV infection is to wash your hands often. Follow these measures:\nWash your hands with warm water and soap\nbefore touching your baby. Tell others to wash their hands, too, before touching your baby.\nAsk others to avoid contact with your baby if they have a cold or fever, or ask them to wear a mask.\nBe aware that kissing your baby can spread RSV.\nTry to keep young children away from your baby."}

RSV is very common among young children and spreads easily from child-to-child.\nDO NOT smoke inside your house, car, or anywhere near your baby. Exposure to tobacco smoke increases the risk of RSV illness.\nParents of babies with BPD should avoid crowds during outbreaks of RSV. Outbreaks are often reported by local news media.\nYour baby's provider may prescribe the medicine palivizumab (Synagis) to prevent RSV infection in your baby. Follow instructions on how to give your baby this medicine.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nBabies with BPD get better slowly over time. Oxygen therapy may be needed for many months. Some infants have long-term lung damage and require oxygen and breathing support, such as with a ventilator."}

Contact your child's provider if you see any signs of a respiratory infection.\nPrevention\nTo help prevent BPD:\nPrevent premature delivery whenever possible."}
