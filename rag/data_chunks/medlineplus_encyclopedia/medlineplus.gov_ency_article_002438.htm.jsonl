The disorders are usually caused by defects in specific proteins (\nenzymes\n) that help break down (metabolize) parts of food.\nA food product that is not broken down into energy can build up in the body and cause a wide range of symptoms. Several inborn errors of metabolism cause developmental delays or other medical problems if they are not controlled.\nThere are many different types of inborn errors of metabolism.\nA few of them are:\nFructose intolerance\nGalactosemia\nMaple syrup urine disease\n(MSUD)\nPhenylketonuria\n(PKU)\nNewborn screening tests\ncan identify some of these disorders.\nRegistered dietitians and other health care providers can help create a diet that is right for each specific disorder.\nAlternative Names\nMetabolism - inborn errors of\nImages\nGalactosemia\nNewborn screening testing\nReferences\nCraigen WJ.
