Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSoluble vs. insoluble fiber\nSoluble vs. insoluble fiber\nThere are 2 different types of\nfiber\n-- soluble and insoluble. Both are important for health, digestion, and preventing diseases.\nSoluble fiber\nattracts water and turns to gel during digestion. This slows digestion. Soluble fiber is found in oat bran, barley, nuts, seeds, beans, lentils, peas, and some fruits and vegetables. It is also found in psyllium, a common fiber supplement. Some types of soluble fiber may help lower risk of heart disease.\nInsoluble fiber\nis found in foods such as wheat bran, vegetables, and whole grains. It adds bulk to the stool and appears to help food pass more quickly through the stomach and intestines.\nAlternative Names\nInsoluble vs. soluble fiber; Fiber - soluble vs. insoluble\nImages\nSoluble and insoluble fiber\nReferences\nHensrud DD.
