It is most often caused by blood clots in the arteries that partially block them.\nSome people may be given drugs to break up the clot if the artery is completely blocked.\nThese drugs are called thrombolytics, or clot-busting drugs.\nThey are only given for a type of\nheart attack\n, where certain changes are noted on the ECG."}
