Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMpox\nMpox\nMpox is a viral infection in which a person develops fever, fatigue, muscle aches, and a rash that may affect the entire body. Most cases resolve within 2 to 4 weeks.\nThis rare disease was regularly found mainly in central and western African countries. Since January 2023, there has been an ongoing outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The World Health Organization (WHO) recently declared this outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern. This is the WHO's highest level of global alert, recognizing the potential threat to countries across the globe.\nAt this time, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has assessed the risk of infection to the general population in the United States as very low.\nCauses\nMpox was first detected in Denmark in 1958 in a colony of monkeys used for research. This is how it first came to be called \"monkeypox.\" The name was changed to mpox to reduce the stigma associated with the previous name."}

This is how it first came to be called \"monkeypox.\" The name was changed to mpox to reduce the stigma associated with the previous name. The first human case of mpox occurred in 1970 in the DRC.\nIn 2022, mpox spread to countries where mpox does not normally occur. This included countries in Europe, North and South America, the Middle East, and Australia.\nMpox is caused by\nOrthopoxvirus\n. It is similar to the virus that causes smallpox. There are two types of mpox virus: clade I and clade II.\nClade I\nis endemic to Central Africa (including the DRC). Endemic means it is always present in some members of the population. Clade I is more severe and causes serious illness and death. It has killed as many as 10% of those infected. Recent death rates have been lower. Currently, there are no cases of Clade I mpox outside of central and eastern Africa.\nClade II\nis endemic to West Africa. It is the type of mpox that caused the 2022 global outbreak. This type of mpox is much less severe, with nearly all people recovering from the illness."}
