Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFeeding tube - infants\nFeeding tube - infants\nA feeding tube is a small, soft, plastic tube placed through the nose (NG) or mouth (OG) into the stomach. These tubes are used to provide feedings and medicines into the stomach until the baby can take food by mouth.\nWHY IS A FEEDING TUBE USED?\nFeeding from the breast or bottle requires strength and coordination. Sick or\npremature\nbabies may not be able to suck or swallow well enough to bottle or breastfeed. Tube feedings allow the baby to get some or all of their feeding into the stomach. This is the most efficient and safest way to provide good nutrition. Oral medicines can also be given through the tube.\nHOW IS A FEEDING TUBE PLACED?\nA feeding tube is gently placed through the nose or mouth into the stomach. An x-ray can confirm correct placement. In babies with feeding problems, the tip of the tube may be placed past the stomach into the small intestine. This provides slower, continuous feedings.\nWHAT ARE THE RISKS OF A FEEDING TUBE?\nFeeding tubes are generally very safe and effective."}

However, problems may occur, even when the tube is placed properly. These include:\nIrritation of the nose, mouth, or stomach, causing minor bleeding\nStuffy nose or infection of the nose if the tube is placed through the nose\nIf the tube is misplaced and not in the proper position, the baby may have problems with:\nAn abnormally slow heart rate (bradycardia)\nBreathing\nSpitting up\nIn rare cases, the feeding tube can puncture the stomach.\nAlternative Names\nGavage tube - infants; OG - infants; NG - infants\nImages\nFeeding tube\nReferences\nGeorge DE, Ogholikhan S.
