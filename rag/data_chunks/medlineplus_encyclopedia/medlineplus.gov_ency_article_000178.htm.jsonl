Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAortic stenosis\nAortic stenosis\nThe aorta is the main artery that carries blood out of the heart to the rest of the body. Blood flows out of the heart and into the aorta through the aortic valve. In people with aortic stenosis, the aortic valve does not open fully. This decreases blood flow from the heart.\nCauses\nAs the aortic valve narrows, the left ventricle has to work harder to pump blood out through the valve. To do this extra work, the muscles in the ventricle walls become thicker. This can lead to chest pain.\nAs the pressure continues to rise, blood may back up into the lungs. Severe aortic stenosis can limit the amount of blood that reaches the brain and the rest of the body.\nAortic stenosis may be present from birth (congenital), but most often it develops later in life. Children with aortic stenosis may have other conditions present from birth.\nAortic stenosis mainly occurs due to the buildup of calcium deposits that narrow the valve. This is called calcific aortic stenosis."}

This is called calcific aortic stenosis. The problem mostly affects older people.\nCalcium buildup of the valve happens sooner in people who are born with abnormal aortic or bicuspid valves. In rare cases, calcium buildup can develop more quickly when a person has received chest radiation (such as for cancer treatment).\nAnother cause is rheumatic fever. This condition can develop after strep throat or scarlet fever. Valve problems do not develop for 5 to 10 years or longer after rheumatic fever occurs. Rheumatic fever is rare in the United States.\nAortic stenosis occurs in about 2% of people over 65 years of age. It occurs more often in men than in women.\nSymptoms\nMost people with aortic stenosis do not develop symptoms until the disease is advanced. The diagnosis may have been made when the health care provider heard a heart murmur and performed tests before any symptoms developed.\nSymptoms of aortic stenosis include:\nChest discomfort: The chest pain may get worse with activity and reach into the arm, neck, or jaw."}

They are also at risk for a heart infection called bacterial endocarditis.\nExams and Tests\nheart murmur,\nclick, or other abnormal sound is almost always heard through a stethoscope.

The provider may be able to feel a vibration or movement when placing a hand over the heart. There may be a faint pulse or changes in the quality of the pulse in the neck.\nBlood pressure may be low.\nAortic stenosis is most often diagnosed and then monitored using a test called a transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE).\nThe following tests may also be performed:\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG)\nExercise stress testing\nLeft cardiac catheterization\nMRI of the heart\nTransesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)\nTreatment\nRegular checkups by a provider may be all that is needed if your symptoms are not severe. The provider should ask about your health history, do a physical exam, and perform an echocardiogram.\nPeople with severe aortic stenosis may be told not to play competitive sports, even if they have no symptoms. If symptoms do occur, strenuous activity must often be limited.\nMedicines are used to treat symptoms of\nheart failure\nor abnormal heart rhythms (most commonly atrial fibrillation). These include diuretics (water pills), nitrates, and beta-blockers."}

These include diuretics (water pills), nitrates, and beta-blockers. High blood pressure should also be treated. If aortic stenosis is severe, this treatment must be done carefully so blood pressure does not drop too far.\nIn the past, most people with heart valve problems were given antibiotics before dental work or a procedure such as colonoscopy. The antibiotics were given to prevent an infection of the damaged heart. However, antibiotics are now used much less often before dental work and other procedures. Check with your provider to find out whether you need antibiotics.\nPeople with this and other heart conditions should stop smoking and be tested for high cholesterol.\nSurgery to repair or replace the valve\nis often done for adults or children who develop symptoms."}

Even if symptoms are not very bad, the provider may recommend surgery based on test results.\nA less invasive procedure called balloon valvuloplasty may be done instead of or before surgery.\nA balloon is placed into an artery in the groin, threaded to the heart, placed across the valve, and inflated. However, narrowing often occurs again after this procedure.\nA newer procedure done at the same time as valvuloplasty can implant an artificial valve (\ntranscatheter aortic valve replacement\nor TAVR). This procedure is becoming more common.\nSome children may need aortic valve repair or replacement.
