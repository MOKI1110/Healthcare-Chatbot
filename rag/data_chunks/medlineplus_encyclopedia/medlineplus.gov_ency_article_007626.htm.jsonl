The incision usually heals on its own after it is repaired. But sometimes, there are complications that require treatment.\nTwo wound complications that can happen within 30 days of open heart surgery are:\nInfection in the wound or chest bone. The symptoms can be pus at the incision, a fever, or feeling tired and sick.\nThe sternum separates into two. The sternum and chest become unstable. You might hear a clicking sound in the sternum when breathing, coughing, or moving around.\nDescription\nTo treat the complication, the surgeon reopens the area that was operated on. The procedure is done in the operating room. The surgeon:\nRemoves the wires holding the sternum together.\nDoes tests of the skin and tissue in the wound to look for signs of infection.\nRemoves dead or infected tissue in the wound (debride the wound)."}

The breast bone may be removed.\nRinses the wound with salt water (saline).\nAfter the wound is cleaned out, the surgeon may or may not close the wound. The wound is packed with a dressing. The dressing will need to be changed daily.\nOr your surgeon may use a VAC (vacuum-assisted closure) dressing. It is a negative pressure dressing. It increases blood flow around the sternum and improves healing.\nThe parts of VAC dressing are:\nVacuum pump\nFoam piece cut to fit the wound\nVacuum tube\nClear dressing that is taped on top\nThe foam piece is changed every 2 to 3 days.\nYour surgeon may put a chest harness on you. This will make the chest bones more stable.\nIt may take days, weeks, or even months for the wound to be clean, clear of infection, and finally heal.\nOnce this healing occurs, the surgeon may use wire to bring the bone back together then close the skin or  use a muscle flap to cover and close the wound."}
