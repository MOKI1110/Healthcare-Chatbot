It usually follows a pattern of receding hairline and hair thinning on the crown.\nEach strand of hair sits in a tiny hole (cavity) in the skin called a follicle. Generally, baldness occurs when the hair follicle shrinks over time, resulting in shorter and finer hair. Eventually, the follicle does not grow new hair. The follicles remain alive, which suggests that it is still possible to grow new hair.\nSymptoms\nThe typical pattern of male baldness begins at the hairline in the front of the head. The hairline gradually moves backward (recedes) and forms an \"M\" shape. A circular area on the back of the head (vertex) often thins and expands in size over time."}

The hairline gradually moves backward (recedes) and forms an \"M\" shape. A circular area on the back of the head (vertex) often thins and expands in size over time. Eventually the hair becomes finer, shorter, and thinner, and creates a U-shaped (or horseshoe) pattern of hair around the sides of the head and a bald area on the back of the head.\nExams and Tests\nClassic male pattern baldness is usually diagnosed based on the appearance and pattern of the hair loss.\nHair loss may be due to other conditions. This may be true if hair loss occurs in patches, you shed a lot of hair, your hair breaks, or you have hair loss along with redness,\nscaling\n, pus, or pain.\nskin biopsy\n, blood tests, or other procedures may be needed to diagnose other disorders that cause hair loss.\nHair analysis is not accurate for diagnosing hair loss due to nutritional or similar disorders. But it may reveal substances such as arsenic or lead.\nTreatment\nTreatment is not necessary if you are comfortable with your appearance. Hair weaving, hairpieces, or change of hairstyle may disguise the hair loss."}

Hair weaving, hairpieces, or change of hairstyle may disguise the hair loss. This is usually the least expensive and safest approach for male baldness.\nMedicines that treat male pattern baldness include:\nMinoxidil (Rogaine), a solution that is applied directly to the scalp to stimulate the hair follicles. It slows hair loss for many men, and some men grow new hair. Hair loss returns when you stop using this medicine.\nFinasteride (Propecia, Proscar), a pill that interferes with the production of a highly active form of testosterone that is linked to baldness. It slows hair loss. It works slightly better than minoxidil. Hair loss returns when you stop using this medicine.\nDutasteride is similar to finasteride but may be more effective.\nOther treatments that are being investigated include:\nPlatelet-Rich Plasma (PRP) injected into the scalp to stimulate hair growth."}

This involves drawing your blood, collecting a portion that is rich in platelets, and injecting the areas of hair loss over a series of sessions.\nHair transplants consist of removing tiny plugs of hair from areas where the hair is continuing to grow and placing them in areas that are balding. The procedure usually requires multiple sessions and may be expensive.\nThe use of laser or light caps or helmets to stimulate hair follicles.\nSuturing hair pieces to the scalp is not recommended. It can result in scars, infections, and\nabscess\nof the scalp. The use of hair implants made of artificial fibers was banned by the FDA because of the high rate of infection.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMale pattern baldness does not indicate a medical disorder, but it may affect self-esteem or cause anxiety."}
