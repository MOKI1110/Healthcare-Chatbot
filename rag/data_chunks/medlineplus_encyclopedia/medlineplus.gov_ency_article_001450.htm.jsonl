It can lead to total hair loss.\nCauses\nAlopecia areata is thought to be an\nautoimmune condition\n. This occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy hair follicles.\nSome people with this condition have a family history of\nalopecia\n. Alopecia areata is seen in men, women, and children. In a few people, hair loss may occur after a major life event such as an illness, pregnancy, or trauma.\nSymptoms\nHair loss is usually the only symptom. A few people may also feel a burning sensation or itching.\nAlopecia areata usually begins as one to several patches of hair loss about 0.4 inches (1 centimeter) to 1.6 in (4 cm). Hair loss is most often seen on the scalp. It may also occur in the beard, eyebrows, pubic hair, and arms or legs in some people. Nail pitting may also occur.\nPatches where hair has fallen out are smooth and round in shape. They may be peach-colored."}

Nail pitting may also occur.\nPatches where hair has fallen out are smooth and round in shape. They may be peach-colored. Hairs that look like exclamation points are sometimes seen at the edges of a bald patch with a magnifying tool.\nIf alopecia areata leads to total hair loss, it often occurs within 6 months after symptoms first start. This is called alopecia totalis when the entire scalp is involved, and alopecia universalis when the entire body is affected.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms, focusing on areas where you have hair loss.\nA scalp\nbiopsy\nmay be done. Blood tests may also be done to check for autoimmune conditions and thyroid problems.\nTreatment\nIf hair loss is not widespread, the hair may regrow in a few months without treatment.\nFor more severe hair loss, it is not clear how much treatment can help change the course of the condition.\nCommon treatments may include:\nSteroid injection under the skin surface\nMedicines applied to the skin\nUltraviolet light therapy\nJAK inhibitors are a newer treatment that can target the immune response."}
