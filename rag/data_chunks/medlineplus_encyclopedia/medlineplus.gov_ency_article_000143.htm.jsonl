Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nChemical pneumonitis\nChemical pneumonitis\nChemical pneumonitis is inflammation of the lungs or\nbreathing difficulty\ndue to inhaling chemical fumes or breathing in and choking on certain chemicals.\nCauses\nMany chemicals used in the home and workplace can cause pneumonitis.\nSome common dangerous inhaled substances include:\nChlorine gas (breathed in from cleaning materials such as chlorine bleach, during industrial accidents, or near swimming pools)\nGrain and fertilizer dust\nNoxious fumes from pesticides\nSmoke (from house fires and wildfires)\nThere are two types of pneumonitis:\nAcute pneumonitis occurs rapidly after breathing in the substance.\nLong-term (chronic) pneumonitis occurs after exposure to low levels of the substance over a long time. This causes inflammation and may lead to stiffness of the lungs. As a result, the lungs start to lose their ability to get oxygen to the body."}

Untreated, this condition can cause\nrespiratory\nfailure and death.\nChronic aspiration of acid from the stomach and exposure to chemical weapons can also lead to chemical pneumonitis.\nSymptoms\nAcute symptoms may include:\nAir hunger (feeling that you cannot get enough air)\nBreathing that sounds  wet or gurgling (abnormal lung sounds)\nCough\nDifficulty breathing\nUnusual sensation (possibly burning feeling) in the chest\nChronic symptoms may include:\nCough (may or may not occur)\nProgressive disability (related to shortness of breath)\nRapid breathing\n(tachypnea)\nShortness of breath\nwith only mild exercise\nExams and Tests\nThe following tests help determine how severely the lungs are affected:\nBlood gases\n(measurement of how much oxygen and carbon dioxide are in your blood)\nCT scan of chest\nLung (pulmonary) function studies\n(tests to measure breathing and how well the lungs are functioning)\nX-ray of the chest\nSwallowing studies to check if stomach acid is the cause of pneumonitis\nBlood tests of"}

Corticosteroids may be given to reduce inflammation, often before long-term scarring occurs.\nAntibiotics are usually not helpful or needed, unless there is a secondary infection. Oxygen therapy may be helpful.\nIn cases of swallowing and stomach problems, eating small meals in the upright position can help."}

In severe cases, a feeding tube in the stomach is needed, although this does not always completely prevent aspiration into the lungs.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome depends on the chemical, the severity of exposure, and whether the problem is acute or chronic.\nPossible Complications\nRespiratory failure and death can occur.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have trouble breathing after inhaling (or possibly inhaling) any substance.\nPrevention\nOnly use household chemicals as directed, and always in well-ventilated areas with proper protective equipment. Never mix ammonia and bleach.\nFollow workplace rules for breathing masks and wear the right mask."}
