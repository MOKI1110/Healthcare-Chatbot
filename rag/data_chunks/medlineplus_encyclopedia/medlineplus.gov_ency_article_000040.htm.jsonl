It is important to check for good circulation after the injured body part has been immobilized.\nSplints can be used for different injuries. For example, with  a broken bone, stabilizing the area is important to reduce pain, prevent further injury, and allow the person to move about as much as possible.\nFirst Aid\nHere is how to make and apply a splint:\nCare for the\nwound\nfirst before applying a splint. Rinse and cover any open wound.\nAn injured body part should usually be splinted in the position in which it was found unless it has been treated by a professional who is a specialist in that body part.\nFind something rigid to use as supports to make the splint, such as sticks, boards, or even rolled up newspapers. If none can be found, use a rolled blanket or clothing."}

If none can be found, use a rolled blanket or clothing. An injured body part can also be taped to an uninjured body part to prevent it from moving. For example, you can tape an injured finger to the finger next to it.\nExtend the splint beyond the injured area to keep it from moving. Try to include the joint above and below the injury in the splint. The added support and stability can help decrease pain.\nSecure the splint with ties, such as belts, cloth strips, neckties, or tape above and below the injury. Make sure the knots are not pressing on the injury. DO NOT make the ties too tight. Doing so can cut off blood circulation.\nCheck the area of the injured body part often for\nswelling\n,\npaleness\n, or\nnumbness\n. If needed, loosen the splint.\nSeek medical help right away.\nDO NOT\nDO NOT change the position of, or realign, an injured body part. Be careful when you place a splint to avoid causing more injury."}

In the meantime, give first aid to the person.\nSeek medical help right away for any of the following:\nBone that is sticking through the skin\nAn open wound around the injury\nLoss of feeling (sensation)\nLoss of pulse or a feeling of warmth to the injured site\nFingers and toes turn blue and lose sensation\nIf medical assistance is not available and the injured part looks abnormally bent, gently placing the injured part back into its normal position may improve the circulation.\nPrevention\nSafety is the best way to avoid broken bones caused by falling.\nAvoid activities that\nstrain\nthe muscles or bones for long periods as these can cause fatigue and falls."}
