Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHyperventilation\nHyperventilation\nHyperventilation is rapid and deep breathing. It is also called overbreathing, and it may leave you feeling breathless.\nConsiderations\nYou breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. Excessive breathing creates a low level of carbon dioxide in your blood. This causes many of the symptoms of hyperventilation.\nYou may hyperventilate from an emotional cause such as during a\npanic attack\n. Or, it can be due to a medical problem, such as bleeding or infection.\nYour health care provider will determine the cause of your hyperventilation. Rapid breathing may be due to a medical emergency and you may need to get treated, unless you have had this before and your provider has told you that you can treat it on your own.\nIf you frequently overbreathe, you may have a medical problem called hyperventilation syndrome.\nWhen you're overbreathing, you might not be aware you're breathing fast and deep."}

You, your friends, and family can learn techniques to stop it from happening and prevent future attacks.\nIf you start hyperventilating, the goal is to raise the carbon dioxide level in your blood. This will end most of your symptoms. Ways to do this include:\nGet reassurance from a friend or family member to help you relax your breathing. Words like \"you are doing fine,\" \"you are not having a heart attack,\" and \"you are not going to die\" are very helpful. It's very important that the person stays calm and uses a soft, relaxed tone.\nTo help you get rid of the right amount of carbon dioxide, learn to do\npursed lip breathing\n."}
