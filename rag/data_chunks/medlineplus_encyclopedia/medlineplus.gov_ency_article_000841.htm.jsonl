These lice can also be found in armpit hair, eyebrows, mustache, beard, around the anus, and eyelashes (in children).\nCauses\nPubic lice are most commonly spread during sexual activity.\nAlthough not common, pubic lice can spread through contact with objects such as toilet seats, sheets, blankets, or bathing suits (that you may try on at a store).\nAnimals cannot spread public lice to humans.\nOther types of lice include:\nBody lice\nHead lice\nYou are at greater risk for pubic lice if you:\nHave many sexual partners (high incidence in men who have sex with men)\nHave sexual contact with an infected person\nShare bedding or clothing with an infected person\nSymptoms\nPubic lice cause itching in the area covered by pubic hair. Itching often gets worse at night."}

Itching often gets worse at night. The itching may start soon after getting infected with lice, or it may not start for up to 2 to 4 weeks after contact.\nOther symptoms can include:\nLocal skin reactions to the bites that cause the skin to turn red or bluish-gray\nSores in the genital area due to bites and scratching\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will do an exam to look for:\nThe lice\nSmall gray-white oval eggs (nits) attached to the hair shafts in the outer genital area\nScratch marks or signs of a skin infection\nBecause pubic lice may cause an eye infection in young children, eyelashes should be looked at with a high-powered magnifying glass. Sexual transmission, and potential sexual molestation, should always be considered if pubic lice are found in children.\nAdult lice are easy to identify with a special magnifying device called a dermatoscope."}

Pubic lice are often referred to as \"the crabs\" because of their appearance.\nTeenagers and adults with pubic lice may need to be tested for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\nTreatment\nMEDICINES\nPubic lice are often treated with medicines that contain a substance called permethrin. To use this medicine:\nThoroughly work the medicine into your pubic hair and surrounding area. Leave it on for at least 5 to 10 minutes, or as directed by your provider.\nRinse well.\nComb your pubic hair with a fine-toothed comb to remove eggs (nits). Applying vinegar to pubic hair before combing may help loosen the nits.\nIn case of eyelash infestation, applying soft paraffin three times daily for 1 to 2 weeks may help.\nMost people need only one treatment. If a second treatment is needed, it should be done 4 days to 1 week later.\nOver-the-counter medicines to treat lice include Rid, Nix, LiceMD, among others."}

Malathion lotion is another option.\nSexual partners should be treated at the same time.\nOTHER CARE\nWhile you are treating pubic lice:\nWash and dry all clothing and bedding in hot water.\nSpray items that cannot be washed with a medicated spray that you can buy at the store. You can also seal items in plastic bags for 10 to 14 days to smother the lice.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe proper treatment, including thorough cleaning, should get rid of the lice.\nScratching can make the skin raw or cause a skin infection.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider for an appointment if:\nYou or your sexual partner has symptoms of pubic lice\nYou try over-the-counter lice treatments, and they are not effective\nYour symptoms continue after treatment\nPrevention\nAvoid sexual or intimate contact with people who have pubic lice until they have been treated.\nBathe or shower often and keep your bedding clean.
