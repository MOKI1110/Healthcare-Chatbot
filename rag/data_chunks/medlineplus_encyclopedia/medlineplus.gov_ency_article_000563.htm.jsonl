It is similar to other blood conditions such as\nhereditary spherocytosis\nand\nhereditary ovalocytosis\n.\nCauses\nElliptocytosis affects about 1 in every 2,500 people of northern European heritage. It is more common in people of African and Mediterranean descent. You are more likely to develop this condition if someone in your family has had it.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nFatigue.\nShortness of breath.\nYellow skin and eyes (jaundice)."}

This may continue for a long time in a newborn.\nExams and Tests\nAn exam by your health care provider may show an\nenlarged spleen\n.\nThe following test results may help diagnose the condition:\nBilirubin\nlevel may be high.\nBlood smear may show elliptical red blood cells.\nComplete blood count\n(CBC) may show anemia or signs of red blood cell destruction.\nLactate dehydrogenase level may be high.\nImaging of the gallbladder may show gallstones.\nTreatment\nThere is no treatment needed for the disorder unless severe anemia or anemia symptoms occur. Surgery to remove the spleen may decrease the rate of red blood cell damage.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people with hereditary elliptocytosis have no problems. They often do not know they have the condition.\nPossible Complications\nElliptocytosis is often harmless. In mild cases, fewer than 15% of red blood cells are elliptical-shaped. However, some people may have crises in which the red blood cells rupture."}

This is more likely to happen when they have a viral infection. People with this disease can develop anemia, jaundice, and gallstones.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have jaundice that does not go away or symptoms of anemia or gallstones.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling may be appropriate for people with a family history of this disease who wish to become parents.\nAlternative Names\nElliptocytosis - hereditary\nImages\nRed blood cells - elliptocytosis\nBlood cells\nReferences\nGallagher PG.
