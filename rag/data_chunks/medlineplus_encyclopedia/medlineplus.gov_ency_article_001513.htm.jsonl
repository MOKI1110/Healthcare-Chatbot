It occurs when endometrial tissue grows into the outer muscular walls of the uterus. Endometrial tissue forms the lining of the uterus.\nCauses\nThe cause is not known. Sometimes, adenomyosis may cause the uterus to grow in size.\nThe condition most often occurs in women ages 35 to 50 who have had at least one pregnancy.\nSymptoms\nIn many cases, there are no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include:\nLong-term or heavy menstrual bleeding\nPainful menstrual periods\n, which gets worse\nPelvic pain during intercourse\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will make the diagnosis if a woman has symptoms of adenomyosis that are not caused by other gynecologic problems. The only way to confirm the diagnosis is by examining the tissue of the uterus after a surgery to remove it.\nDuring a pelvic exam, the provider may find a soft and slightly enlarged uterus. The exam may also reveal a uterine mass or uterine tenderness.\nAn\nultrasound\nof the uterus may be done."}

An MRI can help distinguish this condition from other uterine tumors. It is often used when an ultrasound exam does not provide sufficient information to make a diagnosis.\nTreatment\nMost women have some adenomyosis as they get close to menopause. However, only a few will have symptoms. Most women do not need treatment.\nBirth control pills and an\nIUD\nthat has progesterone can help decrease heavy bleeding. Medicines such as ibuprofen or naproxen can also help manage pain.\nSurgery to remove the uterus (hysterectomy) may be done in women with severe symptoms.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSymptoms most often go away after menopause. Surgery to remove the uterus often gets you rid of symptoms completely.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of adenomyosis.\nAlternative Names\nEndometriosis interna; Adenomyoma; Pelvic pain - adenomyosis\nReferences\nBulun SE."}
