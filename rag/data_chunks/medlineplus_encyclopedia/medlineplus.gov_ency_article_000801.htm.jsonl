During the stage called rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, your eyes move quickly and vivid dreaming is most common. Each night, people go through several cycles of non-REM and REM sleep. During REM sleep, your body is relaxed and your muscles don't move. Sleep paralysis occurs when the sleep cycle is shifting between stages. When you wake up suddenly from REM, your brain is awake, but your body is still in REM mode and can't move, causing you to feel like you're paralyzed.\nEpisodes of sleep paralysis last from a few seconds to 1 or 2 minutes. These spells end on their own or when you are touched or moved. In rare cases, you can have dream-like sensations or\nhallucinations\n, which may be scary.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will ask about your symptoms, focusing on your sleep habits and things that may affect your sleep. You may be asked to fill out a questionnaire about your sleep to help your provider reach a diagnosis.\nSleep paralysis can be a sign of\nnarcolepsy\n."}

If the cause is known, for example, due to lack of sleep, correcting the cause by getting enough sleep often resolves the condition.\nSometimes, medicines that prevent REM during sleep are prescribed.\nIn people with mental health conditions, such as anxiety, medicine and behavioral therapy (talk therapy) to help treat the mental health condition may resolve sleep paralysis.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nDiscuss your condition with your provider if you have repeated episodes of sleep paralysis. They may be due to a medical problem that needs further testing.\nAlternative Names\nParasomnia - sleep paralysis; Isolated sleep paralysis\nImages\nSleep patterns in the young and aged\nReferences\nAmerican Academy of Sleep Medicine."}
