Cough medicines may make it harder for your body to cough up the extra sputum.\nDrink plenty of fluids to help loosen secretions and bring up phlegm.\nGet a lot of rest. Have someone else do household chores.\nAntibiotics are used to treat atypical pneumonia:\nYou may be able to take antibiotics by mouth at home.\nIf your condition is severe, you will likely be admitted to a hospital. There, you will be given antibiotics through a vein (\nintravenously\n), as well as oxygen.\nAntibiotics are usually prescribed for 3 to 5 days, although sometimes they may be used for 2 weeks or more.\nFinish all the antibiotics you've been prescribed, even if you feel better."}

In untreated adults, cough and weakness can last for up to a month. The disease can be more serious in older adults and in those with a weakened immune system.\nPossible Complications\nComplications that may result include any of the following:\nEar inflammation\ncalled bullous myringitis\nHemolytic anemia\n, a condition in which there are not enough red blood cells in the blood because the body is destroying them\nSkin rashes\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop a fever, cough, or shortness of breath.
