Images that come through the eye's lens are focused on the retina. The retina then converts these images to electric signals and sends them along the optic nerve to the brain.\nThe retina most often looks red or orange because there are many blood vessels right behind it. An\nophthalmoscope\nallows your health care provider to see through your pupil and lens to the retina. Sometimes photos or special scans of the retina can show things that the provider cannot see just by looking at the retina through the ophthalmoscope. If other eye problems block the provider's view of the retina,\nultrasound\ncan be used.\nAnyone who experiences these vision problems should get a retinal examination:\nChanges in sharpness of vision\nLoss of color perception\nFlashes of light or floaters\nDistorted vision (straight lines look wavy)\nWatch this video about:\nRetina\nImages\nEye\nReferences\nCioffi GA, Liebmann JM.
