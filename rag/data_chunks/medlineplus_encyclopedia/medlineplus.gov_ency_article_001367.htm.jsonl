Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMilia\nMilia\nMilia are tiny white bumps or small cysts on the skin. They are almost always seen in newborn babies.\nCauses\nMilia occur when dead skin becomes trapped in small pockets at the surface of the skin or mouth. They are common in newborn infants.\nSimilar cysts are seen in the mouths of newborn infants. They are called\nEpstein pearls\n. These cysts also go away on their own.\nAdults may develop milia on the face. The bumps and cysts also occur on parts of the body that are swollen (inflamed) or injured. Rough sheets or clothing may irritate the skin and mild reddening around the bump. The middle of the bump will stay white.\nIrritated milia are sometimes called \"baby acne.\" This is incorrect since milia are not a true from of\nacne\n.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nWhitish, pearly bump in the skin of newborns\nBumps that appear across the cheeks, nose, and chin\nWhitish, pearly bump on gums or roof of mouth (they may look like teeth coming through the gums)\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider can often diagnose milia just by looking at the skin or mouth."}
