Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPositive airway pressure treatment\nPositive airway pressure treatment\nPositive airway pressure (PAP) treatment uses a machine to pump air under pressure into the airway of the lungs. This helps keep the windpipe open during sleep. The forced air delivered by CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) prevents episodes of airway collapse that block the breathing in people with\nobstructive sleep apnea\nand other breathing problems.\nInformation\nWHO SHOULD USE PAP\nPAP can successfully treat most people with obstructive sleep apnea. It is safe and works well for people of all ages, including children."}

If you only have mild sleep apnea and do not feel very sleepy during the day, you may not need it.\nAfter using PAP regularly, you may notice:\nBetter concentration and memory\nFeeling more alert and less sleepy during the day\nImproved sleep for your bed partner\nBeing more productive at work\nLess anxiety and depression and a better mood\nNormal sleep patterns\nLower blood pressure (in people with high blood pressure)\nYour health care provider will prescribe the type of PAP machine that targets your problem:\nContinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) provides a gentle and steady pressure of air in your airway to keep it open.\nAutotitrating (adjustable) positive airway pressure (APAP) changes pressure throughout the night, based on your breathing patterns.\nBilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP or BIPAP) has a higher pressure when you breathe in and lower pressure when you breathe out.\nBiPAP is useful for children and adults who have:\nAirways that collapse while sleeping, making it hard to b"}

Your provider may teach you how to adjust the settings at home. Or, you may need to go to the sleep center to have it adjusted.\nGETTING USED TO THE MACHINE\nIt can take time to get used to using the PAP setup. The first few nights are often the hardest and you may not sleep well.\nIf you are having problems, you may be tempted not to use the machine for the whole night."}
