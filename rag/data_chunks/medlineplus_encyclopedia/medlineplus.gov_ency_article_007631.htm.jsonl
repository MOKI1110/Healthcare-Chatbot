You may need a crown to support a weak tooth or to make your tooth look better.\nDescription\nGetting a dental crown usually takes two dental visits.\nAt the first visit, the dentist will:\nNumb the tooth and neighboring teeth and gums around the tooth that is getting the crown so you do not feel anything.\nRemove any old or failing restorations (fillings) or decay from the tooth.\nReshape your tooth to prepare it for a crown.\nTake an impression of your tooth to send to the dental lab where they make the permanent crown. Some dentists can digitally scan the tooth and make the crown in their office. Sometimes, the impression is taken at a second visit instead of the initial visit.\nMake and fit your tooth with a temporary crown.\nAt the second visit, the dentist will:\nRemove the temporary crown.\nFit your permanent crown."}
