Even if you are able to eat, you should still drink extra fluids between meals.\nOlder children and adults can drink sports beverages such as Gatorade, but these should not be used for younger children. Instead, use the electrolyte and fluid replacement solutions or freezer pops available in food and drug stores.\nDO NOT use fruit juice (including apple juice), sodas or cola (flat or bubbly), fruit-flavored gelatin, or broth. These liquids do not replace lost minerals and can make diarrhea worse.\nDrink small amounts of fluid (2 to 4 oz. or 60 to 120 mL) every 30 to 60 minutes. Do not try to force down large amounts of fluid at  one time, which can cause vomiting. Use a teaspoon (5 milliliters) or syringe for an infant or small child.\nBabies can continue to drink breast milk or formula along with extra fluids. You do NOT need to switch to a soy formula.\nTry eating small amounts of food frequently."}
