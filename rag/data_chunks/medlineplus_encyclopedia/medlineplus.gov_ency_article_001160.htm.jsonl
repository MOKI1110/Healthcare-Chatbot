The disease affects mental and physical development.\nCauses\nMenkes disease is caused by a defect in the\nATP7A\ngene. The defect makes it hard for the body to properly distribute (transport) copper throughout the body. As a result, the brain and other parts of the body do not get enough copper, while it builds up in the small intestine and kidneys. A low copper level can affect the structure of bone, skin, hair, and blood vessels, and interfere with nerve function.\nMenkes syndrome is usually inherited, which means it runs in families. The gene is on the X chromosome, so if a mother carries the non-working copy of the gene, each of her sons has a 50% (1 in 2) chance of developing the disease, and 50% of her daughters will be a carrier of the disease. This kind of gene inheritance is called\nX-linked recessive\n.\nIn some people, the disease is not inherited from the parents."}

Instead, the genetic change occurs at the time the baby is conceived.\nSymptoms\nCommon symptoms of Menkes disease in infants are:\nBrittle, kinky, steely, sparse, or tangled hair\nPudgy, rosy cheeks, sagging facial skin\nFeeding difficulties\nIrritability\nDecreased muscle tone (\nhypotonia\n), floppiness\nLow body temperature\nIntellectual disability and developmental delay\nSeizures\nSkeletal changes\nExams and Tests\nOnce Menkes disease is suspected, tests that may be done include:\nCeruloplasmin blood test\n(substance that transports copper in the blood)\nCopper blood test\nSkin cell culture\nX-ray of the skeleton\nor\nx-ray of the skull\nGene testing to check for a variation of the\nATP7A\ngene\nTreatment\nTreatment usually only helps when started very early in the course of the disease."}

A baby with this condition will often show symptoms early in infancy.\nPrevention\nSee a\ngenetic counselor\nif you want to have children and you have a family history of Menkes syndrome."}
