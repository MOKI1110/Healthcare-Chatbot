Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEGD - esophagogastroduodenoscopy\nEGD - esophagogastroduodenoscopy\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) is a test to examine the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and first part of the small intestine (the\nduodenum\n).\nHow the Test is Performed\nEGD is done in a hospital or outpatient center by a specially trained doctor called a gastroenterologist. The procedure uses an endoscope. This is a flexible tube with a light and camera at the end.\nThe procedure is done as follows:\nDuring the procedure, your breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, and oxygen level are checked. Wires are attached to certain areas of your body and then to machines that monitor these vital signs.\nYou receive\nmedicine into a vein to help you relax\n. You should feel no pain and not remember the procedure.\nA local anesthetic may be sprayed into your mouth to prevent you from coughing or gagging when the scope is inserted.\nA mouth guard is used to protect your teeth and the scope."}

Dentures must be removed before the procedure begins.\nYou then lie on your left side.\nThe scope is inserted through the esophagus (food pipe) to the stomach and duodenum. The duodenum is the first part of the small intestine.\nAir is put through the scope to make it easier for your doctor to see.\nThe lining of the esophagus, stomach, and upper duodenum is examined.\nBiopsies\ncan be taken through the scope. Biopsies are tissue samples that are looked at under the microscope for signs of disease.\nDifferent treatments may be done, such as stretching or widening a narrowed area of the esophagus.\nAfter the test is finished, you will not be able to have food and liquid until your gag reflex returns (so you do not choke).\nThe test lasts about 5 to 20 minutes.\nFollow any\ninstructions\nyou're given for recovering at home.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will not be able to eat anything for 6 to 12 hours before the test."}

Follow instructions about stopping aspirin and other blood-thinning medicines before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe anesthetic spray makes it hard to swallow. This wears off shortly after the procedure. The scope may make you gag.\nYou may feel gas and the movement of the scope in your abdomen. You will not be able to feel the biopsy. Because of sedation, you may not feel any discomfort and have no memory of the test.\nYou may feel bloated from the air that was put into your body."}
