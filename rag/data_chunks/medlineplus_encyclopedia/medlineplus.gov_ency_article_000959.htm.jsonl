Croup is due to swelling around the vocal cords. It is common in infants and children.\nCauses\nCroup affects children ages 3 months to 5 years. It can occur at any age. Some children are more likely to get croup and may get it several times. It is most common between October and April, but can occur at any time of the year.\nCroup is most often caused by viruses such as parainfluenza RSV, measles, adenovirus, and influenza. More severe cases of croup may be caused by bacteria. This condition is called\nbacterial tracheitis\n.\nCroup-like symptoms may also be caused by:\nAllergies\nBreathing in something that irritates your airway\nAcid reflux\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom of croup is a cough that sounds like a seal barking.\nMost children will have a mild cold and a low grade fever for several days before having barking cough and a hoarse voice."}

As the cough gets more frequent, the child may have trouble breathing or\nstridor\n(a harsh, crowing noise made when breathing in).\nCroup is typically much worse at night. It often lasts 3 to 7 nights. The first night or two are most often the worst. Rarely, croup can last for weeks. Talk to your child's health care provider if croup lasts longer than a week or comes back often.\nExams and Tests\nYour provider will take a medical history and ask about your child's symptoms. Your provider will examine your child's chest to check for:\nDifficulty breathing in and out\nWhistling sound (\nwheezing\n)\nDecreased breath sounds\nChest retractions with breathing\nAn exam of the throat may reveal a red epiglottis. In a few cases, x-rays or other tests may be needed.\nneck x-ray\nmay reveal a foreign object or narrowing of the trachea.\nTreatment\nMost cases of croup can be safely managed at home with telephone support from your provider."}

However, if you are worried about your child's symptoms, you should call your provider for advice, even in the middle of the night.\nSteps you can take at home include:\nExpose your child to cool or moist air, such as in a steamy bathroom or outside in the cool night air. This may offer some breathing relief.\nSet up a cool air vaporizer in the child's bedroom and use it for a few nights.\nMake your child more comfortable by giving acetaminophen."}

If the epiglottis becomes infected, the entire windpipe can swell shut. This is a life-threatening condition.\nIf an\nairway blockage\nis not treated promptly, the child can have severe trouble breathing or breathing may stop completely.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your child is not responding to home treatment or is acting more irritable.\nCall 911 or the local emergency number right away if:\nCroup symptoms may have been caused by an insect sting or inhaled object.\nYour child has bluish lips or skin color.\nYour child is drooling.\nYour child is having trouble swallowing.\nThere is stridor (a noise when breathing in).\nThere is a tugging-in of the muscles between the"}
