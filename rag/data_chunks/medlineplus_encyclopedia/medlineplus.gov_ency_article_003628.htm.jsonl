Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCSF total protein\nCSF total protein\nCSF total protein is a test to determine the amount of\nprotein\nin cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a clear fluid that is in the space around the spinal cord and brain.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA sample of CSF is needed [1 to 5 milliliters (ml)]. A\nlumbar puncture\n(spinal tap)is the most common way to collect this sample. Rarely, other methods are used for collecting CSF such as:\nCisternal puncture\nVentricular puncture\nRemoval of CSF from a tube that is already in the CSF, such as a shunt or ventricular drain.\nAfter the sample is taken, it is sent to a lab for evaluation.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou may have this test to help diagnose:\nTumors\nInfection\nInflammation of the\ncentral nervous system\nGuillain-BarrÃ© syndrome\nVasculitis\nBlood in the spinal fluid\nMultiple sclerosis\n(MS)\nNormal Results\nThe normal protein range varies from lab to lab, but is typically 15 to 60 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or  0.15 to 0.6 milligrams per milliliter (mg/mL).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs."}

Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nThe examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal protein level in the CSF suggests a problem in the central nervous system.\nAn increased protein level may be a sign of a tumor, bleeding, nerve inflammation, infection or injury. A blockage in the flow of spinal fluid can cause the rapid buildup of protein in the lower spinal area.\nA decrease in the protein level can mean your body is rapidly producing spinal fluid or you have a more generalized protein deficiency.\nImages\nCSF protein test\nReferences\nDe Luca GC, Griggs RC, Johnston SC.
