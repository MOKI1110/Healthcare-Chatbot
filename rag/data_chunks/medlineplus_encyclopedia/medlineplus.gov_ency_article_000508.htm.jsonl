Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPrerenal azotemia\nPrerenal azotemia\nPrerenal azotemia is an abnormally high level of nitrogen waste products in the blood.\nCauses\nPrerenal azotemia is common, especially in older adults and in people who are in the hospital.\nThe kidneys filter the blood to make urine that removes waste products. When the amount, or pressure, of blood flow through the kidney drops, filtering of the blood also drops. Or it may not occur at all. Waste products stay in the blood. Less urine is made, even though the kidney itself is working.\nWhen nitrogen waste products, such as creatinine and urea, build up in the body, the condition is called azotemia. These waste products act as poisons when they build up. They damage tissues and reduce the ability of the organs to function.\nPrerenal azotemia is the most common form of reduced\nkidney function\nin hospitalized people."}

These conditions include:\nHeart failure\nShock (\nseptic shock\n)\nIt can also be caused by conditions that interrupt blood flow to the kidney, such as:\nCertain types of surgery\nInjury to the kidney\nSymptoms\nPrerenal azotemia may have no symptoms."}

If the cause is not fixed quickly, damage may occur to the kidney (\nacute tubular necrosis\n).\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nAcute kidney failure\nAcute tubular necrosis (tissue death)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nGo to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have symptoms of prerenal azotemia.\nPrevention\nQuickly treating any condition that reduces the volume or force of blood flow through the kidneys may help prevent prerenal azotemia.\nAlternative Names\nAzotemia - prerenal; Uremia; Renal underperfusion; Acute renal failure - prerenal azotemia\nImages\nKidney anatomy\nKidney - blood and urine"}
