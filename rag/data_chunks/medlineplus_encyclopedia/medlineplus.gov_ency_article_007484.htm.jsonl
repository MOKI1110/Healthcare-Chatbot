Your provider will most likely recommend that you take medicines and recommend lifestyle changes.\nBefore making a final diagnosis of either elevated blood pressure or high blood pressure, your provider should ask you to have your blood pressure measured at home, at your pharmacy, or somewhere else besides their office or a hospital.\nIf you have a higher risk for heart disease, diabetes, or a history of a stroke, medicines may be started at lower blood pressure readings. The most commonly used blood pressure targets for people with these medical problems are below 130/80.\nMEDICINES FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE\nMost of the time, only a single drug will be used at first. Two drugs may be started if you have stage 2 high blood pressure.\nSeveral types of medicine are used to treat high blood pressure.

They help your kidneys remove some salt (sodium) from your body.
