Light therapy uses a special lamp with a very bright light that mimics light from the sun:\nTreatment is started in the fall or early winter, before the symptoms of SAD begin.\nFollow your provider's instructions about how to use light therapy. One way that may be recommended is to sit 2 feet (60 centimeters) away from the light box for about 30 minutes each day."}

This is often done in the early morning, to mimic sunrise.\nKeep your eyes open, but do not look straight into the light source.\nIf light therapy is going to help, symptoms of depression should improve within 3 to 4 weeks.\nSide effects of light therapy include:\nEye strain or headache\nMania\n(rarely)\nPeople who take medicines that make them more sensitive to light, such as certain psoriasis medicines, antibiotics, or antipsychotics, should not use light therapy.\nA checkup with your eye doctor is recommended before starting treatment.\nWith no treatment, symptoms usually get better on their own with the change of seasons. Symptoms can improve more quickly with treatment.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome is usually good with treatment. But some people have SAD throughout their lives.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIf you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat\n988lifeline.org\n.
