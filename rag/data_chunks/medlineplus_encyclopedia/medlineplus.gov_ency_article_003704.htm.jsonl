Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take. These include:\nHigh blood pressure medicines\nHeart medicines\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nAntacid and ulcer medicines\nWater pills (diuretics)\nDo not stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider."}

Your provider may recommend that you eat no more than 3 grams of salt (sodium) per day for at least 2 weeks before the test.\nOr, your provider may recommend that you eat your usual amount of salt and also test the amount of\nsodium in your urine\n.\nAt other times, the aldosterone blood test is done right before and after you receive a salt solution (saline) through the vein (IV) for 2 hours. Be aware that other factors can affect aldosterone measurements, including:\nPregnancy\nHigh- or low-sodium diet\nHigh- or low-potassium diet\nEating large amounts of black licorice\nStrenuous exercise\nStress\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise."}

It helps the body regulate blood pressure. Aldosterone increases the reabsorption of sodium and water and the release of potassium in the kidneys. This action raises blood pressure.\nAldosterone blood test is often combined with other tests, such as the\nrenin hormone test\n, to diagnose over- or under-production of aldosterone."}

Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA higher than normal level of aldosterone may be due to:\nBartter syndrome\n(group of rare conditions that affect the kidneys)\nAdrenal glands release too much aldosterone hormone (\nprimary hyperaldosteronism\n- usually due to a benign nodule in the adrenal gland)\nVery low-sodium diet\nTaking blood pressure medicines called mineralocorticoid antagonists\nAbuse of diuretics\nLiver cirrhosis\nHeart failure\nLaxative abuse\nA lower than normal level of aldosterone may be due to:\nAdrenal gland disorders, including not releasing enough ald"}

Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nBlood accumulating under the skin\n(hematoma)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nAldosterone - serum; Addison disease - serum aldosterone; Primary hyperaldosteronism - serum aldosterone; Bartter syndrome - serum aldosterone\nReferences\nGuber HA, Oprea M, Russell YX .
