Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAngiodysplasia of the colon\nAngiodysplasia of the colon\nAngiodysplasia of the colon (large intestine) is swollen, fragile blood vessels in the colon. These can result in bleeding and blood loss from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Angiodysplasia can also occur in the small intestine with similar causes and symptoms.\nCauses\nAngiodysplasia of the colon is mostly related to the aging and breakdown of the blood vessels. It is more common in older adults. It is almost always seen on the right side of the colon.\nMost likely, the problem develops due to normal movement of the colon that causes the blood vessels in the area to enlarge. When this swelling becomes severe, a tiny passageway develops between a small artery and vein. This is called an arteriovenous malformation. Bleeding can occur from this area in the colon wall. Other causes include certain heart and lung conditions.\nRarely, angiodysplasia of the colon is related to other diseases of the blood vessels. One of these is Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. The condition is not related to cancer."}

One of these is Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome. The condition is not related to cancer. It is also different from diverticulosis, which is a more common cause of intestinal bleeding in older adults.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms vary.\nOlder people may have symptoms such as:\nWeakness\nFatigue\nShortness of breath due to anemia\nThey may not have noticeable bleeding directly from the colon.\nOther people may have bouts of mild or severe bleeding in which bright red or black blood comes from the rectum.\nThere is no pain associated with angiodysplasia.\nExams and Tests\nTests that may be done to diagnose this condition include:\nAngiography\n01_003327(only useful if there is active bleeding into the colon).\nCT angiography\n(CTA). This is a special type of CT scan that shows active bleeding into the intestine.\nComplete blood count (CBC) to check for anemia.\nColonoscopy.\nStool test for occult (hidden) blood (a positive test result suggests bleeding from the colon).\nTreatment\nIt is important to find the cause of bleeding in the colon and how fast the blood is being lost."}

You may need to be admitted to a hospital. Fluids may be given through a vein, and blood products may be required.\nOther treatment may be needed once the source of bleeding is found. In most cases, the bleeding stops on its own without treatment.\nIf treatment is needed, it may involve:\nAngiography to help block the blood vessel that is bleeding or to deliver medicine to help cause the blood vessels to tighten to stop the bleeding.\nBurning (cauterizing) the site of the bleed with heat, argon plasma coagulation, or laser using a colonoscope.\nMedicines: A medicine called octreotide can be injected to help treat the problem.\nIn some cases, surgery is the only option. You may need the entire right side of the colon (right hemicolectomy) removed if heavy bleeding continues, even after other treatments have been tried."}
