However, many of these tumors are already quite advanced by the time they are found.\nCCA may start anywhere along the bile ducts. These tumors block off the bile ducts.\nBoth men and women are affected. Most people are older than 65.\nPeople with the following health problems may have a higher chance of developing CCA:\nBile duct (choledochal)\ncysts\nChronic\nbiliary\nand liver inflammation\nHistory of infection with  parasitic worms, liver flukes\nPrimary\nsclerosing cholangitis\nUlcerative colitis\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of CCA may include any of the following:\nFever\nand chills\nClay-colored stools and dark urine\nItching\nLoss of appetite\nPain in the upper right abdomen that may radiate to the back\nWeight loss\nYellowing of the skin (\njaundice\n)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

Tests will be done to check for a tumor or blockage in the bile duct. These may include:\nAbdominal CT scan\nAbdominal ultrasound\nProcedure that uses a viewing scope to look at the bile ducts (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or\nERCP\n), during which\ntissue may be taken\nand looked at under a microscope\nBlood tests that may be done include:\nLiver function tests\n(especially alkaline phosphatase or\nbilirubin\nlevels)\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nTreatment\nThe goal is to treat the cancer and the blockage it causes. When possible, surgery to remove the tumor is the treatment of choice and may result in a cure. Often the cancer has already spread locally or to another area of the body by the time it is diagnosed."}

Often the cancer has already spread locally or to another area of the body by the time it is diagnosed. As a result, surgery to cure the cancer is not possible.\nChemotherapy\nor\nradiation\nmay be given after surgery to decrease the risk of the cancer returning.\nIn select cases, a liver transplant can be tried.\nEndoscopic therapy with stent placement can temporarily relieve blockages in the biliary ducts. This may also relieve jaundice when the tumor cannot be removed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nCompletely removing the tumor allows some people to survive with the possibility of complete cure.\nThe survival time varies greatly from several months to several years. Outlook depends on:\nThe location of CCA\nThe cell type of CCA\nThe stage of the tumor\nThe person's age and general health\nWhether surgery is an option\nThe person's response to treatment\nIf the tumor cannot be completely removed, a cure is generally not possible. With treatment, about one half of affected people live a year, and about one half live longer, but rarely beyond 5 years."}

You and your family may want to start thinking about end-of-life planning, such as:\nPalliative care\nHospice care\nAdvance care directives\nHealth care agents\nPossible Complications\nComplications of CCA include:\nInfection\nLiver failure\nSpread (\nmetastasis\n) of tumor to other organs\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have jaundice or other symptoms of cholangiocarcinoma.\nAlternative Names\nBile duct cancer\nImages\nDigestive system\nBile pathway\nReferences\nGibson RN, Sutherland TR.
