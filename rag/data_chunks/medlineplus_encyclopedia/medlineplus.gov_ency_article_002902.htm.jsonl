Mothballs have an irritating smell, which usually keeps people away from them.\nMore severe symptoms may occur if someone swallows the product on purpose, since larger amounts are commonly swallowed.\nBurns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue necrosis, resulting in infection, shock, and death, even several months after the substance is first swallowed. Scars may form in these tissues, leading to long-term difficulties with breathing, swallowing, and digestion.\nReferences\nDubey D, Sharma VD, Pass SE, Sawhney A,  StÃ¼ve  O.
