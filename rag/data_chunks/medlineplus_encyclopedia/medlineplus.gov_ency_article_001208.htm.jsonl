Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPorphyria\nPorphyria\nPorphyrias are a group of rare disorders in which an important part of\nhemoglobin\n, called heme, is not made properly. Hemoglobin is a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. Heme is also found in myoglobin, a protein found in certain muscles.\nCauses\nNormally, the body makes heme in a multi-step process. Porphyrins are made during several steps of this process. People with porphyria are lacking certain\nenzymes\nneeded for this process. This causes abnormal amounts of porphyrins or related chemicals to build up in the body.\nThere are several forms of porphyria."}

This causes abnormal amounts of porphyrins or related chemicals to build up in the body.\nThere are several forms of porphyria. The most common type is porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT).\nMedicines, infection, alcohol, and hormones such as estrogen may trigger attacks of certain types of porphyria.\nPorphyria can be passed down through families (inherited) or acquired.\nSymptoms\nPorphyria causes three major symptoms:\nAbdominal pain or cramping (only in some forms of the disease)\nSensitivity to light that can cause rashes, blistering, and scarring of the skin (photodermatitis)\nProblems with the nervous system and muscles (\nseizures\n, mental disturbances, nerve damage)\nAttacks can occur suddenly. They often start with severe abdominal pain followed by vomiting and constipation. Being out in the sun can cause pain, sensations of heat, blistering, and skin redness and swelling. Blisters heal slowly, often with scarring or skin color changes. The scarring may be disfiguring."}

You may have a fast heart rate (tachycardia). The provider may find that your deep tendon reflexes (knee jerks or others) do not work properly.\nBlood and urine tests may reveal kidney problems or other problems."}
