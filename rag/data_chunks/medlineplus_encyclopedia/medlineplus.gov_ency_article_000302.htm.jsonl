Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLoss of brain function - liver disease\nLoss of brain function - liver disease\nLoss of brain function occurs when the liver is unable to remove toxins from the blood\n.  This is called hepatic encephalopathy (HE). This problem may occur suddenly or it may develop slowly over time.\nCauses\nAn important function of the liver is to make toxic substances in the body harmless. These substances may be made by the body (ammonia), or substances that you take in (medicines).\nWhen the liver is damaged, these \"poisons\" can build up in the bloodstream and affect the function of the nervous system. The result may be HE.\nHE can occur suddenly and you may become ill very quickly. Causes of HE may include:\nHepatitis A or B infection (uncommon to occur this way)\nBlockage of blood supply to the liver\nPoisoning by different toxins or medicines\nConstipation\nUpper gastrointestinal bleeding\nPeople with severe liver damage often suffer from HE. The end result of chronic liver damage is cirrhosis."}

They may begin slowly and worsen over time.\nEarly symptoms may be mild and include:\nBreath with a musty or sweet odor\nChanges in sleep patterns\nChanges in thinking\nMild confusion\nForgetfulness\nPersonality or mood changes\nPoor concentration and judgment\nWorsening of handwriting or loss of other small hand movements\nSevere symptoms may include:\nAbnormal movements or shaking of hands or arms\nAgitation, excitement, or seizures (occur rarely)\nDisorientation\nDrowsiness or confusion\nBehavior or personality changes\nSlurred speech\nSlowed or sluggish movement\nPeople with HE can become unconscious, unresponsive, and possibly enter into a coma.\nPeople are often not able to care for themselves because of these symptoms.\nExams and Tests\nSigns of nervous system changes may include:\nShaking of the hands (\"flapping tremor\" or asterixis)"}
