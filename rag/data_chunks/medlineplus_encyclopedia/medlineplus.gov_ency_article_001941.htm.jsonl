Decreasing your sedentary behaviors can help you lose weight. For most people, the best way to decrease sedentary behaviors is to reduce the time they spend watching TV and using a computer and other electronic devices. All of these activities are called \"screen time.\"\nSome ways to decrease screen time are:\nChoose 1 or 2 TV programs to watch, and turn off the TV when they are over.\nDo not keep the TV on all the time for background noise -- you might end up sitting down and watching it. Turn on the radio instead."}

You can be up doing things around the house and still listen to the radio.\nDo not eat while you watch TV.\nTake the batteries out of your TV remote control and get up to change the channel.\nBefore you turn on the TV, take your dog or a neighbor's dog for a walk. If you are going to miss your favorite show, record it.\nFind activities to replace TV watching. Read a book, play a board game with family or friends, or take an evening cooking class.\nWork out on an exercise or yoga ball while you watch TV. You will burn calories. Or, set up a stationary bike or treadmill in front of your TV and use it while you watch.\nIf you like playing video games, try games that require you to move your whole body, not just your thumbs.\nHOW MUCH EXERCISE DO YOU NEED?\nThe\nPhysical Activity Guidelines for Americans\nrecommends that adults get a total of 150 to 300 minutes per week of moderate-intensity activity, or 75 to 150 minutes per week of vigorous activity."}
