It is most often bright red, although it may be rust-colored. Sometimes the mucus contains only streaks of blood.\nThe outlook depends on what is causing the problem. Most people do well with treatment to treat the symptoms and the underlying disease. People with severe hemoptysis may die.\nCauses\nA number of conditions, diseases, and medical tests may make you cough up blood."}
