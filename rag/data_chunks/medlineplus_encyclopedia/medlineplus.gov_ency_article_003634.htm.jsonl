Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to see how fast your red blood cells are destroyed. It may be done if your provider suspects you have a type of anemia that your immune system is causing.\nNormal Results\nThe normal range is 41 to 165 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 410 to 1,650 milligrams per liter (mg/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nWhen red blood cells are actively being destroyed, haptoglobin disappears faster than it is created."}

As a result, the levels of haptoglobin in the blood drop.\nLower than normal levels may be due to:\nImmune\nhemolytic anemia\nLong-term (chronic) liver disease\nBlood buildup under the skin (\nhematoma\n)\nLiver disease\nTransfusion reaction\nHigher-than-normal levels may be due to:\nBlockage of the bile ducts\nJoint or muscle inflammation, swelling, and pain that comes on suddenly\nPeptic ulcer\nUlcerative colitis\nOther inflammatory conditions\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting\nor feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nImages\nBlood test\nHemoglobin\nReferences\nMarcogliese AN, Hensch L."}
