Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEpispadias\nEpispadias\nEpispadias is a rare defect that is present at birth. In this condition, the urethra does not develop into a full tube. The urethra is the tube that carries urine out of the body from the bladder. The urine exits the body from the wrong place with epispadias.\nCauses\nThe causes of epispadias are not known. It may occur because the pubic bone does not develop properly.\nEpispadias can occur with a rare birth defect called bladder exstrophy. In this birth defect, the bladder is open through the wall of the abdomen. Epispadias can also occur with other birth defects.\nThe condition occurs more often in boys than girls. It is most often diagnosed at birth or soon afterward.\nSymptoms\nMales will have a short, wide penis with an abnormal curve. The urethra most often opens on the top or side of the penis instead of the tip. However, the urethra may be open along the whole length of the penis.\nFemales have an abnormal clitoris and labia. The urethral opening is often between the clitoris and the labia, but it may be in the belly area."}

However, a second surgery may be needed either soon after the first surgery, or sometime in the future.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSurgery can help the person control the flow of urine."}
