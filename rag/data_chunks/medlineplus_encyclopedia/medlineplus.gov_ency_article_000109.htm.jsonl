Over time, the acute condition turns into long-lasting (chronic) lung disease.\nHypersensitivity pneumonitis may also be caused by:\nFungi or bacteria in humidifiers, heating systems, and air conditioners found in homes and offices\nExposure to certain chemicals, such as isocyanates or acid anhydrides\nExamples of hypersensitivity pneumonitis include:\nBird fancier's lung\nis caused by exposure to proteins found in the feathers or droppings of many species of birds."}

This makes it hard to figure out what has caused the disease. Your symptoms may get better before you go back to the area where you were exposed to the substance."}

This makes it hard to figure out what has caused the disease. Your symptoms may get better before you go back to the area where you were exposed to the substance. In the chronic phase of the condition, the symptoms are more constant and less affected by exposure to the substance.\nSymptoms after acute exposure may include:\nChills\nCough\nFever\nMalaise\n(feeling ill)\nShortness of breath\nSymptoms of chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis may include:\nBreathlessness, especially with activity\nCough, often dry\nLoss of appetite\nUnintentional weight loss\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about your symptoms.\nYour provider may hear abnormal lung sounds called crackles (rales) when listening to your chest with a stethoscope.\nLung changes due to chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis may be seen on a\nchest x-ray\n."}

Treatment involves avoiding this substance in the future. Some people may need to change jobs if they cannot avoid the substance at work.\nIf you have a chronic form of this disease, your provider may recommend that you take glucocorticoids (anti-inflammatory medicines). Sometimes, treatments used for asthma can help people with hypersensitivity pneumonitis."}

Sometimes, treatments used for asthma can help people with hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Sometimes medicines that suppress the immune system are needed to control the disease.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost symptoms go away when you avoid or limit your exposure to the material that caused the problem. The outlook is good if you prevent exposure during the acute stage. When it reaches the chronic stage, the disease might continue to progress, even if the offending substance is avoided.\nPossible Complications\nThe chronic form of this disease may lead to\npulmonary fibrosis\n. This is scarring of the lung tissue that often is not reversible. Eventually, end-stage lung disease and respiratory failure can occur."}
