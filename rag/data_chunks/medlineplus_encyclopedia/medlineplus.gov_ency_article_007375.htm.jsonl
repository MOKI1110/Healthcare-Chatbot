It is inserted through your back or flank.\nPercutaneous nephrostolithotomy (or nephrolithotomy) is the passing of a special medical instrument through your skin into your kidney. This is done to remove kidney stones.\nMost kidney stones pass out of the body on their own through urine. When they do not, your health care provider may recommend these procedures.\nDuring the procedure, you will lie on your stomach on a table. You will be given a shot of lidocaine in the skin where the procedure will be done. This is the same medicine your dentist uses to numb your mouth. The provider may give you medicines to help you relax and reduce pain.\nIf you have nephrostomy only:\nThe surgeon inserts a needle into your skin."}

A needle is passed through the skin into your kidney. Then the tract is dilated and a plastic sheath is left in place allowing a tract to pass instruments.\nThese special instruments are then passed through the sheath. Your surgeon uses these to take out the stone or break it into pieces.\nAfter the procedure, a tube is placed in the kidney (nephrostomy tube). Another tube, called a stent, is placed in the ureter to drain urine from your kidney. This allows your kidney to heal.\nThe place where the nephrostomy catheter was inserted is covered with a dressing."}

These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of the procedure.\nLet your surgeon know about any illness you may have before your procedure.
