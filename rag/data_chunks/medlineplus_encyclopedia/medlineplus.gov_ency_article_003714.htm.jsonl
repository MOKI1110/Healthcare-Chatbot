Progesterone is a hormone produced mainly in the ovaries.\nProgesterone plays a key role in pregnancy. It is produced after ovulation in the second half of the menstrual cycle. It helps make a woman's uterus ready for a fertilized egg to be implanted. It also prepares the uterus for pregnancy by inhibiting the uterine muscle to contract and prepares the breasts for milk production.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. Most of the time, blood is\ndrawn from a vein\nlocated on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nMany medicines can interfere with blood test results.\nYour health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test.\nDO NOT stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted."}

You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to:\nDetermine if a woman is currently ovulating or has recently ovulated\nEvaluate a woman with repeated miscarriages (other tests are used more commonly)\nDetermine the risk for miscarriage or ectopic pregnancy early in pregnancy, (now largely superseded by other diagnostic options)\nNormal Results\nProgesterone levels vary, depending on the timing when the test is done. Blood progesterone levels start to rise midway through the menstrual cycle."}

Blood progesterone levels start to rise midway through the menstrual cycle. It continues to rise for about 6 to 10 days, and then falls if the egg is not fertilized.\nLevels continue to rise in early pregnancy.\nThe following are normal ranges based upon certain phases of the menstrual cycle and pregnancy:\nFemale (pre-ovulation): less than 1 nanogram per milliliter (ng/mL) or 3.18 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L)\nFemale (mid-cycle): 5 to 20 ng/mL or 15.90 to 63.60 nmol/L\nMale: less than 1 ng/mL or 3.18 nmol/L\nPostmenopausal: less than 1 ng/mL or 3.18 nmol/L\nPregnancy 1st trimester: 11.2 to 90.0 ng/mL or 35.62 to 286.20 nmol/L\nPregnancy 2nd trimester: 25.6 to 89.4 ng/mL or 81.41 to 284.29 nmol/L\nPregnancy 3rd trimester: 48 to 150 to 300 or more ng/mL or 152.64 to 477 to 954 or more nmol/L\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories.
