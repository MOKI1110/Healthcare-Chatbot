It is also called peripheral angiography.\nAngiography uses\nx-rays\nand a special dye to see the insides of the arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis test is done in a hospital or specialized procedure unit. You will lie on an x-ray table. You may ask for some medicine to make you sleep and relax (sedative).\nDuring the test, your blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing will be checked.\nThe health care provider will shave and clean an area, most often in the groin.\nA numbing medicine (anesthetic) is injected into the skin over an artery.\nA needle is placed into that artery.\nA thin plastic tube called a catheter is passed through the needle into the artery. The doctor (usually a radiologist with special training in this technique) moves it into the area of the body being studied."}

The doctor (usually a radiologist with special training in this technique) moves it into the area of the body being studied. The doctor can see live images of the area on a TV-like monitor, and uses them as a guide.\nDye flows through the catheter and into the arteries.\nX-ray images of the arteries are taken.\nCertain treatments can be done during this procedure. These treatments include:\nDissolving a blood clot with medicine\nOpening a partially blocked artery with a balloon\nPlacing a small tube called a stent into an artery to help hold it open\nAfter the x-rays or treatments are finished, the catheter is removed. Pressure is applied to the puncture site for 20 to 45 minutes to stop the bleeding. After that time, the area is checked and a tight bandage is applied. The arm or leg where the needle was placed is most often kept straight for another 6 hours after the procedure."}

You should avoid strenuous activity, such as heavy lifting, for 24 to 48 hours.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou should not eat or drink anything for 6 to 8 hours before the test.\nYou may be told to stop taking certain medicines, such as aspirin or other blood thinners for a short while before the test. Never stop taking any medicines unless told to do so by your provider.\nMake sure your provider knows about all the medicines you take, including those you bought without a prescription. This includes herbs and supplements.\nTell your provider if you:\nAre pregnant\nAre allergic to any medicines\nHave ever had an\nallergic reaction\nto x-ray contrast material, shellfish, or iodine substances\nHave ever had any bleeding problems\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe x-ray table is hard and cold. You may want to ask for a blanket or pillow. You may feel some stinging when the numbing medicine is injected."}

You may also feel some pressure as the catheter is moved.\nThe dye can cause a feeling of warmth and flushing. This is normal and most often goes away in a few seconds.\nYou may have tenderness and bruising at the site of the catheter insertion after the test. Seek immediate medical help if you have:\nSwelling\nBleeding that doesn't go away\nSevere pain in an arm or leg\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms of a\nnarrowed or blocked blood vessel\nin the arms, hands, legs, or feet.\nThe test may also be done to diagnose:\nInternal bleeding\nSwelling or inflammation of the blood vessels (\nvasculitis\n)\nNormal Results\nThe x-ray shows normal structures for your age.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result is commonly due to narrowing and hardening of the arteries in the arms or legs from plaque buildup (\nhardening of the arteries\n) in the artery walls.\nThe x-ray may show a blockage in the vessels caused by:\nAneurysms\n(abnormal widening or ballooning of part of an"}
