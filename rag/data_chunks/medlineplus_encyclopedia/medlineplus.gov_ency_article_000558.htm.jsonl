It helps the body keep a healthy balance between bleeding and clotting. Congenital antithrombin III deficiency is an inherited disease. It occurs when a person receives one variant copy of the antithrombin III gene from a parent with the disease.\nThe variant gene leads to a low level of the antithrombin III protein. This low level of antithrombin III can cause blood clots (thrombi) that can block blood flow and damage organs.\nPeople with this condition will often have blood clots at a young age for no reason. They are also likely to have family members who have had a blood clotting problem.\nSymptoms\nPeople will usually have symptoms of a blood clot. Blood clots in the arms or legs usually cause swelling, redness, and pain."}

Blood clots in the arms or legs usually cause swelling, redness, and pain. When a blood clot breaks off from where it formed and travels to another part of the body, it is called a\nthromboembolism\n. Symptoms depend on where the blood clot travels to. A common place is the lung, where the clot can cause a cough, shortness of breath, pain while taking deep breaths, chest pain, and even death. Blood clots that travel to the brain can cause a\nstroke\n.\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam may show:\nA swollen leg or arm\nDecreased\nbreath sounds in the lungs\nA rapid heart rate\nYour health care provider can also order a\nblood test\nto check if you have a low level of antithrombin III.\nTreatment\nA blood clot is treated with blood-thinning medicines (also called anticoagulants). How long you need to take these medicines depends on how serious the blood clot was and other factors."}
