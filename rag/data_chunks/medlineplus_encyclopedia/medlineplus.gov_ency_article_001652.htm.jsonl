These may include pain in the stomach and signs your body has too little fluid (dehydration).\nTests may be done on your stools or the food you have eaten to find out what type of germ is causing your symptoms. However, tests may not always find the cause of the diarrhea.\nIn more serious cases, your provider may order a sigmoidoscopy. This test uses a thin, hollow tube with a light on the end that is placed in the anus and slowly advanced to the rectum and sigmoid colon to look for the source of bleeding or infection.\nTreatment\nMost of the time, you will get better in a couple of days."}

The goal is to ease symptoms and make sure your body has the proper amount of fluids.\nGetting enough fluids and learning what to eat will help keep you comfortable. You may need to:\nManage the diarrhea\nControl nausea and vomiting\nGet plenty of rest\nYou can drink oral rehydration mixtures to replace fluids and minerals lost through vomiting and diarrhea.\nOral rehydration powder can be purchased from a pharmacy. Be sure to mix the powder in safe water.\nYou can make your own mixture by dissolving  ½ teaspoon (tsp) or 3 grams (g) salt and  ½ tsp (2.3 grams) baking soda and 4 tablespoon (tbsp) or 50 grams of sugar in 4 ¼ cups (1 liter) water.\nIf you have diarrhea and are unable to drink or keep down fluids, you may need fluids given through a vein (by IV). This may be more common in young children.\nIf you take diuretics (\"water pills\"), or ACE inhibitors for high blood pressure, contact your provider to see if you need to stop taking the medicine while you have diarrhea."}
