These sacs are called diverticula. Most often, these pouches form in the large intestine (colon). They may also occur in the jejunum in the small intestine, although this is less common.\nCauses\nDiverticulosis is less common in people age 40 and younger. It's more common in older adults. About half of Americans over age 60 have this condition. Most people will have it by age 80.\nNo one knows exactly what causes these pouches to form.\nFor many years, it was thought that eating a low-fiber diet may play a role. Not eating enough fiber can cause constipation (hard stools). Straining to pass stools (feces) increases the pressure in the colon or intestines. This may cause the pouches to form at weak spots in the colon wall."}

However, whether a low-fiber diet leads to this problem is not well proven.\nOther possible risk factors that are also not well proven are lack of exercise and obesity.\nEating nuts, popcorn, or corn does not appear to lead to inflammation of these pouches (\ndiverticulitis\n).\nSymptoms\nMost people with diverticulosis have no symptoms.\nWhen symptoms occur, they may include:\nPain and cramps in your stomach especially in the left lower abdomen\nConstipation\n(sometimes diarrhea)\nBloating or gas\nNot feeling hungry and not eating\nYou may notice small amounts of blood in your stools or on toilet paper. Rarely, more severe bleeding may occur.\nExams and Tests\nDiverticulosis is often found during an exam for another health problem."}

A small camera attached to a tube can reach the length of the colon.\nThis test should not be done when you are having symptoms of acute diverticulitis.\nAngiography\n:\nAngiography is an imaging test that uses x-rays and a special dye to see inside the blood vessels.\nThis test is done to determine a site of bleeding in the GI tract. It may be used if the area of bleeding is not seen during a colonoscopy.\nTreatment\nBecause most people have no symptoms, most of the time, no treatment is needed.\nYour health care provider may recommend getting more fiber in your diet."}

Limit processed foods.\nDrink plenty of fluids.\nGet regular exercise.\nTalk with your provider about taking a fiber supplement.\nYou should avoid NSAIDs such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve). These medicines can make bleeding and diverticulitis (inflammation) more likely.\nFor bleeding that does not stop or recurs:\nColonoscopy\nmay be used to inject medicines or burn a certain area in the intestine to stop the bleeding.\nAngiography may be used to infuse medicines or block off a blood vessel.\nIf bleeding does not stop or recurs many times,\nremoval of a section of the colon\nmay be needed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people who have diverticulosis have no symptoms.
