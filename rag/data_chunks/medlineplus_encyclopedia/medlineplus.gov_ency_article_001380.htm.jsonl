Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nListeriosis\nListeriosis\nListeriosis is an infection that can occur when a person eats food that has been contaminated with bacteria called\nListeria monocytogenes\n(\nL monocytogenes\n).\nCauses\nThe bacteria\nL monocytogenes\nis found in wild animals, domesticated animals, and in soil and water. These bacteria make many animals sick, leading to miscarriage and stillbirth in domestic animals.\nVegetables, meats, and other foods can get infected with the bacteria if they come in contact with contaminated soil or manure. Raw milk or products made from raw milk may carry these bacteria.\nIf you eat the contaminated products, you may get sick. The following people are at increased risk:\nAdults over age 50\nAdults with a weakened immune system\nDeveloping fetuses\nNewborns\nPregnancy\nThe bacteria most often cause a gastrointestinal illness. In some cases, you can develop a blood infection (\nsepticemia\n) or inflammation of the covering of the brain (\nmeningitis\n). Infants and children often have meningitis.\nInfection in early pregnancy may cause a miscarriage."}

Infants and children often have meningitis.\nInfection in early pregnancy may cause a miscarriage. The bacteria may cross the placenta and infect the developing baby. Infections in late pregnancy may lead to stillbirth or death of the infant within a few hours of birth. About one half of infants infected at or near birth will die.\nIn adults, the disease may take many forms, depending on what organ or organ systems are infected. It may occur as:\nHeart infection (\nendocarditis\n)\nBrain or spinal fluid infection (meningitis)\nLung infection (\npneumonia\n)\nBlood infection (septicemia)\nGastrointestinal infection (gastroenteritis, diarrhea)\nOr it may occur in a milder form as:\nAbscesses\nConjunctivitis\nSkin lesion\nSymptoms\nIn infants, symptoms of listeriosis may be seen in the first few days of life and may include:\nLoss of appetite\nLethargy\nJaundice\nRespiratory\ndistress (usually pneumonia)\nShock\nSkin rash\nVomiting\nExams and Tests\nLaboratory tests may be done to detect the bacteria in amniotic fluid, blood, feces, and urine."}

A\nspinal fluid (cerebrospinal fluid or CSF) culture\nwill be performed if a spinal tap is performed.\nTreatment\nAntibiotics (including ampicillin or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) are prescribed to kill the bacteria.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nListeriosis in a fetus or infant is often fatal. Healthy older children and adults are more likely to survive. The illness is less serious if it only affects the gastrointestinal system. Brain or spinal infections have worse outcomes.\nPossible Complications\nInfants who survive listeriosis may have long-term brain and nervous system (neurologic) damage and delayed development.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you or your child develops symptoms of listeriosis.\nPrevention\nForeign food products, such as nonpasteurized soft cheeses, have also led to outbreaks of listeriosis."}
