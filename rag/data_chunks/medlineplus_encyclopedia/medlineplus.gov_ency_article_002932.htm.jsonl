Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRectal prolapse repair\nRectal prolapse repair\nRectal prolapse repair is surgery to fix a\nrectal prolapse\n. This is a condition in which the last part of the intestine (called the rectum) sticks out through the anus.\nDescription\nRectal prolapse may be partial, involving only the inner lining of the bowel (\nmucosa\n). Or, it may be complete, involving the entire wall of the rectum.\nFor most adults, surgery is used to repair the rectum because there is no other effective treatment.\nChildren with rectal prolapse do not always need surgery, unless their prolapse does not improve over time. In infants, prolapse often disappears without treatment.\nMost surgical procedures for rectal prolapse are done under\ngeneral anesthesia\n. For older or sicker people,\nepidural or spinal anesthesia\nmay be used.\nThere are three basic types of surgery to repair rectal prolapse. Your surgeon will decide which one is best for you.\nFor healthy adults, an abdominal procedure has the best chance of success."}

Your surgeon will decide which one is best for you.\nFor healthy adults, an abdominal procedure has the best chance of success. While you are under general anesthesia, your surgeon makes a cut in the abdomen and removes a portion of the colon. The rectum may be attached (sutured) to the surrounding tissue so it will not slide and fall out through the anus. Sometimes, a soft piece of mesh is wrapped around the rectum to help it stay in place. These procedures can also be done with laparoscopic surgery.\nFor older adults or those with other medical problems, an approach through the anus (perineal approach) might be less risky. It might also cause less pain and lead to a shorter recovery. But with this approach, the prolapse is more likely to come back (recur).\nOne of the surgical repairs through the anus involves removing the prolapsed rectum and colon and then suturing the rectum to the surrounding tissues. This procedure can be done under general, epidural, or spinal anesthesia.\nVery frail or sick people may need a smaller procedure that reinforces the sphincter muscles."}

This technique encircles the muscles with a band of soft mesh or a silicone tube. This approach provides only short-term improvement and is rarely used.\nRisks\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general include:\nReactions to medicines\nBreathing problems\nBleeding, blood clots, infection\nRisks of this surgery include:\nInfection. If a piece of rectum or colon is removed, the bowel needs to be reconnected. In rare cases, this connection can leak, causing infection. More procedures may be needed to treat the infection.\nConstipation is very common, although most people have constipation before the surgery.\nIn some people,\nincontinence\n(loss of bowel control) can get worse.\nReturn of prolapse after abdominal or perineal surgery.\nBefore the Procedure\nDuring the 2 weeks before your surgery:\nYou may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot."}

Some of these are aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), vitamin E, warfarin (Coumadin), clopidogrel (Plavix), ticlopidine (Ticlid), and apixaban (Eliquis).\nAsk your health care provider which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\nIf you smoke, try to stop. Ask your provider for help.\nBe sure to tell your surgeon if you get sick before your surgery. This includes a cold, flu, herpes flare-up, urinary problems, or any other illness.\nThe day before your surgery:\nFollow instructions about what you may eat and drink in the days before the operation.\nFollow instructions about when to stop eating or drinking.\nYou may be asked to clear out your intestines with a bowel prep. If so, follow those instructions exactly.\nOn the day of your surgery:\nTake any medicines that your provider told you to take with a small sip of water.\nBe sure to arrive at the hospital on time.\nAfter the Procedure\nHow long you stay in the hospital depends on the procedure."}

The stay for perineal surgery may be 2 to 3 days.\nYou should make a complete recovery in 4 to 6 weeks.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe surgery usually works well at repairing the prolapse.
