Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTricuspid regurgitation\nTricuspid regurgitation\nBlood that flows between different chambers of your heart must pass through a heart valve. These valves open up enough so that blood can flow through. They then close, keeping blood from flowing backward.\nThe tricuspid valve separates the right lower heart chamber (the right ventricle) from the right upper heart chamber (right atrium).\nTricuspid regurgitation is a disorder in which this valve does not close tight enough. This problem causes blood to flow backward into the right atrium when the right ventricle contracts.\nCauses\nAn increase in size of the right ventricle is the most common cause of this condition. The right ventricle pumps blood to the lungs where it picks up oxygen. Any condition that puts extra strain on this chamber can cause it to enlarge."}

The provider may also feel a pulse over your liver. The physical exam may show liver and spleen swelling.\nListening to the heart with a stethoscope may reveal a murmur or other abnormal sounds.

Anything that causes bacteria to get into your bloodstream may lead to this infection. Steps to avoid this problem include:\nAvoid unclean injections.\nTreat strep infections promptly to prevent rheumatic fever.\nAlways tell your health care provider and dentist if you have a history of heart valve disease or congenital heart disease before treatment."}
