It leads to problems with blood clotting (coagulation).\nCauses\nWhen you bleed, a series of reactions take place in the body that helps blood clots form. This process is called the coagulation cascade. It involves special proteins called coagulation, or clotting, factors. You may have a higher chance of excess bleeding if one or more of these factors are missing or are not functioning like they should.\nFactor X is one such coagulation factor. Factor X deficiency is often caused by an inherited variant in the factor X gene. This is called inherited factor X deficiency. Bleeding ranges from mild to severe depending on how severe the deficiency is.\nFactor X deficiency can also be due to another condition or use of certain medicines. This is called acquired factor X deficiency. Acquired factor X deficiency is common."}

It can be caused by:\nLack of vitamin K (some newborns are born with\nvitamin K deficiency\n)\nBuildup of abnormal proteins in the tissues and organs (\namyloidosis\n)\nSevere\nliver disease\nUse of medicines that prevent clotting (anticoagulants such as warfarin)\nWomen with factor X deficiency may first be diagnosed when they have very heavy menstrual bleeding and bleeding after childbirth. The condition may be first noticed in newborn boys if they have bleeding that lasts longer than normal after\ncircumcision\n.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nBleeding into the joints\nBleeding into the muscles\nBruising easily\nHeavy menstrual bleeding\nMucus membrane\nbleeding\nNosebleeds that do not stop easily\nUmbilical cord bleeding after birth\nExams and Tests\nTests that may be done include:\nFactor X assay\nPartial thromboplastin time\n(PTT)\nProthrombin time\n(PT)\nTreatment\nBleeding can be controlled by getting intravenous (IV) infusions of plasma or concentrates of clotting factors."}
