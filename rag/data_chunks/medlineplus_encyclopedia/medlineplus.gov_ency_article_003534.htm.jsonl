Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test may be performed when the health care provider suspects you have anthrax infection. The bacteria that cause anthrax is called\nBacillus anthracis\n.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means no\nantibodies\nto the anthrax bacteria were seen in your blood sample. However, during the early stages of infection, your body may only produce a few antibodies, which the blood test may miss. The test may need to be repeated in 10 days to 2 weeks.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result means antibodies to the bacteria have been detected and you may have anthrax disease. But some people come in contact with the bacteria and do not develop the disease.\nTo determine if you have a current infection, your provider will look for an increase in the antibody count after a few weeks as well as your symptoms and physical exam findings.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
