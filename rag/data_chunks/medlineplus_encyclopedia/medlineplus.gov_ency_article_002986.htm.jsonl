Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nChin augmentation\nChin augmentation\nChin augmentation is surgery to reshape or enhance the size of the chin. It may be done either by inserting an implant or by moving or reshaping the jaw bones.\nDescription\nSurgery may be performed in the surgeon's office, a hospital, or an outpatient clinic.\nYou may have\nx-rays\ntaken of your face and chin. The surgeon will use these x-rays to find out what part of the chin to operate on.\nWhen you need only an implant to round out the chin:\nYou may be under\ngeneral anesthesia\n(asleep and pain-free). Or, you may get medicine to numb the area, along with a medicine that will make you relaxed and sleepy.\nA cut is made, either inside the mouth or outside under the chin. A pocket is created in front of the chin bone and under the muscles. The implant is placed inside.\nThe surgeon may use real bone or fat tissue, or an implant made out of silicone, Teflon, Dacron, or newer biological inserts.\nThe implant is often attached to the bone with stitches or screws.\nSutures are used to close the surgical cut."}

When the cut is inside the mouth, the scar can barely be seen.\nThe surgeon may also need to move some bones:\nYou will likely be under general anesthesia.\nThe surgeon will make a cut inside your mouth along the lower gum. This gives the surgeon access to the chin bone.\nThe surgeon uses a bone saw or chisel to make a second cut through the jaw bone. The jaw bone is moved and wired or screwed in place with a metal plate.\nThe cut is closed with stitches and a bandage is applied."}

Because the surgery is performed inside your mouth, you will not see any scars.\nThe procedure takes between 1 and 3 hours.\nChin augmentation is commonly done at the same time as cosmetic nose surgery (\nrhinoplasty\n) or facial\nliposuction\n(when fat is removed from under the chin and neck).\nSurgery to correct bite problems (orthognathic surgery) can be done at the same time as chin surgery.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nChin augmentation is mostly done to balance the appearance of the face by making the chin longer or bigger compared to the nose. The best candidates for chin augmentation are people with small or receding chins (microgenia), but who have a normal bite.\nTalk with a plastic surgeon if you are considering chin augmentation."}

Ask your surgeon what kind of pain medicine you should use.\nYou may feel some numbness in your chin for up to 3 months, and a stretching sensation around your chin for 1 week. Most of the swelling will be gone by 6 weeks, depending on the type of procedure you had.\nYou may have to stick to a liquid or soft diet for at least a day or two.\nYou will probably have the outside bandage removed within a week of surgery. You may be asked to wear a neck brace while you are sleeping for 4 to 6 weeks.\nYou can resume light activity the day of surgery. You should be able to return to work and your usual activities within 7 to 10 days. Your surgeon will give you specific instructions.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf the cut was made under the chin, the scar should not be very noticeable.\nMost implants last for a lifetime."}
