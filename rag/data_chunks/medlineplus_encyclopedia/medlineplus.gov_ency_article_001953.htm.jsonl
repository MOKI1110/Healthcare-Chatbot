Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nOrgasmic dysfunction in women\nOrgasmic dysfunction in women\nOrgasmic dysfunction is when a woman either cannot reach orgasm, or has trouble reaching orgasm when she is sexually excited.\nWhen sex is not enjoyable, it can become a chore instead of a satisfying, intimate experience for both partners. Sexual desire may decline, and sex may occur less often. This can create resentment and conflict in the relationship.\nCauses\nAbout 10% to 15% of women have never had an orgasm. Surveys suggest that up to one half of women are not satisfied with how often they reach orgasm.\nSexual response involves the mind and body working together in a complex way. Both need to function well for an orgasm to happen.\nMany factors can lead to problems reaching orgasm."}
