Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPericarditis - constrictive\nPericarditis - constrictive\nConstrictive pericarditis is a process in which the sac-like covering of the heart (the pericardium) becomes thickened and scarred.\nRelated conditions include:\nBacterial pericarditis\nPericarditis\nPericarditis after heart attack\nCauses\nMost of the time, constrictive pericarditis occurs due to things that cause inflammation to develop around the heart, such as:\nHeart surgery\nRadiation therapy\nto the chest\nTuberculosis\nLess common causes include:\nAbnormal fluid buildup in the covering of the heart. This may occur because of infection or as a complication of surgery.\nMesothelioma\nThe condition may also develop without a clear cause.\nIt is rare in children.\nSymptoms\nWhen you have constrictive pericarditis, the inflammation causes the covering of the heart to become thick and rigid. This makes it hard for the heart to expand properly when it beats. As a result, the heart chambers don't fill up with enough blood."}

This makes it hard for the heart to expand properly when it beats. As a result, the heart chambers don't fill up with enough blood. Blood backs up behind the heart, causing heart swelling and other symptoms of heart failure.\nSymptoms of chronic constrictive pericarditis include:\nDifficulty breathing (\ndyspnea\n) that develops slowly and gets worse\nFatigue\nLong-term swelling (\nedema\n) of the legs and ankles\nSwollen abdomen\nWeakness\nExams and Tests\nConstrictive pericarditis is very hard to diagnose. Signs and symptoms are similar to other conditions such as\nrestrictive cardiomyopathy\nand\ncardiac tamponade\n. Your health care provider will need to rule out these conditions when making a diagnosis.\nA physical exam may show that your neck veins stick out. This indicates increased pressure around the heart. The provider may note weak or distant heart sounds when listening to your chest with a stethoscope."}

This indicates increased pressure around the heart. The provider may note weak or distant heart sounds when listening to your chest with a stethoscope. A knocking sound may also be heard.\nThe physical exam may also reveal liver swelling and fluid in the belly area.\nThe following tests may be ordered:\nChest MRI\nChest CT scan\nChest x-ray\nCoronary angiography\nor cardiac catheterization\nECG\nEchocardiogram\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to improve heart function. The cause must be identified and treated. Depending on the source of the problem, treatment may include anti-inflammatory agents, antibiotics, medicines for tuberculosis, or other treatments.\nDiuretics (\"water pills\") are often used in small doses to help the body remove excess fluid. Pain medicines may be needed for discomfort.\nSome people may need to cut down on their activity. A low-sodium diet may also be recommended.\nIf other methods do not control the problem, surgery called a pericardiectomy may be needed."}

For this reason, it is most often done in people who have severe symptoms.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nHeart failure\nPulmonary edema\nLiver and kidney dysfunction\nScarring of the heart muscle\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of constrictive pericarditis.\nPrevention\nIn some cases, constrictive pericarditis is not preventable.\nHowever, conditions that can lead to constrictive pericarditis should be properly treated.\nAlternative Names\nConstrictive pericarditis\nImages\nPericardium\nConstrictive pericarditis\nReferences\nHoit BD, Oh JK.
