These areas include the:\nBack of the knees\nGroin\nNeck\nTemple\nTop or inner side of the foot\nWrist\nTo measure the pulse at your wrist, place your index and middle finger over the underside of your opposite wrist, below the base of the thumb. Press with flat fingers until you feel the pulse.\nTo measure the pulse on the neck, place the index and middle fingers just to the side of the Adam's apple, in the soft, hollow area. Press gently until you locate the pulse.\nNote: Sit or lie down before taking the neck pulse. The neck arteries in some people are sensitive to pressure. Fainting or slowing of the heartbeat can result. Also, do not take the pulses on both sides of the neck at the same time. Doing so can slow the flow of blood to the head and lead to fainting.\nOnce you find the pulse, count the beats for 1 full minute. Or, count the beats for 30 seconds and multiply by 2. This will give the beats per minute."}

It is usually accurate to count the beats for shorter times, such as 10 or 15 seconds, and then multiply by 6 or 4 respectively.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nTo determine the resting heart rate, you must have been resting for at least 10 minutes. Take the exercise heart rate while you are exercising.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThere is a slight pressure from the fingers.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nMeasuring the pulse gives important information about your health. Any change from your normal heart rate can indicate a health problem. A fast pulse may signal an infection or\ndehydration\n. In emergency situations, the pulse rate can help determine if the person's heart is pumping.\nPulse measurement has other uses as well."}

Talk to your health care provider about this. Also discuss resting heart rates that are below the normal values (\nbradycardia\n).\nA pulse that is very firm (\nbounding pulse\n) and that lasts for more than a few minutes should be checked by your provider as well."}

These blockages are common in people with diabetes or\nhardening of the artery from high cholesterol\n.
