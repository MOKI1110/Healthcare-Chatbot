Sputum is the material that comes up from your air passages when you cough very deeply.\nThe\nGram stain method\nis one of the most commonly used methods to rapidly identify the type of bacteria in a bacterial infection, including pneumonia.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA sputum sample is needed.\nYou will be asked to cough deeply and spit any substance that comes up from your lungs (sputum) into a special container.\nYou may be asked to breathe in a mist of salty steam. This makes you cough more deeply and produce sputum.\nIf you still do not produce enough sputum, you might have a procedure called\nbronchoscopy\n.\nTo increase the accuracy, this test is sometimes done 3 times, often 3 days in a row.\nThe sample is sent to a lab. The lab team member places a very thin layer of the sample onto a glass slide. This is called a smear. Stains are placed on the sample."}

The lab team member places a very thin layer of the sample onto a glass slide. This is called a smear. Stains are placed on the sample. The lab team member looks at the stained slide under a microscope, checking for bacteria and white blood cells. The color, size, and shape of the cells help identify the bacteria.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nDrinking fluids the night before the test may help your lungs produce phlegm. It makes the test more accurate if it is done first thing in the morning.\nIf you are having a bronchoscopy, follow your health care provider's instructions on how to prepare for the procedure.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThere is no discomfort, unless a bronchoscopy needs to be performed.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order this test if you have a persistent or prolonged cough, or if you are coughing up material that has a foul odor or unusual color. The test may also be done if you have other signs and symptoms of a respiratory disease or an infection.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means that few to no white blood cells and no bacteria were seen in the sample."}

A culture is needed to confirm the diagnosis.\nRisks\nThere are no risks, unless bronchoscopy is performed.\nAlternative Names\nGram stain of sputum\nImages\nSputum test\nReferences\nDockrell DH, Ho A, Gordon SB.
