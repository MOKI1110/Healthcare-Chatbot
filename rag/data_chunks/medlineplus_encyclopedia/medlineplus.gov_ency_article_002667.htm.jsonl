This article focuses on lithium overdose, or toxicity.\nAcute toxicity occurs when you swallow too much of a lithium prescription at one time.\nChronic toxicity occurs when you slowly take a little too much of a lithium prescription every day for a while. This is quite easy to do, because dehydration, other medicines, and other conditions can easily affect how your body handles lithium. These factors can make the lithium build up to harmful levels in your body without you intending this.\nAcute-on-chronic toxicity occurs when you normally take lithium every day, but one day you take an extra amount. This can be as little as a couple of pills or as much as a whole bottle.\nLithium is a medicine with a narrow range of safety. Significant poisoning can result when the amount of lithium taken is more than this range.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose or toxicity."}

People who do not develop nervous system symptoms usually do not have long-term complications. If serious nervous system symptoms occur, these problems may be permanent.\nChronic toxicity is sometimes hard to diagnose at first. This delay can lead to long-term problems. If dialysis is done quickly, the person may feel much better. But symptoms such as memory and mood problems may be permanent.\nAcute-on-chronic overdose often has a poor outlook. Nervous system symptoms may not go away, even after treatment with dialysis.\nAlternative Names\nLithobid toxicity\nReferences\nAronson JK. Lithium.
