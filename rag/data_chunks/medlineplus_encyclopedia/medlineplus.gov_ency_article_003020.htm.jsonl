Meningocele and myelomeningocele are types of\nspina bifida\n.\nDescription\nA meningocele causes an abnormal lump in the lower back. There are two types of meningoceles: open (skin is missing) and closed (the skin covering is intact). It is common to have parts of the spinal cord or nerves inside the lump.\nFor both meningoceles and myelomeningoceles, the surgeon will close the opening in the back.\nAfter birth, an open defect is covered by a sterile dressing. Your child may then be transferred to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Care will be provided by a medical team with experience in children with spina bifida.\nYour baby will likely have an\nMRI\n(magnetic resonance imagining) or\nultrasound\nof the back to see the spinal cord."}

An MRI or ultrasound of the brain may be done to look for\nhydrocephalus\n(extra fluid in the brain).\nIf the myelomeningocele is not covered by skin or a membrane when your child is born, surgery will be done within 24 to 48 hours after birth. This is to prevent infection.\nIf your child has hydrocephalus, a shunt (plastic tube) will be put in the child's brain to drain the extra fluid to the stomach. This prevents pressure that could damage the baby's brain. The shunt is called a\nventriculoperitoneal (VP) shunt\n.\nYour child should not be exposed to latex before, during, and after surgery. Many children with this condition have very bad allergies to latex.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nRepair of a meningocele or myelomeningocele is needed to prevent infection and further injury to the child's spinal cord and nerves."}

Surgery cannot correct the defects in the spinal cord or nerves.\nRisks\nRisks for any anesthesia and surgery are:\nBreathing problems\nReactions to medicines\nBleeding\nInfection\nLatex allergy if latex products are used\nRisks for this surgery are:\nFluid buildup and pressure in the brain (hydrocephalus)\nIncreased chance of urinary tract infection and bowel problems\nInfection or inflammation of the spinal cord\nParalysis, weakness, or sensation changes due to loss of nerve function\nBefore the Procedure\nA health care provider often will find these defects before birth using fetal ultrasound. Your provider will follow the fetus very closely until birth. It is better if the infant is carried to full term. Your obstetric provider will want to do a cesarean delivery (\nC-section\n). This will prevent further damage to the sac or exposed spinal tissue.\nAfter the Procedure\nYour child will most often need to spend about 2 weeks in the hospital after surgery."}

This will prevent further damage to the sac or exposed spinal tissue.\nAfter the Procedure\nYour child will most often need to spend about 2 weeks in the hospital after surgery. The child must lie flat without touching the wound area. After surgery, your child will receive antibiotics to prevent infection.\nAn MRI or ultrasound of the brain is repeated after surgery to see if hydrocephalus develops once the defect in the back is repaired.\nYour child may need physical, occupational, and speech therapy. Many children with these problems have gross (large) and fine (small) motor disabilities, and swallowing problems, early in life.\nThe child may need to see a team of medical experts in spina bifida often after discharge from the hospital.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well your child does depends on the initial condition of their spinal cord and nerves. After a meningocele repair, children often do very well and have no further brain, nerve, or muscle problems.\nChildren born with myelomeningocele most often have paralysis or weakness of the muscles below the level of their spine where the defect is. They also may not be able to control their bladder or bowels."}
