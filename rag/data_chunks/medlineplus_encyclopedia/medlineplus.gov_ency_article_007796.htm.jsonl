This type of surgery may be used for people who cannot have regular shoulder replacement surgery or for whom the reverse approach may give a better result.\nDescription\nYou'll receive anesthesia before surgery. Two types of anesthesia can be used:\nGeneral anesthesia\n, which means you'll be unconscious and unable to feel pain.\nRegional anesthesia\nto numb your arm and shoulder area so you don't feel any pain in this area. You'll also be given medicine to help you relax during the operation.\nThe shoulder is a ball-and-socket joint. The round end of the arm bone fits into the curved surface at the end of the shoulder blade, called the socket."}

This type of joint allows you to move your arm in most directions.\nFor a\ntotal shoulder replacement\n, the replacement parts look like the parts of the body they are replacing:\nThe round end of your arm bone is replaced with a rounded metal head (ball). The ball sometimes is supported by a stem that goes into the arm bone. It can be held in place with special cement to allow your bone to grow onto it.\nThe socket part of your shoulder bone (glenoid) is replaced with a smooth plastic lining (socket) held in place with special cement.\nIn a reverse total shoulder replacement, the positions of the ball and socket are reversed."}

Then your surgeon:\nRemoves the head (top) of your upper arm bone (humerus).\nPlaces the new metal ball into the shoulder socket.

The drain will be removed when you no longer need it.\nThis surgery normally takes 2 hours.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nA regular anatomic shoulder replacement relies on the rotator cuff to move the arm and shoulder. The muscles and tendons of the rotator cuff hold the ball and socket of the shoulder joint in place.\nReverse total shoulder replacement is usually performed when you have a rotator cuff tear and severe arthritis. With this surgery, the mechanics of the shoulder are changed and the deltoid muscles are now used to move the arm since the rotator cuff is badly damaged."}

These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), warfarin (Coumadin), dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), and clopidogrel (Plavix).\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\nIf you have\ndiabetes\n,\nheart disease\n, or other medical conditions, your surgeon will ask you to see the provider who treats you for these conditions to ensure they're under control.\nTell your surgeon if you've been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 or 2 drinks a day.\nIf you smoke, try to stop.
