Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCryoglobulins\nCryoglobulins\nCryoglobulins are antibodies that become solid or gel-like at low temperatures in the laboratory. This article describes the blood test used to check for them.\nIn the laboratory, cryoglobulins come out of solution in blood when the blood sample is cooled below 98.6 °F (37 °C). They dissolve again when the sample is warmed up.\nCryoglobulins come in three main types, but in most cases the cause of having cryoglobulins is\nhepatitis C\n. The disease in which cryoglobulins are found is called\ncryoglobulinemia\n. Cryoglobulins can cause inflammation in blood vessels, called vasculitis. They may also cause inflammation in the kidney, nerves, joints, lungs and skin.\nHow the Test is Performed\nBecause they are temperature sensitive, cryoglobulins are hard to accurately measure. The blood specimen must be collected in a special way. The test should only be done in laboratories that are equipped for it.\nBlood is drawn from a vein. A vein on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand is used in most cases."}

The test should only be done in laboratories that are equipped for it.\nBlood is drawn from a vein. A vein on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand is used in most cases. Blood should NOT be drawn from a catheter that has heparin in it. The site is cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic). The health care provider wraps an elastic band around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area and make the vein swell with blood.\nNext, the provider gently inserts a needle into the vein. The blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm. The vial should be warm at room or body temperature, before it is used. Vials that are colder than room temperature before being processed at the laboratory may not give accurate results.\nOnce the blood has been collected, the needle is removed, and the puncture site is covered to stop any bleeding.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may want to call ahead to ask to have your blood drawn by a lab technician who has experience collecting blood for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nSome people feel discomfort when the needle is inserted."}

Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is most often done when a person has symptoms of a condition associated with cryoglobulins. Cryoglobulins are associated with cryoglobulinemia. They also occur in other conditions that affect the skin, joints, kidneys, and nervous system.\nNormal Results\nNormally, there are no cryoglobulins.\nNote: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories.
