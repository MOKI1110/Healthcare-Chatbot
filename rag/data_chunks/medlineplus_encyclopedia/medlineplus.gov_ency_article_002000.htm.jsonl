CNMs have graduated from a midwifery education program accredited by the Accreditation Commission on Midwifery Education (ACME). Upon entering the program, applicants either already have a registered nurse (RN) license or they receive their RN license as part of their CNM training.\nTo receive certification, CNMs must pass a national certification exam administered by the American Midwifery Certification Board (AMCB).\nCertified midwives (CMs) receive the same training and certification as CNMs; however, they do not have an RN license. To maintain certification, both CMs and CNMs must pass recertification every 5 years.\nCNMs can be licensed to practice in 50 states plus the District of Columbia and U.S. territories."}

Licensing occurs at the state level and falls under specific state laws. As with other advanced practice nurses, license requirements for CNMs vary from state to state. They follow the legal requirements of the state where they practice.\nCertification is done through a national organization and all states have the same requirements for professional practice standards. Only graduates of nurse-midwifery programs accredited by the ACNM are eligible to take the certification exam given by the AMCB.\nAlternative Names\nNurse midwife; CNM\nReferences\nAmerican College of Nurse-Midwives.
