Chlorine poisoning occurs when someone swallows or breathes in (inhales) chlorine.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\nPoisonous Ingredient\nChlorine reacts with water in and out of the body to form hydrochloric acid and hypochlorous acid."}

Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive:\nBlood and urine tests.\nBreathing support, including oxygen delivered through a tube through the mouth into the lungs, and a breathing machine (ventilator).\nBronchoscopy\n-- camera down the throat to look for burns in the airways and lungs.\nChest x-ray.\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG).\nEndoscopy\n-- camera down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and the stomach.\nFluids through a vein (by IV).\nMedicine to reverse the effect of the poison and treat symptoms.\nSurgical removal of burned skin (skin debridement).\nTube through the mouth into the stomach to aspirate (suck out) the stomach."}

This is only done when the person gets medical care within 30 to 45 minutes of the poisoning, and a very large amount of chlorine has been swallowed.\nWashing of the skin (irrigation) -- perhaps every few hours for several days.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment is received. The sooner a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\nSwallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue death. This may result in infection, shock, and death, even several months after the substance was swallowed. Scar tissue in the affected areas can lead to long-term problems with breathing, swallowing, and digestion.\nReferences\nAgency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) website.
