This usually occurs when there is not enough of the pigment that carries oxygen (\nhemoglobin\n) in the red blood cells.\nThe most common cause of hypochromia in the United States is not enough iron in the body (iron deficiency). If it is not treated, this can lead to a disorder called\niron deficiency anemia\n.\nThe cause of hypochromia should be evaluated by your health care provider.\nImages\nHypochromia\nReferences\nCamaschella C.
