It is also called temporal arteritis.\nCauses\nGiant cell arteritis affects medium-to-large arteries. It causes inflammation, swelling, tenderness, and damage to the blood vessels that supply blood to the head, neck, upper body, and arms. It most commonly occurs in the arteries around the temples (temporal arteries). These arteries branch off from the carotid artery in the neck. In some cases, the condition can occur in medium-to-large arteries in other places in the body as well.\nThe cause of the condition is unknown. It is believed to be due in part to a faulty\nimmune response\n. The disorder has been linked to some infections and to certain genes.\nGiant cell arteritis is more common in people with another inflammatory disorder known as\npolymyalgia rheumatica\n. While GCA is a considerably uncommon condition, it primarily affects individuals over the age of 50."}

While GCA is a considerably uncommon condition, it primarily affects individuals over the age of 50. It is most common in people of northern European descent. The condition may run in families.\nSymptoms\nSome common symptoms of this problem are:\nNew throbbing headache on one side of the head or the back of the head\nTenderness when touching the scalp\nOther symptoms may include:\nJaw pain that occurs when chewing (called jaw claudication)\nPain in the arm after using it\nMuscle aches\nPain and stiffness in the neck, upper arms, shoulder, and hips (polymyalgia rheumatica)\nWeakness, excessive tiredness\nFever\nGeneral ill feeling\nProblems with eyesight may occur, and at times may begin suddenly."}

These problems include:\nBlurred vision\nDouble vision\nSudden reduced vision (blindness in one or both eyes)\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will examine your head.\nThe scalp is often sensitive to touch.\nThere may be a tender, thick artery on one side of the head, most often over one or both temples.\nBlood tests may include:\nHemoglobin\nor\nhematocrit\nLiver function tests\nSedimentation rate\n(ESR) and\nC-reactive protein\n(CRP)\nBlood tests alone cannot provide a diagnosis. You may need to have a\nbiopsy\nof the temporal artery. This is a surgical procedure that can be done as an outpatient.\nYou may also have other tests, including:\nColor Doppler ultrasound of the temporal arteries. This may take the place of a temporal artery biopsy if done by someone experienced with the procedure.\nMRI\nor CT angiography.\nPET scan\n.\nBiopsy. If the ultrasound is positive a biopsy may not be needed."}

If the ultrasound is positive a biopsy may not be needed. If the ultrasound is negative, the heath care provider will decide if a biopsy is needed.\nTreatment\nGetting prompt treatment can help prevent severe problems such as blindness or stroke.\nWhen giant cell arteritis is suspected, you will receive corticosteroids, such as prednisone, by mouth. These medicines are often started even before a biopsy is done. You may also be told to take aspirin.\nMost people begin to feel better within a few days after starting treatment. The dose of corticosteroids will be cut back very slowly. However, you will need to take medicine for 1 to 2 years.\nIf the diagnosis of giant cell arteritis is made, in most people a biologic medicine called tocilizumab will be added. This medicine reduces the amount of corticosteroids needed to control the disease.\nLong-term treatment with corticosteroids can make bones thinner and increase your chance of a fracture."}
