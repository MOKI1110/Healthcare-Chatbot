It can occur after you have gone through an extreme emotional trauma that involved the threat of injury or death.\nCauses\nHealth care providers do not know why traumatic events cause PTSD in some people, but not in others. Your genes, emotions, and family setting may all play roles. Past emotional trauma may increase your risk of PTSD after a recent traumatic event.\nWith PTSD, the body's response to a stressful event is changed. Normally, after the event, the body recovers. The stress hormones and chemicals the body releases due to the stress go back to normal levels. For some reason in a person with PTSD, the body keeps releasing the stress hormones and chemicals.\nPTSD can occur at any age. It can occur after events such as:\nAssault\nCar accidents\nDomestic abuse\nNatural disasters\nPrison stay\nSexual assault\nTerrorism\nWar\nSymptoms\nThere are 4 types of PTSD symptoms:\n1."}

They can help you manage your PTSD symptoms. They will also guide you as you work through your feelings about the trauma.\nThere are many types of talk therapy. One type that is often used for PTSD is called desensitization. During therapy, you are encouraged to remember the traumatic event and express your feelings about it. Over time, memories of the event become less frightening.\nDuring talk therapy, you may also learn ways to relax, such as when you start to have flashbacks.\nMEDICINES\nYour provider may suggest that you take medicines. They can help ease your\ndepression\nor anxiety. They can also help you sleep better. Medicines need time to work. Do not stop taking them or change the amount (dosage) you take without talking to your provider. Ask your provider about possible side effects and what to do if you experience them.\nSupport Groups\nSupport groups, whose members are people who have similar experiences with PTSD, can be helpful."}
