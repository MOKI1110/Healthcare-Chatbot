Child-proofing the home is very important at this new stage. Install window guards, gates on stairways, cabinet locks, toilet seat locks, electric outlet covers, and other safety features to keep the child safe.\nPut the toddler in car seat when riding in a car.\nDo not leave a toddler alone for even short periods of time. Remember, more accidents occur during the toddler years than at any other stage of childhood.\nMake clear rules about not playing in streets or crossing without an adult.\nFalls are a major cause of injury.

Keep gates or doors to stairways closed. Use guards for all windows above the ground floor. Do not leave chairs or ladders in areas that are likely to tempt the toddler. They may try to climb up to explore new heights. Use corner guards on furniture in areas where the toddler is likely to walk, play, or run.\nPoisoning is a common cause of toddler illness and death. Keep all medicines in a locked cabinet. Keep all toxic household products (polishes, acids, cleaning solutions, chlorine bleach, lighter fluid, insecticides, or poisons) in a locked cabinet or closet. Many household and garden plants, such as toad stools, may cause serious illness or death if eaten. Ask your child's provider for a list of common poisonous plants.\nIf there is a firearm in the house, keep it unloaded and locked in a secure place.\nKeep toddlers away from the kitchen with a safety gate. Place them in a playpen or high chair while you work. This will eliminate the danger of burns.\nNever leave a child unattended near a pool, open toilet, or bathtub."}

A toddler may drown, even in shallow water in a bathtub. Parent-child swimming lessons can be a safe and enjoyable way for toddlers to play in water. Toddlers cannot learn how to swim by themselves and should not be on their own near water.\nPARENTING TIPS\nToddlers need to learn accepted rules of behavior. Be regular both in modeling behavior (behaving the way you want your child to behave) and in pointing out inappropriate behavior in the child. Reward good behavior. Give them time-outs for bad behavior, or for going beyond the set limits.\nThe toddler's favorite word may seem to be \"No!!!\" Do not fall into a pattern of bad behavior. Do not use yelling, spanking, and threats to discipline the child.\nTeach children the proper names of body parts.\nStress the unique, individual qualities of the child.\nTeach the concepts of please, thank you, and sharing with others.\nRead to the child regularly. This will help develop verbal skills.\nRegularity is the key."}

Let them have regular nap, bed, snack, and meal times.\nToddlers should not be allowed to eat many snacks throughout the day. Too many snacks can take away the desire to eat regular nutritious meals.\nTraveling with a toddler or having guests at the house can disrupt the child's routine. This may make the child more irritable. In these situations, reassure the child and try to get back to a routine in a calm way.\nImages\nToddler development\nReferences\nBeck BM, Nwora C.
