Over-the-counter means that they can be purchased without a prescription.\nInformation\nSpermicides and vaginal sponges do not work as well at preventing pregnancy as some other forms of birth control. However, using a spermicide or sponge is much better than not using birth control at all.\nSPERMICIDES\nSpermicides are chemicals that stop sperm from moving. They come as gels, foams, creams, or suppositories. They are inserted into the vagina before sex. You can buy spermicides in most drug and grocery stores.\nSpermicides alone do not work very well."}

About 15 pregnancies occur out of every 100 women who correctly use this method alone over 1 year.\nIf spermicides are not used correctly, the risk of pregnancy is more than 25 for every 100 women each year.\nUsing spermicides along with other methods, such as male or female condoms or the diaphragm, will reduce the chance of pregnancy even more.\nEven by using a spermicide alone, however, you are still much less likely to become pregnant than if you did not use any birth control.\nHow to use spermicide:\nUsing your fingers or applicator, place the spermicide deep into the vagina 10 minutes before having sex. It should continue to work for about 60 minutes.\nYou will need to use more spermicide every time you have sex.\nDO NOT douche for at least 6 hours after sex. (Douching is never recommended, as it can cause infection in the uterus and tubes.)\nSpermicides do not reduce your chance of an infection."}
