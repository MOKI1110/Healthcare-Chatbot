It occurs when your body's immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue (autoimmune disorder), mainly in the digestive tract.\nWhen parts of the digestive tract remain swollen or inflamed, the walls of the intestines become thickened.\nFactors that may play a role in Crohn disease include:\nYour genes and family history. (People who are white or of Eastern European Jewish descent are at a higher risk."}

It mostly begins in people between ages 15 and 35. But recently Crohn disease has been increasing in the older population, too.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms depend on the part of the digestive tract involved. Symptoms range from mild to severe, and can come and go, with periods of flare-ups.\nThe main symptoms of Crohn disease are:\nCrampy pain in the abdomen (belly area).\nFever.\nFatigue\n.\nLoss of appetite and weight loss.\nFeeling that you need to pass stools, even though your bowels are already empty (\ntenesmus\n)."}

Treating the IBD is the key to making diarrhea and other symptoms better.\nOther medicines to help with symptoms include:\nFiber supplements, such as psyllium powder (Metamucil) or methylcellulose (Citrucel). Ask your provider before taking these products or laxatives.\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) for mild pain. Avoid medicines such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), or naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) which can make your symptoms worse.\nYour provider may also prescribe medicines to help control Crohn disease:\nAminosalicylates (5-ASAs) are medicines that help control mild to moderate symptoms.
