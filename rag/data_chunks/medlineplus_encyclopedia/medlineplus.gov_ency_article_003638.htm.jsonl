It is commonly called a \"sed rate.\"\nIt is a test that indirectly measures the level of certain proteins in the blood. This measurement correlates with the amount of inflammation in the body.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. Most of the time, blood is\ndrawn from a vein\nlocated on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. The blood sample is sent to a lab.\nThe test measures how fast red blood cells (called erythrocytes) fall to the bottom of a tall, thin tube.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere are no special steps needed to prepare for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted."}
