Of these,\nfrostbite\nis the most common freezing injury. Nonfreezing injuries that occur from exposure to cold wet conditions include trench foot and immersion foot conditions. Chilblains (also known as pernio) are small, itchy or painful lumps on the skin that often occur on the fingers, ears, or toes. They are a type of nonfreezing injury that develops in cold, dry conditions.\nYou are more likely to develop hypothermia if you are:\nVery old or very young\nChronically ill, especially people who have heart or blood flow problems\nMalnourished\nOverly tired\nTaking certain prescription medicines\nUnder the influence of alcohol or drugs\nCauses\nHypothermia occurs when more heat is lost than the body can make."}

In most cases, it occurs after long periods in the cold.\nCommon causes include:\nBeing outside without enough protective clothing, especially in winter\nFalling into cold water of a lake, river, or other body of water\nWearing wet clothing in windy or cold weather\nHeavy exertion, not drinking enough fluids, or not eating enough in cold weather\nSymptoms\nAs a person develops hypothermia, they slowly lose the ability to think and move. In fact, they may even be unaware that they need emergency treatment. Someone with hypothermia also is likely to have frostbite.\nThe symptoms include:\nConfusion\nDrowsiness\nPale and cold skin\nSlowed breathing or heart rate\nShivering that cannot be controlled (although at extremely low body temperatures, shivering may stop)\nWeakness and loss of coordination\nLethargy (weakness and sleepiness),\ncardiac arrest\n,\nshock\n, and coma can set in without prompt treatment."}

Hypothermia can be fatal.\nFirst Aid\nTake the following steps if you think someone has hypothermia:\nIf the person has any symptoms of hypothermia that are present, especially confusion or problems thinking, call 911 or the local emergency number right away.\nIf the person is\nunconscious\n, check airway, breathing, and circulation. If necessary, begin rescue breathing or\nCPR\n. If the victim is breathing fewer than 6 breaths per minute, begin rescue breathing.\nTake the person inside to room temperature and cover with warm blankets. If going indoors is not possible, get the person out of the wind and use a blanket to provide insulation from the cold ground. Cover the person's head and neck to help retain body heat. If nothing else is available, natural material such as a thick layer of tree branches, pine needles, or leaves can help provide insulation from the ground.\nVictims of severe hypothermia should be removed from the cold environment with as little exertion as possible."}

This helps to avoid warmth from being shunted from the person's core to the muscles. In a very mildly hypothermic person, muscular exercise is thought to be safe, however.\nOnce inside, remove any wet or tight clothes and replace them with dry, loose clothing.  Cover the person with warm blankets if available.\nWarm the person. If necessary, use your own body heat to aid the warming. Apply warm compresses to the neck, chest wall, and groin. If the person is alert and can easily swallow, give warm, sweetened, nonalcoholic fluids to aid the warming.\nStay with the person until medical help arrives.\nDO NOT\nFollow these precautions:\nDo not assume that someone found lying motionless in the cold is already dead.\nDo not use direct heat (such as hot water, a heating pad, or a heat lamp) to warm the person.\nDo not give the person alcohol.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall 911 or the local emergency number anytime you suspect someone has hypothermia."}

Drink plenty of fluids and get enough food and rest.\nWear proper clothing in cold temperatures to protect your body.
