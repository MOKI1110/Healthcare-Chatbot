This type of treatment does not target the entire breast, rather just part of the breast. This includes the area around where the original cancer was located, sparing some normal tissue.\nA standard course of whole breast directed external beam breast treatment takes 3 to 6 weeks. Partial breast radiation therapy can be accelerated (APBI) and accomplished in as little as 1 to 2 weeks. APBI targets a high dose of radiation only on or near the area where the breast tumor was removed."}

APBI targets a high dose of radiation only on or near the area where the breast tumor was removed. It avoids exposing the surrounding tissue to radiation.\nThere are three common approaches for APBI:\nExternal beam, the topic of this article\nBrachytherapy\n(inserting radioactive sources into the breast)\nIntraoperative radiation (delivering radiation at the time of surgery in the operating room)\nDescription\nRadiation therapy is usually delivered on an outpatient basis, except for intraoperative radiation therapy.\nTwo common techniques are used for partial breast external beam radiation treatment:\nThree dimensional conformal external beam radiation (3DCRT)\nIntensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT)\nBefore you have any radiation treatment, you will meet with the radiation oncologist. This person is a doctor who specializes in radiation therapy.\nThe doctor will put small alignment marks on your skin. These marks ensure that you are correctly positioned during your treatments.\nThese marks will either be ink marks or a permanent tattoo."}

It may sometimes be given twice a day (usually with 4 to 6 hours between sessions).\nDuring each treatment session you will lie on a special table, either on your back or your stomach.\nThe technicians will position you so the radiation targets the treatment area.\nYou may be asked to hold your breath while the radiation is being delivered. This helps limit how much radiation your heart receives.\nMost often, you will receive radiation treatment for between 1 and 5 minutes. You will be in and out of the cancer center within 15 to 20 minutes on average.\nYou are not radioactive after these radiation treatments.

Therefore, in some cases, the whole breast may not need to receive radiation. Partial breast irradiation only treats some, but not all of the breast, focusing on the area where the cancer is most likely to return, usually around the surgical cavity. The thinking is that by sparing some normal tissue, it will lower the risk of side effects.\nAPBI is used to prevent breast cancer from coming back. When radiation therapy is given after breast-conserving surgery, it is called adjuvant (additional) radiation therapy.\nAPBI may be given after\nlumpectomy\nor partial\nmastectomy\n(called breast-conserving surgery) for:\nDuctal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)\nStage I or II breast cancer\nBefore the Procedure\nTell your health care provider what medicines you are taking.\nWear loose fitting clothes to the treatments.\nAfter the Procedure\nRadiation therapy can also damage or kill healthy cells.

The death of healthy cells can lead to side effects. These side effects depend on the dose of radiation and how often you have the therapy. Radiation can have short-term (acute) or long-term (later) side effects.\nShort-term side effects can begin within days or weeks after treatment begins. Most side effects of this type go away within 4 to 6 weeks after treatment ends. The most common short-term effects include:\nBreast redness, tenderness, sensitivity\nBreast swelling or edema\nBreast infection (rare)\nLong-term side effects may begin months or years after treatment and may include:\nDecreased breast size\nIncreased firmness of the breast\nSkin redness and discoloration\nIn rare cases, rib fractures, heart problems (more likely for left breast radiation), or lung inflammation (called pneumonitis) or scar tissue affecting breathing\nThe development of a second cancer in the breast or chest years or even decades later\nArm swelling (edema) -- more common if lymph nodes were surgically removed and if the armpit area was treated with radiation\nYour"}
