Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMethylmalonic acidemia\nMethylmalonic acidemia\nMethylmalonic acidemia is a disorder in which the body cannot break down certain proteins and fats. The result is a buildup of a substance called methylmalonic acid in the blood. This condition is passed down through families.\nIt is one of several conditions called an \"inborn error of metabolism.\"\nCauses\nThe disease is most often diagnosed in the first year of life. It is an autosomal recessive disorder. This means the defective gene must be passed onto the child from both parents.\nA newborn with this rare condition may die before it is ever diagnosed. Methylmalonic acidemia affects boys and girls equally.\nSymptoms\nBabies may appear normal at birth, but develop symptoms once they start eating more protein, which can cause the condition to get worse."}

The disease can cause seizures and stroke.\nSymptoms include:\nBrain disease that gets worse (progressive encephalopathy)\nDehydration\nDevelopmental delays\nFailure to thrive\nLethargy\nSeizures\nVomiting\nExams and Tests\nTesting for methylmalonic acidemia is often done as part of a\nnewborn screening exam\n. The United States Department of Health and Human Services recommends screening for this condition at birth because early detection and treatment is helpful.\nTests that may be done to diagnose this condition include:\nBlood ammonia test\nBlood gases\nComplete blood count\nCT scan\nor\nMRI of the brain\nElectrolyte levels\nGenetic testing\nMethylmalonic acid blood test\nPlasma amino acid test\nTreatment\nTreatment consists of cobalamin and carnitine supplements and a low-protein diet."}

The child's diet must be carefully controlled.\nIf supplements do not help, the health care provider may also recommend a diet that avoids substances called isoleucine, threonine, methionine, and valine.\nLiver or kidney transplantation (or both) have been shown to help some patients. These transplants provide the body with new cells that help breakdown methylmalonic acid normally.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nBabies may not survive their first episode of symptoms from this disease."}

Those who survive often have problems with the development of the nervous system, although normal cognitive development can occur.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nComa\nDeath\nKidney failure\nPancreatitis\nCardiomyopathy\nRecurrent infections\nHypoglycemia\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nSeek medical help right away if your child is having a seizure for the first time.\nSee a provider if your child has signs of:\nFailure-to-thrive\nDevelopmental delays\nPrevention\nA low-protein diet can help reduce the number of attacks. People with this condition should avoid those who are sick with contagious illnesses, such as colds and the flu.\nGenetic counseling may be helpful for couples with a family history of this disorder who wish to have a baby.\nSometimes, expanded newborn screening is done at birth, including screening for methylmalonic acidemia. You can ask your provider if your child had this screening.\nReferences\nGallagher RC, Enns GM, Cowan TM, Mendelsohn B, Packman S."}
