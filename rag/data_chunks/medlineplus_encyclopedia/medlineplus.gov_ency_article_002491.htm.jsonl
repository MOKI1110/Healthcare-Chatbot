It is in a class of substances called caustics. Ammonium hydroxide forms when ammonia dissolves in water. This article discusses poisoning from ammonium hydroxide.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\nPoisonous Ingredient\nAmmonium hydroxide is poisonous.\nWhere Found\nAmmonium hydroxide is found in many industrial products and cleaners. Some of these are flooring strippers, brick cleaners, and cements.\nAmmonium hydroxide can also release ammonia gas into the air.\nAmmonia alone (not ammonium hydroxide) can be found in many household items such as detergents, stain removers, bleaches, and dyes."}

Extensive damage to the mouth, throat, eyes, lungs, esophagus, nose, and stomach are possible.\nThe ultimate outcome depends on how severe the damage is. If the chemical was swallowed, damage to the esophagus and stomach continues to occur for several weeks. Infection and holes (perforation) may result, and surgery may be needed. Some people won't recover and death can occur weeks or months later.\nKeep all cleaning materials, caustics, and poisons in their original containers and out of reach of children.\nAlternative Names\nAqueous - ammonia\nReferences\nCohen DE."}
