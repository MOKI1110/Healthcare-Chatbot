Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nForeign object - swallowed\nForeign object - swallowed\nIf you swallow a foreign object, it can get stuck in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract from the esophagus (swallowing tube) to the colon (large intestine). This can lead to a blockage or tear in the GI tract.\nConsiderations\nChildren ages 6 months to 3 years are the age group most likely to swallow a foreign object.\nThese items may include coins, marbles, pins, pencil erasers, buttons, beads, or other small items or foods.\nAdults can also swallow foreign objects due to intoxication, mental illness, or\ndementia\n. Older adults who have swallowing problems may accidentally swallow their dentures. Construction workers often swallow small nails or screws, and tailors and dressmakers often swallow pins or buttons.\nCauses\nYoung children like to explore things with their mouths and may swallow an object on purpose or by accident. If the object passes through the food pipe and into the stomach without getting stuck, it will probably pass through the entire GI tract."}

If the object passes through the food pipe and into the stomach without getting stuck, it will probably pass through the entire GI tract. Objects will often pass through the GI tract within a week. In most cases, the object passes through without harming the person.\nHowever, sharp, pointed, or caustic objects such as batteries can cause serious problems, as can magnets and objects longer than 1 inch (in) or 2.5 centimeters (cm) in a small child or 2 in (5 cm) in an older child or adult.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nAbdominal pain\nChoking\nCoughing\nWheezing\nNoisy breathing\nNo breathing or breathing trouble (respiratory distress)\nChest, throat, or neck pain\nTurning blue, red, or white in the face\nDifficulty swallowing saliva\nSometimes, only minor symptoms are seen at first."}

This will take several days and may sometimes cause rectal or anal bleeding.\nA procedure called\nendoscopy\nmay be needed to confirm if the child has swallowed an object and to remove it. Endoscopy will be done if the object is long or sharp, or is a magnet or disk battery. It will also be done if the child has drooling, breathing difficulty, fever, vomiting, or pain.\nX-rays\nmay also be done.\nIn severe cases, surgery may be needed to remove the object.\nDO NOT\nDo not force feed infants who are crying or breathing rapidly."}

This may cause the baby to inhale liquid or solid food into their airway.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider, or call 911 or the local emergency number if you think a child has swallowed a foreign object.\nPrevention\nPreventive measures include:\nCut food into small pieces for young children. Teach them how to chew well.\nDiscourage talking, laughing, or playing while food is in the mouth.\nDo not give potentially dangerous foods such as hot dogs, whole grapes, nuts, popcorn, food with bones, or hard candy to children under age 3 years.\nKeep small objects out of the reach of young children.\nTeach children to avoid placing foreign objects into their noses and other body openings.\nAlternative Names\nForeign body ingestion\nReferences\nGoodloe JM, Soulek J.
