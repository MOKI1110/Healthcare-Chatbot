Dried apricots contain more potassium than fresh apricots.\nMilk, yogurt, and nuts are also good sources of potassium.\nAll meats (red meat and chicken) and fish, such as salmon, cod, flounder, and sardines provide some potassium as well.\nPeople with kidney problems, particularly those on dialysis, should not eat too many potassium-rich foods. Your health care provider will recommend a potassium-restricted diet if you need it.\nSide Effects\nHaving too much or too little potassium in your body can cause serious health problems.\nA low blood level of potassium is called\nhypokalemia\n. It can cause weak muscles, abnormal heart rhythms, and a slight rise in blood pressure. You may have hypokalemia if you:\nTake diuretics (water pills) to treat high blood pressure or heart failure\nTake too many laxatives\nHave severe or prolonged vomiting or diarrhea\nHave certain kidney or adrenal gland disorders\nToo much potassium in the blood is known as\nhyperkalemia\n."}
