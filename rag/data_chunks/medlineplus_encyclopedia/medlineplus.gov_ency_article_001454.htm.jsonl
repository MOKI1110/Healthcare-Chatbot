Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCreeping eruption\nCreeping eruption\nCreeping eruption is a human infection with dog or cat\nhookworm\nlarvae (immature worms).\nCauses\nHookworm eggs are found in the stool of infected dogs and cats. When the eggs hatch, the larvae can infest soil and vegetation.\nWhen you come into contact with this infested soil, the larvae can burrow into your skin. They cause an intense\ninflammatory response\nthat leads to a\nrash\nand severe itching.\nCreeping eruption is more common in countries with warm climates. In the United States, the Southeast has the highest rates of infection. The main risk factor for this disease is contact with damp, sandy soil that has been contaminated with infected cat or dog stool."}

The main risk factor for this disease is contact with damp, sandy soil that has been contaminated with infected cat or dog stool. More children than adults become infected.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of creeping eruption include:\nBlisters\nItching, may be more severe at night\nRaised, snakelike tracks in the skin that may spread over time, usually about 1 centimeter (cm) or less than one-half inch (in) per day, usually on the feet and legs (severe infections may cause several tracks)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can often diagnose this condition by looking at your skin. In rare cases, a\nskin biopsy\nis done to check for other conditions. In very rare cases, a blood test is done to see if you have increased\neosinophils\n(a type of white blood cell).\nTreatment\nAnti-parasitic medicines may be used to treat the infection.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nCreeping eruption often goes away by itself over weeks to months."}

Treatment with anti-parasitic medicines helps the infection go away more quickly.\nPossible Complications\nCreeping eruption may lead to these complications:\nBacterial skin infections caused by scratching\nSpread of the infection through the bloodstream to the lungs or small intestine (rare)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you or your child have skin sores that are:\nSnake-like\nItchy\nMoving from one area to another\nPrevention\nPublic sanitation and deworming of dogs and cats have decreased hookworm infestation in the United States.\nHookworm larvae often enter the body through bare feet, so wearing shoes in areas where hookworm infestations are known to occur helps prevent infection.\nAlternative Names\nParasite infection - hookworm;  Cutaneous larvae migrans; Zoonotic hookworm; Ancylostoma caninum; Ancylostoma braziliensis; Bunostomum phlebotomum; Uncinaria stenocephala\nImages\nHookworm - mouth of the organism\nHookworm - close-up of the organism\nHookworm - Ancyl"}
