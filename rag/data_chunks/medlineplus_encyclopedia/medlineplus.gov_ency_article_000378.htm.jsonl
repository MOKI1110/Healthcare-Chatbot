Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAddison disease\nAddison disease\nAddison disease is a disorder that causes the\nadrenal glands\nto not produce enough hormones.\nCauses\nThe adrenal glands are small hormone-releasing organs located on top of each kidney. They are made up of an outer portion, called the cortex, and an inner portion, called the medulla.\nThe cortex produces 3 hormones:\nGlucocorticoid hormones (such as cortisol) maintain sugar (glucose) control, blood pressure, decrease (suppress)\nimmune response\n, and help the body respond to stress.\nMineralocorticoid hormones (such as aldosterone) regulate sodium, water and potassium balance.\nSex hormones, androgens (male) and estrogens (female), affect sexual development and sex drive.\nAddison disease results from damage to the adrenal cortex."}

Always carry medical ID (card, bracelet, or necklace) that says you have adrenal insufficiency. The ID should also say the type of medicine and dosage you need in case of an emergency.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWith hormone therapy, many people with Addison disease are able to lead a nearly normal life.\nPossible Complications\nComplications can occur if you take too little or too much adrenal hormone.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nYou are unable to keep your medicine down due to vomiting.\nYou have stress such as infection, injury, trauma, or dehydration."}
