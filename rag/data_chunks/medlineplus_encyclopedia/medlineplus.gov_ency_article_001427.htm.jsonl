These problems cause a break in the flow of speech called disfluency.\nCauses\nStuttering usually affects children ages 2 to 5 years and is more common in boys. It may last for several weeks to several years.\nFor a small number of children, stuttering does not go away and may get worse. This is called developmental stuttering and it is the most common type of stuttering.\nStuttering tends to run in families. Genes that cause stuttering have been identified.\nThere is also evidence that stuttering may be a result of brain injuries, such as stroke or traumatic brain injuries.\nIn rare cases, stuttering is caused by emotional trauma (called psychogenic stuttering).\nStuttering persists into adulthood more in boys than in girls.\nSymptoms\nStuttering may start with repeating consonants (k, g, t). If stuttering becomes worse, words and phrases are repeated.\nLater, vocal spasms develop. There is a forced, almost explosive sound to speech."}

The provider will also check for:\nFluency of speech\nAny emotional stress\nAny underlying condition\nEffect of stuttering on daily life\nNo testing is usually necessary.
