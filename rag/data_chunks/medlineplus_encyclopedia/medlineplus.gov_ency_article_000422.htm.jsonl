It occurs when\nuric acid\nbuilds up in the blood and causes inflammation in the joints.\nAcute gout is a painful condition that often affects only one joint. Chronic gout is the repeated episodes of pain and inflammation. More than one joint may be affected.\nWatch this video about:\nGout\nCauses\nGout is caused by having higher-than-normal level of uric acid in your body. This may occur if:\nYour body makes too much uric acid\nYour body has a hard time getting rid of uric acid\nWhen uric acid builds up in the fluid around the joints (synovial fluid), uric acid crystals form. These crystals cause the joint to become inflamed, causing pain, swelling and warmth.\nThe exact cause is unknown. Gout may run in families. The problem is more common in men, in women after menopause, and people who drink alcohol."}

Gout may run in families. The problem is more common in men, in women after menopause, and people who drink alcohol. As people become older, gout becomes more common.\nThe condition may also develop in people with:\nDiabetes\nKidney disease\nObesity\nSickle cell anemia\nand other\nanemias\nLeukemia\nand other blood cancers\nGout may occur after taking medicines that interfere with the removal of uric acid from the body. People who take certain medicines, such as hydrochlorothiazide and other water pills, may have a higher level of uric acid in the blood.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of acute gout:\nIn most cases, only one or a few joints are affected. The big toe, knee, or ankle joints are most often affected. Sometimes many joints become swollen and painful.\nThe pain starts suddenly, often during the night. Pain is often severe, described as throbbing, crushing, or excruciating.\nThe joint appears warm and red. It is most often very tender and swollen (it hurts to put a sheet or blanket over it).\nThere may be a\nfever\n.\nThe attack may go away in a few days, but may return from time to time."}

It is most often very tender and swollen (it hurts to put a sheet or blanket over it).\nThere may be a\nfever\n.\nThe attack may go away in a few days, but may return from time to time. Additional attacks often last longer.\nThe pain and swelling most often go away after the first attack. Many people will have another attack in the next 6 to 12 months.\nSome people may develop chronic gout. This is also called gouty arthritis. This condition can lead to joint damage and loss of motion in the joints. People with chronic gout will have joint pain and other symptoms most of the time.\nDeposits of uric acid can form lumps below the skin around joints or other places such as the elbows, fingertips, and ears. The lump is called a tophus, from Latin, meaning a type of stone. Tophi (multiple lumps) can develop after a person has had gout for many years. These lumps may drain chalky material.\nExams and Tests\nTests that may be done include:\nSynovial fluid analysis\n(shows uric acid crystals)\nUric acid -- blood\nJoint x-rays\n(may be normal)\nSynovial biopsy\nUric acid -- urine\nA uric acid level in the blood over 7.2 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter) is high."}

But, not everyone with a high uric acid level has gout.\nTreatment\nTake medicines for gout as soon as you can if you have a new attack.\nTake nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or indomethacin when symptoms begin. Talk to your health care provider about the correct dose. You may need stronger doses for a few days.\nA prescription medicine called colchicine helps reduce pain, swelling, and inflammation.\nCorticosteroids (such as prednisone) can also be very effective. Corticosteroids can be injected into the joint or taken as a pill. Your provider may inject the inflamed joint with steroids to relieve the pain.\nWith attacks of gout in multiple joints an injectable medicine called anakinra (Kineret) may be used.\nThe pain often goes away within 12 hours of starting treatment."}

Most of the time, all pain is gone within 48 hours.\nYou may need to take daily medicines such as allopurinol (Zyloprim), febuxostat (Uloric) or probenecid (Benemid) to decrease the uric acid level in your blood. Additionally, an intravenous medicine called pegloticase (Kystexxa) is available for severe cases. Lowering the uric acid to less than 6 mg/dL is needed to prevent deposits of uric acid. If you have visible tophi, the uric acid should be lower than 5 mg/dL.\nYou may need these medicines if:\nYou have several attacks during the same year or your attacks are quite severe.\nYou have damage to joints.\nYou have tophi.\nYou have kidney disease or\nkidney stones\n.\nDiet and lifestyle changes may help prevent gouty attacks:\nDecrease alcohol, especially beer (some wine may be helpful).\nLose weight.\nExercise daily.\nLimit your intake of red meat and sugary beverages.\nChoose healthy foods, such as dairy products, vegetables, nuts, legumes, fruits (less sugary ones), and whole grains.\nCoffee and"}

However, the acute form of the disease may progress to chronic gout if the high uric acid is not treated adequately.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nChronic gouty arthritis.\nKidney stones.\nDeposits in the kidneys, leading to\nchronic kidney failure\n.\nHigh levels of uric acid in the blood are associated with increased risk for kidney disease. Studies are being done to find out whether lowering uric acid reduces the risk for kidney disease.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of acute gouty arthritis or if you develop tophi.\nPrevention\nYou may not be able to prevent gout, but you may be able to avoid things that trigger symptoms.
