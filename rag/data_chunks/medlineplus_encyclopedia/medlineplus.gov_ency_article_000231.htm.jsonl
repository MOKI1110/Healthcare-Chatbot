The esophagus is the tube food passes through as it goes from the mouth to the stomach.\nCauses\nWhen there is a hole in the esophagus, the contents of the esophagus can pass into the surrounding area in the chest (mediastinum). This often results in infection of the mediastinum (\nmediastinitis\n).\nThe most common cause of an esophageal perforation is injury during a medical procedure."}

Surgery will depend on the location and size of the perforation. If surgery is needed, it is best done within 24 hours.\nTreatment may include:\nFluids given through a vein (IV)\nIV antibiotics to prevent or treat infection\nDraining of fluid around the lungs with a chest tube\nMediastinoscopy\nto remove fluid that has collected in the area behind the breastbone and between the lungs (mediastinum)\nA stent may be placed in the esophagus if only a small amount of fluid has leaked.
