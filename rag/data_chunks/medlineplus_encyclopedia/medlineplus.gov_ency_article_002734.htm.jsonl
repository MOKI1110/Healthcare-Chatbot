The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\nSwallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Extensive damage to the mouth, throat, eyes, lungs, esophagus, nose, and stomach are possible.\nOutcome depends on the amount of damage. Damage continues to occur to the esophagus and stomach for several weeks after swallowing the poison. Perforation (holes) may develop in these organs, leading to serious bleeding and infection. Death may occur months later. Treatment may require removal of part of the esophagus and stomach.\nAlternative Names\nEpoxy poisoning; Resin poisoning\nReferences\nHoyte C. Caustics.
