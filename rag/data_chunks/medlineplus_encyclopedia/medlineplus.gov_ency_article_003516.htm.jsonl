Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nT-cell count\nT-cell count\nA T-cell count measures the number of T cells in the blood. Your health care provider may order this test if you have signs of a weak immune system, such as due to having HIV/AIDS.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample is needed\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nT cells are a type of lymphocyte. Lymphocytes are a type of white blood cell. They make up part of the immune system. T cells help the body fight diseases or harmful substances, such as bacteria or viruses.\nYour health care provider may order this test if you have signs of a weak immune system (\nimmunodeficiency disorder\n). It may also be ordered if you have a disease of the lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small glands that make some types of white blood cells."}

It may also be ordered if you have a disease of the lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small glands that make some types of white blood cells. The test is also used to monitor how well treatment for these types of diseases is working.\nOne type of T cell is the CD4 cell, or \"helper cell.\" People with HIV/AIDS have routine T-cell tests to check their CD4 cell counts. The results help your provider monitor the disease and its treatment.\nNormal Results\nNormal results vary depending on the type of T-cell tested.\nIn adults, a normal CD4 cell count ranges from 500 to 1,500 cells/mm\n3\n(0.50 to 1.50 cells/10\n9\n/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nHigher than normal T-cell levels may be due to:\nCancer, such as\nacute lymphocytic leukemia\nor\nmultiple myeloma\nInfections, such as\nhepatitis\nor\nmononucleosis\nLower than normal T-cell levels may be due to:\nAcute\nviral infections\nAging\nCancer\nImmune system diseases, such as HIV/AIDS\nRadiation therapy\nSteroid treatment\nRisks\nThere is very little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nBlood accumulating under the skin (hematoma)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nThis test is often performed on people with a weakened immune system."}
