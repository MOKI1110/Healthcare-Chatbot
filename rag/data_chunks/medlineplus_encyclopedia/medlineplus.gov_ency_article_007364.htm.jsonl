This means your child will be asleep and will not feel pain. Some or all of the hair will be shaved.\nThe standard surgery is called open repair. It includes these steps:\nThe most common place for a surgical cut to be made is over the top of the head, from just above one ear to just above the other ear. The cut is usually wavy. Where the cut is made depends on the specific problem.\nA flap of skin, tissue, and muscle below the skin, and the tissue covering the bone are loosened and raised up so the surgeon can see the bone.\nA strip of bone is usually removed where two sutures are fused. This is called a strip craniectomy. Sometimes, wider pieces of bone must also be removed. This is called synostectomy. Parts of these bones may be changed or reshaped when they are removed."}

Then, they may be put back in place. Other times, they are not.\nSometimes, bones that are left in place need to be shifted or moved.\nSometimes, the bones around the eyes are cut and reshaped.\nBones are fastened using small plates with screws that go into the skull. The plates and screws can be metal or a resorbable material (disappears over time). The plates may expand as the skull grows.\nSurgery usually takes 3 to 7 hours. Your child might need (36 to 70%) to have a\nblood transfusion\nduring or after surgery to replace blood that is lost during the surgery.\nA newer kind of surgery is used for some children. This type is usually done for children younger than 3 to 6 months old.\nThe surgeon makes one or two small cuts in the scalp. Most times, these cuts are each just 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) long. These cuts are made above the area where the bone needs to be removed.\nA tube (endoscope) is passed through the small cuts. The scope allows the surgeon to view the area being operated on."}

These cuts are made above the area where the bone needs to be removed.\nA tube (endoscope) is passed through the small cuts. The scope allows the surgeon to view the area being operated on. Special medical devices and a camera are passed through the endoscope. Using these devices, the surgeon removes portions of bones through the cuts.\nThis surgery usually takes about 1 to 2 hours. There is much less blood loss and a faster recovery with this kind of surgery.\nMost children need to wear a special helmet to protect their head for a period of time after surgery.\nChildren do best when they have this surgery when they are 3 months old. The surgery should be done before the child is 6 months old.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nA baby's head, or skull, is made up of eight different bones. The connections between these bones are called sutures. When a baby is born, it is normal for these sutures to be open a little. As long as the sutures are open, the baby's skull and brain can grow.\nCraniosynostosis is a condition that causes one or more of the baby's sutures to close too early. The suture becomes bone. This can cause the shape of your baby's head to be different than normal."}

This includes anything you bought without a prescription. You may be asked to stop giving your child some of these medicines in the days before the surgery.\nAsk the surgeon which medicines your child should still take on the day of the surgery.\nOn the day of the surgery:\nGive your child a small sip of water with any medicines your surgeon told you to give your child.\nYour child's surgeon will tell you when to arrive for the surgery.\nAsk your surgeon if your child can eat or drink before surgery. In general:\nOlder children should not eat any food or drink any milk after midnight before the operation. They can have clear juice, water, and breast milk up to 4 hours before surgery.\nInfants younger than 12 months can usually eat formula, cereal, or baby food until about 6 hours before surgery."}

Rinse your child well.\nAfter the Procedure\nAfter open (non-endoscopic)  surgery, your child will be taken to an intensive care unit (ICU). Your child will be moved to a regular hospital room after a day or two. Your child will stay in the hospital for 3 to 7 days.\nYour child will have a large bandage wrapped around the head. There will also be a tube going into a vein. This is called an\nIV\n.\nThe nurses will watch your child closely.\nTests will be done to see if your child lost too much blood during surgery. A blood transfusion will be given, if needed.\nYour child will have swelling and bruising around the eyes and face. Sometimes, the eyes may be swollen shut.
