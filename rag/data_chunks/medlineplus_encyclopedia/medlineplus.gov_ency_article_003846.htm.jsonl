Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFluorescein angiography\nFluorescein angiography\nFluorescein angiography is an eye test that uses a special dye and camera to look at blood flow in the\nretina\nand\nchoroid\n. These are the two layers in the back of the eye.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will be given eye drops that make your pupil dilate. You will be asked to place your chin on a chin rest and your forehead against a support bar to keep your head still during the test.\nThe health care provider will take pictures of the inside of your eye including the back of your eye (retina). After the first group of pictures is taken, a dye called fluorescein is injected into a vein. Most often it is injected at the inside of your elbow. A camera-like device takes pictures as the dye moves through the blood vessels in the back of your eye.\nA newer method called ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography can provide more information about certain diseases than regular fluorescein angiography.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will need someone to drive you home."}

Your vision may be blurry for up to 12 hours after the test.\nYou may be told to stop taking medicines that could affect the test results. Tell your provider about any allergies, particularly reactions to iodine.\nYou must sign an informed consent form. You must remove contact lenses before the test.\nTell the provider if you may be pregnant.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted, some people feel slight pain. Others feel only a prick or sting. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhen the dye is injected, you may have mild nausea and a warm feeling in your body. These symptoms go away quickly most of the time.\nThe dye will cause your urine to be temporarily darker."}

These symptoms go away quickly most of the time.\nThe dye will cause your urine to be temporarily darker. It may be orange in color for a day or two after the test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to see if there is proper blood flow in the blood vessels in the two layers in the back of your eye (the retina and choroid).\nIt can also be used to diagnose problems in the eye or to determine how well certain eye treatments are working.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means the vessels appear a normal size, there are no new abnormal vessels, and there are no blockages or leakages.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf blockage or leakage is present, the pictures will map the location for possible treatment.\nAn abnormal result of a fluorescein angiography may be due to:\nBlood flow (circulatory) problems, such as blockage of the arteries or veins\nCancer\nDiabetic or other retinopathy\nHigh blood pressure\nInflammation or\nedema\n(swelling)\nMacular degeneration\nMicroaneurysms -- enlargement of capillaries in the retina\nTumors\nSwelling of the optic disc\nThe test may also be done if you have:\nRetinal"}
