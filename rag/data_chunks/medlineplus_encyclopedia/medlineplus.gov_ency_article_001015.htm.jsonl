They are the most common reason why a person goes to see an eye professional.\nOther types of refractive errors are:\nFarsightedness\nNearsightedness\nCauses\nPeople are able to see because the front part of the eye bends (refracts) light and focuses it on the retina. This is the inside of the back surface of the eye.\nIf the light rays are not clearly focused on the retina, the images you see may be blurry.\nWith astigmatism, the cornea is abnormally curved. This curve causes vision to be out of focus.\nThe cause of astigmatism is unknown. It is most often present from birth. Astigmatism often occurs together with nearsightedness or farsightedness. If astigmatism gets worse, it may be a sign of\nkeratoconus\n.\nAstigmatism is very common."}

It sometimes occurs after certain types of eye surgery, such as\ncataract surgery\n.\nSymptoms\nAstigmatism makes it hard to see fine details, either close up or from a distance.\nExams and Tests\nAstigmatism is easily diagnosed by a\nstandard eye exam\nwith\nrefraction test\n. Special tests are not required in most cases.\nChildren or adults who cannot respond to a normal refraction test can have their refraction measured by a test that uses reflected light (retinoscopy).\nTreatment\nMild astigmatism may not need to be corrected.\nGlasses or contact lenses will correct astigmatism, but do not cure it.\nLaser surgery can help change the shape of the cornea surface to eliminate astigmatism, along with nearsightedness or farsightedness.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAstigmatism may change with time, requiring new glasses or contact lenses."}
