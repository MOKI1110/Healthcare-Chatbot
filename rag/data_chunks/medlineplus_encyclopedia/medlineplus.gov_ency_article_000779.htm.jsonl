Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCerebral arteriovenous malformation\nCerebral arteriovenous malformation\nA cerebral arteriovenous malformation (AVM) is an abnormal connection between the arteries and veins in the brain that usually forms before birth.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of cerebral AVM is unknown, however growing evidence suggests a genetic cause. An AVM occurs when arteries in the brain connect directly to nearby veins without having the normal small blood vessels (capillaries) between them.\nAVMs vary in size and location in the brain.\nAn AVM rupture occurs because of pressure and damage to the blood vessel. This allows blood to leak (hemorrhage) into the brain or surrounding tissues and reduces blood flow to the brain.\nCerebral AVMs are rare. Although the condition is present at birth, symptoms may occur at any age. Ruptures happen most often in people ages 15 to 20. It can also occur later in life."}

Although the condition is present at birth, symptoms may occur at any age. Ruptures happen most often in people ages 15 to 20. It can also occur later in life. Some people with an AVM also have\nbrain aneurysms\n.\nSymptoms\nIn about one half of people with AVMs, the first symptoms are those of a\nstroke\ncaused by bleeding in the brain.\nSymptoms of an AVM that is bleeding are:\nConfusion or disturbed sleep\nEar noise/buzzing\n(also called pulsatile tinnitus)\nHeadache\nin one or more parts of the head, may seem like a migraine\nProblems walking\nSeizures\nSymptoms due to pressure on one area of the brain include:\nVision problems\nDizziness\nMuscle weakness\nin an area of the body or face\nNumbness\nin an area of the body\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical examination. You'll be asked about your symptoms, with a focus on your nervous system problems."}

Your provider will discuss with you:\nThe risk that your AVM will break open (rupture). If this happens, there may be permanent brain damage.\nThe risk for any brain damage if you have one of the surgeries listed below.\nYour provider may discuss different factors that may increase your risk for bleeding, including:\nCurrent or planned pregnancies\nWhat the AVM looks like on imaging tests\nSize of the AVM\nYour age\nYour symptoms\nA bleeding AVM is a medical emergency. The goal of treatment is to prevent further complications by controlling the bleeding and seizures and, if possible, removing the AVM.\nThree surgical treatments are available."}

The goal of treatment is to prevent further complications by controlling the bleeding and seizures and, if possible, removing the AVM.\nThree surgical treatments are available. Some treatments are used together.\nOpen brain surgery removes the abnormal connection. The surgery is done through an opening made in the skull.\nEmbolization (\nendovascular treatment\n):\nA catheter is guided through a small cut in your groin or arm. It enters an artery and then goes into the small blood vessels in your brain where the AVM is located.\nA glue-like substance is injected into the abnormal vessels. This stops the blood flow in the AVM and reduces the risk of bleeding. This may be the first choice for some kinds of AVMs, or if surgery can't be done.\nStereotactic radiosurgery\n:\nRadiation is aimed directly on the area of the AVM. This causes scarring and shrinkage of the AVM and reduces the risk of bleeding.\nIt is particularly useful for small AVMs deep in the brain that are difficult to remove by surgery.\nMedicines to stop seizures are prescribed if needed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSome people, whose first symptom is excessive brain bleeding, will die."}

AVMs that do not cause symptoms by the time people reach their late 40s or early 50s are more likely to remain stable, and  in rare cases, cause symptoms.
