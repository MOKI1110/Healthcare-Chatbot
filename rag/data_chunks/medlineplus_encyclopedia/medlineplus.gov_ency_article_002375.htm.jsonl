Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy uses a special pressure chamber to increase the amount of oxygen in the blood.\nInformation\nSome hospitals have a hyperbaric chamber. Smaller units may be available in outpatient centers.\nThe air pressure inside a hyperbaric oxygen chamber is about two and a half times higher than the normal pressure in the atmosphere. This helps your blood carry more oxygen to organs and tissues in your body.\nThe other benefits of increased pressure of oxygen in the tissues may include:\nMore and improved oxygen supply\nReduction in swelling and edema\nStopping infection\nHyperbaric therapy can help wounds, particularly infected wounds, heal more quickly."}

A treatment session for more acute conditions such as decompression sickness may last longer, but may not need to be repeated.\nYou might feel pressure in your ears while you are in the hyperbaric chamber. Your ears may pop when you get out of the chamber. This is similar to what happens when you dive and come up or when you ascend and descend on the plane.\nReferences\nLipnick MS, Van Hoesen KB.
