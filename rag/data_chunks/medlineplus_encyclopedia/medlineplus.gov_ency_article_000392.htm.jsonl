It causes LDL (bad) cholesterol level to be very high. The condition begins at birth and can cause heart attacks at an early age.\nRelated topics include:\nFamilial combined hyperlipidemia\nFamilial hypertriglyceridemia\nFamilial dysbetalipoproteinemia\nCauses\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic disorder. It is caused by a gene variant on chromosome 19.\nThe defect makes the body unable to remove low density lipoprotein (LDL, or bad) cholesterol from the blood. This results in a high level of LDL in the blood. This makes you more likely to have narrowing of the arteries from\natherosclerosis\nat an early age. The condition is typically passed down through families in an\nautosomal dominant\nmanner. That means you only need to get the abnormal gene from one parent in order to inherit the disease.\nIn rare cases, a child may inherit the gene from both parents."}

When this occurs, the increase in cholesterol level is much more severe. The risk for heart attacks and heart disease are high, even in childhood.\nSymptoms\nIn the early years there may be no symptoms.\nSymptoms that may occur include:\nFatty skin deposits called xanthomas over parts of the hands, elbows, knees, ankles and around the cornea of the eye\nCholesterol deposits in the eyelids (xanthelasmas)\nChest pain (\nangina\n) or other signs of\ncoronary artery disease\nmay be present at a young age\nCramping of one or both calves when walking\nSores on the toes that do not heal\nSudden stroke-like symptoms such as trouble speaking, drooping on one side of the face, weakness of an arm or leg, and loss of balance\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam may show fatty skin growths called\nxanthomas\nand cholesterol deposits in the eye (corneal arcus).\nThe  health care provider  will ask questions about your personal and family medical history."}

People who get only one copy of the defective gene from their parents may do well with diet changes and statin drugs.\nLIFESTYLE CHANGES\nThe first step is to\nchange what you eat\n.

Most of the time, the provider will recommend that you try this for several months before prescribing medicines. Diet changes include lowering the amount of fat you eat so that it is less than 30% of your total calories. If you are overweight, losing weight is very helpful.\nHere are some ways to cut saturated fat out of your diet:\nEat less beef, chicken, pork, and lamb\nReplace full-fat dairy products with low-fat products\nEliminate trans fats\nYou can lower the amount of cholesterol you eat by eliminating egg yolks and organ meats such as liver.\nIt may help to talk to a dietitian who can give you advice about changing your eating habits. Weight loss and regular exercise may also help lower your cholesterol level.\nMEDICINES\nIf lifestyle changes do not change your cholesterol level, your provider may recommend that you take medicines. There are several types of drugs available to help lower blood cholesterol level, and they work in different ways. Some are better at lowering LDL cholesterol, some are good at lowering triglycerides, while others help raise HDL cholesterol."}

Making diet changes, exercising, and taking your medicines correctly can lower cholesterol level. These changes can help delay a heart attack, especially for people with a milder form of the disorder.\nMen and women with familial hypercholesterolemia typically are at increased risk of early heart attacks.\nThe risk of death varies among people with familial hypercholesterolemia.
