Here are some tips:\nAsk your veterinarian for information about infections that you might get from your pets.\nHave your veterinarian check all of your pets for these infectious diseases, if testing is available.\nWash your hands thoroughly after handling or touching your pet, cleaning the litter box, or disposing of pet feces. Always wash your hands before you eat, prepare food, take medicines, or smoke.\nKeep your pet clean and healthy.

Neutered animals are less likely to roam, and therefore less likely to get diseases.\nBring your pet to a veterinarian if the animal has diarrhea, is coughing and sneezing, has decreased appetite, or has lost weight.\nTips if you have a dog or cat:\nHave your cat tested for the feline leukemia and feline immunodeficiency viruses. Although these viruses do not spread to humans, they affect the cat's immune system. This puts your cat at risk of other infections that may be spread to humans.\nFeed your pet only commercially prepared food and treats. Animals can get sick from undercooked or raw meat or eggs. Cats can get infections, such as toxoplasmosis, by eating wild animals.\nDo not let your pet drink from the toilet. Several infections can be spread this way.\nKeep your pet's nails short. You should avoid rough play with your cat, as well as any situation where you could get scratched."}

Cats can spread\nBartonella henselae\n, the organism responsible for cat scratch disease.\nTake measures to prevent flea or tick infestations. Several bacterial and viral infections are spread by fleas and ticks. Dogs and cats can use flea collars. Permethrin-treated bedding can decrease the risk of flea and tick infestations.\nIn rare cases, dogs can spread a condition called kennel cough to people with a weakened immune system. If possible, do not place your dog in a boarding kennel or other high-risk environment.\nIf you have a cat litter box:\nKeep your cat's litter box away from eating areas. Use disposable pan liners so that the entire pan can be cleaned with each litter change.\nIf possible, have someone else change the litter pan. If you must change the litter, wear rubber gloves and a disposable face mask.\nThe litter should be scooped daily to prevent the risk of toxoplasmosis infection."}

They often carry rare but serious diseases.\nReptiles carry a type of bacteria called salmonella. If you own a reptile, wear gloves when handling the animal or its feces because salmonella is easily passed from animal to human.\nWear rubber gloves when handling or cleaning fish tanks.\nFor more information about pet-related infections, contact your veterinarian or the Humane Society in your area.\nAlternative Names\nAIDS patients and pets; Bone marrow and organ transplant patients and pets; Chemotherapy patients and pets\nImages\nImmune system structures\nReferences\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention website.
