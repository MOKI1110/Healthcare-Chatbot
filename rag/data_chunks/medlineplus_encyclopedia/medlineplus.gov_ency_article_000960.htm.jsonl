The sac comes through a hole or weak area in the strong layer of the belly wall that surrounds the muscle. This layer is called the fascia.\nWhich type of hernia you have depends on where it is:\nFemoral hernia\nis a bulge in the upper thigh, just below the groin. This type is more common in women than men.\nHiatal hernia\noccurs in the diaphragm muscle that separates the chest and abdomen. Part of the upper stomach pushes into the chest.\nIncisional hernia\ncan occur through a scar if you have had abdominal surgery in the past.\nUmbilical hernia\nis a bulge around the belly button. Most often it occurs when the muscle around the belly button does not close completely after birth.\nInguinal hernia\nis a bulge in the groin. It is more common in men. It may go all the way down into the scrotum.\nCauses\nUsually, there is no clear cause of a hernia."}

Some people have a family history of hernias.\nBabies and children can get hernias. It happens when there is weakness in the belly wall. Inguinal hernias are common in boys. Some children do not have symptoms until they are adults.\nAny activity or medical problem that increases pressure on the tissue in the belly wall and muscles may lead to a hernia, including:\nLong-term (chronic) constipation and pushing hard (straining) to have a bowel movement\nChronic coughing or sneezing\nCystic fibrosis\nEnlarged prostate\n, straining to urinate\nExtra weight\nFluid in the abdomen (\nascites\n)\nPeritoneal dialysis\nPoor nutrition\nSmoking\nOverexertion\nUndescended testicles\nSymptoms\nThere are usually no symptoms other than a visible bulge.

Some people have discomfort or pain. The discomfort may be worse when standing, straining, or lifting heavy objects. In time, the most common complaint is a bump that is sore and growing.\nWhen a hernia gets bigger, the small intestine inside it may get stuck in the hole and lose its blood supply. This is called strangulation. This causes pain and swelling at the site of strangulation. Symptoms may include:\nNausea and vomiting\nNot being able to pass gas or have bowel movements\nWhen this occurs, surgery is needed right away.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can usually see or feel a hernia when you are examined. You may be asked to cough, bend, push, or lift."}

Surgery may be more risky for people with serious medical problems.\nSurgery repairs the weakened abdominal wall tissue (fascia) and closes any holes. Most hernias are closed with stitches and sometimes with mesh patches to plug the hole.\nAn umbilical hernia that does not heal on its own by the time a child is 5 years old will likely be repaired.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome for most hernias is usually good with treatment. It is rare for a hernia to come back."}
