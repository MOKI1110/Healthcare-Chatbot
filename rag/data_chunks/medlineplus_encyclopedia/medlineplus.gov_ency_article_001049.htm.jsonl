This gives it a map-like appearance.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of geographic tongue is unknown. It may be due to irritation from hot or spicy foods, or alcohol. The condition appears to be less common in smokers.\nThe change in pattern on the surface of the tongue occurs when there is a loss of the tiny, finger-like projections, called papillae, on the tongue. These areas look flat as a result. The appearance of the tongue may change very quickly. The flat-looking areas may remain for more than a month.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nMap-like appearance to the surface of the tongue\nPatches that move from day to day\nSmooth, red patches and sores (lesions) on the tongue\nSoreness and burning pain (in some cases)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will diagnose this condition by looking at your tongue. Most of the time, tests are not needed.\nTreatment\nNo treatment is needed."}
