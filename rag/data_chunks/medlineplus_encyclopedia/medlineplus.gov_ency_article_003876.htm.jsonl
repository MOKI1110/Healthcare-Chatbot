Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCoronary angiography\nCoronary angiography\nCoronary angiography is a procedure that uses a special dye (contrast material) and x-rays to see how blood flows through the arteries in your heart.\nHow the Test is Performed\nCoronary angiography is sometimes performed with cardiac\ncatheterization\n.\nBefore the test starts, you may be given a mild sedative to help you relax.\nAn area of your body (the arm or groin) is cleaned and numbed with a local numbing medicine (anesthetic). The cardiologist passes a thin hollow tube, called a catheter, through an artery and carefully moves it up into the heart. X-ray images help the doctor position the catheter.\nOnce the catheter is in place, dye (contrast material) is injected into the catheter. X-ray images are taken to see how the dye moves through the artery. The dye helps highlight any blockages in blood flow.\nThe procedure most often lasts 30 to 60 minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou should not eat or drink anything for 8 hours before the test starts.\nYou will wear a hospital gown."}

You must sign a consent form before the test. Your health care provider will explain the procedure and its risks.\nTell your provider if you:\nAre allergic to any medicines or if you have had a bad reaction to contrast material in the past\nAre taking sildenafil (Viagra), Avanafil (Stendra), tadalafil (Cialis) or other medicines from this class\nMight be pregnant\nHow the Test will Feel\nIn most cases, you will be awake during the test. You may feel some pressure at the site where the catheter is placed.\nYou may feel a flushing or warm sensation after the dye is injected.\nAfter the test, the catheter is removed. You might feel a firm pressure being applied at the insertion site to prevent bleeding. If the catheter is placed in your groin, you will be asked to lie flat on your back for a few hours to several hours after the test to avoid bleeding."}

This may cause some mild back discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nCoronary angiography may be done if:\nYou have angina for the first time.\nYou have angina that is becoming worse, not going away, occurring more often, or happening at rest (called\nunstable angina\n).\nYou have\naortic stenosis\nor another heart valve problem.\nYou have atypical chest pain, when other tests are normal.\nYou had an abnormal\nheart stress test\n.\nYou are going to have surgery on your heart and you are at high risk for coronary artery disease.\nYou have\nheart failure\n.\nYou have been diagnosed as having a heart attack.\nNormal Results\nThere is a normal supply of blood to the heart and no blockages.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result may mean you have a blocked artery. The test can show how many coronary arteries are blocked, where they are blocked, and the severity of the blockages.\nRisks\nCardiac catheterization carries a slightly increased risk when compared with other heart tests."}

However, the test is very safe when performed by an experienced team.\nGenerally, the risk for serious complications ranges from 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 500. Risks of the procedure include the following:\nCardiac tamponade\nIrregular heartbeats\nInjury to a heart artery\nLow blood pressure\nAllergic reaction to contrast dye or a medicine administered during the exam\nStroke\nHeart attack\nConsiderations associated with any type of catheterization include the following:\nIn general, there is a risk for bleeding, infection, and pain at the IV or catheter site.\nThere is a very small risk that the soft plastic catheters could damage the blood vessels or surrounding structures.\nBlood clots could form on the catheters and later block blood vessels elsewhere in the body.\nThe contrast dye could damage the kidneys (particularly in people with diabetes or prior kidney problems).\nConsiderations\nIf a blockage is found, your cardiologist may perform a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) to open the blockage."}
