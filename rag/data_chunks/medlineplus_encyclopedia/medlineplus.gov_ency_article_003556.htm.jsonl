Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nThyroid peroxidase antibody\nThyroid peroxidase antibody\nThyroid peroxidase is a type of protein (called an\nenzyme\n) that cells in the thyroid gland use to make thyroid hormone. If these enzymes leak out into the bloodstream (as when thyroid cells are damaged) the immune system makes\nantibodies\nagainst these proteins. The thyroid peroxidase antibody test measures these antibodies in the blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to confirm the cause of thyroid problems, including\nHashimoto thyroiditis\n.\nThe test is also used to find out if an immune or\nautoimmune disorder\nis damaging the thyroid.\nNormal Results\nA negative test means the result is normal.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}

Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA positive test may be due to:\nGranulomatous or subacute thyroiditis\n(an immune reaction of the thyroid gland that often follows an upper respiratory infection)\nHashimoto thyroiditis (a reaction of the immune system against the thyroid gland)\nHigh levels of these antibodies have also been linked with an increased risk of:\nMiscarriage\nPreeclampsia\n(high blood pressure and protein in the urine after the 20th week of pregnancy)\nPremature birth\nIn vitro fertilization\nfailure\nImportant: A positive result does not always mean that you have a thyroid condition or that you need treatment for your thyroid. A positive result may mean that you have a higher chance of developing thyroid disease in the future."}
