It measures substances (proteins) called\nantibodies\nthat are present in the blood of people who may have the disease.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample is needed\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is usually needed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe RPR test can be used to screen for syphilis. It is used to screen people who have symptoms of sexually transmitted infections and is routinely used to screen pregnant women for the disease.\nThe test is also used to see how treatment for syphilis is working. After treatment with antibiotics, the levels of syphilis antibodies should fall. These levels can be monitored with another RPR test."}

After treatment with antibiotics, the levels of syphilis antibodies should fall. These levels can be monitored with another RPR test. Unchanged or rising levels can mean a persistent infection.\nThe test is similar to the\nvenereal disease research laboratory\n(VDRL) test.\nNormal Results\nA negative test result is considered normal. However, the body does not always produce antibodies specifically in response to the syphilis bacteria, so the test is not always accurate. False-negatives may occur in people with early- and late-stage syphilis. More testing may be needed before ruling out syphilis.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA positive test result may mean that you have syphilis. If the screening test is positive, the next step is to confirm the diagnosis with a more specific test for syphilis, such as\nFTA-ABS\n. The FTA-ABS test will help distinguish between syphilis and other infections or conditions.\nHow well the RPR test can detect syphilis depends on the stage of the infection. The test is most sensitive (almost 100%) during the middle (secondary and latent) stages of syphilis."}

Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nRapid plasma reagin test; Syphilis screening test\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nRadolf JD, Tramont EC, Salazar JC.
