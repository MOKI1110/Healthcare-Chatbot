Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMeckel diverticulectomy\nMeckel diverticulectomy\nMeckel diverticulectomy is surgery to remove an abnormal pouch of the lining of the small intestine (bowel). This pouch is called a\nMeckel diverticulum\n.\nDescription\nYou will receive\ngeneral anesthesia\nbefore surgery. This will make you sleep and unable to feel pain.\nIf you have open surgery:\nYour surgeon will make a large surgical cut in your belly to open up the area.\nYour surgeon will look at the small intestine in the area where the pouch or diverticulum is located.\nYour surgeon will remove the diverticulum from the wall of your intestine.\nYour surgeon will close the defect in the intestine with sutures or staples.\nSometimes, the surgeon may need to remove a small part of your intestine along with the diverticulum. If this is done, the open ends of your intestine will be sewn or stapled back together. This procedure is called an\nanastomosis\n.\nSurgeons can also do this surgery using a laparoscope. The laparoscope is an instrument that looks like a small telescope with a light and a video camera."}

It is inserted into your belly through a small cut. Video from the camera appears on a monitor in the operating room. This allows the surgeon to view inside your belly during surgery.\nIn surgery using a laparoscope:\nThree to five small cuts are made in your belly. The camera and other small tools will be inserted through these cuts.\nYour surgeon may also make a cut that is 2 to 3 inches (5 to 7.6 centimeters) long to put a hand through, if needed.\nYour belly will be filled with gas to allow the surgeon to see the area and perform the surgery with more room to work.\nThe diverticulum is operated on as described above.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nTreatment is needed to prevent:\nBleeding\nBowel obstruction\n(a blockage in your intestine)\nInfection\nInflammation\nThe most common symptom of Meckel diverticulum is painless bleeding from the rectum."}
