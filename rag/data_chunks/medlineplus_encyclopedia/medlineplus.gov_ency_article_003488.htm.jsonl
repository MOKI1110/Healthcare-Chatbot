This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may recommend this test if you have:\nSigns of low iron (iron deficiency)\nSigns of too much iron\nAnemia caused by a chronic disease\nNormal Results\nNormal value range is:\nIron: Males: 50 to 150 mcg/dL (8.95 to 26.85 micromol/L); Females: 35 to 145 mcg/dL (6.26 to 25.95 micromol/L)\nTotal iron binding capacity\n(TIBC):  Males: 171 to 505 mcg/dL (30.6 to 90.3 micromol/L); Females: 149 to 492 mcg/dL (26.7 to 88.0 micromol/L)\nIron saturation: Males: 20% to 50%; Females: 15% to 45%\nThe numbers above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nHigher-than-normal iron level may be a sign of:\nToo much iron in the body (\nhemochromatosis\n)\nAnemia due to red blood cells being destroyed too quickly (\nhemolytic anemia\n)\nLiver tissue death\nInflammation of the liver (\nhepatitis\n)\nIron poisoning\nFrequent blood transfusions\nLower-than-normal level may be a sign of:\nLong-term digestive tract bleeding\nHeavy menstrual bleeding\nIntestinal conditions that cause poor absorption of iron\nNot enough iron in the diet\nPregnancy\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.
