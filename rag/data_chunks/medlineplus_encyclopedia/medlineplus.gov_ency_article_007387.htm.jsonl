Two types of anesthesia can be used:\nGeneral anesthesia\n, which means you will be unconscious and unable to feel pain.\nRegional anesthesia\nto numb your arm and shoulder area so that you do not feel any pain in this area. If you receive only regional anesthesia, you will also be given medicine to help you relax during the operation.\nThe shoulder is a ball and socket joint. The round end of the arm bone fits into the opening at the end of the shoulder blade, called the socket. This type of joint allows you to move your arm in most directions.\nFor total shoulder replacement, the round end of your arm bone will be replaced with an artificial stem that has a rounded metal head (ball). The socket part (glenoid) of your shoulder bone will be replaced with a smooth plastic lining (socket) that will be held in place with special cement."}

The socket part (glenoid) of your shoulder bone will be replaced with a smooth plastic lining (socket) that will be held in place with special cement. If only 1 of these 2 bones needs to be replaced, the surgery is called a partial shoulder replacement, or a hemiarthroplasty.\nAnother type of procedure is called reverse total shoulder replacement. In this surgery, the positions of the ball and socket are switched. The round part of the shoulder is removed from the top of the arm, and a metal ball is attached to the shoulder bone. The socket is then attached to the arm bone. The ball ends up on the other side of the shoulder. This surgery can be done when the rotator cuff tendons are severely damaged or there are shoulder fractures.\nFor shoulder joint replacement, your surgeon will make an incision (cut) over your shoulder joint to open up the area. Then your surgeon will:\nRemove the head (top) of your upper arm bone (humerus).\nPlace the new metal head and stem into place."}

It can sometimes be cemented in if the bone quality is poor.\nSmooth the surface of the old socket and cement the new one in place.\nClose your incision with staples or sutures.\nPlace a dressing (bandage) over your wound.\nYour surgeon may place a tube in this area to drain fluid that may build up in the joint. The drain will be removed when you no longer need it.\nThis surgery normally takes 1 to 3 hours.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nShoulder replacement surgery is often done when you have severe pain in the shoulder area, which limits your ability to move your arm."}
