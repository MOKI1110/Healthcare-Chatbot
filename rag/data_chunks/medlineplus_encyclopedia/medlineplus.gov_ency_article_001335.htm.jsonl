This is the thin tissue that lines the inner wall of the abdomen and covers most of the abdominal organs.\nCauses\nPeritonitis is caused by a collection of blood, body fluids, or pus in the belly (\nabdomen\n).\nOne type is called\nspontaneous bacterial peritonitis\n(SBP). It occurs in people with\nascites\n. Ascites is the buildup of fluid in the space between the lining of the abdomen and the organs. This problem is found in people with long-term liver damage, certain cancers, and heart failure.\nPeritonitis may be a result of other problems. This is known as\nsecondary peritonitis\n. Problems that may lead to this type of peritonitis include:\nTrauma or wounds to the belly\nRuptured appendix\nRuptured diverticula\nInfection after any surgery in the belly\nSymptoms\nYour belly is very painful or tender. The pain may become worse when your belly is touched or when you move.\nYour belly may look or feel bloated."}
