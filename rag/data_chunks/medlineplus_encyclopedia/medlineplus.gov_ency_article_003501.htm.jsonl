Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSchirmer test\nSchirmer test\nThe Schirmer test determines whether the eye produces enough tears to keep it moist.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe health care provider will place the end of a strip of filter paper inside the lower eyelid of each eye. Both eyes are tested at the same time. Before the test, you will be given numbing eye drops to prevent your eyes from tearing due to irritation from the paper strips.\nThe exact procedure may vary. Most often, the eyes are closed for 5 minutes. Close your eyes gently. Closing the eyes tightly or rubbing the eyes during the test can cause abnormal test results.\nAfter 5 minutes, the provider removes the paper and measures how much of it has become moist.\nSometimes the test is done without numbing drops to test for other types of tear problems.\nThe phenol red thread test is similar to the Schirmer test, except that red strips of special thread are used instead of paper strips. Numbing drops are not needed."}

Numbing drops are not needed. The test takes 15 seconds.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will be asked to remove your glasses or contact lenses before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nSome people find that holding the paper against the eye is irritating or mildly uncomfortable. The numbing drops often sting at first.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is used when your provider suspects you have dry eye. Symptoms include dryness of the eyes or excessive watering of the eyes.\nNormal Results\nMore than 10 mm of moisture on the filter paper after 5 minutes is a sign of normal tear production."}

Leave contact lenses out for at least 2 hours after the test.\nEven though the Schirmer test has been available since 1903, several studies show that it does not properly identify a large group of people with dry eyes. Newer and better tests are being developed. One test measures a molecule called lactoferrin."}

Newer and better tests are being developed. One test measures a molecule called lactoferrin. People with low tear production and dry eye have low levels of this molecule.\nAnother test measures tear osmolarity, or how concentrated the tears are. The higher the osmolarity, the more likely it is that you have dry eye.\nAlternative Names\nTear test; Tearing test; Dry eye test; Basal secretion test; SjÃ¶gren - Schirmer; Schirmer's test\nImages\nEye\nSchirmer's test\nReferences\nAkpek EK, Amescua G, Farid Ml; American Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern Cornea and External Disease Panel, et al.
