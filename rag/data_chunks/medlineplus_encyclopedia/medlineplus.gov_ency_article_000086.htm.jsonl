Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPleural effusion\nPleural effusion\nA pleural effusion is a buildup of fluid between the layers of tissue that line the lungs and chest cavity.\nCauses\nThe body normally produces pleural fluid in small amounts to lubricate the surfaces of the pleura. This is the thin tissue that lines the chest cavity and surrounds the lungs. Pleural effusion is an abnormal, excessive collection of this fluid.\nThere are two types of pleural effusion:\nTransudative pleural effusion is caused by fluid leaking into the pleural space."}

Pleural effusion is an abnormal, excessive collection of this fluid.\nThere are two types of pleural effusion:\nTransudative pleural effusion is caused by fluid leaking into the pleural space. This is from increased pressure in the blood vessels or a low blood protein count.\nHeart failure\nis the most common cause.\nExudative effusion is caused by blocked blood vessels or lymph vessels, inflammation, infection, lung injury, or tumors.\nRisk factors for pleural effusion may include:\nSmoking and drinking alcohol, as these can cause heart, lung and liver disease, which can lead to pleural effusion\nHistory of any contact with asbestos\nSymptoms\nSymptoms can include any of the following:\nChest pain\n, usually a sharp pain that is worse with cough or deep breaths\nCough\nFever and chills\nHiccups\nRapid breathing\nShortness of breath\nSometimes there are no symptoms.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms."}
