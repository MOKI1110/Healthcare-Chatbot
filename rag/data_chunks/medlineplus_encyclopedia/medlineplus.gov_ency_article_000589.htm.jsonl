Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPolycythemia vera\nPolycythemia vera\nPolycythemia vera (PV) is a bone marrow disease that leads to an abnormal increase in the number of blood cells. The red blood cells are the most affected blood cell type.\nCauses\nPV is a disorder of the bone marrow. It mainly causes too many red blood cells to be produced. The numbers of white blood cells and platelets may also be higher than normal.\nPV is a rare disorder that occurs more often in men than in women. It is not usually seen in people under age 40. The problem is often linked to a variant gene called\nJAK2\nV617F. The cause of this variant gene is unknown. This variant gene is not an inherited disorder.\nSymptoms\nIn people with PV, there are too many red blood cells in the blood."}

The cause of this variant gene is unknown. This variant gene is not an inherited disorder.\nSymptoms\nIn people with PV, there are too many red blood cells in the blood. This results in thicker blood, which can't flow through small blood vessels normally, leading to symptoms such as:\nTrouble breathing when lying down\nDizziness\nFeeling tired all the time\nFull feeling in the left upper abdomen (due to enlarged spleen)\nHeadache\nItchiness\n, especially after a warm bath\nRed skin coloring, especially of the face\nShortness of breath\nSymptoms of blood clots in veins near the skin surface (\nphlebitis\n)\nVision problems\nRinging in the ears (\ntinnitus\n)\nJoint pain\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

One unit of blood (about 1 pint, or 1/2 liter) is removed each week until the number of red blood cells drops. The treatment is continued as needed.\nMedicines that may be used include:\nHydroxyurea to reduce the number of red blood cells made by the bone marrow."}

This medicine is prescribed when hydroxyurea and other treatments have failed.\nTaking aspirin to reduce the risk of blood clots may be an option for some people, but aspirin increases the risk for stomach bleeding.\nUltraviolet-B or ultraviolet-A light therapy can reduce the severe itching some people experience.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with polycythemia vera and their families can be found at:\nThe Leukemia and Lymphoma Society --\nwww.lls.org/myeloproliferative-neoplasms/polycythemia-vera\nMPN Research Foundation --\nwww.mpnresearchfoundation.org/living-with-an-mpn/\nNational Organization for Rare Disorders --\nrarediseases.org/rare-diseases/polycythemia-vera/\nNIH Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center --\nrarediseases.info"}
