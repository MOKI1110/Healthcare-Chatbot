Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. There are many types of anemia.\nVitamin B12 deficiency anemia is a low red blood cell count due to a lack (deficiency) of\nvitamin B12\n.\nCauses\nYour body needs vitamin B12 to make red blood cells. In order to provide vitamin B12 to your cells:\nYou must eat foods that contain vitamin B12, such as meat, poultry, shellfish, eggs, fortified breakfast cereals, and dairy products.\nYour body must absorb enough vitamin B12. A special protein, called intrinsic factor, helps your body do this efficiently. This protein is released by cells in the stomach.\nCertain health conditions can make it difficult for your body to absorb enough vitamin B12."}

Symptoms of nerve damage include:\nNumbness and tingling of hands and feet\nLoss of balance\nProblems concentrating\nConfusion or change in mental status (\ndementia\n) in severe cases\nPsychosis\n(losing contact with reality)\nHallucinations\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

The goal of treatment is to increase your vitamin B12 level.\nFor people who have a low level of B12 due to a restricted vegetarian diet, taking B12 pills may resolve the issue.\nFor people with a health condition that causes B12 deficiency, treatment may include a shot of vitamin B12, often once a month.

This may be permanent if you do not start treatment promptly after your symptoms begin. If nerve damage is severe or long-lasting, some damage may be permanent.\nVitamin B12 deficiency anemia most often responds well to treatment. It will likely get better when the underlying cause of the deficiency is treated.\nPossible Complications\nA woman with a low B12 level may have a false positive Pap smear. This is because vitamin B12 deficiency affects the way certain cells (epithelial cells) in the cervix look.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have any of the symptoms of anemia.\nPrevention\nEating a well-balanced diet can help ensure you get enough vitamin B12 from the foods you eat."}
