These holes are called pores.\nEach pore opens to a follicle. A follicle contains a hair and an oil gland. The oil released by the gland helps remove old skin cells and keeps your skin soft.\nThe glands can become blocked with a mixture of oil and skin cells. The blockage is called a plug or comedone. If the top of the plug is white, it is called a\nwhitehead\n. It is called a\nblackhead\nif the top of the plug is dark.\nIf bacteria become trapped in the plug, the body's immune system may react to it, causing pimples.\nAcne that is deep in your skin can cause hard, painful\ncysts\n. This is called nodulocystic acne.\nAcne is most common in teenagers, but anyone can get acne, even babies. The problem tends to run in families.\nSome things that may trigger acne include:\nHormonal changes that make the skin oilier."}

The problem tends to run in families.\nSome things that may trigger acne include:\nHormonal changes that make the skin oilier. These may be related to puberty, menstrual periods, pregnancy,\nbirth control pills\n, or stress.\nGreasy or oily cosmetic and hair products.\nCertain drugs (such as steroids,\ntestosterone\n, estrogen, and phenytoin). Birth control devices, such as some drug-containing IUDs, can make acne worse.\nHeavy sweating and humidity.\nExcessively touching, resting on, or rubbing the skin.\nResearch does not show that chocolate, nuts, and greasy foods cause acne. However, diets high in refined sugars or dairy products may be related to acne in some people, but this connection is controversial.\nSymptoms\nAcne commonly appears on the face and shoulders. It may also occur on the trunk, arms, legs, and buttocks. Skin changes include:\nCrusting of skin bumps\nCysts\nPapules (small red bumps)\nPustules\n(small red bumps containing white or yellow pus)\nRedness around the skin eruptions\nScarring of the skin\nWhiteheads\nBlackheads\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can diagnose acne by looking at your skin."}

(Noncomedogenic products have been tested and proven not to clog pores and cause acne in most people.)\nRemove all dirt or make-up. Wash once or twice a day, including after exercising.\nAvoid scrubbing or repeated skin washing.\nShampoo your hair daily, especially if it is oily.\nComb or pull your hair back to keep the hair out of your face.\nWhat NOT to do:\nTry not to aggressively squeeze, scratch, pick, or rub the pimples."}

Follow the directions carefully and apply these products sparingly.\nThese products may contain benzoyl peroxide, sulfur, resorcinol, adapalene, or salicylic acid.\nThey work by killing bacteria, drying up skin oils, or causing the top layer of your skin to peel.\nThey may cause redness, drying, or excessive peeling of the skin.\nBe aware that benzoyl peroxide containing preparations can bleach or discolor towels and clothing.\nA small amount of sun exposure may improve acne slightly, but tanning mostly hides the acne."}
