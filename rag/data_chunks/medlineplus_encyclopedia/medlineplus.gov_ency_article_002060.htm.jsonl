Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nYour baby in  the birth canal\nYour baby in  the birth canal\nDuring labor and delivery, your baby must pass through your pelvic bones to reach the vaginal opening. The goal is to find the easiest way out. Certain body positions give the baby a smaller shape, which makes it easier for your baby to get through this tight passage.\nThe best position for the baby to pass through the pelvis is with the head down and the body facing toward the mother's back. This position is called occiput anterior.\nInformation\nCertain terms are used to describe your baby's position and movement through the birth canal.\nFETAL STATION\nFetal station refers to where the presenting part is in your pelvis.\nThe presenting part.\nThe presenting part is the part of the baby that leads the way through the birth canal. Most often, it is the baby's head, but it can be a shoulder, the buttocks, or the feet.\nIschial spines.\nThese are bone points on the mother's pelvis."}

Normally the ischial spines are the narrowest part of the pelvis.\n0 (zero) station.\nThis is when the baby's head is even with the ischial spines. The baby is said to be \"engaged\" when the largest part of the head has entered the pelvis.\nIf the presenting part lies above the ischial spines, the station is reported as a negative number from -1 to -5.\nIn first-time moms, the baby's head may engage by 36 weeks into the pregnancy. However, engagement may happen later in the pregnancy, or even during labor.\nFETAL LIE\nThis refers to how the baby's spine lines up with the mother's spine. Your baby's spine is between their head and tailbone.\nYour baby will most often settle into a position in the pelvis before labor begins.\nIf your baby's spine runs in the same direction (parallel) as your spine, the baby is said to be in a longitudinal lie."}

Nearly all babies are in a longitudinal lie.\nIf the baby is sideways (at a 90-degree angle to your spine), the baby is said to be in a transverse lie.\nFETAL ATTITUDE\nThe fetal attitude describes the position of the parts of your baby's body.\nThe normal fetal attitude is commonly called the fetal position.\nThe head is tucked down to the chest.\nThe arms and legs are drawn in towards the center of the chest.\nAbnormal fetal attitudes include a head that is tilted back, so the brow or the face presents first. Other body parts may be positioned behind the back. When this happens, the presenting part will be larger as it passes through the pelvis. This makes delivery more difficult.\nDELIVERY PRESENTATION\nDelivery presentation\ndescribes the way the baby is positioned to come down the birth canal for delivery.\nThe best position for your baby inside your uterus at the time of delivery is head down."}

This is called cephalic presentation.\nThis position makes it easier and safer for your baby to pass through the birth canal. Cephalic presentation occurs in about 97% of deliveries.\nThere are different types of cephalic presentation, which depend on the position of the baby's limbs and head (fetal attitude).\nIf your baby is in any position other than head down, your health care provider may recommend a cesarean delivery.\nBreech presentation\nis when the baby's bottom is down. Breech presentation occurs about 3% of the time. There are a few types of breech:\nA complete breech is when the buttocks present first and both the hips and knees are flexed.\nA frank breech is when the hips are flexed so the legs are straight and completely drawn up toward the chest.\nOther breech positions occur when either the feet or knees present first.\nThe shoulder, arm, or trunk may present first if the fetus is in a transverse lie. This type of presentation occurs less than 1% of the time."}

Transverse lie is more common when you deliver before your due date, or have twins or triplets.\nCARDINAL MOVEMENTS OF LABOR\nAs your baby passes through the birth canal, the baby's head will change positions. These changes are needed for your baby to fit and move through your pelvis. These movements of your baby's head are called cardinal movements of labor.\nEngagement\nThis is when the widest part of your baby's head has entered the pelvis.\nEngagement tells your provider that your pelvis is large enough to allow the baby's head to move down (descend).\nDescent\nThis is when your baby's head moves down (descends) further through your pelvis.\nMost often, descent occurs during labor, either as the cervix dilates or after you begin pushing.\nFlexion\nDuring descent, the baby's head is flexed down so that the chin touches the chest.\nWith the chin tucked, it is easier for the baby's head to pass through the pelvis.\nInternal Rotation\nAs your baby's head descends further, the head will most often r"}

This helps the head fit the shape of your pelvis.\nUsually, the baby will be face down toward your spine.\nSometimes, the baby will rotate so it faces up toward the pubic bone.\nAs your baby's head rotates, extends, or flexes during labor, the body will stay in position with one shoulder down toward your spine and one shoulder up toward your belly.\nExtension\nAs your baby reaches the opening of the vagina, usually the back of the head is in contact with your pubic bone.\nAt this point, the birth canal curves upward, and the baby's head must extend back."}
