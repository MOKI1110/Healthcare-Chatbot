This happens when the liver doesn't work properly. It does not break down and eliminate these chemicals. The toxic materials can build up in the brain and damage brain tissue.  However, ammonia may not be the cause of hepatocellular degeneration.\nSpecific areas of the brain, such as the basal ganglia, are more likely to be injured from liver failure. The basal ganglia help control bodily movement. This condition is the \"non-Wilsonian\" type. This means that the liver damage is not caused by\nWilson disease\n, which leads to copper deposits in the liver. Damage to the basal ganglia can cause symptoms similar to Parkinson disease.\nA condition called hepatic encephalopathy can also cause similar symptoms."}

It is more frequent than hepatocerebral degeneration. It also can occur with hepatocerebral degeneration.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nDifficulty walking\nImpaired intellectual function\nJaundice\nMuscle spasm (myoclonus)\nRigidity\nShaking of arms, head (tremor)\nTwitching\nUncontrolled body movements (\nchorea\n)\nTremor of the hand when the wrist is extended (also called a flapping tremor or asterixis)\nUnsteady walking (\nataxia\n)\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam may reveal signs of cirrhosis of the liver or liver failure, including:\nFluid in the abdomen that causes swelling (\nascites\n)\nGastrointestinal bleeding from enlarged veins in the food pipe (\nesophageal varices\n)\nJaundice (yellowing of the skin)\nA nervous system (neurological) exam may show signs of:\nComa\nConfusion\nDementia\nInvoluntary movements\nWalking instability (ataxia)\nLaboratory tests will show advanced liver disease or liver failure."}

Lab tests can also check for other causes of the symptoms.\nOther tests may include:\nMRI of the head\nEEG\n(may show general slowing of brain waves)\nCT scan of the head\nTreatment\nThe treatment includes trying medicines that are used for hepatic encephalopathy. This includes antibiotics (such as rifaximin) or a medicine such as lactulose, which lowers the level of ammonia in the blood.\nTrying to correct the \"shunt\" (blood flow changes) from the liver disease may help. This may be done by interventional radiology or surgery.\nThere is no specific treatment for the neurologic syndrome, because it is caused by irreversible liver damage. A liver transplant may cure the liver disease. However, this operation may help, but not reverse the symptoms of brain damage.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThis is a long-term (chronic) condition that may lead to permanent nervous system (neurological) symptoms.\nThe person may continue to get worse and die without a liver transplant."}

If a transplant is done early, the neurological syndrome may improve.\nPossible Complications\nComplications include:\nHepatic coma\nSevere brain damage with a wide range of possible symptoms\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have any symptoms of liver disease.\nPrevention\nIt is not possible to prevent all forms of liver disease. However, alcohol-related, metabolic-related, and many types of viral hepatitis may be prevented.\nTo reduce your risk of getting alcohol-related or viral hepatitis:\nAvoid risky behaviors, such as IV drug use or unprotected sex.\nDon't drink, or drink only in moderation.\nAlternative Names\nChronic acquired (Non-Wilsonian) hepatocerebral degeneration; Hepatic encephalopathy; Portosystemic encephalopathy\nImages\nLiver anatomy\nReferences\nGarcia-Tsao G.
