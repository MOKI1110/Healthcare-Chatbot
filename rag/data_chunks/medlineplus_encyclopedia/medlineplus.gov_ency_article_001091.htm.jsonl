It is present from birth (congenital heart disease). The pulmonary valve is an opening on the right side of the heart that regulates blood flow from the right ventricle (right side pumping chamber) to the lungs.\nIn pulmonary atresia, the valve leaflets are fused. This causes a solid sheet of tissue to form where the valve opening should be. Normal blood flow to the lung is blocked as a result. Because of this defect, blood from the right side of the heart is restricted from reaching the lungs to pick up oxygen.\nCauses\nAs with most congenital heart diseases, there is no known cause of pulmonary atresia."}

The condition is linked with another type of congenital heart defect called a\npatent ductus arteriosus\n(PDA).\nPulmonary atresia may occur with or without a\nventricular septal defect (VSD)\n.\nIf the person does not have a VSD, the condition is called pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum (PA/IVS).\nIf the person has both problems, the condition is called pulmonary atresia with VSD. This is an extreme form of\ntetralogy of Fallot\n.\nAlthough both conditions are called pulmonary atresia, they are, in fact, different defects. This article discusses pulmonary atresia without a VSD.\nPeople with PA/IVS may also have a poorly developed tricuspid valve. They may also have an underdeveloped or very thick right ventricle, and abnormal blood vessels feeding the heart."}

They may also have an underdeveloped or very thick right ventricle, and abnormal blood vessels feeding the heart. Less commonly, structures in the left ventricle, aortic valve, and right atrium are involved.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms most often occur in the first few hours of life, although it may take up to a few days.\nSymptoms may include:\nBluish color to the skin (cyanosis) due to low oxygen level in the blood\nFast breathing\nFatigue\nPoor eating habits (babies may get tired while nursing or sweat during feedings)\nShortness of breath\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will use a stethoscope to listen to the heart and lungs. People with a PDA have a heart murmur that can be heard with a stethoscope.\nThe following tests may be ordered:\nChest x-ray\nEchocardiogram\nElectrocardiogram (ECG)\nHeart catheterization\nPulse oximetry -- shows the amount of oxygen in the blood\nTreatment\nA medicine called prostaglandin E1 is usually used to help the blood move (circulate) into the lungs. This medicine keeps a blood vessel open between the pulmonary artery and aorta."}

This medicine keeps a blood vessel open between the pulmonary artery and aorta. The vessel is called a PDA.\nMultiple treatments are possible, but which one is selected depends on the extent of the heart abnormalities that accompany the pulmonary valve defect. Potential invasive treatments include:\nBiventricular repair -- This surgery separates the blood flow to the lungs from the circulation to the rest of the body by creating two pumping ventricles.\nUniventricular palliation -- This surgery separates the blood flow to the lungs from the circulation to the rest of the body by constructing one pumping ventricle.\nHeart transplant.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost cases can be helped with surgery. How well a baby does depends on:\nSize and connections of the pulmonary artery (the artery that takes blood to the lungs)\nHow well the heart is beating\nHow well the other heart valves are formed or how much they are leaking\nOutcome varies because of the different forms of this defect."}

Rubella infection in a pregnant woman can cause congenital heart disease.\nWomen who are pregnant should get good prenatal care:\nAvoid alcohol and illegal drugs during pregnancy.\nTell your provider that you are pregnant before taking any new medicines.\nHave a blood test early in your pregnancy to see if you are immune to rubella."}

Many family members may be affected. If you are planning to get pregnant, talk to your provider about screening for genetic diseases.\nIf the defect is found before birth, medical specialists (such as a pediatric cardiologist, cardiothoracic surgeon, and neonatologist) can be present at the birth, and ready to help as needed. This preparation can mean the difference between life and death for some babies.\nAlternative Names\nPulmonary atresia - intact ventricular septum; PA/IVS; Congenital heart disease - pulmonary atresia; Cyanotic heart disease - pulmonary atresia; Valve - disorder pulmonary atresia\nImages\nHeart - section through the middle\nHeart - front view\nReferences\nValente AM, Dorfman AL, Babu-Narayan SV, Kreiger EV."}
