It helps in food digestion and regulation of blood sugar levels. The pancreas has three parts called the head (the wider end), middle, and tail. When done to treat cancer, all or part of the pancreas is removed depending on the location of the cancer tumor.\nWhether the procedure is performed laparoscopically (using a tiny video camera) or using\nrobotic surgery\ndepends on:\nThe extent of the surgery\nThe experience and number of surgeries your surgeon has performed\nThe experience and number of surgeries performed at the hospital you are going to use\nThe surgery is done in the hospital with general anesthesia so you are asleep and pain free."}

The following types of surgeries are used in the surgical treatment of pancreatic cancer.\nWhipple procedure --\nThis is the most common surgery for pancreatic cancer.\nA cut is made in your belly and the head of the pancreas is removed.\nThe gallbladder, bile duct, and part of the duodenum (first part of the small intestine) are also taken out. Sometimes, part of the stomach is removed.\nDistal pancreatectomy and splenectomy --\nThis surgery is used more often for tumors in the middle and tail of the pancreas.\nThe middle and the tail of the pancreas are removed.\nThe spleen may also be removed.\nTotal pancreatectomy --\nThis surgery is not done very often. There is little benefit of taking out the whole pancreas if the cancer can be treated by removing only part of the gland.\nA cut is made in your belly and the whole pancreas is removed.\nThe gallbladder, spleen, part of the duodenum, and nearby lymph nodes are also removed."}
