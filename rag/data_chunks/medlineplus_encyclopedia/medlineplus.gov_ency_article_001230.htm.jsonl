A bone tumor may be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (\nbenign\n).\nCauses\nThe cause of bone tumors is unknown. They often occur in areas of the bone that grow rapidly. Possible causes include:\nGenetic defects passed down through families\nRadiation\nInjury\nIn most cases, no specific cause is found.\nOsteochondromas are the most common noncancerous (benign) bone tumors. They occur most often in young people between the ages of 10 and 20.\nCancers that start in the bones are called primary bone tumors. Bone cancers that start in another part of the body (such as the breast, lungs, or colon) are called secondary or\nmetastatic\nbone tumors."}

Bone cancers that start in another part of the body (such as the breast, lungs, or colon) are called secondary or\nmetastatic\nbone tumors. They behave very differently from primary bone tumors.\nCancerous primary bone tumors include:\nChondrosarcoma\nEwing sarcoma\nFibrosarcoma\nOsteosarcoma\nCancers that most often spread to the bone are cancers of the:\nBreast\nKidney\nLung\nProstate\nThyroid\nThese forms of cancer usually affect older people.\nBone cancer is more common in people who have a family history of cancers.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a bone tumor may include any of the following:\nBone fracture, especially from slight injury (trauma)\nBone pain\n, may be worse at night\nOccasionally a mass and swelling can be felt at the tumor site\nSome benign tumors have no symptoms.\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

Your provider will closely monitor you. You will likely need regular imaging tests, such as x-rays, to see if the tumor shrinks or grows.\nSurgery may be needed to remove the tumor in some cases.\nTreatment for cancerous bone tumors that have spread from other parts of the body depends on where the cancer started.\nRadiation therapy\nmay be given to prevent fractures or to relieve pain.\nChemotherapy\nmay be used to prevent fractures or the need for surgery or radiation.\nTumors that start in the bone are rare."}

Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well you do depends on the type of bone tumor.\nThe outcome is usually good in people with noncancerous (benign) tumors.
