When a person becomes infected with HIV, the virus attacks and weakens the immune system. As the immune system weakens, the person is at risk of getting life-threatening infections and\ncancers\n. When that happens, the illness is called AIDS.\nHIV can be transmitted to the fetus or the newborn during pregnancy, during labor or delivery, or by breastfeeding.\nThis article is about HIV/AIDS in pregnant women and infants.\nCauses\nMost children with HIV get the virus when it passes from an HIV-positive mother to their child."}

This can occur during pregnancy, childbirth, or when breastfeeding.\nOnly blood, semen, vaginal fluids, and breast milk have been shown to transmit infection to others.\nThe virus is not spread to infants by:\nCasual contact, such as hugging or touching\nTouching items that were touched by a person infected with the virus, such as towels or washcloths\nSaliva, sweat, or tears that is not mixed with the blood of an infected person\nSymptoms\nMost infants born to HIV-positive women in the United States do not become HIV positive if the mother and infant have good prenatal and postpartum care that includes antiretroviral therapy (ART).\nInfants who are infected with HIV often have no symptoms for the first 2 to 3 months. Once symptoms develop, they can vary."}

These are severe infections in the body. They can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, protozoa, or parasites. At this point, the illness has progressed to AIDS.\nExams and Tests\nHere are the tests a pregnant mother and her baby may have to diagnose HIV:\nTESTS TO DIAGNOSE HIV IN PREGNANT WOMEN\nAll pregnant women should have a\nscreening test for HIV\nalong with other prenatal tests."}

This test looks for how much of the HIV virus is in the body. In infants born to HIV positive mothers, HIV testing is done:\n14 to 21 days after birth\nAt 1 to 2 months\nAt 4 to 6 months\nIf the results of 2 tests are negative, the infant does not have an HIV infection.

These medicines stop the virus from multiplying.\nTREATING PREGNANT WOMEN\nTreating pregnant women with HIV prevents children from becoming infected.\nIf a woman tests positive during pregnancy, she will receive ART while pregnant. Most often she will receive a three-medicine regimen.\nThe risk of these ART medicines for the baby in the womb is low. The mother may have another ultrasound at the second trimester.\nHIV may be found in a woman when she goes into labor, particularly if she has not previously received prenatal care. If so, she will be treated with ART right away. Sometimes these medicines will be given through a vein (\nIV\n).\nIf the first positive test is during labor, receiving ART right away during labor can reduce the rate of infection in children to about 10%.\nTREATING BABIES AND INFANTS\nInfants born to infected mothers start receiving ART within 6 to 12 hours after birth."}

This holds true even for women who are taking HIV medicines. Doing so may pass HIV to the baby through breast milk.\nSupport Groups\nThe challenges of being a caretaker of a child with HIV/AIDS can often be helped by joining a\nsupport group\n. In these groups, members share common experiences and problems.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe risk of a mother transmitting HIV during pregnancy or during labor is low for mothers identified and treated with ART early in pregnancy. When treated, the chance of her baby being infected is less than 1%."}

The treatment does not cure the infection. The medicines only work as long as they are taken every day. With proper treatment, children with HIV/AIDS can live a nearly normal lifespan.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have HIV or are at risk for HIV, and you become pregnant or are thinking of becoming pregnant.\nPrevention\nHIV-positive women who might become pregnant should talk to their provider about the risk to their unborn child. They should also discuss methods to prevent their baby from becoming infected, such as taking ART during pregnancy."}
