Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEnteroclysis\nEnteroclysis\nEnteroclysis is an imaging test of the small intestine. The test looks at how a liquid called contrast material moves through the small intestine.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis test is done in a radiology department. Depending on the need,\nx-ray\n,\nCT scan\n, or\nMRI\nimaging is used.\nThe test involves the following:\nYour health care provider inserts a tube through your nose or mouth into your stomach and into the beginning of the small bowel.\nContrast material and air flow through the tube, and images are taken.\nThe provider can watch on a monitor as the contrast moves through the bowel.\nThe goal of the study is to view all of the loops of small bowel. You may be asked to change positions during the exam."}

You may be asked to change positions during the exam. The test may last a few hours, because it takes a while for the contrast to move through all of the small bowel.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nFollow your provider's instructions on how to prepare for the test, which may include:\nDrinking clear liquids for at least 24 hours before the test.\nNot eating or drinking anything for several hours before the test. Your provider will tell you exactly how many hours.\nTaking laxatives to clear the bowels.\nNot taking certain medicines. Your provider will tell you which ones. Do not stop taking any medicines on your own. Ask your provider first.\nIf you are anxious about the procedure, you may be given a sedative before it starts. You will be asked to remove all jewelry and wear a hospital gown. It is best to leave jewelry and other valuables at home."}

You will be asked to remove any removable dental work, such as appliances, bridges, or retainers.\nIf you are, or think you're pregnant, tell your provider before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe placement of the tube may be uncomfortable. The contrast material may cause a feeling of abdominal fullness.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is performed to examine the small bowel. It is one way of telling if the small intestine is normal.\nNormal Results\nThere are no problems seen with the size or shape of the small intestine. Contrast travels through the bowel at a normal rate without any sign of blockage.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nMany problems of the small intestine can be found with enteroclysis."}

Some of these include:\nInflammation of the small bowel (such as\nCrohn disease\n)\nSmall bowel isn't absorbing nutrients normally (\nmalabsorption\n)\nNarrowing or stricture of the intestine\nSmall bowel blockage\nTumors of the small intestine\nRisks\nThe radiation exposure may be greater with this test than with other types of x-rays because of the length of time. But most experts feel that the risk is low compared to the benefits.\nPregnant women and children are more sensitive to the risks of x-ray radiation. Rare complications of enteroclysis include:\nAllergic reactions to medicines prescribed for the test (your provider can tell you which medicines)\nPossible injury to bowel structures during the study\nBarium may cause constipation."}
