People who currently have a heart condition such as heart failure or other health problems such as diabetes, should talk with their health care provider about what type of diet is best. You may need to make certain changes to your diet that are not included in these recommendations.\nRecommendations\nFRUITS AND VEGETABLES\nFruits and vegetables are part of a heart-healthy diet. They are good sources of\nfiber\n, vitamins, and minerals."}

They are good sources of\nfiber\n, vitamins, and minerals. Most are low in fat, calories, sodium, and cholesterol.\nEat 5 or more servings of fruits and vegetables per day.\nGet more fiber by eating whole fruits instead of drinking juice.\nGRAINS\nChoose whole-grain foods (such as whole-wheat bread, cereal, crackers, and pasta or brown rice) for at least half of your daily grain intake. Grain products provide fiber, vitamins, minerals, and complex carbohydrates. Eating too many grains, especially refined grain foods (such as white bread, pasta, and baked goods) can cause weight gain.\nLimit high-fat baked goods such as butter rolls, cheese crackers, and croissants, and cream sauces for pasta."}

Avoid packaged snacks that contain partially hydrogenated oils or trans fats.\nEATING HEALTHY PROTEIN\nMeat, poultry, seafood, dried peas, lentils, nuts, and eggs are good sources of protein, B vitamins, iron, and other vitamins and minerals.\nYou should:\nEat at least 2 servings of low-mercury fish per week.\nCook by baking, broiling, roasting, steaming, boiling, or microwaving instead of deep frying.\nFor the main entree, use less meat or have meatless meals a few times a week. Get protein from plant-based protein foods instead.\nMilk and other dairy products are good sources of protein, calcium, the B vitamins niacin and riboflavin, and vitamins A and D.\nFATS, OILS, AND CHOLESTEROL\nSome types of fat are healthier than others. A diet high in saturated and trans fats causes cholesterol to build up in your arteries (blood vessels). This puts you at risk for heart attack, stroke, and other major health problems. Avoid or limit foods that are high in these fats."}

This puts you at risk for heart attack, stroke, and other major health problems. Avoid or limit foods that are high in these fats. Polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats that come from vegetable sources have many health benefits.\nYou should  avoid or limit foods that are high in saturated fats. Here are some examples:\nFoods with a lot of saturated fats include animal products such as butter, cheese, whole milk, ice cream, sour cream, lard, and fatty meats such as bacon.\nSome vegetable oils (coconut, palm, and palm kernel oils) also contain saturated fats. These fats are solid at room temperature.\nLimit trans fats as much as possible by avoiding hydrogenated or partially-hydrogenated fats. These are often found in packaged snacks and solid margarine.\nThink about the following when choosing a margarine:\nChoose soft margarine (tub or liquid) over harder stick forms.\nChoose margarines with liquid vegetable oil as the first ingredient. Even better, choose \"light\" margarines that list water as the first ingredient."}

They can also lower your HDL (good) cholesterol level.\nTo avoid trans fats, limit fried foods, commercial baked goods (donuts, cookies, and crackers), and hard margarines.\nOTHER TIPS TO KEEP YOUR HEART HEALTHY\nYou may find it helpful to talk to a dietitian about your eating choices. The American Heart Association is a good source of information on diet and heart disease. Balance the number of calories you eat with the number you use each day to maintain a healthy body weight."}

The American Heart Association is a good source of information on diet and heart disease. Balance the number of calories you eat with the number you use each day to maintain a healthy body weight. You can ask your doctor or dietitian to help you figure out a good number of calories for you.\nLimit your intake of foods high in calories or low in nutrition, including foods like soft drinks and candy that contain a lot of sugar.\nThe American Heart Association recommends that sodium intake be no more than 2,300 milligrams (about 1 teaspoon of salt) a day with an ideal limit of no more than 1,500 mg per day for most adults. Cut down on sodium by reducing the amount of salt you add to food when eating and cooking. Also limit packaged foods that have salt added to them, such as canned soups and vegetables, cured meats, and some frozen meals. Always check the nutrition label for the sodium content per serving and be sure to pay attention to the number of servings per container. Season foods with lemon juice, fresh herbs or spices instead.\nFoods with more than 300 mg of sodium per serving may not fit into a reduced sodium diet.\nExercise regularly."}

For example, walk for at least 30 minutes a day, in blocks of 10 minutes or longer. Try to move at least 30 minutes during at least 5 days of the week.\nLimit the amount of alcohol you drink. Women should have no more than 1 alcoholic drink per day. Men should not have more than 2 alcoholic drinks each day. One drink is defined as 12 fl ounces [360 milliliters (mL)] of beer, 5 fl ounces (150 mL) of wine, or a 1 1/2-fl ounce (45 mL) shot of liquor.\nAlternative Names\nDiet - heart disease; CAD - diet; Coronary artery disease - diet; Coronary heart disease - diet\nPatient Instructions\nCholesterol - drug treatment\nImages\nHealthy diet\nFish in diet\nObesity and health\nFruits and vegetables\nReferences\nArnett DK, Blumenthal RS, Albert MA, Buroker AB, et al. 2019 ACC/AHA guideline on the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease: a report of the American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines.\nCirculation.\n2019;140(11):e596-e646."}
