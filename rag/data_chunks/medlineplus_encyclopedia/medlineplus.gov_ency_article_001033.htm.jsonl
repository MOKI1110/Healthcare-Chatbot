They are not cancerous.\nCauses\nSebaceous cysts\nare the most common type of\ncysts\nseen in the ear. These sack-like lumps are made up of dead skin cells and oils produced by oil glands in the skin.\nPlaces they are likely to be found include:\nBehind the ear\nIn the ear canal\nIn the earlobe\nOn the scalp\nThe exact cause of the problem is unknown. Cysts may occur when oils are produced in a skin gland faster than they can be released from the gland. They can also occur if the oil gland opening has become blocked and a cyst forms under the skin.\nBenign\nbony tumors of the ear canal (exostoses and osteomas) are caused by excess growth of bone."}

Repeated exposure to cold water may increase the risk for benign bony tumors of the ear canal.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms of cysts include:\nPain (if cysts are in the outside ear canal or if they get infected)\nSmall soft skin lumps on, behind, or in front of the ear\nThe symptoms of benign tumors include:\nEar discomfort\nGradual\nhearing loss\nin  one ear\nRepeated outer ear infections\nNote: There may be no symptoms.\nExams and Tests\nBenign cysts and tumors are most often found during a routine ear exam. This type of exam may include hearing tests (\naudiometry\n) and middle ear testing (\ntympanometry\n). When looking into the ear, the  health care provider  may see cysts or benign tumors in the ear canal.\nSometimes, a\nCT scan\nis needed.\nThis disease may also affect the results of the following tests:\nCaloric stimulation\nElectronystagmography\nTreatment\nTreatment is not needed if the cyst does not cause pain or affect hearing.\nIf a cyst becomes painful, it may be infected."}

Treatment may include antibiotics or removal of the cyst.\nBenign bony tumors may increase in size over time. Surgery may be needed if a benign tumor is painful, interferes with hearing, or leads to frequent ear infections.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nBenign ear cysts and tumors are slow-growing. They may sometimes shrink or may disappear on their own.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nHearing loss, if the tumor is large\nInfection of the cyst\nInfection of the ear canal\nWax trapped in the ear canal\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have:\nSymptoms of a benign ear cyst or tumor\nDiscomfort, pain, or hearing loss\nAlternative Names\nOsteomas; Exostoses; Tumor - ear; Cysts - ear; Ear cysts; Ear tumors; Bony tumor of the ear canal; Furuncles\nImages\nEar anatomy\nReferences\nGold L, Williams TP.
