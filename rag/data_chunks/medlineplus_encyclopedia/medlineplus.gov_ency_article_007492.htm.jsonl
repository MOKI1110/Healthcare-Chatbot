They may also be called artificial sweeteners, non-nutritive sweeteners (NNS), and noncaloric sweeteners.\nFunction\nSugar substitutes may be helpful for people trying to lose weight. They provide sweetness to foods and drinks without adding a lot of extra calories. Most of these contain almost no calories.\nUsing sugar substitutes in place of sugar can help prevent dental decay. They also may help with blood sugar control in people with diabetes.\nFood Sources\nSugar substitutes can be added to food when you eat. Most can also be used during cooking and baking."}

Most \"sugar-free\" or low-calorie food products you buy at the store are made using sugar substitutes.\nCommonly used sugar substitutes include:\nAspartame (Equal and NutraSweet)\nNutritive sweetener -- has calories, but is very sweet, so little is needed.\nA combination of two amino acids -- phenylalanine and aspartic acid.\n200 times sweeter than sucrose.\nLoses its sweetness when exposed to heat. It is best used in beverages rather than baking.\nHasn't shown any serious side effects.\nFDA approved.\nThe FDA requires that foods containing aspartame must have information on the label for people with PKU (phenylketonuria, a rare genetic disorder) alerting them about the presence of phenylalanine.\nMany studies have been done on aspartame, and none have found that it is linked to cancer. However, one expert group has classified it as \"possibly carcinogenic (cancer causing) in humans.\" The FDA disagrees with this and states that aspartame is safe to use within recommended use levels."}

Many studies have been done on FDA-approved sugar substitutes, and they have been shown to be safe. Based on these studies, the FDA states they are safe for use for the general population.\nAspartame is not recommended for people with\nPKU\n.

The WHO's Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA) has not recommended any change in the acceptable amount of aspartame that can be safely consumed.\nThere is little evidence to support the use of or avoidance of sugar substitutes during pregnancy. FDA-approved sweeteners are fine to use in moderation. However, the American Medical Association suggests avoiding saccharin during pregnancy due to possible slow fetal clearance.\nRecommendations\nThe FDA regulates all sugar substitutes that are sold or used in prepared foods in the United States. The FDA has set an acceptable daily intake (ADI). This is the amount a person can safely eat each day over a lifetime. Most people eat far less than the ADI.\nIn 2012, the American Heart Association and the American Diabetes Association published a report that concluded that sensible use of sugar substitutes could help lower caloric and carbohydrate intake."}
