GERD is a condition in which food or stomach acid comes back up from your stomach into the esophagus. The esophagus is the tube from your mouth to the stomach.\nReflux often occurs if the muscles where the esophagus meets the stomach do not close tightly enough. A\nhiatal hernia\ncan make GERD symptoms worse. It occurs when the stomach bulges through this opening into your chest.\nSymptoms of reflux or heartburn are burning in the stomach that you may also feel in your throat or chest, burping or gas bubbles, or trouble swallowing food or fluids.\nDescription\nThe most common procedure of this type is called fundoplication. In this surgery, your surgeon will:\nFirst repair the hiatal hernia, if one is present. This involves tightening the opening in your diaphragm with stitches to keep your stomach from bulging upward through the opening in the muscle wall."}

This involves tightening the opening in your diaphragm with stitches to keep your stomach from bulging upward through the opening in the muscle wall. Some surgeons place a piece of mesh in the repaired area to make it more secure.\nWrap the upper part of your stomach around the end of your esophagus with stitches. The stitches create pressure at the end of your esophagus, which helps prevent stomach acid and food from flowing up from the stomach into the esophagus.\nSurgery is done while you are under general anesthesia, so you are asleep and pain-free. Surgery most often takes 2 to 3 hours. Your surgeon may choose from different techniques.\nOPEN REPAIR\nYour surgeon will make 1 large surgical cut in your belly.\nA tube may be inserted into your stomach through the abdomen to keep the stomach wall in place. This tube will be taken out in about a week.\nLAPAROSCOPIC REPAIR\nYour surgeon will make 3 to 5 small cuts in your belly. A thin tube with a tiny camera on the end is inserted through one of these cuts.\nSurgical tools are inserted through the other cuts."}

A special camera on a flexible tool (endoscope) is passed down through your mouth and into your esophagus.\nUsing this tool, the surgeon will put small clips in place at the point where the esophagus meets the stomach."}

This is very rare.\nGas bloat. This is when the stomach overfills with air or food and you are unable to relieve the pressure by burping or vomiting. These symptoms slowly get better for most people.\nPain and difficulty when you swallow. This is called dysphagia. In most people, this goes away during the first 3 months after surgery.\nReturn of the hiatal hernia or reflux.\nBefore the Procedure\nYou may need the following tests:\nBlood tests (\ncomplete blood count\n,\nelectrolytes\n, or liver tests).\nEsophageal manometry (to measure pressures in the esophagus) or\npH monitoring\n(to see how much stomach acid is coming back into your esophagus).\nUpper endoscopy."}

Ask your surgeon what you should do.\nAsk your provider which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\nOn the day of your surgery:\nFollow your surgeon's instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.\nTake the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\nFollow instructions for showering before surgery.\nYour surgeon will tell you when to arrive at the hospital."}
