This is because their bodies have a harder time fighting off the virus than people with a strong immune system.\nViral pneumonia is most often caused by one of several viruses:\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV)\nInfluenza virus\nParainfluenza virus\nAdenovirus (less common)\nMeasles virus\nCoronaviruses\nsuch as SARS-CoV-2, which causes\nCOVID-19\npneumonia\nSerious viral pneumonia is more likely to happen in those with a weakened immune system, such as:\nBabies who are born too early.\nChildren with heart and lung problems.\nPeople who have HIV/AIDS.\nPeople receiving\nchemotherapy\nfor cancer, or other medicines that weaken the immune system.\nPeople who have had an organ transplant.\nSome viruses like the\nflu\n(influenza) and SARS-CoV2 can lead to severe pneumonia in younger and otherwise healthy people.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of viral pneumonia often begi"}

You can take these steps at home:\nRegulate your fever with aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen or naproxen), or acetaminophen.

Have someone else do chores.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost cases of viral pneumonia are mild and get better without treatment within 1  to 3 weeks. Some cases are more serious and require a hospital stay.\nPossible Complications\nMore serious infections can result in\nrespiratory\nfailure, liver failure, and\nheart failure\n. Sometimes, bacterial infections occur during or just after viral pneumonia, which may lead to more serious forms of pneumonia.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if symptoms of viral pneumonia develop or your condition gets worse after starting to improve.\nPrevention\nWash your hands often, after blowing your nose, going to the bathroom, diapering a baby, and before eating or preparing food.\nAvoid coming into contact with other sick people.\nDo not smoke."}
