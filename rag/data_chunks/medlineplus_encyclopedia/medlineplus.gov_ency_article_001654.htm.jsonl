It can be passed down through families (inherited).\nCauses\nAarskog syndrome is a genetic disorder that is linked to the X chromosome. It affects mainly males, but females may have a milder form. The condition is caused by changes (mutations) in a gene called \"faciogenital dysplasia\" (\nFGD1\n).\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of this condition include:\nBelly button that sticks out\nBulge in the groin or scrotum\nDelayed sexual maturity\nDelayed teeth\nDownward\npalpebral slant\nto eyes (palpebral slant is the direction of the slant from the inner to outer corner of the eye)\nHairline with a \"widow's peak\"\nMildly sunken chest (pectus excavatum)\nMild to moderate cognitive problems\nMild to moderate\nshort height\n, which may not be obvious until the child is 1 to 3 years old\nPoorly developed middle section of the face\nRounded face\nScrotum surrounds the penis (shawl scrotum)\nShort fingers and toes with mild\nwebbing\nSingle crease in the pa"}
