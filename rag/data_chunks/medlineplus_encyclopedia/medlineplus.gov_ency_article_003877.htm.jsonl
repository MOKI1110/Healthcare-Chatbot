These are attached by wires to a small recording monitor. You carry the Holter monitor in a pocket or pouch worn around your neck or waist. The monitor runs on batteries.\nWhile you wear the monitor, it records your heart's electrical activity.\nKeep a diary of what activities you do while wearing the monitor, and how you feel.\nAfter 24 to 48 hours, you will return the monitor to your health care provider's office.\nYour provider will look at the records and see if there have been any abnormal heart rhythms.\nIt is very important that you accurately record your symptoms and activities so the provider can match them with your Holter monitor findings.\nElectrodes must be firmly attached to the chest so the machine gets an accurate recording of the heart's activity.\nWhile wearing the device, av"}

You may be asked to exercise while being monitored if your symptoms have occurred in the past while you were exercising.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou do not need to prepare for the test.\nYour provider will start the monitor.

The monitor may also be used:\nAfter a\nheart attack\nTo diagnose heart rhythm problems that may be causing symptoms such as\npalpitations\nor syncope (passing out/\nfainting\n)\nWhen starting a new heart medicine\nHeart rhythms which may be recorded include:\nAtrial fibrillation or flutter\nFast heart rate (tachycardia)\nMultifocal atrial tachycardia\nParoxysmal supraventricular tachycardia\nSlow heart rate (bradycardia)\nVentricular tachycardia\nNormal Results\nNormal variations in\nheart rate\noccur with activities. A normal result is no significant changes in heart rhythms or pattern.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may include various\narrhythmias\nsuch as those listed above."}
