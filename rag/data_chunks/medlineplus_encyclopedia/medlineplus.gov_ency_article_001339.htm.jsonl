Symptoms include fever, diarrhea, vomiting, bleeding, and often, death.\nEbola can occur in humans and other primates (gorillas, monkeys, and chimpanzees).\nThe Ebola outbreak in West Africa that began in March 2014 was the largest hemorrhagic viral epidemic in history. Of the people who developed Ebola in this outbreak, 71% died.\nThe virus poses a very low risk to people in the United States.\nFor the most up-to-date information, please visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) website:\nwww.cdc.gov/vhf/ebola\n.\nCauses\nWHERE EBOLA OCCURS\nEbola was discovered in 1976 near the Ebola River in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Since then, several small outbreaks have occurred in Africa. The 2014 outbreak was the largest."}

There is no evidence that the virus that causes Ebola is spread through the air or water. A person who has Ebola can't spread the disease until symptoms appear.\nEbola can only spread between humans by direct contact with infected body fluids including but not limited to urine, saliva, sweat, feces, vomit, breast milk, and semen."}

The virus can enter the body through a break in the skin or through mucous membranes, including the eyes, nose, and mouth.\nEbola can also spread by contact with any surfaces, objects, or materials that have been in contact with body fluids from a sick person, such as:\nBedclothes and bedding\nClothing\nBandages\nNeedles and syringes\nMedical equipment\nIn Africa, Ebola may also be spread by:\nHandling infected wild animals hunted for food (bushmeat)\nContact with blood or body fluids of infected animals\nContact with infected bats\nEbola does not spread through:\nAir\nWater\nFood\nInsects (mosquitoes)\nHealth care workers and people caring for sick relatives are at high risk for developing Ebola because they are more likely to come in to direct contact with body fluids. The proper use of personal protective equipment\npersonal protective equipment\n(PPE) greatly reduces this risk.\nSymptoms\nThe time between exposure and when symptoms occur (incubation period) is 2 to 21 days."}

A person also may be more likely to survive if they receive good medical care.\nPeople who survive Ebola are immune from the virus for 10 years or more. They can no longer spread Ebola. It is not known whether they can be infected with a different species of Ebola. However, men who survive can carry the Ebola virus in their sperm for as long as 3 months."}

If you plan to travel to one of the countries where Ebola is present, the CDC recommends taking the following steps to prevent illness:\nPractice careful hygiene. Wash your hands with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer."}
