On the other hand, if you have symptoms of a\nbladder or kidney infection\n, bacteria will often be present and growing in your urine.\nSometimes, your health care provider may check your urine for bacteria, even when you do not have any symptoms. If enough bacteria are found in your urine, you have asymptomatic bacteriuria.\nCauses\nAsymptomatic bacteriuria occurs in a small number of healthy people. It affects women more often than men."}

Most people with no urinary tract symptoms do not need this test.\nYou may need a urine culture done as a screening test, even without symptoms, if:\nYou are pregnant\nYou have a surgery or procedure planned that involves the bladder, prostate, or other parts of the urinary tract\nTo make the diagnosis of asymptomatic bacteriuria, the culture must show a large growth of bacteria.\nIn men, only one culture needs to show growth of bacteria\nIn women, two different cultures must show growth of bacteria\nTreatment\nMost people who have bacteria growing in their urine, but no symptoms, do not need treatment. This is because the bacteria are not causing any harm. In fact, treating people with this problem may make it harder to treat infections in the future.\nHowever, for some people getting a urinary tract infection is more likely or may cause more severe problems."}
