Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSecretin stimulation test\nSecretin stimulation test\nThe secretin stimulation test measures the ability of the pancreas to respond to a hormone called secretin. The small intestine produces secretin when partially digested food from the stomach moves into the area.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe health care provider inserts a tube through your nose and into your stomach. The tube is then moved into the first part of the small intestine (\nduodenum\n). You are given secretin through a vein (intravenously). The fluids released from the pancreas into the duodenum are removed through the tube over the next 1 to 2 hours.\nSometimes, the fluid can be collected during an upper GI endoscopy.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will be asked to not eat or drink anything, including water, for up to 12 hours before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may have a gagging feeling as the tube is inserted.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nSecretin causes the pancreas to release a fluid that contains  digestive enzymes."}

These enzymes break down food and help the body absorb nutrients.\nThe secretin stimulation test is done to check the digestive function of the pancreas. The following diseases may prevent the pancreas from working properly:\nChronic pancreatitis\nCystic fibrosis\nPancreatic cancer\nIn these conditions, there may be a lack of digestive enzymes or other chemicals in the fluid that comes from the pancreas. This can reduce the body's ability to digest food and absorb nutrients.\nNormal Results\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly depending on the lab doing the test. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal values may mean that the pancreas is not working properly.\nRisks\nThere is a slight risk of the tube being placed through the windpipe and into the lungs, instead of through the esophagus and into the stomach.\nAlternative Names\nPancreatic function test\nImages\nSecretin stimulation test\nReferences\nPandol SJ."}
