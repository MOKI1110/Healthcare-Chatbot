A person must inherit a copy of the variant gene from each parent to develop the condition.\nFD occurs most often in people of Eastern European Jewish ancestry (Ashkenazi Jews). It is caused by a change to a gene. It is rare in the general population.\nSymptoms\nFD affects the nerves in the autonomic (involuntary) nervous system. These nerves manage daily body functions such as blood pressure, heart rate, sweating, bowel and bladder emptying, digestion, and the senses.\nSymptoms of FD are present at birth and may grow worse over time."}

A genetic counselor can help teach you about the condition and direct you to support groups in your area.\nPrevention\nGenetic DNA testing is very accurate for FD. It may be used for diagnosing people with the condition or those who carry the gene. It can also be used for prenatal diagnosis.\nPeople of Eastern European Jewish background and families with a history of FD may wish to seek\ngenetic counseling\nif they are thinking of having children.\nAlternative Names\nRiley-Day syndrome; FD; Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy - type III (HSAN III); Autonomic crises - familial dysautonomia\nImages\nChromosomes and DNA\nReferences\nDugoff L, Wapner RJ.
