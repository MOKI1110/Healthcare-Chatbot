Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nGonorrhea\nGonorrhea\nGonorrhea is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI).\nCauses\nGonorrhea is caused by the bacteria\nNeisseria gonorrhoeae\n. Any type of sex can spread gonorrhea. You can get it through contact with the mouth, throat, eyes, urethra, vagina, penis, or anus.\nOver one million cases occur in the United States each year.\nThe bacteria grow in warm, moist areas of the body. This can include the tube that carries urine out of the body (urethra). In women, the bacteria may be found in the reproductive tract (which includes the fallopian tubes, uterus, and cervix). The bacteria can also grow in the eyes.\nHealth care providers are required by law to report all cases of gonorrhea to the local Department of Health. The goal of this law is to make sure the person gets proper follow-up care and treatment."}

The goal of this law is to make sure the person gets proper follow-up care and treatment. Sexual partners also need to be found, tested, and treated.\nYou are more likely to develop this infection if:\nYou have multiple sex partners.\nYou have a partner with a past history of any STI.\nYou do not use a condom during sex.\nYou abuse alcohol or illegal substances.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of gonorrhea most often appear 2 to 5 days after infection. However, it may take up to a month for symptoms to appear in men.\nSome people do not have symptoms. They may not know that they have caught the infection, so do not seek treatment. This increases the risk of complications and the chances of passing the infection on to another person.\nSymptoms in men include:\nBurning and pain while urinating\nNeed to urinate urgently or more often\nDischarge from the penis (white, yellow, or green in color)\nRed or swollen opening of penis (urethra)\nTender or swollen testicles\nSore throat (gonococcal pharyngitis)\nSymptoms in women can be very mild. They can be mistaken for another type of infection."}

This is called a Gram stain. This method is fast, but it is not the most certain.\nGonorrhea is most accurately detected with DNA tests. DNA tests are useful for screening. The ligase chain reaction (LCR) test is one of the tests. DNA tests are quicker than cultures."}

These tests can be performed on urine samples, which are easier to collect than samples from the genital area.\nPrior to DNA tests, cultures (cells that grow in a lab dish) were used to provide proof of gonorrhea, but are less commonly used now.\nSamples for a culture are most often taken from the cervix, vagina, urethra, anus, or throat. Rarely, samples are taken from joint fluid or blood. Cultures can often provide an early diagnosis within 24 hours."}

A confirmed diagnosis is available within 72 hours.\nIf you have gonorrhea, you should ask to be tested for other sexually transmitted infections, including chlamydia, syphilis, HIV, herpes, and hepatitis.\nScreening for gonorrhea in asymptomatic people should take place in the following groups:\nSexually active females 24 years and younger\nWomen older than 24 years who are at increased risk for infection\nIt is unclear whether screening men for gonorrhea is beneficial.\nTreatment\nA number of different antibiotics may be used for treating this type of infection.\nYou may receive one large dose of oral antibiotics or take a smaller dose for seven days.\nYou may be given an antibiotic injection or shot, and then be given antibiotic pills. Some types of pills are taken one time in the provider's office. Other types are taken at home for up to a week.\nMore severe cases of PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) may require you to stay in the hospital."}

Your provider will determine the best treatment.\nAbout one half of the women with gonorrhea are also infected with\nchlamydia\n. Chlamydia is treated at the same time as a gonorrhea infection with additional antibiotics.\nYou will need a follow-up visit 7 days after treatment if your symptoms include joint pain, skin rash, or more severe pelvic or abdomen pain. Tests will be done to make sure the infection is gone.\nSexual partners must be tested and treated to prevent passing the infection back and forth. You and your partner must finish all of the antibiotics. Use condoms until you both have finished taking your antibiotics. If you've contracted gonorrhea or chlamydia, you are less likely to contract either disease again if you always use condoms.\nAll sexual contacts of the person with gonorrhea should be contacted and tested."}

Gonorrhea that has spread is a more serious infection. Most of the time, it gets better with treatment.\nPossible Complications\nComplications in women may include:\nInfections that spread to the fallopian tubes which can cause scarring. This can cause problems getting pregnant at a later time. It can also lead to chronic pelvic pain,\nPID\n,\ninfertility\n, and\nectopic pregnancy\n."}

Safe sex practices include screening for STIs in all sexual partners, using condoms consistently, having fewer sexual contacts.\nAsk your provider if you should receive the\nhepatitis B vaccine\n-link and the\nHPV vaccine\n-link.
