The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina.\nCauses\nWorldwide, cervical cancer is the fourth most common type of cancer in women. It is much less common in the United States because of the widespread use of\nPap tests\nto screen women for cervical cancer or its precursors.\nCervical cancer starts in the cells on the surface of the cervix. There are two types of cells on the surface of the cervix, squamous and columnar (gland cells). Most cervical cancers are from squamous cells.\nCervical cancer usually develops slowly. It starts as a precancerous condition called\ndysplasia\n. This condition can be detected by a Pap test and is nearly 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer."}

It starts as a precancerous condition called\ndysplasia\n. This condition can be detected by a Pap test and is nearly 100% treatable. It can take years for dysplasia to develop into cervical cancer. Most women who are diagnosed with cervical cancer today have not had regular Pap tests or the HPV vaccine, or they have not followed up on abnormal Pap test results.\nAlmost all cervical cancers are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a common virus that is spread through skin-to-skin contact and also by sexual intercourse. There are many different types (strains) of HPV. Some strains lead to cervical as well as other cancers. Other strains can cause\ngenital warts\n. Others do not cause any problems at all.\nA woman's sexual behavior can increase her risk for developing cervical cancer."}

Risky sexual practices include:\nHaving sex at an early age\nHaving multiple sexual partners\nHaving a partner or many partners who take part in high-risk sexual activities\nOther risk factors for cervical cancer include:\nNot getting the\nHPV vaccine\nBeing economically disadvantaged\nHaving a mother who took the medicine diethylstilbestrol (DES) during pregnancy in the early 1960s to prevent miscarriage\nHaving a weakened immune system\nSymptoms\nMost of the time, early cervical cancer has no symptoms. Symptoms that may occur include:\nAbnormal vaginal bleeding between periods\n, after intercourse, or after menopause\nVaginal discharge that does not stop, and may be pale, watery, pink, brown, bloody, or foul-smelling\nPeriods that become heavier and last longer than usual\nCervical cancer may spread to the vagina, lymph nodes, bladder, intestines, lungs, bones, and liver. Often, there are no problems or symptoms until the cancer is advanced and has spread."}

Special tests and tools are needed to spot such conditions:\nA Pap test screens for precancers and cancer, but does not make a final diagnosis.\nDepending on your age, the\nHPV DNA test\nmay be done along with a Pap test to screen for cervical cancer. Or it may be used after a woman has had an abnormal Pap test result. It may also be used as the first test. Talk to your health care provider about which test or tests are right for you.\nIf abnormal changes are found, the cervix is usually examined under magnification. This procedure is called\ncolposcopy\n. Pieces of tissue might be removed (biopsied) during this procedure."}

This procedure is called\ncolposcopy\n. Pieces of tissue might be removed (biopsied) during this procedure. This tissue is then sent to a lab for examination.\nA procedure called a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) may also be done. This uses an electrified metal loop to remove some tissue from the cervix. If this is not feasible, a larger procedure called a\ncone biopsy\nmay be done. This is a procedure that removes a cone-shaped wedge from the front of the cervix.\nIf cervical cancer is diagnosed, the provider will order more tests. These help determine how far the cancer has spread. This is called\ncancer staging\n. Tests may include:\nChest x-ray\nCT scan of the abdomen and pelvis\nCystoscopy\nIntravenous pyelogram (IVP)\nMRI of the abdomen and pelvis\nPET scan\nTreatment\nTreatment of cervical cancer depends on:\nThe stage of the cancer\nThe size and shape of the tumor\nThe woman's age and general health\nHer desire to have children in the future\nEarly cervical cancer can be cured by removing or destroying the precancerous or cancerous tissue."}

This is why Pap tests done at the recommended times are so important to prevent cervical cancer, or catch it at an early stage. There are surgical ways to cure cervical cancer without removing the uterus or seriously damaging the cervix, so that a woman can still have children in the future.\nTypes of surgery for cervical precancer, and on occasion, very small early cervical cancer include:\nLEEP -- uses electricity to remove abnormal tissue.\nCold knife cone -- uses a scalpel to remove abnormal tissue.\nCryotherapy -- freezes abnormal cells.\nLaser therapy -- uses light to burn abnormal tissue.\nHysterectomy\nmay be done for women with precancer who have undergone multiple LEEP procedures, or who are not interested in further childbearing.\nTreatment for more advanced cervical cancer may include:\nRadical hysterectomy, which removes the uterus and much of the surrounding tissues, including lymph nodes and the upper part of the vagina."}

The vaccine prevents most types of HPV infection that cause cervical cancer. Your provider can tell you if the vaccine is right for you.\nPractice safer sex\n. Using condoms during sex reduces the risk for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\nLimit the number of sexual partners you have. Avoid partners who are active in high-risk sexual behaviors.\nGet Pap tests as often as your provider recommends."}
