They are often red or blue in color. They usually appear in the legs but can occur in other parts of the body.\nNormally, valves in your veins keep your blood flowing up toward the heart, so the blood does not collect in one place. The valves in varicose veins are either damaged or missing. This causes the veins to become filled with blood, particularly when you are standing.\nVein stripping is used to remove or tie off a large vein in the leg called the superficial saphenous vein. This helps treat varicose veins.\nVein stripping usually takes about 1 to 1 1/2 hours. You may receive either:\nGeneral anesthesia\n, in which you will be asleep and unable to feel pain.\nSpinal anesthesia\n, which will make the lower half of your body feel numb."}

You may receive either:\nGeneral anesthesia\n, in which you will be asleep and unable to feel pain.\nSpinal anesthesia\n, which will make the lower half of your body feel numb. You may also get medicine to help you relax.\nDuring surgery:\nYour surgeon will make 2 or 3 small cuts in your leg.\nThe cuts are near the top, middle, and bottom of your damaged vein. One is in your groin. The other will be farther down your leg, either in your calf or ankle.\nYour surgeon will then thread a thin, flexible plastic wire into the vein through your groin and guide the wire through the vein toward the other cut farther down your leg.\nThe wire is then tied to the vein and pulled out through the lower cut, which pulls the vein out with it.\nIf you have other damaged veins near the surface of your skin, your surgeon may also make small cuts over them to remove them or tie them off."}

This is called ambulatory phlebectomy.\nYour surgeon will close the cuts with stitches.\nYou will wear bandages and compression stockings on your leg after the procedure.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nYour health care provider may recommend vein stripping for:\nVaricose veins that cause problems with blood flow\nLeg pain and heaviness\nSkin changes or sores that are caused by too much pressure in the veins\nBlood clots or swelling in the veins\nImproving the appearance of your leg\nVaricose veins that can't be treated with newer procedures\nToday, surgeons are rarely performing vein stripping surgeries because there are newer,\nnon-surgical\nways to treat varicose veins that don't require general anesthesia and are done without an overnight hospital stay. These treatments are less painful, have better results, and have a much faster recovery time.\nRisks\nVein stripping is generally safe."}

You may need to keep them wrapped for several weeks.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSurgical vein stripping reduces pain and improves the appearance of your leg. Rarely, vein stripping causes scars. Mild leg swelling can occur."}
