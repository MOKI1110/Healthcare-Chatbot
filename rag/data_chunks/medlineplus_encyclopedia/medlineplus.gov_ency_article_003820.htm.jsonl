Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPercutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram\nPercutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram\nA percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTC) is an\nx-ray\nof the bile ducts. These are the tubes that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is performed in a radiology department by an interventional radiologist.\nYou will be asked to lie on your back on the x-ray table. Your health care provider will clean the upper right and middle area of your belly area and then apply a numbing medicine.\nX-rays and ultrasound are used to help the radiologist locate your liver and bile ducts. A long, thin, flexible tube is then inserted through a needle and the skin into the liver. Your provider injects dye, called contrast medium, into the bile ducts. Contrast helps highlight certain areas so they can be seen. More x-rays are taken as the dye flows through the bile ducts into the small intestine. This can be seen on a video monitor.\nYou will be given medicine to calm you (sedation) for this procedure."}

Rarely, you may receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n, so you will be asleep.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nInform your provider if you are pregnant or have a\nbleeding disorder\n.\nYou will be given a hospital gown to wear and you will be asked to remove all jewelry.\nYou will be asked not to eat or drink anything for 6 hours prior to the exam.\nTell your provider if you are taking any blood thinners such as Warfarin (coumadin), Plavix (clopidogrel), Pradaxa, or Xarelto.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThere will be a sting as the anesthetic is given. You may have some discomfort as the needle is advanced into the liver. You will have sedation for this procedure.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test can help diagnose the cause of a bile duct blockage.\nBile is a liquid released by the liver. It contains cholesterol, bile salts, and waste products. Bile salts help your body break down (digest) fats."}

It contains cholesterol, bile salts, and waste products. Bile salts help your body break down (digest) fats. A blockage of the bile duct can lead to jaundice (yellow discoloration of the skin), itching of the skin, or infection of the liver, gallbladder or pancreas.\nWhen it is performed, PTC is most often the first part of a two-step process to relieve or treat a blockage.\nThe PTC makes a \"roadmap\" of the bile ducts, which can be used to plan the treatment.\nAfter the roadmap is done, the blockage can be treated by either placing a stent or a thin tube called a drain.\nThe drain or stent will help the body get rid of the bile from the body. That process is called percutaneous biliary drainage (PTBD).\nNormal Results\nThe\nbile\nducts are normal in size and appearance for the age of the person.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThe results may show that the ducts are enlarged. This may mean the ducts are at least partially blocked. The blockage may be caused by scarring or stones. It may also indicate cancer in the bile ducts, liver, pancreas, or gallbladder."}

There is also a small risk for:\nDamage to nearby organs\nDamage to the liver\nExcessive blood loss\nBlood poisoning\n(sepsis)\nInflammation of the bile ducts\nInfection\nConsiderations\nMost of the time, this test is done after an\nendoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography\n(ERCP) test has been tried first. The PTC may be done if an ERCP test cannot be performed or has failed to clear the blockage.\nA magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is another, noninvasive imaging method, based on\nmagnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI). It also provides views of the bile ducts, but it is not always possible to do this exam."}
