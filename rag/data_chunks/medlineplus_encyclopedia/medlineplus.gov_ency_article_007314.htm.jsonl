Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAbsent pulmonary valve\nAbsent pulmonary valve\nAbsent pulmonary valve is a rare defect in which the pulmonary valve is either missing or poorly formed. Oxygen-poor blood flows through this valve from the heart to the lungs, where it picks up fresh oxygen. This condition is present at birth (congenital).\nCauses\nAbsent pulmonary valve occurs when the pulmonary valve does not form or develop properly while the baby is in the mother's womb. When present, it often occurs as part of a heart condition called\ntetralogy of Fallot\n. It is found in about 3% to 6% of people who have tetralogy of Fallot.\nWhen the pulmonary valve is missing or does not work well, blood does not flow efficiently to the lungs to get enough oxygen.\nIn most cases, there is also a hole between the left and right ventricles of the heart (\nventricular septal defect\n)."}

This defect will also lead to low-oxygen blood being pumped out to the body.\nThe skin will have a blue appearance (cyanosis), because the body's blood contains a low amount of oxygen.\nAbsent pulmonary valve also results in very enlarged (dilated) branch pulmonary arteries (the arteries that carry blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen). They can become so enlarged that they press on the tubes that bring the oxygen into the lungs (bronchi)."}

Infants without severe symptoms most often have surgery within the first 3 to 6 months of life or later.\nDepending on the type of other heart defects the infant has, surgery may involve:\nClosing the hole in the wall between the left and right ventricles of the heart (ventricular septal defect)\nClosing a blood vessel that connects the aorta to the pulmonary artery (ductus arteriosis)\nEnlarging the flow from the right ventricle to the lungs\nTypes of surgery for absent pulmonary valve include:\nMoving the pulmonary artery to the front of the aorta and away from the airways\nRebuilding the artery wall in the lungs to reduce pressure on the airways (pulmonary plication and reduction arterioplasty)\nRebuilding the windpipe and breathing tubes to the lungs\nReplacing the abnormal pulmonary valve with one taken from human or animal tissue\nInfants with severe breathing sym"}
