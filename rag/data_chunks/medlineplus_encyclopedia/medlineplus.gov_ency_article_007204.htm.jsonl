Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSoy\nSoy\nHumans have been eating soybeans for almost 5000 years. The soybean is high in protein. The quality of protein from soy equals that of protein from animal foods.\nFunction\nSoy in your diet can lower cholesterol. Many research studies support this claim. The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) agrees that 25 grams per day of soy protein may reduce the risk for\nheart disease\n. Health benefits of soy products may be due to their high levels of polyunsaturated fats, fiber, minerals, vitamins, and low saturated fat content.\nIsoflavones that occur naturally in soy products may play a part in preventing some hormone-related cancers. Eating a diet that has a moderate amount of soy prior to adulthood may lower the risk for\nbreast\nand ovarian cancer in women. However, the benefits of soy in women who are postmenopausal or who already have cancer remain unclear."}

However, the benefits of soy in women who are postmenopausal or who already have cancer remain unclear. Whole soy in products like tofu, soy milk, and edamame is preferred to processed soy such as the soy protein isolates that are found in many snack products and imitation meat products.\nThe benefit of using isoflavone supplements in food or pills in the prevention or treatment of cancer has not been proven. The ability of these supplements to ease menopause symptoms such as hot flashes also is unproven.\nFood Sources\nNot all soy products contain the same amount of protein. The following list ranks the protein content of some common soy foods. Highest protein items are at the top of the list.\nSoy protein isolate (added to many soy food products, including soy sausage patties and soybean burgers)\nSoy flour\nWhole soybeans\nTempeh\nTofu\nSoy milk\nTo find out about protein content in a soy-based food:\nCheck the Nutrition Facts label to see the grams of protein per serving.\nAlso look at the list of ingredients."}

If a product contains isolated soy protein (or soy protein isolate), the protein content should be fairly high.\nNote:\nThere is a difference between soy supplements in the form of tablets or capsules and soy protein products. Most soy supplements are made of concentrated soy isoflavones. These substances may help relieve symptoms of menopause. However, there is not enough evidence to support soy isoflavones for other health purposes, such as lowering cholesterol.\nSide Effects\nPeople who are not allergic to soy do not have serious side effects from eating these foods. Mild side effects of consuming products with added soy protein isolate may include stomach aches, constipation, and\ndiarrhea\n.\nRecommendations\nIn adults, 25 grams per day of soy protein may reduce the risk for heart disease.\nSoy foods and soy-based infant formula are often used for children with dairy allergies. No studies have shown whether isolated soy protein or isoflavone supplements are useful or safe for this group."}
