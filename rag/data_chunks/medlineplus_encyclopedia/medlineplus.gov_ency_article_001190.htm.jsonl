Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMuscular dystrophy\nMuscular dystrophy\nMuscular dystrophy (MD) is a group of inherited disorders that cause\nmuscle weakness\nand loss of muscle tissue, which get worse over time.\nCauses\nInherited conditions are passed down through families. They may become manifest in childhood or adulthood. There are many different types of MD. They include:\nBecker muscular dystrophy\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy\nEmery-Dreifuss muscular dystrophy\nFacioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy\nLimb-girdle muscular dystrophy\nOculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy\nMyotonic muscular dystrophy\nSymptoms\nMD can affect adults, but the more severe forms tend to occur in early childhood.\nSymptoms vary among the different types of MD. All of the muscles may be affected. Or, only specific groups of muscles may be affected, such as those around the pelvis, shoulder, or face."}

All of the muscles may be affected. Or, only specific groups of muscles may be affected, such as those around the pelvis, shoulder, or face. The muscle weakness slowly gets worse and symptoms may include:\nDelayed development of muscle motor skills\nDifficulty using one or more muscle groups\nDrooling\nEyelid drooping\n(ptosis)\nFrequent falls\nLoss of strength in a muscle or group of muscles as an adult\nLoss in muscle size\nProblems walking\n(delayed walking)\nMuscle contractures\nIntellectual disability is present in some types of MD.\nSeveral types of MD affect only males.\nExams and Tests\nA physical examination and your medical history will help your health care provider determine the type of MD. Specific muscle groups are affected by different types of MD.\nThe exam may show:\nWeakness of certain muscles\nAbnormally curved spine (\nscoliosis\n)\nJoint contractures (\nclubfoot\n, claw-hand, or others)\nLow muscle tone (\nhypotonia\n)\nSome types of MD involve the heart muscle, causing\ncardiomyopathy\nor  abnormal heart rhythm (\narrhythmia\n).\nOften, there is a loss of muscle mass (\nwasting\n)."}

This may be hard to see because some types of MD cause a buildup of fat and connective tissue that makes the muscle appear larger. This is called pseudohypertrophy.\nmuscle biopsy\nmay be used to confirm the diagnosis. In some cases, a DNA blood test may be all that is needed.\nOther tests may include:\nHeart testing --\nelectrocardiography\n(ECG)\nNerve testing --\nnerve conduction\nand\nelectromyography\n(EMG)\nUrine and blood testing, including\ncreatine phosphokinase\n(CPK) level\nGenetic testing for some forms of MD\nMuscle biopsy\nTreatment\nThere are no known cures for the various MDs. Recent advances have led to some gene therapies that are promising for the future. The goal of treatment is to control symptoms.\nPhysical therapy may help maintain muscle strength and function. Leg braces and a wheelchair can improve mobility and self-care."}

In some cases, surgery on the spine or legs may help improve function.\nCorticosteroids taken by mouth are sometimes prescribed to children with certain MDs to keep them walking for as long as possible.\nThe person should be as active as possible. No activity at all (such as bedrest) can make the disease worse.\nSome people with breathing weakness may benefit from devices to assist breathing.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\nsupport group\nwhere members share common experiences and problems.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe severity of disability depends on the type of MD. All types of MD slowly get worse, but how fast this happens varies widely.\nSome types of MD, such as Duchenne muscular dystrophy in boys, are associated with a shortened lifespan."}

Other types cause little disability and people have a normal lifespan.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nYou have symptoms of MD.\nYou have a personal or family history of MD and you are planning to have children.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling\nis advised when there is a personal or family history of MD. Women may have no symptoms, but still carry the gene for the disorder. Duchenne muscular dystrophy can be detected with about 95% accuracy by genetic studies done during pregnancy.\nAlternative Names\nInherited myopathy; MD\nImages\nSuperficial anterior muscles\nDeep anterior muscles\nTendons and muscles\nLower leg muscles\nReferences\nManzur AY.
