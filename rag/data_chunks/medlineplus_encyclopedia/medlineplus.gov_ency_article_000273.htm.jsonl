These may be as small as a grain of sand or as large as a golf ball.\nCauses\nThe cause of gallstones varies. There are two main types of gallstones:\nStones made of cholesterol -- This is the most common type. Cholesterol gallstones are not related to cholesterol level in the blood. In most cases, they are not visible on CT scans but are visible on a sonogram (ultrasound) of the abdomen.\nStones made of bilirubin -- These are called pigment stones."}

In most cases, they are not visible on CT scans but are visible on a sonogram (ultrasound) of the abdomen.\nStones made of bilirubin -- These are called pigment stones. They occur when red blood cells are destroyed and too much bilirubin is in the bile.\nGallstones are more common in:\nFemale sex\nNative Americans and people of Hispanic descent\nPeople over age 40\nPeople who are overweight\nPeople with family history of gallstones\nThe following factors also make you more likely to develop gallstones:\nBone marrow\nor solid organ transplant\nDiabetes\nFailure of the gallbladder to empty bile properly (this is more likely to happen during pregnancy)\nLiver cirrhosis\nand biliary tract infections (pigmented stones)\nMedical conditions that cause too many\nred blood cells to be destroyed\nRapid weight loss from eating a very low-calorie diet, or after weight loss surgery\nReceiving nutrition through a vein for a long period of time (intravenous feedings)\nTaking birth control pills\nSymptoms\nMany people with gallstones do not have any symptoms."}

These are often found during a routine x-ray, abdominal surgery, or other medical procedure.\nHowever, if a large\nstone blocks a tube\nor duct that drains the gallbladder, you may have a cramping pain in the middle to right upper abdomen. This is known as biliary colic. The pain goes away if the stone passes into the first part of the small intestine.\nSymptoms that may occur include:\nPain in the right upper or middle upper abdomen for at least 30 minutes. The pain may be constant or cramping."}

However, people planning weight loss surgery may need to have gallstones removed before undergoing the procedure. In general, people who have symptoms will need surgery right away or soon after the stone is found.\nA technique called\nlaparoscopic cholecystectomy\nis most commonly used."}

This procedure uses small surgical incisions, which allow for a faster recovery. A patient can often go home from the hospital within 1 day of surgery.\nIn the past, open\ncholecystectomy\n(gallbladder removal) was most often done. However, this technique is less common now.\nERCP and a procedure called a sphincterotomy may be done to find or treat\ngallstones in the common bile duct\n.\nMEDICINES\nMedicines may be given in pill form to dissolve cholesterol gallstones. However, these drugs may take 2 years or longer to work, and the stones may return after treatment ends.\nRarely, chemicals are passed into the gallbladder through a catheter. The chemical rapidly dissolves cholesterol stones. This treatment is hard to perform, so it is not done very often. The chemicals used can be toxic, and the gallstones may return.\nLITHOTRIPSY\nShock wave lithotripsy (ESWL) of the gallbladder has also been used for people who cannot have surgery."}

Your provider will give you instructions when you leave the hospital.\nThe chance of symptoms or complications from gallstone surgery is low. Nearly all people who have their gallbladder taken out by surgery do not have their symptoms return.\nPossible Complications\nBlockage by gallstones may cause swelling or infection in the:\nGallbladder (cholecystitis)\nTube that carries bile from the liver to the gallbladder and intestines (\ncholangitis\n)\nPancreas (pancreatitis)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have:\nPain in the upper part of your abdomen\nYellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes\nPrevention\nIn most people, gallstones can't be prevented."}
