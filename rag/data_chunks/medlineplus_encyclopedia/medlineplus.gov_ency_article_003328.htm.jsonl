An\nautoimmune\nliver disease means that the body's immune system attacks the liver.\nThese tests include:\nAnti-liver/kidney microsomal antibodies\nAnti-mitochondrial antibodies\nAnti-nuclear antibodies\nAnti-smooth muscle antibodies\nSerum IgG\nThe panel may also include other tests. Often, immune protein levels in the blood are also checked.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is taken from a\nvein\n.\nThe blood sample is sent to the lab for testing.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou do not need to take special steps before this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted to draw blood. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nAutoimmune disorders are a possible cause of liver disease."}

The most common of these diseases are autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cholangitis (formerly called primary biliary cirrhosis).\nThis group of tests helps your health care provider diagnose specific liver diseases.\nNormal Results\nPROTEIN LEVELS:\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Please check with your provider for the normal ranges in your particular laboratory.\nANTIBODIES:\nNegative results on all antibodies are normal.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories.

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nBlood tests for autoimmune diseases are not wholly accurate. They can have false negative results (you have the disease, but the test is negative) and false positive results (you do not have the disease, but the test is positive).\nA weakly positive or low titer positive test for autoimmune disease is often not due to any disease.\nA positive test on the panel may be a sign of autoimmune hepatitis or other autoimmune liver disease.\nIf the test is positive mostly for anti-mitochondrial antibodies, you are likely to have primary biliary cholangitis. If the immune proteins are high and albumin is low, you may have liver cirrhosis or chronic active hepatitis.\nRisks\nSlight risks from having blood drawn include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting\nor feeling lightheaded\nHematoma\n(blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nLiver disease test panel - autoimmune\nImages\nLiver\nReferences\nBowlus C, Assis DN, Goldberg D.
