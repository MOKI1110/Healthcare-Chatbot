Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nUpper airway biopsy\nUpper airway biopsy\nUpper airway biopsy is surgery to remove a small piece of tissue from the nose, mouth, and throat area. The tissue will be examined under the microscope by a pathologist.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe surgeon will spray a numbing medicine in your mouth and throat. A metal tube is inserted to hold your tongue out of the way.\nAnother numbing medicine flows through the tube down the back of the throat. This may cause you to cough at first. When the area feels thick or swollen, it is numb.\nThe test may also be performed under general anesthesia, so that you will be asleep and not feel pain.\nThe surgeon looks at the abnormal area, and removes a small piece of tissue. It is sent to the laboratory for examination.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nDO NOT eat for 6 to 12 hours before the test.\nTell your surgeon if you take a blood thinner, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin, when you schedule the biopsy. You may need to stop taking them for a little while."}

You may need to stop taking them for a little while. Never stop taking any medicines without first talking to your surgeon or health care provider.\nHow the Test will Feel\nAs the area is being numbed, you may feel like there is fluid running down the back of your throat. You may feel the need to cough or gag. And you may feel pressure or mild tugging.\nWhen the numbness wears off, your throat may feel scratchy for several days. After the test, the cough reflex will return in 1 to 2 hours. Then you may eat and drink normally.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test may be done if your provider thinks there is a problem with your upper airway."}
