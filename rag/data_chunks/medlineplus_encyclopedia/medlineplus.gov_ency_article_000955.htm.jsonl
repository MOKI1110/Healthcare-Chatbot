Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSomatic symptom disorder\nSomatic symptom disorder\nSomatic symptom disorder (SSD) occurs when a person feels extreme, exaggerated anxiety about physical symptoms. The person has such intense thoughts, feelings, and behaviors related to the symptoms, that they feel they cannot do some of the activities of daily life. They may believe routine medical problems are life threatening. This anxiety may not improve despite normal medical evaluations and test results and reassurance from their health care provider.\nA person with SSD is not faking their symptoms. Their pain and other symptoms are real. They may be caused by a medical problem. Often, no physical cause can be found. However, it is the extreme reaction and behaviors about the symptoms that are the main problem.\nCauses\nSSD usually begins by age 30. It occurs more often in women than in men. It's not clear why some people develop this condition."}

It occurs more often in women than in men. It's not clear why some people develop this condition. Certain factors may be involved:\nHaving a negative outlook\nBeing more physically and emotionally sensitive to pain and other sensations\nFamily history or upbringing\nGenetics\nPeople who have a history of physical or sexual abuse may be more likely to have this disorder. But not everyone with SSD has a history of abuse.\nSSD is similar to\nillness anxiety disorder\n(hypochondria). This is when people are overly anxious about becoming sick or developing a serious disease. They fully expect they will become very ill at some point. Unlike SSD, with illness anxiety disorder, there are few or no actual physical symptoms.\nSymptoms\nCommon physical symptoms that occur with SSD include:\nPain\nFatigue or weakness\nShortness of breath\nSymptoms may be mild to severe. There may be one or more symptoms of any type. They may come and go or change over time."}

Symptoms may be due to a medical condition but they also may have no clear cause.\nHow people feel and behave in response to these physical sensations are the main symptoms of SSD. These reactions must persist for 6 months or more. People with SSD may:\nFeel extreme anxiety about symptoms\nFeel concern that mild symptoms are a sign of serious disease\nGo to the provider for multiple tests and procedures, but not believe the results if they are normal\nFeel that the provider does not take their symptoms seriously enough or has not done a good job treating the problem\nSpend a lot of time and energy dealing with health concerns\nHave trouble functioning because of thoughts, feelings, and behaviors about symptoms\nExams and Tests\nYou will have a complete physical exam. Your provider may do certain tests to find any physical causes of your symptoms. The types of tests that are done depend on what symptoms you have.\nYour provider may refer you to a mental health provider."}
