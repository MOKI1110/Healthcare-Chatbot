The carpal tunnel is an area in your wrist that is created by wrist bones and which contains the median nerve and tendons. You may feel aching, burning, numbness, or tingling in your palm, wrist, thumb, or fingers. The thumb muscle can become weak, making it difficult to grasp things. Pain may go up to your elbow.\nCarpal tunnel syndrome occurs when the median nerve gets compressed at the wrist because of swelling of structures in the carpal tunnel or narrowing due to the bones of the carpal tunnel. This is the nerve in the wrist that allows feeling and movement to parts of the hand."}

Swelling can occur if you:\nDo repetitive movements with your wrist, such as typing on a computer keyboard, using a computer mouse, playing racquetball or handball, sewing, painting, writing, or using a vibrating tool\nAre pregnant, menopausal, or overweight\nHave diabetes, premenstrual syndrome, an underactive thyroid, or rheumatoid arthritis\nInjury:\nWrist pain with bruising and swelling is often a sign of an injury. Signs of a possible\nbroken bone\ninclude deformed joints and inability to move the wrist, hand, or a finger. There can also be cartilage injuries in the wrist. Other common injuries include\nsprain\n,\nstrain\n,\ntendinitis\n, and\nbursitis\n.\nArthritis:\nArthritis\nis another common cause of wrist pain, swelling, and stiffness. There are many types of arthritis:\nOsteoarthritis\noccurs with age and overuse.\nRheumatoid arthritis\ngenerally affects both wrists.\nPsoriatic arthritis\nusually accompanies psoriasis.\nInfectious arthritis is a medical emergency."}

Signs of an infection include redness and warmth of the wrist, fever above 100 °F (37.7 °C), and recent illness.\nOther Causes\nGout\n: This occurs when your body produces too much uric acid, a waste product. The uric acid forms crystals in the joints, rather than being excreted in the urine.\nPseudogout\n: This occurs when calcium pyrophosphate crystals deposit in the joints, causing pain, redness, and swelling. The wrists and knees are most often affected.\nHome Care\nFor carpal tunnel syndrome, you may need to make adjustments to your work habits and environment:\nMake sure that your keyboard is low enough that your wrists are not bending upward while you type.\nTake plenty of breaks from activities that aggravate the pain. When typing, stop often to rest the hands, if only for a moment."}

When typing, stop often to rest the hands, if only for a moment. Rest your hands on their sides, not the wrists.\nAn occupational therapist can show you ways to ease pain and swelling and stop the syndrome from coming back.\nOver-the-counter pain medicines, such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or acetaminophen can relieve pain and swelling.\nVarious typing pads, split keyboards, and wrist splints (braces) are designed to relieve wrist pain. These may help symptoms. Try a few different kinds to see if any of them help.\nYou may only need to wear a wrist splint at night while you sleep. This helps reduce the swelling. If this does not help, you may need to wear the splint during the day as well.\nApply warm or cold compresses a few times during the day.\nFor a recent injury:\nRest your wrist. Keep it elevated above the heart level to reduce any swelling.\nApply an ice pack to the tender and swollen area. Wrap the ice in cloth. Do not place ice directly on the skin."}

Follow package instructions on how much to take. DO NOT take more than the recommended amount.\nAsk your health care provider if it's OK to wear a splint for several days.
