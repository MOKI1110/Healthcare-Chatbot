The sample is then examined for\ncancer\n, infection, or\nlung disease\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nAn open lung biopsy is done in the hospital using\ngeneral anesthesia\n. This means you will be asleep and pain free. A tube will be placed through your mouth down your throat, and into your windpipe (trachea) to help you breathe.\nThe surgery is done in the following way:\nAfter cleaning the skin, the surgeon makes a small cut in the left or right side of your chest.\nThe ribs are gently separated.\nA viewing scope may be inserted through a small hole between the ribs to see the area to be biopsied.\nTissue is taken from the lung and sent to a lab for examination.\nAfter surgery, the wound is closed with stitches.\nYour surgeon may leave a small plastic tube in your chest to prevent air and fluid from building up.\nThe breathing tube may not be able to be removed right after surgery."}

So, you may need to be on a\nbreathing machine\nfor some time.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou should tell your surgeon if you are pregnant, allergic to any medicines, or if you have a bleeding problem. Be sure to tell your surgeon about all the medicines you take, including herbs, supplements, and those bought without a prescription.\nFollow your surgeon's instructions for not eating or drinking before the procedure.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen you wake up after the procedure, you will feel drowsy for several hours.\nThere will be some tenderness and pain where the surgical cut is located. Most surgeons inject a long-acting local anesthetic at the surgical cut site so that you will have very little pain right afterward.\nYou may have a sore throat from the tube."}
