Doctors believe that the seizure activity may help the brain \"rewire\" itself, which helps relieve symptoms. ECT is generally safe and effective.\nECT is most often done in a hospital while you are asleep and pain free (\ngeneral anesthesia\n):\nYou receive medicine to relax you (muscle relaxant). You also receive another medicine (short-acting anesthetic) to put you briefly to sleep and prevent you from feeling pain.\nElectrodes are placed on your scalp. Two electrodes monitor your brain activity. Another two electrodes are used to deliver the electric current.\nWhen you are asleep, a small amount of electric current is delivered to your head to cause seizure activity in the brain. It lasts for about 40 seconds. You receive medicine to prevent the seizure from spreading throughout your body."}

As a result, your hands or feet move only slightly during the procedure.\nECT is usually given once every 2 to 5 days for a total of 6 to 12 sessions. Sometimes more sessions are needed.\nSeveral minutes after the treatment, you wake up. You do not remember the treatment. You are taken to a recovery area. There, your health care team monitors you closely. When you have recovered, you can go home.\nYou need to have an adult drive you home. Be sure to arrange this ahead of time.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nECT is a highly effective treatment for depression, most commonly severe depression."}

It can be very helpful for treating depression in people who:\nAre having delusions or other psychotic symptoms with their depression\nAre pregnant and severely depressed\nAre suicidal\nCan't take antidepressant medicines\nHaven't responded fully to antidepressant medicines\nLess often, ECT is used for conditions such as mania, catatonia, and\npsychosis\nthat do not improve enough with other treatments.\nRisks\nECT has received bad press, in part because of its potential for causing memory problems. Since ECT was introduced in the 1930s, the dose of electricity used in the procedure has been decreased significantly. Also, it may be given with the electrode placed on only one side of the skull (unilateral ECT)."}

Discuss your medical conditions and any concerns with your health care provider when deciding whether ECT is right for you.\nBefore the Procedure\nBecause general anesthesia is used for this procedure, you will be asked not to eat or drink before ECT.\nAsk your provider whether you should take any daily medicines in the morning before ECT.\nAfter the Procedure\nAfter a successful course of ECT, you will receive medicines or less frequent ECT to reduce the risk of another episode of depression.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSome people report mild confusion and headache after ECT. These symptoms should only last for a short while.\nAlternative Names\nShock treatment; Shock therapy; ECT; Depression - ECT; Bipolar - ECT\nReferences\nLuccarelli J, Henry ME, Fernandez-Robles C, Cusin C, Camprodon JA, Dougherty DD.
