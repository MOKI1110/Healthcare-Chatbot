Contrast dye is placed into the bladder through the urethra. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will lie on a table. A numbing medicine is applied to the opening to your urethra. A flexible tube (catheter) is inserted through your urethra into the bladder. Contrast dye flows through the tube until your bladder is full or you tell the technician that your bladder feels full.\nWhen the bladder is full, you are placed in different positions so that x-rays can be taken. A final x-ray is taken once the catheter is removed and you have emptied your bladder. This reveals how well your bladder empties.\nThe test takes about 30 to 60 minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou must sign an informed consent form. You must empty your bladder before the test."}

You will be asked questions to determine if you may have an\nallergic reaction\nto the contrast dye, or if you have a current infection that could make inserting the catheter difficult.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel some pressure when the catheter is inserted. You will feel an urge to urinate when the contrast dye enters the bladder. The person performing the test will stop the flow when the pressure becomes uncomfortable. The urge to urinate will continue throughout the test.\nAfter the test, the area where the catheter was placed may feel sore when you urinate.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou may need this test to examine your bladder for problems such as holes or tears, or to find out why you have repeated bladder infections."}
