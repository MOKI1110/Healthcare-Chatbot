Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nExchange transfusion\nExchange transfusion\nExchange transfusion is a potentially life-saving procedure that is done to counteract the effects of serious jaundice or changes in the blood due to diseases such as sickle cell anemia.\nThe procedure involves slowly removing the person's blood and replacing it with fresh donor blood or plasma.\nDescription\nAn exchange transfusion requires that the person's blood be removed and replaced. In most cases, this involves placing one or more thin tubes, called catheters, into a blood vessel. The exchange transfusion is done in cycles, each one most often lasts a few minutes.\nThe person's blood is slowly withdrawn (most often about 5 to 20 mL at a time, depending on the person's size and the severity of illness). An equal amount of fresh, prewarmed blood or plasma flows into the person's body."}

This cycle is repeated until the correct volume of blood has been replaced.\nAfter the exchange transfusion, catheters may be left in place in case the procedure needs to be repeated.\nIn diseases such as sickle cell anemia, blood is removed and replaced with donor blood.\nIn conditions such as\nneonatal polycythemia\n, a specific amount of the child's blood is removed and replaced with a normal saline solution, plasma (the clear liquid part of blood), or albumin (a normal blood protein)."}

This decreases the total number of red blood cells in the body and makes it easier for blood to flow through the body.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nAn exchange transfusion may be needed to treat the following conditions:\nDangerously high red blood cell count in a newborn (neonatal polycythemia)\nRh-induced hemolytic disease of the newborn\nSevere disturbances in body chemistry\nSevere newborn jaundice that does not respond to\nphototherapy with bili lights\nSevere sickle cell crisis\nToxic effects of certain drugs\nRisks\nGeneral risks are the same as with any transfusion. Other possible complications include:\nBlood clots\nChanges in blood chemistry (high or low potassium, low calcium, low glucose, change in acid-base balance in the blood)\nHeart and lung problems\nInfection (very low risk due to careful screening of blood)\nShock if not enough blood is replaced\nAfter the Procedure\nThe person may need to be monitored for several days in the hospital after the transfusion."}
