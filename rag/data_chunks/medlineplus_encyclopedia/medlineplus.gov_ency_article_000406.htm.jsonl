This hormone is made in the\nadrenal glands\n. Too much cortisol can be due to various problems. One of the causes is if there is too much of the hormone ACTH in the blood. ACTH is usually made by the pituitary in small amounts and then signals the adrenal glands to produce cortisol. Sometimes other cells outside the pituitary can make large amounts of ACTH. This is called ectopic Cushing syndrome. Ectopic means that something is occurring in an abnormal place in the body.\nEctopic Cushing syndrome is caused by\ntumors\nthat release ACTH."}

Some people have many symptoms while others have only a few. Most people with any type of Cushing syndrome have:\nRound, red, and full face (\nmoon face\n)\nSlow growth rate in children\nWeight gain with fat accumulation on the trunk, but fat loss from the arms, legs, and buttocks (central obesity)\nSkin changes that are often seen:\nSkin infections\nThick, purple stretch marks (1/2 inch or 1 centimeter or more wide) called\nstriae\non the skin of the abdomen, thighs, upper arms, and breasts\nThin skin with easy bruising\nMuscle and bone changes include:\nBackache, which occurs with routine activities\nBone pain or tenderness\nCollection of fat between the shoulders and above the collar bone\nRib and spine fractures c"}

Surgery is usually possible when the tumor is noncancerous (\nbenign\n).\nIn some cases, the tumor is cancerous and spreads to other areas of the body before your provider can discover the problem with cortisol production. Surgery may not be possible in these cases. But your provider may prescribe medicines to block cortisol production.\nSometimes removal of both adrenal glands is needed if the tumor cannot be found and medicines do not fully block cortisol production.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSurgery to remove the tumor may lead to full recovery.
