It makes the right side of the heart work harder than normal.\nCauses\nThe right side of the heart pumps blood into the pulmonary artery and then through the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Blood returns to the left side of the heart, where it is pumped to the rest of the body.\nWhen the small arteries (blood vessels) of the lungs become narrowed, they cannot carry as much blood. When this happens, pressure builds up. This is called pulmonary hypertension.\nThe heart needs to work harder to force the blood through the vessels against this pressure. Over time, this causes the right side of the heart to become larger and malfunction."}

Fast heart rate (\npalpitations\n) may be present. Over time, symptoms occur with lighter activity or even while at rest.\nOther symptoms include:\nAnkle and leg swelling\nBluish color of the lips or skin (\ncyanosis\n)\nChest pain or pressure, most often in the front of the chest\nDizziness or fainting spells\nFatigue\nIncreased abdominal size due to fluid buildup\nWeakness\nPeople with pulmonary hypertension often have symptoms that come and go.
