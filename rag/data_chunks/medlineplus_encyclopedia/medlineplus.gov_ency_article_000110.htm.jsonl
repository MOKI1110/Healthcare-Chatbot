This leads to attacks of wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.\nCauses\nAsthma\nis caused by inflammation (swelling) in the airways of the lungs. When an asthma attack occurs, the lining of the air passages swells and the muscles surrounding the airways activate. This makes the airways narrower and reduces the amount of air that can pass through.\nIn people who have sensitive airways, asthma symptoms can be triggered by breathing in substances called triggers.\nMany substances in the workplace can trigger asthma symptoms, leading to occupational asthma."}

The most common triggers are wood dust, grain dust, animal dander, fungi, or chemicals.\nThe following workers are at higher risk:\nBakers\nDetergent manufacturers\nDrug manufacturers\nFarmers\nGrain elevator workers\nLaboratory workers (especially those working with laboratory animals)\nMetal workers\nMillers\nPlastics workers\nWoodworkers\nSymptoms\nSymptoms are usually due to  narrowing of the airways and tightening spasms of the muscles lining the airways. This reduces the amount of air that can pass through, which can lead to wheezing sounds.\nSymptoms usually occur shortly after you are exposed to the substance. They often improve or go away when you leave work."}

However, symptoms may continue for years after you are no longer exposed in the workplace.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of asthma.\nTalk to your provider about getting the flu, pneumonia, COVID-19, and other vaccines.\nIf you've been diagnosed with asthma, call your provider right away if you develop a cough, shortness of breath, fever, or other signs of a lung infection, especially if you think you have the flu or COVID-19. Since your lungs are already damaged, it's very important to have the infection treated right away. This will prevent breathing problems from becoming severe, as well as further damage to your lungs.\nAlternative Names\nAsthma - occupational exposure; Irritant-induced reactive airways disease\nImages\nSpirometry\nRespiratory system\nReferences\nCorry EL, Luong AU, David B.
