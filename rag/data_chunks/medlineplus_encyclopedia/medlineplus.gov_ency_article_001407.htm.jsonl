A related but less common neuralgia affects the\nglossopharyngeal nerve\n, which provides feeling to the throat.\nNeuralgia is more common in older people, but it may occur at any age.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nIncreased sensitivity of the skin along the path of the damaged nerve, so that any touch or pressure is felt as pain\nPain along the path of the nerve that is sharp or stabbing, in the same location each episode, comes and goes (intermittent) or is constant and burning, and may get worse when the area is moved\nWeakness or complete paralysis of muscles supplied by the same nerve\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam, and ask about your symptoms.\nThe exam may show:\nAbnormal sensation in the skin\nReflex problems\nLoss of muscle mass\nLack of sweating (sweating is controlled by nerves)\nTenderness along a nerve\nTrigger points (areas where even a slight touch triggers pain)\nYou may also need to see a dentist if the pain is in your f"}

But, the following tests may be done to find the cause of the pain:\nBlood tests to check\nblood sugar\n, kidney function, and other possible causes of neuralgia\nMagnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI)\nNerve conduction study\nwith\nelectromyography\nUltrasound\nSpinal tap (\nlumbar puncture\n)\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the cause, location, and severity of the pain.\nMedicines to control pain may include:\nAntidepressants\nAntiseizure medicines\nOver-the-counter or prescription pain medicines\nPain medicines in the form of skin patches or creams\nOther treatments may include:\nShots with pain-relieving (anesthetic) medicines\nNerve blocks\nPhysical therapy (for some types of neuralgia, especially postherpetic neuralgia)"}

In rare cases, a procedure called motor cortex stimulation (MCS) is tried. An electrode is placed over part of a nerve, spinal cord, or brain and is hooked to a pulse generator under the skin. This changes how your nerves signal and it may reduce pain.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost neuralgias are not life threatening and are not signs of other life-threatening disorders. For severe pain that does not improve, see a pain specialist so that you can explore all treatment options.\nMost neuralgias respond to treatment. Attacks of pain usually come and go."}
