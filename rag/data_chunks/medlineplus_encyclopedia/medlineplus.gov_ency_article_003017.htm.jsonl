The needle passes through the skin between the thyroid cartilage and the cricoid cartilage.\nIn a hospital, before inserting the needle, a small cut may be made in the skin and the membrane between the thyroid and cricoid cartilages.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nA needle cricothyrotomy is an emergency procedure to relieve an\nairway obstruction\nuntil surgery can be done to place a breathing tube (\ntracheostomy or surgical cricothyrotomy\n).\nIf the airway blockage occurs with trauma to the head, neck, or spine, care must be taken to avoid further injury to the person.\nRisks\nRisks for this procedure include:\nInjury to the voice box (larynx), thyroid gland, or esophagus\nRisks for any surgery are:\nBleeding\nInfection\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well the person does depends on the cause of the airway blockage and how quickly the person receives proper breathing support."}
