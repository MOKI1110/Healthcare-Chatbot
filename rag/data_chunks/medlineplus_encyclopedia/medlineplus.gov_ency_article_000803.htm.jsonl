Idiopathic means there is not a clear cause.\nCauses\nIH is similar to\nnarcolepsy\nin that you are extremely sleepy. It is different from narcolepsy because IH doesn't usually involve suddenly falling asleep (sleep attacks) or losing muscle control due to strong emotions (cataplexy). Also, unlike narcolepsy, naps in IH are usually not refreshing.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms often develop slowly during the teens or young adulthood."}
