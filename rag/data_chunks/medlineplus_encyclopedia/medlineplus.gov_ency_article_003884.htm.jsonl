This test is done in a hospital or outpatient center by a specially trained doctor called a gastroenterologist.\nBefore the procedure, you receive numbing medicine inside the nose. This helps make the insertion of the tube less uncomfortable.\nAfter the tube is in the stomach, the tube is pulled slowly back into your esophagus. At this time, you are asked to swallow. The pressure of the muscle contractions is measured along several sections of the tube.\nWhile the tube is in place, other studies of your esophagus may be done. The tube is removed after the tests are completed. The test takes about 1 hour.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou should not have anything to eat or drink for 8 hours before the test."}

If you have the test in the morning, Do not eat or drink after midnight.\nTell your health care provider about all medicines you are taking. These include vitamins, herbs, and other over-the-counter medicines and supplements.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may have a gagging sensation and discomfort when the tube passes through your nose and throat. You may also feel discomfort in your nose and throat during the test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe esophagus is the tube that carries food from your mouth into the stomach. When you swallow, muscles in your esophagus squeeze (contract) to push food toward the stomach. Valves, or sphincters, inside the esophagus open to let food and liquid through. They then close to prevent food, fluids, and stomach acid from moving backward. The sphincter at the bottom of the esophagus is called the lower esophageal sphincter, or LES.\nEsophageal manometry is done to see if the esophagus is contracting and relaxing properly."}

During the test, your doctor can also check the LES to see if it opens and closes properly.\nThe test may be ordered if you have symptoms of:\nHeartburn or nausea after eating (\ngastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD\n)\nProblems swallowing (feeling like food is stuck behind the breast bone)\nNormal Results\nThe LES pressure and muscle contractions are normal when you swallow.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may indicate:\nA problem with the esophagus that affects its ability to move food toward the stomach (\nachalasia\n)\nA weak LES, which causes heartburn (GERD)\nAbnormal contractions of the esophagus muscles that do not effectively move food to the stomach (\nesophageal spasm\n)\nRisks\nRisks of this test include:\nSlight nosebleed\nSore throat\nHole or perforation in the esophagus (this rarely happens)\nAlternative Names\nEsophageal motility studies; Esophageal function studies\nImages\nEsophageal manometry\nEsophageal manometry test\nReferences"}
