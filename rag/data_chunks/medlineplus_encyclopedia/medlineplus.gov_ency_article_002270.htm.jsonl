Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNewborn head molding\nNewborn head molding\nNewborn head molding is an abnormal head shape that results from pressure on the baby's head during childbirth.\nInformation\nThe bones of a newborn baby's skull are soft and flexible, with gaps between the plates of bone.\nThe spaces between the bony plates of the skull are called\ncranial sutures\n. The front (\nanterior\n) and back (posterior)\nfontanelles\nare 2 gaps that are particularly large. These are the soft spots you can feel when you touch the top of your baby's head.\nWhen a baby is born in a head-first position, pressure on the head in the birth canal may mold the head into an oblong shape. These spaces between the bones allow the baby's head to change shape. Depending on the amount and length of pressure, the skull bones may even overlap.\nThese spaces also allow the brain to grow inside the skull bones. They will close as the brain reaches its full size.\nFluid may also collect in the baby's scalp (\ncaput succedaneum\n), or blood may collect beneath the scalp (cephalohematoma)."}

This may further distort the shape and appearance of the baby's head. Fluid and blood collection in and around the scalp is common during delivery. It will most often go away in a few days.\nIf your baby is born breech (buttocks or feet first) or by\ncesarean delivery\n(C-section), the head is most often round. Severe abnormalities in head size are not related to molding.\nRelated topics include:\nCraniosynostosis\nMacrocephaly\n(abnormally large head size)\nMicrocephaly\n(abnormally small head size)\nAlternative Names\nNewborn cranial deformation; Molding of the newborn's head; Neonatal care - head molding\nImages\nSkull of a newborn\nFetal head molding\nNewborn head molding\nReferences\nBall JW, Dains JE, Flynn JA, Solomon BS, Stewart RW.
