Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPityriasis alba\nPityriasis alba\nPityriasis alba is a common skin disorder that causes patches of light-colored (hypopigmented) areas.\nCauses\nThe cause is unknown but may be linked to\natopic dermatitis\n(eczema). The disorder is most common in children and teens. It is more noticeable in children with dark skin.\nSymptoms\nThe problem areas on the skin (lesions) often start as slightly red and scaly patches that are round or oval. They usually appear on the face, upper arms, neck, and upper middle of the body. After these lesions go away, the patches turn light-colored (hypopigmented).\nThe patches do not tan easily. Because of this, they may get red quickly in the sun. As the skin surrounding the patches darkens normally, the patches may become more visible.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can usually diagnose the condition by looking at the skin. Tests, such as potassium hydroxide (\nKOH\n), may be done to check for other skin problems."}
