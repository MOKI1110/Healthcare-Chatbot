A person's childhood and environment may also play roles.\nThis disorder can affect both men and women. It occurs more often in men.\nSymptoms\nOCPD has some of the same symptoms as\nobsessive-compulsive disorder\n(OCD). People with OCD have unwanted thoughts, while people with OCPD believe that their thoughts are correct. In addition, OCD often begins in childhood while OCPD usually starts in the teen years or early 20s.\nPeople with either OCPD or OCD are often high achievers and feel a sense of urgency about their actions. They may become very upset if other people interfere with their rigid routines. They may not be able to express their anger directly."}

People with OCPD have feelings that they consider more appropriate, like anxiety or frustration.\nA person with OCPD has symptoms of perfectionism that usually begin by early adulthood. This perfectionism may interfere with the person's ability to complete tasks because their standards are so rigid. They may withdraw emotionally when they are not able to control a situation. This can interfere with their ability to solve problems and form close relationships.\nOther signs of OCPD include:\nOver-devotion to work\nNot being able to throw things away, even when the objects have no value\nLack of flexibility\nLack of generosity\nNot wanting to allow other people to do things\nNot being willing to show affection\nPreoccupation with details, rules, and lists\nExams and Tests\nOCPD is diagnosed based on a psychological evaluation.
