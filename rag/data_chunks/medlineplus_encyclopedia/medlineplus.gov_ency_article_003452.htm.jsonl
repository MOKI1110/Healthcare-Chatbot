Pinworms are small, thin worms that commonly infect young children, although anyone can be infected.\nHow the Test is Performed\nWhen a person has a pinworm infection, adult pinworms live in the intestine and colon. At night, the female adult worms deposit their eggs outside the rectum near the anal area.\nOne way to detect pinworms is to shine a flashlight on the anal area. The worms are tiny, white, and threadlike. If none are seen, check for 2 or 3 additional nights.\nThe best way to diagnose this infection is to do a tape test. The best time to do this is in the morning before bathing, because pinworms lay their eggs at night.\nSteps for the test are:\nFirmly press the sticky side of a 1-inch (2.5 centimeters) strip of cellophane tape over the anal area for a few seconds. The eggs stick to the tape.\nThe tape is then transferred to a glass slide, sticky side down."}

Put the slide and piece of tape in a plastic bag and seal the bag.\nWash your hands well.\nTake the bag to your health care provider. Your provider will check the tape to see if there are eggs.\nThe tape test may need to be done on 3 separate days to improve the chances of detecting the eggs.\nYou may be given a special pinworm test kit. If so, follow instructions on how to use it.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe skin around the anus may have minor irritation from the tape.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is performed to check for pinworms, which can cause itching in the anal area.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf adult pinworms or eggs are found, the person has a pinworm infection. Usually, all household members need to be treated with medicine."}
