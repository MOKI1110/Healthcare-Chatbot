It does not use ionizing radiation (\nx-rays\n).\nSingle MRI images are called slices. The images can be stored on a computer, viewed on a monitor, printed on film or scanned to a disk. One exam can produce thousands of images.\nDifferent types of MRI include:\nAbdominal MRI\nCervical MRI\nChest MRI\nCranial MRI\nHeart MRI\nLumbar MRI\nPelvic MRI\nMRA\n(MR Angiography)\nMRV (MR Venography)\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou may be asked to wear a hospital gown or clothing without zippers or snaps (such as sweatpants and a t-shirt). Certain types of metal can cause blurry images.\nYou will lie on a narrow table, which slides into a large tunnel-shaped scanner.\nSome exams require a special dye (contrast). Most of the time, the dye will be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm before the test."}

Most of the time, the dye will be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm before the test. The dye helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly.\nSmall devices, called coils, may be placed around the head, arm, or leg, or around other areas to be studied. These help send and receive the radio waves, and improve the quality of the images.\nDuring the MRI, the person who operates the machine will watch you from another room. The test usually lasts about 30 to 60 minutes, but may take longer.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan.\nTell your health care provider if you are afraid of close spaces (have claustrophobia)."}

You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious, or your provider may suggest an open MRI, in which the machine is not as close to the body.\nBefore the test, tell your provider if you have:\nArtificial heart valves\nBrain aneurysm clips\nHeart defibrillator or pacemaker\nInner ear (cochlear) implants\nKidney disease or dialysis (you may not be able to receive contrast)\nRecently placed artificial joints\nVascular\nstents\nWorked with sheet metal in the past (you may need tests to check for metal pieces in your eyes)\nBecause the MRI contains strong magnets, metal objects are not allowed into the room with the MRI scanner:\nItems such as jewelry, watches, credit cards, and hearing aids can be damaged.\nPens, pocketknives, and eyeglasses may fly across the room.\nPins, hairpins, metal zippers, and similar metallic items can distort the images.\nRemovable dental work should be taken out just before the scan.\nHow the Test will Feel\nAn MRI exam causes no pain."}

If you have difficulty lying still or are very nervous, you may be given a medicine to relax you. Too much movement can blur MRI images and cause errors.\nThe table may be hard or cold, but you can request a blanket or pillow. The machine produces loud thumping and humming noises when turned on. You can wear ear plugs to help reduce the noise.\nAn intercom in the room allows you to speak to someone at any time. Some MRI facilities have televisions and special headphones that you can use to help the time pass.\nThere is no recovery time, unless you were given a medicine to relax."}

Different types of tissues send back different MRI signals. For example, healthy tissue sends back a slightly different signal than cancerous tissue. Consult your provider with any questions and concerns.\nRisks\nMRI does not use ionizing radiation."}

For example, healthy tissue sends back a slightly different signal than cancerous tissue. Consult your provider with any questions and concerns.\nRisks\nMRI does not use ionizing radiation. No side effects from the magnetic fields and radio waves have been reported.\nThe most common type of contrast (dye) used is gadolinium. This substance is thought to be generally safe for most people. Gadolinium is retained in the brain and other organs (including the skin in people with kidney disease) after use. In rare cases, organ and skin damage have occurred in patients with preexisting kidney failure. Tell your provider before the test if you have kidney problems.\nThe strong magnetic fields created during an MRI can cause heart pacemakers and other implants not to work as well. The magnets can also cause a piece of metal inside your body to move or shift.\nAlternative Names\nMagnetic resonance imaging; Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) imaging\nImages\nMRI scans\nReferences\nCarpenter JP, Litt H, Gowda M.
