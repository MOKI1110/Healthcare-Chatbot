Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPheochromocytoma\nPheochromocytoma\nPheochromocytoma is a rare\ntumor\nof adrenal gland tissue that typically arises from the adrenal gland. It results in the release of too much epinephrine and norepinephrine, which are hormones that control heart rate, metabolism, and blood pressure.\nCauses\nPheochromocytoma may occur as a single tumor or as more than one growth. It usually develops in the center (medulla) of one or both\nadrenal glands\n. The adrenal glands are two triangle-shaped glands. One gland is located on top of each kidney. In rare cases, a pheochromocytoma occurs outside the adrenal gland. When it does, it is usually somewhere else in the abdomen.\nVery few pheochromocytomas are cancerous.\nThe tumors may occur at any age, but they are most common from early to mid-adulthood.\nIn few instances, the condition may also be seen among family members (hereditary).\nSymptoms\nMost people with this tumor have attacks of a set of symptoms, which happen when the tumor releases hormones. The attacks usually last from a few minutes to hours."}

The set of symptoms include:\nHeadaches\nHeart palpitations\nSweating\nHigh blood pressure\nAs the tumor grows, the attacks often increase in frequency, length, and severity.\nOther symptoms that may occur include:\nAbdominal\nor\nchest pain\nIrritability, nervousness\nPallor\nWeight loss\nNausea and vomiting\nShortness of breath\nSeizures\nProblems sleeping\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. You'll be asked about your medical history and symptoms.\nTests done may include:\nAbdominal CT scan\nAdrenal gland biopsy\nCatecholamines blood test\n(serum catecholamines)\nGlucose test\nMetanephrine blood test (serum metanephrine)\nAn imaging test called an\nMIBG scintiscan\nMRI of abdomen\nUrine catecholamines\nUrine metanephrines\nPET scan\nof abdomen\nBone scan\nTreatment\nTreatment involves removing the tumor with surgery.

It is important to stabilize your blood pressure and pulse with certain medicines before surgery. You may need to stay in the hospital and have your vital signs closely monitored around the time of surgery. After surgery, your vital signs will be continuously monitored in an intensive care unit.\nWhen the tumor cannot be surgically removed, you will need to take medicine to manage it. A combination of medicines is usually needed to control the effects of the extra hormones.\nRadiation therapy\nand\nchemotherapy\nwon't cure this kind of tumor, but they may help control the disease and treat symptoms that arise.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people who have noncancerous tumors that are removed with surgery are still alive after 5 years. The tumors come back in some people. Levels of the hormones norepinephrine and epinephrine return to normal after surgery.\nContinued high blood pressure may occur after surgery."}
