Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNormal pressure hydrocephalus\nNormal pressure hydrocephalus\nHydrocephalus\nis a buildup of spinal fluid inside the fluid chambers of the brain. Hydrocephalus means \"water on the brain.\"\nNormal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) is a rise in the amount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in the brain that affects brain function. However, the pressure of the fluid is usually normal.\nCauses\nThere is no known cause for NPH. But the chance of developing NPH is high in someone who previously had any of the following:\nBleeding from a blood vessel or\naneurysm\nin the brain (\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage\n)\nCertain head injuries\nMeningitis\nor similar infections\nSurgery on the brain (\ncraniotomy\n)\nAs CSF builds up in the brain, the fluid-filled chambers (ventricles) of the brain swell. This causes pressure on brain tissue. This can damage or destroy parts of the brain.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of NPH often begin slowly."}

This causes pressure on brain tissue. This can damage or destroy parts of the brain.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of NPH often begin slowly. There are three main symptoms of NPH:\nChanges in the way a person walks: difficulty when beginning to walk (gait apraxia), feeling as if your feet are stuck to the ground (magnetic gait)\nSlowing of mental function: forgetfulness, difficulty paying attention, apathy or no mood\nProblems controlling urine (\nurinary incontinence\n), and sometimes controlling stools (\nbowel incontinence\n)\nDiagnosis of NPH can be made if any of the above symptoms occur and NPH is suspected and testing is done.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about the symptoms. If you have NPH, your provider will likely find that your walking (gait) is not normal."}

You may also have memory problems.\nTests that may be done include:\nHead CT scan\nor\nMRI of the head\nLumbar puncture\n(spinal tap) with careful testing of walking before and right after the spinal tap\nTreatment\nTreatment for NPH usually requires surgery to place a tube called a shunt that routes the excess CSF out of the brain ventricles and into the abdomen. This is called a\nventriculoperitoneal shunt\n.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWithout treatment, symptoms often get worse and could lead to death.\nSurgery improves symptoms in some people. Those with mild symptoms have the best outcome."}
