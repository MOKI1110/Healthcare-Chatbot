Some of the muscles in your forearm attach to the bone on the outside of your elbow.\nWhen you use these muscles over and over again, small tears may develop in the tendon. Over time, the tendon cannot heal, and this leads to irritation and pain where the tendon is attached to the bone.\nThis injury is common in people who play a lot of tennis or other racket sports, hence the name tennis elbow. Backhand is the most common stroke to cause symptoms.\nBut any activity that involves repetitive twisting of the wrist (like using a screwdriver) can lead to this condition."}

You may also want to:\nPut ice on the outside of your elbow 2 or 3 times a day. Cover the painful area with a towel, and place the ice on it for 15 minutes. Do not fall asleep while applying the ice. You can get frostbite if you leave it on too long.\nTake nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or aspirin.\nIf your tennis elbow is due to sports activity, you may want to:\nAsk your provider about any changes you can make to your technique.\nCheck the sports equipment you are using to see if any changes may help.

It wraps around the upper part of your forearm and takes some of the pressure off the muscles.\nYour provider may also inject cortisone and a numbing medicine around the area where the tendon attaches to the bone. This may help decrease the swelling and pain.\nIf the pain continues after rest and treatment,\nsurgery\nto repair or remove the injured tendon  may be recommended.
