It is characterized by repeated episodes of fever.\nCauses\nRelapsing fever is an infection caused by several species of bacteria in the Borrelia family.\nThere are two major forms of relapsing fever:\nTick-borne relapsing fever (TBRF) is transmitted by the ornithodoros tick. It occurs in Africa, Spain, Saudi Arabia, Asia, and certain areas in the western United States and Canada. The bacteria species associated with TBRF are\nBorrelia duttonii\n,\nBorrelia hermsii\n, and\nBorrelia parkeri\n.\nLouse-borne relapsing fever (LBRF) is transmitted by\nbody lice\n. It is most common in Asia, Africa, Central and South America. The bacteria species associated with LBRF is\nBorrelia recurrentis\n.\nSudden fever occurs within 2 weeks of infection.\nIn TBRF, multiple episodes of fever occur, and each may last up to 3 days. People may not have a fever for up to 2 weeks, and then it returns.\nIn LBRF, the fever commonly lasts 3 to 6 days."}

People may not have a fever for up to 2 weeks, and then it returns.\nIn LBRF, the fever commonly lasts 3 to 6 days. It is often followed by a single, milder episode of fever.\nIn both forms, the fever episode may end in crisis. This consists of shaking chills, followed by intense sweating, falling body temperature, and low blood pressure. This stage may result in death.\nIn the United States, TBRF often occurs west of the Mississippi River, particularly in the mountains of the West and the high deserts and plains of the Southwest. In the mountains of California, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Colorado, Oregon, and Washington, infections are usually caused by\nBorrelia hermsii\nand are often picked up in cabins in forests. The risk may now extend into the southeastern United States.\nLBRF is mainly a disease of the developing world. It is currently seen in Ethiopia and Sudan."}

The risk may now extend into the southeastern United States.\nLBRF is mainly a disease of the developing world. It is currently seen in Ethiopia and Sudan. Famine, war, and the movement of refugee groups can result in clusters of LBRF epidemics.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of relapsing fever include:\nBleeding\nHeadache\nJoint aches, muscle aches\nNausea and vomiting\nSagging on one side of the face (facial droop)\nStiff neck\nSudden high fever, shaking chills,\nseizure\nWeakness, unsteadiness while walking\nComa\nExams and Tests\nRelapsing fever should be suspected if someone coming from a high-risk area has repeated episodes of fever. This is largely true if the fever is followed by a crisis stage, and if the person may have been exposed to lice or soft-bodied ticks.\nTests that may be done include:\nBlood smear\nto determine the cause of the infection\nBlood antibody tests (sometimes used, but their usefulness is limited)\nTreatment\nAntibiotics, including penicillin and tetracycline, are used to treat this condition.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPeople with this condition who have developed a coma, heart inflammation, liver problems, or pneumonia are more likely to die."}

Possible infections need to be investigated in a timely manner.\nPrevention\nWearing clothing that fully covers the arms and legs when you are outdoors can help prevent TBRF infection. Insect repellent such as DEET on the skin and clothing also work."}
