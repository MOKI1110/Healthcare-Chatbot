Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCatecholamines - urine\nCatecholamines - urine\nCatecholamines are chemicals made by nerve tissue (including the brain) and the adrenal gland.\nThe main types of catecholamines are dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. These chemicals break down into other components, which leave your body through your urine.\nA urine test can be done to measure the amount of catecholamines produced by your body. Separate urine tests may be done to measure related substances.\nCatecholamines can also be measured with a\nblood test\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nFor this test, you must collect your urine in a special bag or container every time you urinate for a 24-hour period.\nOn day 1, urinate over the toilet when you wake up in the morning and discard that urine.\nUrinate into the special container every time you use the bathroom for the next 24 hours."}

Keep it in the refrigerator or a cool place during the collection period.\nOn day 2, urinate into the container in the morning again when you wake up.\nLabel the container with your name, the date, the time of completion, and return it as instructed.\nFor an infant, thoroughly wash the area where urine exits the body.\nOpen a urine collection bag (a plastic bag with an adhesive paper on one end).\nFor males, place the entire\npenis\nin the bag and attach the adhesive to the skin.\nFor females, place the bag over the labia.\nDiaper as usual over the secured bag.\nThis procedure may take a few tries. An active baby can move the bag causing urine to go into the diaper.\nCheck the infant often and change the bag after the infant has urinated into it."}

Drain the urine from the bag into the container provided by your health care provider.\nDeliver the sample to the laboratory or to your provider as soon as possible.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nStress\nand heavy exercise may affect the test results.\nSome foods can increase catecholamines in your urine. You may need to avoid the following foods and beverages for several days before the test:\nBananas\nChocolate\nCitrus fruits\nCocoa\nCoffee\nLicorice\nTea\nVanilla\nMany medicines can interfere with test results.\nYour provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test.\nDo not stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination, and there is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is usually done to diagnose an adrenal gland tumor called\npheochromocytoma\n. It may also be used to diagnose a nervous system tumor called\nneuroblastoma\n."}

Urine catecholamine levels are increased in most people with neuroblastoma.\nThe urine test for catecholamines may also be used to monitor those who are receiving treatment for these conditions.\nNormal Results\nAll of the catecholamines are broken down into inactive substances that appear in the urine:\nDopamine becomes homovanillic acid (HVA)\nNorepinephrine becomes normetanephrine and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA)\nEpinephrine becomes metanephrine and VMA\nThe following normal values are the amount of the substance found in the urine over a 24-hour period:\nDopamine: 65 to 400 micrograms (mcg)/24 hours (420 to 2612 nmol/24 hours)\nEpinephrine: 0.5 to 20 mcg/24 hours\nMetanephrine: 24 to 96 mcg/24 hours (some laboratories give the range as 140 - 785 mcg/24 hours)\nNorepinephrine: 15 to 80 mcg/24 hours\nNormetanephrine: 75 to 375 mcg/24 hours\nTotal urine catecholamines: 14 to 110 mcg/24 hours\nVMA: 2 to 7 milligrams (mg)/24 hours (10 to 35 mcmol/24 hours)\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among"}
