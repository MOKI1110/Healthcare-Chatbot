It is covered with a\nmucous membrane\n. Small bumps (papillae) cover the surface of the back part of the tongue.\nBetween the papillae are the taste buds, which allow you to taste.\nThe tongue moves food to help you chew and swallow.\nThe tongue also helps you form words.\nThere are many different reasons for changes in the tongue's function and appearance.\nPROBLEMS MOVING THE TONGUE\nTongue movement problems are most often caused by nerve damage. Rarely, problems moving the tongue may also be caused by a disorder where the band of tissue that attaches the tongue to the floor of the mouth is too short."}
