Lack of blood flow means the cells and organs do not get enough oxygen and nutrients to function properly. Many organs can be damaged as a result. Shock requires immediate treatment and can get worse very rapidly. As many as 1 in 5 people in shock will die from it.\nConsiderations\nThe main types of shock include:\nCardiogenic shock\n(due to heart problems)\nHypovolemic shock\n(caused by too little blood volume)\nAnaphylactic shock\n(caused by allergic reaction)\nSeptic shock\n(due to infections)\nNeurogenic shock (caused by damage to the nervous system)\nObstructive shock (caused by something outside of the heart which prevents the heart from pumping enough blood)\nCauses\nShock can be caused by any condition that reduces blood flow, including:\nHeart problems (such as\nheart attack\nor\nheart failure\n)\nLow blood volume (as with heavy\nbleeding\nor\ndehydration\n)\nChanges in blood vessels (as with infection or\nsevere allergic reactions\n)\nCertain medicines that significantly reduce"}

If necessary, begin rescue breathing and\nCPR\n.\nEven if the person is able to breathe on their own, continue to check rate of breathing at least every 5 minutes until help arrives.\nIf the person is conscious and does not have an injury to the head, leg, neck, or spine, place the person in the shock position. Lay the person on their back and elevate their legs about 12 inches (30 centimeters). Do not elevate their head. If raising the legs will cause pain or potential harm, leave the person lying flat.\nGive appropriate first aid for any wounds, injuries, or illnesses.\nKeep the person warm and comfortable. Loosen tight clothing.\nIF THE PERSON VOMITS OR DROOLS\nTurn the person or their head to one side to prevent choking if you do not suspect an injury to the spine.\nIf a spinal injury is suspected, \"log roll\" the person instead."}
