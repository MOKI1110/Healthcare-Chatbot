Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMastectomy\nMastectomy\nA mastectomy is surgery to remove the breast tissue. Some of the skin and the nipple may also be removed. The surgery is most often done to treat\nbreast cancer\n.\nDescription\nBefore surgery begins, you will be given\ngeneral anesthesia\n. This means you will be asleep and pain-free during surgery.\nThere are different types of mastectomies. Which one your surgeon performs depends on the type of breast problem you have. Most of the time, a mastectomy is done to treat breast cancer. However, it is sometimes done to prevent cancer (prophylactic mastectomy).\nThe surgeon will make a cut in your breast and perform one of these operations:\nNipple-sparing mastectomy: The surgeon removes your entire breast, but leaves the nipple and areola (the colored circle around the nipple) in place. If you have cancer, the surgeon may do a\nbiopsy of lymph nodes\nin the underarm area to see if the cancer has spread.\nSkin-sparing mastectomy: The surgeon removes your breast with the nipple and areola with minimal skin removal."}

If you have cancer, the surgeon may do a biopsy of lymph nodes in the underarm area to see if the cancer has spread.\nModified radical mastectomy: The surgeon removes your entire breast with the nipple and areolar along with some of the lymph nodes underneath the arm.\nRadical mastectomy: The surgeon removes your entire breast with the nipple and areola along with the skin over your breast, all of the lymph nodes underneath the arm, and the skin is then closed with sutures (stitches).\nOne or two small plastic drains or tubes are very often left in your chest to remove extra fluid from where the breast tissue used to be.\nA plastic surgeon may be able to begin reconstruction of your breast during the same operation."}

You may also choose to have breast reconstruction at a later time. If you have reconstruction, a skin- or nipple-sparing mastectomy may be an option.\nA mastectomy will take about 2 to 3 hours.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nWOMEN DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER\nThe most common reason for a mastectomy is breast cancer.\nIf you are diagnosed with breast cancer,\ntalk to your health care provider about your choices\n:\nLumpectomy\nis when only the breast cancer and tissue around the cancer are removed.

Genetic tests (such as BRCA1 or BRCA2) may help show that you have a high risk. However, even with a normal genetic test, you may still be at high risk for breast cancer, depending on other factors. It may be useful to meet with a genetic counselor to assess your level of risk.\nA prophylactic mastectomy should be done only after very careful thought and discussion with your doctor, a genetic counselor, your family, and loved ones.\nA mastectomy greatly reduces the risk for breast cancer, but does not eliminate it.\nYou may decide to have a mastectomy based on your personal preference for a given condition. You and your provider will discuss the pros and cons of this decision.\nRisks\nScabbing, blistering, wound opening, bleeding, seroma, or skin loss along the edge of the surgical cut or within the skin flaps may occur.\nRisks:\nShoulder pain and stiffness."}

The drains will be removed later during an office visit with your surgeon. A nurse will teach you how to look after the drain, or you might be able to have a home care nurse help you.\nYou may have pain around the site of your cut after surgery. The pain is worst in the first few days after surgery and then goes away over a period of several weeks. You will receive pain medicines during your hospital stay. Talk with your surgeon about medicines to take for pain after surgery.\nFluid may collect in the area of your mastectomy after all the drains are removed. This is called a seroma. It most often goes away on its own, but it may need to be drained using a needle (aspiration).\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost women recover well after mastectomy.\nIn addition to surgery, you may need other treatments for breast cancer.
