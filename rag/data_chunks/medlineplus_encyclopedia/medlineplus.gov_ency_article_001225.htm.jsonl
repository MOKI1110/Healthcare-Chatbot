Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNeurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA)\nNeurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA)\nNeurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) are a group of very rare nervous system disorders. They are passed down through families (inherited). NBIA involves movement problems, dementia, and other nervous system symptoms.\nCauses\nSymptoms of NBIA begin in childhood or adulthood.\nThere are 10 types of NBIA. Each type is caused by a different gene variant. The most common gene variant causes the disorder called PKAN (pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration).\nPeople with all forms of NBIA have a buildup of iron in an area deep inside the brain called the basal ganglia as well as other areas of the brain that help regulate movements.\nSymptoms\nNBIA mainly causes movement problems."}

Other symptoms may include:\nDementia\nDifficulty speaking\nDifficulty swallowing\nMuscle problems such as rigidity or involuntary muscle contractions (\ndystonia\n)\nSeizures\nTremor\nVision loss, such as from\nretinitis pigmentosa\nWeakness\nWrithing movements\nToe walking\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about symptoms and medical history.\nGenetic tests can look for the variant gene that causes the disease. However, these tests aren't widely available.\nTests such as an\nMRI\nscan can help check for other movement disorders and diseases. The MRI usually shows iron deposits in the basal ganglia, and are called the \"eye of the tiger\" sign because of the way the deposits look in the scan. This sign suggests a diagnosis of PKAN.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for NBIA. Treatment is mainly focused on regulating the symptoms."}

The most commonly used medicines to regulate symptoms include baclofen and trihexyphenidyl.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nNBIA damages the nerves over time and symptoms get worse. It leads to a lack of movement, and often death by early adulthood.\nPossible Complications\nMedicine used to treat symptoms can cause complications. Being unable to move due to the disease can lead to:\nBlood clots\nRespiratory infections\nSkin breakdown\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your child develops:\nIncreased stiffness in the arms or legs\nIncreasing problems at school\nUnusual movements\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling\nmay be recommended for families affected by this illness. There is no known way to prevent it.\nAlternative Names\nHallervorden-Spatz disease; Pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration; PKAN; NBIA\nReferences\nJankovic J.
