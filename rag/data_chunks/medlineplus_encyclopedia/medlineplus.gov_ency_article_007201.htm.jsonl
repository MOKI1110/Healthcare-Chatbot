Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNuclear stress test\nNuclear stress test\nNuclear stress test is an imaging method that uses radioactive material to show how well blood flows into the heart muscle, both at rest and during activity.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis test is done at a medical center or health care provider's office. It is done in stages:\nYou will have an intravenous (IV) line started.\nA radioactive substance, such as thallium or sestamibi, will be injected into one of your veins.\nYou will lie down and wait for between 15 and 45 minutes.\nA special camera will scan your heart and create pictures to show how the substance has traveled through your blood and into your heart.\nMost people will then walk on a treadmill (or pedal on an exercise machine).\nAfter the treadmill starts moving slowly, you will be asked to walk (or pedal) faster and on an incline.\nIf you are not able to exercise, you may be given a medicine called a vasodilator (such as adenosine or dipyridamole [persantine])."}

This medicine widens (dilates) your heart arteries.\nIn other cases, you may get a medicine (dobutamine) that will make your heart beat faster and harder, similar to when you exercise.\nYour blood pressure and heart rhythm (\nelectrocardiogram - ECG)\nwill be monitored throughout the test.\nWhen your heart is working as hard as it can, a radioactive substance is again injected into one of your veins.\nYou will wait for 15 to 45 minutes.\nAgain, the special camera will scan your heart and create pictures.\nYou may be allowed to get up from the table or chair and have a snack or drink.\nYour provider will compare the first and second set of pictures using a computer. This can help detect if you have heart disease or if your heart disease is becoming worse.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou should wear comfortable clothes and shoes with non-skid soles. You may be asked not to eat or drink after midnight."}

You may be asked not to eat or drink after midnight. You will be allowed to have a few sips of water if you need to take medicines.\nYou will need to avoid caffeine for 24 hours before the test. This includes:\nTea and coffee\nAll sodas, even ones that are labeled caffeine-free\nChocolates, and certain pain relievers that contain caffeine\nMany medicines can interfere with blood test results.\nYour provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test.\nDo not stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.\nHow the Test will Feel\nDuring the test, some people feel:\nChest pain\nFatigue\nMuscle cramps in the legs or feet\nShortness of breath\nIf you are given the vasodilator medicine, you may feel a sting as it is injected. This is followed by a feeling of warmth."}
