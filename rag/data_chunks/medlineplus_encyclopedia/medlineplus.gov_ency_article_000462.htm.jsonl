Ureters are the tubes that carry urine from the kidney to the bladder. The swollen area can block urine flow.\nA ureterocele is a birth defect.\nCauses\nA ureterocele occurs in the lower part of the ureter, where it enters the bladder. The swollen area prevents urine from moving freely into the bladder. The urine collects in the ureterocele and stretches its walls. It expands like a water balloon.\nA ureterocele can also cause urine to flow backward from the bladder to the kidney. This is called reflux which may damage the kidney.\nUreteroceles occur in about 1 in 500 people. This condition is equally common in both the left and right ureters.\nSymptoms\nMost people with ureteroceles do not have any symptoms."}

Drains placed in the ureter or\nrenal\narea (\nstents\n) may provide short-term relief of symptoms.\nSurgery to repair the ureterocele cures the condition in most cases. Your surgeon may cut into the ureterocele. Another surgery may involve removing the ureterocele and reattaching the ureter to the bladder. The type of surgery depends on your age, overall health, and extent of the blockage.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome varies."}
