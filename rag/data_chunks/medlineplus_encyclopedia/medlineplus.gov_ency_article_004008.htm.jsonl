Examples are bacteria, viruses, toxins, cancer cells, and blood or tissues from another person. The immune system makes cells and\nantibodies\nthat destroy these harmful substances.\nAGING CHANGES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE IMMUNE SYSTEM\nAs you grow older, your immune system does not work as well. The following immune system changes may occur:\nThe immune system becomes slower to respond. This increases your risk of getting sick. Flu shots or other vaccines may not work as well or protect you for as long as expected.\nAn\nautoimmune disorder\nmay develop. This is a disease in which the immune system mistakenly attacks and damages or destroys healthy body tissues.\nYour body may heal more slowly. There are fewer immune cells in the body to bring about healing.\nThe immune system's ability to detect and correct cell defects also declines."}
