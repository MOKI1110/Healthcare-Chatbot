Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCompression fractures of the back\nCompression fractures of the back\nCompression fractures of the back are broken vertebrae. Vertebrae are the bones of the spine.\nCauses\nOsteoporosis\nis the most common cause of this type of fracture. Osteoporosis is a disease in which bones become fragile. In most cases, bone loses calcium and other minerals with age. Other causes of compression fractures may include:\nTrauma to the back\nTumors that spread to the bone from elsewhere\nTumors that start in the spine, such as multiple myeloma\nHaving many fractures of the vertebrae can lead to\nkyphosis\n. This is a hump-like curvature of the spine.\nSymptoms\nCompression fractures can occur suddenly. This can cause severe back pain.\nThe pain is most commonly felt in the middle or lower spine. It can also be felt on the sides or in the front of the spine.\nThe pain is often sharp and \"knife-like.\" Pain can be disabling, and take weeks to months to go away.\nCompression fractures due to osteoporosis may cause no symptoms at first."}

Often, they are discovered when x-rays of the spine are done for other reasons. Over time, the following symptoms may occur:\nBack pain that starts slowly, and gets worse with walking, but is not felt when resting\nLoss of height, as much as 6 inches (15 centimeters) over time\nStooped-over posture, or kyphosis, also called a dowager's hump\nPressure on the spinal cord from hunched over posture can, in rare cases, cause:\nNumbness\nTingling\nWeakness\nDifficulty walking\nLoss of control of the bowel or bladder\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

These fractures often do not cause injury to the spinal cord. The condition is usually treated with medicines and calcium supplements to prevent further fractures.\nPain may be treated with:\nPain medicine\nBed rest\nOther treatments may include:\nBack braces, but these may further weaken the bones and increase the risk for more fractures\nPhysical therapy to improve movement and strength around the spine\nA medicine called calcitonin to help relieve bone pain\nSurgery may be done if you have severe and disabling pain for more than 2 months that does not get better with other treatments. Surgery can include:\nBalloon kyphoplasty\nVertebroplasty\nSpinal fusion\nOther surgery may be done to remove bone if the fracture is due to a tumor.\nAfter surgery you may need:\nA brace for 6 to 10 weeks if the fracture was due to an injury.\nMore surgery to join spine bones together or to relieve pressure on a nerve.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost compression fractures due to injury heal in 8 to 10 weeks with rest, wearing of a brace, and pain medicines."}

Some fractures, though, can lead to long-term (chronic) pain and disability.\nMedicines to treat osteoporosis can help prevent future fractures. However, medicines cannot reverse damage that has already occurred.\nFor compression fractures caused by tumors, the outcome depends on the type of tumor involved."}
