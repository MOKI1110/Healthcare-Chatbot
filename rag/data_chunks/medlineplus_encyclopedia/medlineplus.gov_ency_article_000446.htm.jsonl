It is an autoimmune disorder. This means your body attacks healthy tissue by mistake. It is caused by a reaction to a medicine. Related conditions are drug-induced cutaneous lupus and drug-induced ANCA vasculitis.\nThe most common medicines known to cause drug-induced lupus erythematosus are:\nIsoniazid\nHydralazine\nProcainamide\nTumor-necrosis factor (TNF) alpha inhibitors (such as etanercept, infliximab and adalimumab)\nMinocycline\nQuinidine\nOther less common drugs may also cause the condition."}

These may include:\nAnti-seizure medicines\nCapoten\nChlorpromazine\nMethyldopa\nSulfasalazine\nLevamisole, typically as a contaminant of cocaine\nCancer immunotherapy drugs such as pembrolizumab can also cause a variety of autoimmune reactions including drug-induced lupus.\nSymptoms of drug-induced lupus tend to occur after taking the drug for at least 3 to 6 months.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nFever\nGeneral ill feeling (malaise)\nJoint pain\nJoint swelling\nLoss of appetite\nPleuritic\nchest pain (sharp pain that is worse with breathing in)\nSkin rash\non areas exposed to sunlight\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will do a physical exam and listen to your chest with a stethoscope."}

This is rare.\nWhen the disease is active, you should wear protective clothing and sunglasses to guard against too much sun.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost of the time, drug-induced lupus erythematosus is not as severe as SLE. The symptoms often go away within a few days to weeks after stopping the medicine you were taking."}

Rarely, kidney inflammation (nephritis) can develop with drug-induced lupus caused by TNF inhibitors or with ANCA vasculitis due to hydralazine or levamisole. Nephritis may require treatment with prednisone and immunosuppressive medicines.\nAvoid taking the drug that caused the reaction in future. Symptoms are likely to return if you do so.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nInfection\nThrombocytopenic\npurpura -- bleeding near the skin surface, resulting from a low number of platelets in the blood\nHemolytic anemia\nMyocarditis\nPericarditis\nNephritis\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nYou develop new symptoms when taking any of the medicines listed above.\nYour symptoms do not get better after you stop taking the medicine that caused the condition.\nPrevention\nWatch for signs of a reaction if you are taking any of the drugs that can cause this problem.\nAlternative Names\nLupus - drug induced\nImages\nLupus, discoid  - view of lesions on the chest\nAnt"}
