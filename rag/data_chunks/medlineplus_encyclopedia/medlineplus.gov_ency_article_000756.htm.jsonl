The eyelid may repeatedly close (or nearly close) and reopen. This article discusses eyelid twitches in general.\nCauses\nThe most common things that make the muscle in your eyelid twitch are fatigue, stress, caffeine, and excessive alcohol intake. Rarely, they can be a side effect of a medicine used for migraine headaches. Once spasms begin, they may continue off and on for a few days. Then, they disappear. Most people have this type of eyelid twitch once in a while and find it very annoying. In most cases, you won't even notice when the twitch has stopped.\nYou may have more severe contractions, where the eyelid completely closes. This form of eyelid twitching is called blepharospasm. It lasts much longer than the more common type of eyelid twitch. It is often very uncomfortable and may cause your eyelids to close completely."}

Twitching can be caused by irritation of the:\nSurface of the eye (cornea)\nMembranes lining the eyelids (conjunctiva)\nSometimes, the reason your eyelid is twitching cannot be found.\nSymptoms\nCommon symptoms of eyelid twitch are:\nRepeated uncontrollable twitching or spasms of your eyelid (most often the upper lid)\nLight sensitivity (sometimes, this is the cause of the twitching)\nBlurry vision (sometimes)\nTreatment\nEyelid twitching most often goes away without treatment. In the meantime, the following steps may help:\nGet more sleep.\nDrink less caffeine.\nConsume less alcohol.\nLubricate your eyes with eye drops.\nIf twitching is severe or lasts a long time, small injections of botulinum toxin can control the spasms. In rare cases of severe blepharospasm, limited removal of some of the muscles around the eyelids or brain surgery may be helpful.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook depends on the specific type or cause of eyelid twitch."}
