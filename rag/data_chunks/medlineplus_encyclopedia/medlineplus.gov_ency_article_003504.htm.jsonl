Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCPK isoenzymes test\nCPK isoenzymes test\nThe creatine phosphokinase (CPK) isoenzymes test measures the different forms of CPK in the blood. CPK is an enzyme found mainly in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. This may be taken from a vein. The test is called a\nvenipuncture\n.\nIf you are in the hospital, this test may be repeated over 2 or 3 days. A significant rise or fall in the total CPK or CPK isoenzymes can help your health care provider diagnose certain conditions.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed in most cases.\nTell your provider about all the medicines you are taking. Some drugs can interfere with test results. Drugs that can increase CPK measurements include the following:\nAlcohol\nAmphotericin B\nCertain anesthetics\nCocaine\nFibrate medicines\nStatins\nSteroids, such as dexamethasone\nThis list is not all-inclusive.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain when the needle is inserted to draw blood. Some people feel only a prick or stinging sensation."}

Some people feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done if a\nCPK test\nshows that your total CPK level is elevated. CPK isoenzyme testing can help find the exact source of the damaged tissue.\nCPK is made of three slightly different substances:\nCPK-1 (also called CPK-BB) is found mostly in the brain and lungs\nCPK-2 (also called CPK-MB) is found mostly in the heart\nCPK-3 (also called CPK-MM) is found mostly in skeletal muscle\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nHigher-than-normal CPK-1 levels:\nBecause CPK-1 is found mostly in the brain and lungs, injury to either of these areas can increase CPK-1 levels. Increased CPK-1 levels may be due to:\nBrain cancer\nBrain injury\n(due to any type of injury including, stroke, or bleeding in the brain)\nElectroconvulsive therapy\nPulmonary infarction\nSeizure\nHigher-than-normal CPK-2 levels:\nCPK-2 levels rise 3 to 6 hours after a\nheart attack\n."}
