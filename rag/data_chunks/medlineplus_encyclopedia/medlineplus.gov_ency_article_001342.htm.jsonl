It occurs in malnourished children in areas where sanitation and cleanliness are lacking.\nCauses\nThe exact cause is unknown, but noma may be due to a certain kind of bacteria.\nThis disorder most often occurs in young, severely malnourished children from ages 2 to 5 years. Often they have had an illness such as measles, scarlet fever, tuberculosis, or cancer. They may also have a weakened immune system.\nRisk factors include:\nA type of malnutrition called\nKwashiorkor\n, and other forms of severe protein malnutrition\nPoor sanitation and dirty living conditions\nDisorders such as measles or leukemia\nLiving in a developing country\nSymptoms\nNoma causes sudden tissue destruction that rapidly gets worse. First, the gums and lining of the cheeks become inflamed and develop sores (ulcers). The ulcers develop a foul-smelling drainage, causing\nbad breath\nand skin odor.\nThe infection spreads to the skin, and the tissues in the lips and cheeks die."}

The ulcers develop a foul-smelling drainage, causing\nbad breath\nand skin odor.\nThe infection spreads to the skin, and the tissues in the lips and cheeks die. This can eventually destroy the soft tissue and bone. The destruction of the bones around the mouth causes deformity of the face and loss of teeth.\nNoma can also affect the genitals, spreading to the genital skin (this is sometimes called noma pudendi).\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam shows inflamed areas of the mucous membranes, mouth ulcers, and skin ulcers. These ulcers have a foul-smelling drainage. There may be other signs of malnutrition.\nTreatment\nAntibiotics and proper nutrition helps stop the disease from getting worse. Plastic surgery may be necessary to remove destroyed tissues and reconstruct facial bones. This will improve facial appearance and the function of the mouth and jaw.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn some cases, this condition can be deadly if it is not treated. Other times, the condition may heal over time, even without treatment."}
