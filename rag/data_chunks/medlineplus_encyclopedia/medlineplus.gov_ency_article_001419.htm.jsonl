However, an abnormal immune response to measles or, possibly, certain variant forms of the virus may cause severe illness and death. This response leads to brain inflammation (swelling and irritation) that may last for years.\nSSPE has been reported in all parts of the world, but in western countries it is a rare disease.\nVery few cases are seen in the United States since the nationwide measles vaccination program began. SSPE tends to occur several years after a person has measles, even though the person seems to have fully recovered from the illness. Males are more often affected than females. The disease generally occurs in children and adolescents.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of SSPE occur in four general stages."}

With each stage, the symptoms are worse than the stage before:\nStage I: There may be personality changes, mood swings, or\ndepression\n.\nFever\nand\nheadache\nmay also be present. This stage may last up to 6 months.\nStage II: There may be\nuncontrolled movement problems\nincluding jerking and muscle spasms. Other symptoms that may occur in this stage are loss of vision,\ndementia\n, and\nseizures\n.\nStage III: Jerking movements are replaced by writhing (twisting) movements and rigidity. Death may occur from complications.\nStage IV: Areas of the brain that regulate breathing, heart rate, and blood pressure are damaged. This leads to\ncoma\nand then death.\nExams and Tests\nThere may be a history of measles in an unvaccinated child."}

Treatment is generally aimed at regulating symptoms. Certain antiviral medicines and medicines that boost the immune system may be tried to slow the progression of the disease.\nSupport Groups\nThe following resources can provide more information on SSPE:\nNational Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke --\nwww.ninds.nih.gov/health-information/disorders/encephalitis\nNational Organization for Rare Disorders --\nrarediseases.org/rare-diseases/subacute-sclerosing-panencephalitis/\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSSPE is always fatal."}

People with this disease die 1 to 3 years after diagnosis. Some people may survive longer.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if your child has not completed their scheduled vaccines. The measles vaccine is included in the\nMMR\nvaccine.\nPrevention\nImmunization against measles is the only known prevention for SSPE. The\nmeasles vaccine\nhas been highly effective in reducing the number of affected children.\nMeasles immunization should be done according to the recommended American Academy of Pediatrics and Centers for Disease Control schedule. The measles vaccine cannot cause SSPE.\nAlternative Names\nSSPE; Subacute sclerosing leukoencephalitis; Dawson encephalitis; Measles - SSPE; Rubeola - SSPE\nReferences\nGans HA. Measles.
