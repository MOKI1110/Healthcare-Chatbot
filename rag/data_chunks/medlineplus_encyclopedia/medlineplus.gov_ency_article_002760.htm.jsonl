You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\nWhat to Expect at the Emergency Room\nThe person may not need to go to the emergency room.\nIf they do go, the provider will measure and monitor their vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated.\nThe provider may give the person a laxative. This will help move the wax quickly through the intestines and help prevent a bowel blockage.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSince beeswax is considered fairly nonpoisonous, recovery is very likely.\nHow well someone does depends on how much beeswax they swallowed and how quickly they receive treatment.\nReferences\nDavison K, Frank BL.
