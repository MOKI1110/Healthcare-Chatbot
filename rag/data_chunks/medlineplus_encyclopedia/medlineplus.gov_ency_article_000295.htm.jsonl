It is caused by a group of bacteria called Shigella.\nCauses\nThere are several types of Shigella bacteria, including:\nShigella sonnei\n, also called \"group D\" Shigella, is responsible for most cases of shigellosis in the United States.\nShigella flexneri\n, or \"group B\" Shigella, causes almost all other cases.\nShigella dysenteriae,\nor \"group A\" Shigella is rare in the United States. However, it can lead to deadly outbreaks in developing countries.\nPeople infected with the bacteria release it into their stool. They can spread the bacteria to water or food, or directly to another person."}

They can spread the bacteria to water or food, or directly to another person. Getting just a little bit of the Shigella bacteria into your mouth is enough to cause infection.\nOutbreaks of shigellosis are linked to poor sanitation, contaminated food and water, and crowded living conditions.\nShigellosis is common among travelers in developing countries and workers or residents in refugee camps.\nIn the United States, the condition is most commonly seen in daycare centers and places where groups of people live, such as nursing homes.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms often develop about 1 to 7 days (average 3 days) after coming into contact with the bacteria.\nSymptoms include:\nAcute (sudden)\nabdominal pain\nor cramping\nAcute fever\nBlood, mucus, or pus in the stool\nCrampy rectal pain\nNausea and vomiting\nWatery and bloody diarrhea\nExams and Tests\nIf you have symptoms of shigellosis, your health care provider will check for:\nDehydration (not enough fluids in your body) with a fast heart rate and low blood pressure\nAbdominal tenderness\nElevated level of white blood cells in the blood\nSt"}

Several types of electrolyte solutions are available over-the-counter (without a prescription).\nAntibiotics can help shorten the length of the illness. These medicines also help prevent the illness from spreading to others in group living or daycare settings. They may also be prescribed for people with severe symptoms.\nIf you have diarrhea and cannot drink fluids by mouth because of severe nausea, you may need medical care and\nintravenous\n(IV) fluids."}

Never stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe infection can be mild and goes away on its own. Most people, except malnourished children and those with weakened immune systems, typically recover fully.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nDehydration, severe\nHemolytic-uremic syndrome\n(HUS), a form of kidney failure with anemia and clotting problems\nReactive arthritis\nAbout 1 in 10 children (under age 15) with severe Shigella enteritis develop nervous system problems. These may include\nfebrile seizures\n(also called a \"fever fit\") when body temperature rises quickly and the child has seizures."}

Handwashing is the most effective way to prevent shigellosis.
