One or more stones can be in the kidney or ureter at the same time.\nCauses\nKidney stones are common. Some types run in families. They may occur at any age, including in premature infants.\nThere are different types of kidney stones. The cause depends on the type of stone.\nStones can form when urine contains too much of certain substances that form crystals. These crystals can develop into stones over weeks or months.\nCalcium stones are most common. They are most likely to occur in men between ages 20 to 30. Calcium can combine with other substances to form the stone.\nOxalate is the most common of these substances. Oxalate is present in certain foods such as spinach. It is also found in vitamin C supplements. Diseases of the small intestine increase your risk for these stones.\nCalcium stones can also form by combining with phosphate or carbonate.\nOther types of stones include:\nCystine stones can form in people who have\ncystinuria\n. This disorder runs in families."}

This disorder runs in families. It affects both men and women.\nStruvite stones are mostly found in men or women who have repeated\nurinary tract infections\n. These stones can grow very large and can block the kidney, ureter, or bladder.\nUric acid stones are more common in men than in women. They can occur with gout or after receiving chemotherapy for some types of cancer.\nOther substances, such as certain medicines, also can form stones.\nThe biggest risk factor for kidney stones is not drinking enough fluids. Kidney stones are more likely to occur if you make less than 1 liter (32 ounces) of urine a day.\nSymptoms\nYou may not have symptoms until the stone moves down the tube (ureters) through which urine empties into your bladder."}

When this happens, the stone can block the flow of urine out of the kidneys, causing pain.\nThe main symptom is severe pain that starts and stops suddenly:\nPain may be felt in the belly area or side of the back.\nPain may move to the groin area (\ngroin pain\n), testicles (\ntesticle pain\n) in men, and labia (vaginal pain) in women.\nOther symptoms can include:\nAbnormal urine color\nBlood in the urine\nChills\nFever\nNausea and vomiting\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

This will help the\nstone pass\n.\nPain can be very bad. Over-the-counter pain medicines (for example, ibuprofen and naproxen), either alone or along with narcotics, can be very effective.\nSome people with severe pain from kidney stones need to stay in the hospital."}
