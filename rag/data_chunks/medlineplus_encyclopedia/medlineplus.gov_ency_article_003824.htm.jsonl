Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLung gallium scan\nLung gallium scan\nLung gallium scan is a type of\nnuclear scan\nthat uses radioactive gallium to identify inflammation in the lungs.\nHow the Test is Performed\nGallium is injected into a vein. The scan will be taken 6 to 24 hours after the gallium is injected. (Test timing depends on whether your condition is\nacute\nor\nchronic\n.)\nDuring the test, you lie on a table that moves underneath a scanner called a gamma camera. The camera detects the radiation produced by the gallium. Images are displayed on a computer screen.\nDuring the scan, it is important that you keep still to get a clear image. The technician can help make you comfortable before the scan begins. The test takes about 30 to 60 minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nSeveral hours to 1 day before the scan, you will get an injection of gallium at the place where the testing will be done.\nJust before the scan, remove jewelry, dentures, or other metal objects that can affect the scan."}

Take off the clothing on the upper half of your body and put on a hospital gown.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe injection of gallium will sting, and the puncture site may hurt for several hours or days when touched.\nThe scan is painless, but you must stay still. This may cause discomfort for some people.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is usually done when you have signs of inflammation in the lungs. This is most often due to\nsarcoidosis\nor a certain type of pneumonia."}

This is most often due to\nsarcoidosis\nor a certain type of pneumonia. It is not performed very often in recent years.\nNormal Results\nThe lungs should appear of normal size and texture, and should take up very little gallium.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf a large amount of gallium is seen in the lungs, it may mean any of the following problems:\nSarcoidosis (a disease in which inflammation occurs in the lungs and other tissues of the body)\nOther respiratory infections, most often a type of pneumonia caused by the fungus\nPneumocystis jirovecii\nRisks\nThere is some risk to children or unborn babies. Because a pregnant or nursing woman may pass on radiation, special precautions need to be taken.\nFor women who are not pregnant or nursing and for men, there is very little risk from the radiation in gallium, because the amount is very small. There are increased risks if you are exposed to radiation (such as\nx-rays\nand scans) many times."}

Discuss any concerns you have about radiation with your health care provider who recommends the test.\nConsiderations\nUsually your provider will recommend this scan based on the results of a\nchest x-ray\n. Small defects may not be visible on the scan. For this reason, this test is not often done anymore.\nAlternative Names\nGallium 67 lung scan; Lung scan; Gallium scan - lung; Scan - lung\nImages\nGallium injection\nReferences\nHarisinghani MG, Chen JW, Weissleder R.
