Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCholinesterase - blood\nCholinesterase - blood\nSerum cholinesterase is a blood test that looks at levels of 2 substances that help the nervous system work properly. They are called acetylcholinesterase and pseudocholinesterase. Your nerves need these substances to send signals.\nAcetylcholinesterase is found in nerve tissue and red blood cells. Pseudocholinesterase is found primarily in the liver.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is\ndrawn from a vein\nlocated on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special steps are needed to prepare for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour health care provider may order this test if you may have been exposed to chemicals called organophosphates. These chemicals are used in pesticides."}
