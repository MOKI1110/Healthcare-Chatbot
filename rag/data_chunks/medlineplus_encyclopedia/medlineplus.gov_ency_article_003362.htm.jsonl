Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSerum phenylalanine screening\nSerum phenylalanine screening\nSerum phenylalanine screening is a blood test to look for signs of the disease\nphenylketonuria\n(PKU). The test detects abnormally high levels of an amino acid called phenylalanine.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is most often done as part of routine screening tests before a newborn leaves the hospital. If the child is not born in a hospital, the test should be done in the first 48 to 72 hours of life.\nAn area of the infant's skin, most often the heel, is cleaned with a germ killer and punctured with a sharp needle or a lancet. Three drops of blood are placed in 3 separate test circles on a piece of paper. Cotton or a bandage may be applied to the puncture site if it is still bleeding after the blood drops are taken.\nThe test paper is taken to the laboratory, where it is mixed with a type of bacteria that needs phenylalanine to grow."}

Afterward, there may be some throbbing. Infants are given a small amount of sugar water, which has been shown to reduce the painful sensation associated with the skin puncture.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to screen infants for PKU, an uncommon condition that occurs when the body lacks a substance needed to breakdown the amino acid phenylalanine.\nIf PKU is not detected early, increasing phenylalanine levels in the baby will cause intellectual disability."}

When discovered early, changes in the diet can help prevent the severe side effects of PKU.\nNormal Results\nA normal test result means that phenylalanine levels are normal and the child does not have PKU.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your baby's test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf the screening test results are abnormal, PKU is a possibility. Further testing will be done if the phenylalanine levels in your baby's blood are too high.\nRisks\nThe risks of having blood drawn are slight, but include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nAlternative Names\nPhenylalanine - blood test; PKU - phenylalanine\nReferences\nKonczal LL, Zinn AB.
