Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCushing syndrome\nCushing syndrome\nCushing syndrome is a disorder that occurs when your body has a high level of the hormone cortisol.\nCauses\nThe most common cause of Cushing syndrome is taking too much glucocorticoid or corticosteroid medicine. This form of Cushing syndrome is called\nexogenous Cushing syndrome\n. Prednisone, dexamethasone, and prednisolone are examples of this type of medicine. Glucocorticoids mimic the action of the body's natural hormone cortisol. These drugs are used to treat many conditions such as asthma, skin inflammation, cancer, bowel disease, joint pain, and rheumatoid arthritis.\nOther people develop Cushing syndrome because their body produces too much cortisol. This hormone is made in the\nadrenal glands.\nCauses of too much cortisol are:\nCushing disease\n, which occurs when the pituitary gland makes too much of the hormone adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH). ACTH then signals the adrenal glands to produce too much cortisol."}
