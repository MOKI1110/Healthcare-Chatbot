Swallowing pine oil can have severe effects on many parts of the body. In most cases, the biggest problem is that pine oil is swallowed (aspirated) into the lungs instead of the stomach, causing breathing problems.\nThe faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\nReferences\nCrinion S.
