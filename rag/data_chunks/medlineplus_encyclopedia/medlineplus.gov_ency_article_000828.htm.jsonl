Birthmarks include cafe-au-lait spots, moles, and Mongolian spots. Birthmarks can be\nred\nor other colors.\nCauses\nDifferent types of birthmarks have different causes.\nCafe-au-lait spots are common at or after birth. Someone who has many of these spots may have a genetic disorder called\nneurofibromatosis\n.\nMoles are very common -- nearly everyone has them. Most moles appear after birth.\nMongolian spots are more common in people with darker skin.\nSymptoms\nEach type of birthmark has its own appearance:\nCafe-au-lait spots are light tan, the color of coffee with milk.\nMoles are spots made of small clusters of colored skin cells.\nMongolian spots\n(also called Mongolian blue spots) are usually bluish or bruised-looking. They often appear over the lower back or buttocks."}
