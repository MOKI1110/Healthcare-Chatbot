It is most often diagnosed in children, adolescents, or young adults.\nInsulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells, called beta cells. The pancreas is below and behind the stomach. Insulin is needed to move glucose into cells. Inside the cells, glucose is stored and later used for energy. With type 1 diabetes, beta cells produce little or no insulin.\nWithout enough insulin, glucose builds up in the bloodstream instead of going into the cells. This buildup of glucose in the blood is called hyperglycemia. The body is unable to use the glucose for energy. This leads to the symptoms of type 1 diabetes.\nThe exact cause of type 1 diabetes is unknown. It is an\nautoimmune disorder\n. This is a condition that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue."}

It is an\nautoimmune disorder\n. This is a condition that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue. In people with type 1 diabetes, an infection or another trigger causes the body to mistakenly attack the beta cells in the pancreas that make insulin. The tendency to develop autoimmune diseases, including type 1 diabetes, can be inherited from your parents.\nSymptoms\nHIGH BLOOD SUGAR\nThe following symptoms may be the first signs of type 1 diabetes. Or, they may occur when blood sugar is high.\nBeing very thirsty\nFeeling hungry\nFeeling tired all the time\nHaving blurry eyesight\nFeeling numbness or tingling in your feet\nLosing weight despite an increased appetite\nUrinating more often (including urinating at night or bedwetting in children who were dry overnight before)\nFor other people, these serious warning symptoms may be the first signs of type 1 diabetes."}

Everyone with type 1 diabetes must take insulin every day.\nMost commonly, insulin is injected under the skin using a syringe, insulin pen, or insulin pump. Another form of insulin is the inhaled type. Insulin cannot be taken by mouth because the acid in the stomach destroys insulin.\nInsulin types differ in how fast they start to work and how long they last.

Your provider will choose the best type of insulin for you and will tell you at what time of day to use it. Some types of insulin may be mixed together in an injection to get the best blood glucose control. Other types of insulin should never be mixed.\nMost people with type 1 diabetes need to take two kinds of insulin. Basal insulin is long-lasting and controls how much sugar your own body makes when you are not eating. Meal-time (bolus or prandial) insulin is rapid acting and is taken with every meal, usually a few minutes before you start eating. It lasts only long enough to help move the sugar absorbed from a meal into muscle and fat cells for storage.\nYour provider or diabetes educator will teach you how to give insulin injections. At first, a child's injections may be given by a parent or another adult. By age 14, most children can give themselves their own injections.\nInhaled insulin comes as a powder that is breathed in (inhaled). It is rapid acting and used just before each meal."}

This helps you adjust your insulin doses to specific meals or activities to prevent blood sugar from becoming too high or too low.\nThe American Diabetes Association and the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics have information for planning healthy, balanced meals.

Talk to your provider and diabetes educator about how often to check.\nTo check your blood sugar level, you may use a device called a glucose meter. Usually, you prick your finger with a small needle, called a lancet, to get a tiny drop of blood. You place the blood on a test strip and put the strip into the meter. The meter gives you a reading that tells you the level of your blood sugar.\nA continuous glucose monitor (CGM) estimates your blood sugar level from fluid under your skin. These monitors are used mostly by people who also use insulin pumps to control their diabetes but they are often helpful for people not using an insulin pump."}

These monitors are used mostly by people who also use insulin pumps to control their diabetes but they are often helpful for people not using an insulin pump. Most monitors do not require a finger prick.\nKeep a record of your blood sugar for yourself and your health care team. This can often be done most easily using a website designed for this purpose. These numbers will help if you have problems managing your diabetes. You and your provider should set a target goal for your blood sugar level at different times during the day. You should also plan what to do when your blood sugar is too low or high.\nTalk to your provider about your target for the A1C test. This lab test shows your average blood sugar level over the past 3 months. It shows how well you are controlling your diabetes. For most people with type 1 diabetes, the A1C target should be 7% or lower.\nLow blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. A blood sugar level below 70 mg/dL (3.9 mmol/L) is too low and can harm you. A blood sugar level below 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) is cause for immediate action. Keeping good control of your blood sugar can help prevent low blood sugar."}

Diabetes damages the nerves. This can make your feet less able to feel pressure, pain, heat, or cold. You may not notice a foot injury until you have severe damage to the skin and tissue below, or you get a severe infection.\nDiabetes can also damage blood vessels. Small sores or breaks in the skin may become deeper skin sores (\nulcers\n). The affected limb may need to be amputated if these skin ulcers do not heal, or become larger, deeper, or infected.\nTo prevent problems with your feet:\nStop using tobacco\n, if you use it.\nImprove control of your blood sugar.\nGet a foot exam at least once a year from your provider, and learn whether you have nerve damage.\nAsk your provider to check your feet for problems such as calluses, a bunion or hammertoe."}
