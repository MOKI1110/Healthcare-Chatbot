The muscle disorder can be inherited, such as\nmuscular dystrophy\n, or acquired, such as alcoholic or steroid myopathy.\nThe medical name for muscle disorder is myopathy.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom is weakness.\nOther symptoms include cramps and stiffness.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will take your medical history and perform a neurological exam. Tests that may be ordered include:\nBlood and urine tests\nElectromyography\n(EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCS)\nMuscle biopsy\nGenetic tests to look for conditions that run in families. This can be tested with blood work or sometimes saliva testing.\nA muscle biopsy examines a tissue sample under a microscope to confirm disease. Sometimes, a blood or saliva test to check for a genetic disorder is all that is needed based on someone's symptoms and family history.\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the cause."}
