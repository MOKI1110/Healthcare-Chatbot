Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMitral valve regurgitation\nMitral valve regurgitation\nMitral regurgitation is a disorder in which the mitral valve on the left side of the heart does not close properly.\nRegurgitation means leaking from a valve that does not close all the way.\nCauses\nBlood that flows between different chambers of your heart must flow through a valve. The valve between the 2 chambers on the left side of your heart is called the mitral valve. It opens up enough so that blood can flow from the upper chamber of your heart (left atrium) to the lower chamber (left ventricle). It then closes, keeping blood from flowing backwards.\nWhen the mitral valve doesn't close all the way, blood flows backward into the upper heart chamber (atrium) from the lower chamber as it contracts. This is called mitral regurgitation and is a common type of heart valve disorder. This cuts down on the amount of blood that flows to the rest of the body. As a result, the heart may try to pump harder. This may lead to congestive heart failure.\nMitral regurgitation may begin suddenly."}

As a result, the heart may try to pump harder. This may lead to congestive heart failure.\nMitral regurgitation may begin suddenly. This often occurs after a heart attack. When the regurgitation does not go away, it becomes long-term (chronic).\nMany other diseases or problems can weaken or damage the valve or the heart tissue around the valve. You are at risk for mitral valve regurgitation if you have:\nCoronary heart disease and high blood pressure\nInfection of the heart valves\nMitral valve prolapse\n(MVP)\nRare conditions, such as untreated syphilis or\nMarfan syndrome\nRheumatic heart disease. This is a complication of untreated strep throat that is becoming less common.\nSwelling of the left lower heart chamber\nAnother important risk factor for mitral regurgitation is past use of a diet pill called \"Fen-Phen\" (fenfluramine and phentermine) or dexfenfluramine.
