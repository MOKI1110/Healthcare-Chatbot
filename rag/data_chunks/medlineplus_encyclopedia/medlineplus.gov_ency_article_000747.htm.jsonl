These movements or noises are involuntary (not on purpose).\nCauses\nProvisional tic disorder is common in children.\nThe cause of provisional tic disorder can be physical or mental (psychological). It may be a mild form of\nTourette syndrome\n. Provisional means that the tic has been present for less than a year.\nSymptoms\nYour child may have\nfacial tics\nor tics involving movement of the arms, legs, or other areas.\nTics may involve:\nMovements that occur again and again and do not have a rhythm\nAn overwhelming urge to make the movement\nBrief and jerky movements that include blinking, clenching the fists, jerking the arms, kicking, raising the eyebrows, sticking out the tongue\nThe tics often look like nervous behavior. Tics appear to get worse with stress."}

Tics appear to get worse with stress. They may be less frequent during sleep or not occur during sleep at all.\nSounds may also occur, such as:\nClicking\nGrunting\nHissing\nMoaning\nSniffing\nSnorting\nSquealing\nThroat clearing\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will consider physical causes of provisional tic disorder before making a diagnosis.\nIn order to be diagnosed with provisional tic disorder, symptoms must be present less than one year and not be due to other conditions including use of substances.\nOther disorders such as\nanxiety\n, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder\n(ADHD),\nuncontrollable movement\n(myoclonus),\nobsessive-compulsive disorder\n(OCD), and\nepilepsy\nmay need to be ruled out.\nTreatment\nProviders recommend that family members do not call attention to the tics at first. This is because unwanted attention may make the tics worse."}

This is because unwanted attention may make the tics worse. If the tics are severe enough to cause problems at school or work, behavioral techniques and medicines may help.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSimple childhood tics usually disappear over a period of months. If symptoms persist for more than three months, they are more likely to become chronic.\nPossible Complications\nThere are usually no complications. A\nchronic motor tic disorder\ncan develop.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nTalk to your child's provider if you are concerned about a provisional tic disorder, especially if it continues or disrupts your child's life. If you are not sure whether the movements are a tic or a\nseizure\n, contact your provider right away.\nAlternative Names\nTic - transient tic disorder\nImages\nCentral nervous system and peripheral nervous system\nBrain\nBrain and nervous system\nBrain structures\nReferences\nKim JW, Walter HJ, DeMaso DR.
