Peritonitis is present when this tissue becomes inflamed or infected. Secondary peritonitis is when another condition is the cause.\nCauses\nSecondary peritonitis has several major causes.\nBacteria may enter the peritoneum through a hole (perforation) in an organ of the digestive tract. The hole may be caused by a ruptured appendix, stomach ulcer, or perforated colon. It may also come from an injury, such as a gunshot or knife wound or following the ingestion of a sharp foreign body.\nBile\nor chemicals released by the pancreas may leak into the abdominal cavity. This may be caused by\nswelling and inflammation of the pancreas\ncalled pancreatitis.\nTubes or catheters placed into the abdomen may cause this problem. These include catheters for peritoneal dialysis, feeding tubes, and others.\nAn infection of the bloodstream (sepsis) may lead to an infection in the abdomen also."}
