Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSilent thyroiditis\nSilent thyroiditis\nSilent thyroiditis is an immune reaction of the thyroid gland. The disorder can cause\nhyperthyroidism\n, followed by\nhypothyroidism\n.\nThe thyroid gland is located in the neck, just above where your collarbones meet in the middle.\nCauses\nThe cause of the disease is unknown. But it is related to an attack against the thyroid by the\nimmune system\n. The disease affects women more often than men.\nThe disease can occur in women who have just had a baby. It can also be caused by medicines such as interferon and amiodarone, and some types of chemotherapy, which affect the immune system.\nSymptoms\nThe earliest symptoms result from an overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism)."}

Medicines called beta-blockers may be used to relieve rapid heart rate and excessive sweating.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSilent thyroiditis often goes away on its own within 1 year."}
