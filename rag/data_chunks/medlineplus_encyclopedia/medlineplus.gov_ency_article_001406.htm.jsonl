These abilities affect learning to read. A child's early reading skills are based on word recognition. That involves being able to separate out the sounds in words and match them with letters and groups of letters.\nPeople with DRD have trouble connecting the sounds of language to the letters of words. This may also create problems in understanding sentences.\nTrue dyslexia is much broader than simply confusing or transposing letters. For example, mistaking a \"b\" and a \"d.\"\nIn general, symptoms of DRD may include problems with:\nDetermining the meaning of a simple sentence\nLearning to recognize written words\nRhyming words\nExams and Tests\nIt is important for your health care provider to check for other causes of learning and reading disabilities, such as:\nEmotional disorders\nIntellectual disability\nBrain diseases\nCertain cultural and education factors\nBefore diagnosing DRD, your provider will:\nPerform a complete medical exam, including a neurological exam.\nAsk questions about the person's developmental, social, and school performance.\nAsk if anyone else in the family has had dyslexia.\nPsych"}
