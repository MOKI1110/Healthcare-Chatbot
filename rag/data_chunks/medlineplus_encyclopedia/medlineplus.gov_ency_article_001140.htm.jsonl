It occurs due to poor muscle movement in the bowel. It is a congenital condition, which means it is present from birth.\nCauses\nMuscle contractions in the gut help digested foods and liquids move through the intestine. This is called peristalsis. Nerves between the muscle layers trigger the contractions.\nIn people with Hirschsprung disease, the nerves are missing from a part of the bowel. Areas without these nerves cannot push material through. This causes a blockage. Intestinal contents build up behind the blockage. The bowel and abdomen swell as a result.\nHirschsprung disease causes about 25% of all newborn intestinal blockages. It occurs 5 times more often in males than in females."}

A rectal exam may reveal tight muscle tone in the rectal muscles.\nTests used to help diagnose Hirschsprung disease may include:\nAbdominal x-ray\nAnal manometry (a balloon is inflated in the rectum to measure pressure in the area)\nBarium enema\nRectal biopsy\nTreatment\nA procedure called serial rectal irrigation helps relieve pressure in (decompress) the bowel.\nThe abnormal section of colon must be taken out using surgery. Most commonly, the rectum and abnormal part of the colon are removed. The healthy part of the colon is then pulled down and attached to the anus.\nSometimes this can be done in one operation. However, it is often done in two parts. A colostomy is performed first. The other part of the procedure is done later in the child's first year of life.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSymptoms improve or go away in most children after surgery. A small number of children may have constipation or problems controlling stools (fecal incontinence)."}

A small number of children may have constipation or problems controlling stools (fecal incontinence). Children who get treated early or who have a shorter segment of bowel involved have a better outcome.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nInflammation and infection of the intestines (enterocolitis) may occur before surgery, and sometimes during the first 1 to 2 years afterwards. Symptoms are severe, including swelling of the abdomen, foul-smelling watery diarrhea, lethargy, and poor feeding.\nPerforation or rupture of the intestine.\nShort bowel syndrome, a condition that can lead to malnourishment and dehydration.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your child's provider if:\nYour child develops symptoms of Hirschsprung disease\nYour child has abdominal pain or other new symptoms after being treated for this condition\nAlternative Names\nCongenital megacolon; Hirschsprung's disease\nReferences\nBass LM, Wershil BK.
