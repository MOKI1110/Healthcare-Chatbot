Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nOsmotic fragility test\nOsmotic fragility test\nOsmotic fragility is a blood test to detect whether red blood cells are more likely to break down.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nIn the laboratory, red blood cells are tested with a solution that makes them swell. This determines how fragile they are.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to detect conditions called\nhereditary spherocytosis\nand\nthalassemia\n. Hereditary spherocytosis and thalassemia cause red blood cells to be more fragile than normal.\nNormal Results\nA normal test result is called a negative result.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result may indicate  one of these conditions:\nThalassemia\nHereditary spherocytosis\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting\nor feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma\n(blood buildup under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nSpherocytosis - osmotic fragility; Thalassemia - osmotic fragility\nReferences\nGallagher PG.
