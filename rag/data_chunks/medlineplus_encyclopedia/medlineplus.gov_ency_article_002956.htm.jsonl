Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLung surgery\nLung surgery\nLung surgery is surgery done to repair or remove lung tissue. There are many common lung surgeries, including:\nBiopsy of an unknown growth in or around the lung\nLobectomy, to remove one or more lobes of a lung\nLung transplant\nPneumonectomy, to remove a lung\nSurgery to prevent the buildup or return of fluid to the chest (pleurodesis)\nSurgery to remove an infection in the chest cavity (\nempyema\n)\nSurgery to remove blood in the chest cavity, particularly after trauma\nSurgery to remove small balloon-like tissues (blebs) that cause lung collapse (\npneumothorax\n)\nWedge resection, to remove part of a lobe in a lung\nA thoracotomy is a surgical cut that a surgeon makes to open the chest wall.\nDescription\nYou will have\ngeneral anesthesia\nbefore surgery. You will be asleep and unable to feel pain. Two common ways to do surgery on your lungs are thoracotomy and video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS). Robotic surgery may also be used.\nLung surgery using a thoracotomy is called open surgery."}

Robotic surgery may also be used.\nLung surgery using a thoracotomy is called open surgery. In this surgery:\nYou will lie on your side on an operating table. Your arm will be placed above your head.\nYour surgeon will make a surgical cut between two ribs. The cut will go from the front of your chest wall to your back, passing just underneath the armpit. These ribs will be separated or a rib may be removed.\nYour lung on this side will be deflated so that air will not move in and out of it during surgery. This makes it easier for the surgeon to operate on the lung.\nYour surgeon may not know how much of your lung needs to be removed until your chest is open and the lung can be seen.\nYour surgeon may also remove lymph nodes in this area.\nAfter surgery, one or more drainage tubes will be placed into your chest area to drain out fluids that build up."}

These tubes are called chest tubes.\nAfter the surgery on your lung, your surgeon will close the ribs, muscles, and skin with sutures.\nOpen lung surgery may take from 2 to 6 hours.\nVideo-assisted thoracoscopic surgery:\nYour surgeon will make several small surgical cuts over your chest wall. A videoscope (a tube with a tiny camera on the end) and other small tools will be passed through these cuts.\nThen, your surgeon may remove part or all of your lung, drain fluid or blood that has built up, or do other procedures.\nOne or more tubes will be placed into your chest to drain fluids that build up.\nThis procedure leads to much less pain and a faster recovery than open lung surgery.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery may be done to:\nRemove\ncancer\n(such as\nlung cancer\n) or biopsy an unknown growth in or around the lung\nTreat injuries that cause lung tissue to collapse (\npneumothorax\nor\nhemothorax\n)\nTreat permanently\ncollapsed lung\ntissue (\natelec"}
