Iron overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this mineral. This can be by accident or on purpose.\nIron overdose is particularly dangerous for children. A severe overdose can happen if a child eats adult multivitamins, such as prenatal vitamins. If the child eats too many pediatric multivitamins, the effect is usually minor.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with has an\noverdose\n, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\nPoisonous Ingredient\nIron can be harmful in large amounts.\nWhere Found\nIron is an ingredient in many mineral and vitamin supplements.
