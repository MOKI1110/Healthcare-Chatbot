Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nImperforate anus\nImperforate anus\nImperforate anus is a defect in which the opening to the anus is missing or blocked. The anus is the opening to the rectum through which stools leave the body. This is present from birth (congenital).\nCauses\nImperforate anus may occur in several forms:\nThe rectum may end in a pouch that does not connect with the colon.\nThe rectum may have openings to other structures. These may include the urethra, bladder, base of the penis or scrotum in boys, or vagina in girls.\nThere may be narrowing (stenosis) of the anus or no anus.\nIt is caused by abnormal development of the fetus. Many forms of imperforate anus occur with other birth defects.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of the problem may include:\nAnal opening very near the vagina opening in girls\nFirst stool is not passed within 24 to 48 hours after birth\nMissing or moved opening to the anus\nStool passes out of the vagina, base of penis, scrotum, or urethra\nSwollen belly area\nTreatment\nA health care provider can diagnose this condition during a physical exam."}

Imaging tests may be ordered.\nThe infant should be checked for other problems, such as abnormalities of the genitals, urinary tract, and spine.\nSurgery to correct the defect is needed. If the rectum connects with other organs, these organs will also need to be repaired. A temporary colostomy (connecting the end of the large intestine to the abdomen wall so that stool can be collected in a bag) is often needed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost defects can successfully be corrected with surgery. Most children with mild defects do very well. However, constipation can be a problem.\nChildren who have more complex surgeries still have control over their bowel movements most of the time. However, they often need to follow a bowel program."}
