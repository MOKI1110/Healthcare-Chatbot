Semen is the thick, white fluid released during ejaculation that contains sperm.\nThis test is sometimes called a sperm count.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will need to provide a semen sample. Your health care provider will explain how to collect a sample.\nWatch this video about:\nSperm release pathway\nMethods for collecting a sperm sample include:\nMasturbating into a sterile jar or cup\nUsing a special condom during intercourse given to you by your provider\nYou should get the sample to the lab within 30 minutes. If the sample is collected at home, keep it in the inside pocket of your coat so that it will stay at body temperature while you are transporting it.\nA laboratory specialist must look at the sample within 2 hours of the collection. The earlier the sample is analyzed, the more reliable the results."}

The earlier the sample is analyzed, the more reliable the results. The following things will be evaluated:\nHow the semen thickens into a solid and turns to liquid\nFluid thickness, acidity, and sugar content\nResistance to flow (viscosity)\nMovement of the sperm (motility)\nNumber and structure of the sperm\nVolume of semen\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nIn order to have an adequate sperm count, do not have any sexual activity that causes ejaculation for 2 to 3 days before the test. However, this time should not be longer than 5 days, after which the quality can diminish.\nHow the Test will Feel\nTalk to your provider if you are uncomfortable with how the sample is to be collected.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nSemen analysis is one of the first tests done to evaluate a man's fertility. It can help determine if a problem in sperm production or quality of the sperm is causing\ninfertility\n. About half of couples unable to have children have a male infertility problem.\nThe test may also be used after a\nvasectomy\nto make sure there are no sperm in the semen."}

About half of couples unable to have children have a male infertility problem.\nThe test may also be used after a\nvasectomy\nto make sure there are no sperm in the semen. This can confirm the success of the vasectomy.\nThe test may also be performed for the following condition:\nKlinefelter syndrome\nNormal Results\nA few of the common normal values are listed below.\nThe normal volume varies from 1.5 to 5.0 milliliter per ejaculation.\nThe sperm count varies from 20 to 150 million sperm per milliliter.\nAt least 60% of the sperm should have a normal shape and show normal forward movement (motility).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nAn abnormal result does not always mean there is a problem with a man's ability to have children. Therefore, it is not completely clear how the test results should be interpreted.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may suggest a male infertility problem. For example, if the sperm count is very low or very high, a man may be less fertile."}

Testing may reveal abnormal shapes or abnormal movements of the sperm.\nHowever, there are many unknowns in male infertility. Further testing may be needed if abnormalities are found.\nMany of the causes of male infertility are treatable.\nRisks\nThere are no risks.\nConsiderations\nThe following may affect a man's fertility:\nAlcohol\nMany recreational and prescription drugs\nTobacco\nAlternative Names\nMale fertility test; Sperm count; Infertility - semen analysis\nImages\nSperm\nSemen analysis\nReferences\nJeelani R, Bluth MH.
