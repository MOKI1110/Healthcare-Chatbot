It leads to breathing difficulty such as wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.\nCauses\nAsthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) in the airways. An asthma attack occurs when the lining of the air passages has become swollen and the muscles surrounding the airways become tight. This narrowing reduces the amount of air that can pass through the airway.\nAsthma symptoms can be caused by breathing in substances called\nallergens\nor triggers, or by other causes.\nCommon asthma triggers include:\nAnimals (pet hair or dander)\nDust mites\nCertain medicines (aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs [NSAIDs])\nChanges in weather (most often cold weather)\nChemicals in the air (pollution) or in food\nPhysical activity\nMold\nPollen\nRespiratory infections, such as the\ncommon cold\nand many other viruses\nStrong emotions (stress)\nTobacco or other inhalant that is smoked\nSubstances in some workplaces can also trigger asthma symptoms, leading to\noccupational"}

Others have no history of allergies.\nSymptoms\nAsthma symptoms vary from person to person. For example, you may have symptoms all the time or mostly during physical activity.\nMost people with asthma have attacks separated by symptom-free periods.

They are used to prevent symptoms in people with moderate to severe asthma. You must take these medicines every day for them to work. Take them even when you feel OK.\nSome long-term medicines are breathed in (inhaled), such as steroids and long-acting beta-agonists. Others are taken by mouth (orally).
