Mental health experts are not sure what causes it. Genes may play a role.\nSchizophrenia occurs in just as many men as women. It usually begins in the teen or young adult years, but it may begin later in life. In women, it tends to begin slightly later.\nSchizophrenia in children usually begins after age 5. Childhood schizophrenia (younger than 13) is rare and can be hard to tell apart from other developmental problems.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms usually develop slowly over months or years. The person may have many symptoms, or only a few.\nPeople with schizophrenia may have trouble keeping friends and jobs."}

A psychiatrist should examine the person and make the diagnosis. The diagnosis is made based on an interview of the person and family members.\nThe psychiatrist will ask about the following:\nHow long symptoms have lasted\nHow the person's ability to function has changed\nWhat the person's developmental background was like\nAbout the person's genetic and family history\nHow well medicines have worked\nWhether the person has problems with substance abuse\nOther medical conditions the person has\nBrain scans (such as\nCT\nor\nMRI\n) and blood tests may be used to check for other conditions that have similar symptoms.\nTreatment\nDuring an episode of schizophrenia, the person may need to stay in the hospital for safety reasons.\nMEDICINES\nAntipsychotic medicines (antipsychotics) are the most effective treatment for schizophrenia. They change the balance of chemicals in the brain and can help regulate symptoms.\nThese medicines can cause side effects, but many side effects can be managed."}

This condition causes repeated movements that the person cannot control. Contact your health care provider right away if you think you or your family member may have this condition due to a medicine.\nWhen schizophrenia does not improve with antipsychotic medicines, other medicines may be tried.\nSchizophrenia is a life-long illness.

Behavioral techniques, such as social skills training, can help the person function better in social and work situations. Job training and relationship-building classes are also important.\nFamily members and caregivers are very important during treatment. Therapy can teach important skills, such as:\nCoping with symptoms that continue, even while taking medicines\nFollowing a healthy lifestyle, including getting enough sleep and staying away from recreational drugs\nTaking medicines correctly and managing side effects\nWatching for the return of symptoms, and knowing what to do when they return\nGetting the right support services\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook is hard to predict.
