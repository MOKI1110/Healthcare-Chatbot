These gene problems are passed down through families (inherited) in an\nautosomal dominant pattern\n. This means the abnormal gene is needed from only one parent in order to inherit the disease. Often, many family members have the disease.\nWith all forms of ADTKD, as the disease progresses, the kidney tubules are damaged."}

Often, many family members have the disease.\nWith all forms of ADTKD, as the disease progresses, the kidney tubules are damaged. These are the structures in the kidneys that allow most fluid in the blood to be filtered and returned to the blood.\nThe abnormal genes that cause the different forms of ADTKD are:\nUMOD\ngene -- causes ADTKD-\nUMOD\n, or uromodulin kidney disease\nMUC1\ngene -- causes ADTKD-\nMUC1\n, or mucin-1 kidney disease\nREN\ngene -- causes ADTKD-\nREN\n, or familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy type 2 (FJHN2)\nHNF1B\ngene -- causes ADTKD-\nHNF1B\n, or maturity-onset diabetes mellitus of the young type 5 (MODY5)\nWhen the cause of ADTKD is not known or a genetic test has not been done, it is called ADTKD-NOS.\nSymptoms\nEarly in the disease, depending on the form of ADTKD, symptoms may include:\nExcessive urination (polyuria)\nGout\nSalt cravings\nUrination at night\n(nocturia)\nWeakness\nAs the disease worsens, symptoms of\nkidney failure\nmay develop, which include:\nEasy bruising or bleeding\nFatigue\n, weakness\nFrequent hiccups\nHeadache\nIncreased skin color (skin may appear yellow or brown)\nItching\nMalaise\n(general"}

Because so much water and salt may be lost, you may need to follow instructions on drinking plenty of fluids and taking salt supplements to avoid dehydration.\nAs the disease progresses, kidney failure develops. Treatment may involve taking medicines and diet changes, limiting foods containing phosphorus and potassium. You may need dialysis and a kidney transplant.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe age at which people with ADTKD reach\nend-stage kidney disease\nvaries, depending on the form of the disease.
