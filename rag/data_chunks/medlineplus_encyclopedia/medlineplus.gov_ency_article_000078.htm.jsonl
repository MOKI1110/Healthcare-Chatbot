Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPrimary alveolar hypoventilation\nPrimary alveolar hypoventilation\nAlveolar hypoventilation means that a person does not have enough respiratory function to keep the blood level of carbon dioxide in a normal range. Primary means that it is not due to an identifiable cause such as a lung or brain disease. The lungs and airways are normal.\nCauses\nNormally, when the oxygen level in the blood is low or the carbon dioxide level is high, there is a signal from the brain to breathe more deeply or quickly. In people with primary alveolar hypoventilation, this change in breathing does not happen.\nThe cause of this condition is unknown. Some babies have symptoms of this at birth, due to congenital central hypoventilation syndrome. This syndrome is due to a variant in the PHOX2B gene. Children and adults may have a less severe condition that has no definitive cause though some health care providers suspect it may be due to changes in the part of the brain that controls breathing.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms are usually worse during sleep."}

Episodes of stopped breathing (\napnea\n) often occur while sleeping. Often there is no shortness of breath during the day.\nSymptoms include:\nBluish coloration of the skin\ncaused by lack of oxygen (cyanosis)\nDaytime\ndrowsiness\nFatigue\nMorning headaches\nSwelling of the ankles\nWaking up from sleep unrested\nWaking up many times at night\nPeople with this disease may be very sensitive to even small doses of sedatives or narcotics. These medicines can make their breathing problem much worse.\nExams and Tests\nYour provider will perform a physical exam and ask about symptoms.\nTests will be done to check for other causes. For example,\nmuscular dystrophy\ncan make the rib muscles weak, and\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n(COPD) damages the lung tissue itself."}

A small stroke can affect the breathing center in the brain.\nTests that may be done include:\nMeasuring levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood (\narterial blood gases\n)\nChest x-ray\nor\nCT scan\nCBC to check oxygen carrying ability of red blood cells\nLung function tests\nOvernight oxygen level measurements (oximetry)\nSleep study (\npolysomnography\n)\nTreatment\nMedicines that stimulate the\nrespiratory\nsystem may be used but do not always work. Mechanical devices that assist breathing, particularly at night, may be helpful in some people. Oxygen therapy may help in a few people, but may worsen night symptoms in others.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nResponse to treatment varies.\nPossible Complications\nLow blood oxygen level can cause high blood pressure in the lung blood vessels. This can lead to\ncor pulmonale\n(right-sided heart failure).\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of this disorder."}
