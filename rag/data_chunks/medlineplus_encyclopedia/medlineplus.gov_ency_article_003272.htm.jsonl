Head size is measured as the distance around the top of the head. A smaller than normal size is determined using standardized charts of head circumference.\nCauses\nMicrocephaly most often occurs because the brain does not grow at a normal rate. The growth of the skull is determined by brain growth. Brain growth takes place while a baby is in the womb and during infancy.\nConditions that affect brain growth can cause smaller than normal head size."}

The Zika virus has been found in Africa, the South Pacific, tropical regions of Asia, and in Brazil and other parts of South America, along with Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nMost often, microcephaly is diagnosed at birth or during routine\nwell-baby exams\n."}

Head measurements are part of all well-baby exams for the first 18 months. This takes only a few seconds while a measuring tape is placed around the infant's head.\nThe provider will keep a record over time to determine:\nWhat is the head circumference?\nIs the head growing at a slower rate than the body?\nWhat other symptoms are there?\nIt may also be helpful to keep your own records of your baby's growth."}
