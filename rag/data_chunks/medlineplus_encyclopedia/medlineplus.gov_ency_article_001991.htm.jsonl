It is most often triggered by poor sleep habits.\nIn children, sleepwalking starts between ages 6 and 12 years. It occurs more often in boys than girls. Children outgrow sleepwalking in most cases.\nIf you can, gently steer someone who is sleepwalking safely back to bed. Try to make the home safer by adding gates to stairways and other safety measures to prevent injury.\nTrying to stick to a bedtime routine may help reduce the problem.\nImages\nSleepwalking\nReferences\nAvidan AY.
