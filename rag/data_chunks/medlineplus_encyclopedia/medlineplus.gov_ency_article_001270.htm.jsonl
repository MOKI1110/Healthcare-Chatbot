Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nUrge incontinence\nUrge incontinence\nUrge incontinence occurs when you have a strong, sudden need to urinate that is difficult to delay. The bladder then squeezes, or spasms, and you may lose urine.\nCauses\nAs your bladder fills with urine from the kidneys, it stretches to make room for the urine. You should feel the first urge to urinate when there is a bit less than 1 cup (240 milliliters) of urine in your bladder. Most people can hold more than 2 cups (480 milliliters) of urine in the bladder.\nTwo muscles help prevent the flow of urine:\nThe sphincter is a muscle around the opening of the bladder. It squeezes to prevent urine from leaking into the urethra. This is the tube that urine passes through from your bladder to the outside.\nThe bladder wall muscle relaxes so the bladder can expand and hold urine.\nWhen you urinate, the bladder wall muscle squeezes to force urine out of the bladder."}

This helps you become aware of when you lose urine because of bladder spasms. Then you relearn the skills you need to hold and release urine.\nYou set a schedule of times when you should try to urinate. You try to avoid urination between these times.\nOne method is to force yourself to wait 30 minutes between trips to the bathroom, even if you have an urge to urinate in between these times. This may not be possible in some cases.\nAs you become better at waiting, gradually increase the time by 15 minutes until you are urinating every 3 to 4 hours.\nPELVIC FLOOR MUSCLE TRAINING\nSometimes,\nKegel exercises\n, biofeedback, or electrical stimulation may be used with bladder retraining."}

This includes taking bubble baths or using harsh soaps.\nMEDICINES\nMedicines used to treat urge incontinence relax bladder contractions and help improve bladder function. There are several types of medicines that may be used alone or together:\nAnticholinergic medicines help relax the muscles of the bladder. They include oxybutynin (Oxytrol, Ditropan), tolterodine (Detrol), darifenacin (Enablex), trospium (Sanctura), and solifenacin (VESIcare).\nBeta agonist medicines can also help relax the muscles of the bladder."}

The only medicine of this type currently is mirabegron (Myrbetriq).\nFlavoxate (Urispas) is a medicine that calms muscle spasms. However, studies have shown that it is not always effective at controlling symptoms of urge incontinence.\nTricyclic antidepressants (imipramine) help relax the smooth muscle of the bladder.\nBotox injections are commonly used to treat overactive bladder. The medicine is injected into the bladder through a cystoscope. The procedure is most often done in the provider's office.\nThese medicines may have side effects such as dizziness, constipation, or dry mouth. Talk with your provider if you notice bothersome side effects.\nIf you have an infection, your provider will prescribe antibiotics. Be sure to take the entire amount as directed.\nSURGERY\nSurgery can help your bladder store more urine. It can also help relieve the pressure on your bladder."}

Surgery is used for people who do not respond to medicines or who have side effects associated with medicines.\nSacral nerve stimulation involves implanting a small unit under your skin. This unit sends small electrical pulses to the sacral nerve (one of the nerves that comes out at the base of your spine). The electrical pulses can be adjusted to help relieve your symptoms.\nAugmentation cystoplasty is performed as a last resort for severe urge incontinence. In this surgery, a part of the bowel is added to the bladder. This increases the bladder size and allows it to store more urine.\nPossible complications include:\nBlood clots\nBowel blockage\nInfection\nSlightly increased risk of tumors\nNot being able to empty your bladder -- you may need to learn how to put a catheter into the bladder to drain urine\nUrinary tract infection\nUrinary incontinence is a long-term (chronic) problem."}

Many people must try different treatments (some at the same time) to reduce symptoms.\nGetting better takes time, so try to be patient.
