Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPtosis - infants and children\nPtosis - infants and children\nPtosis (\neyelid drooping\n) in infants and children is when the upper eyelid is lower than it should be. This may occur in one or both eyes. Eyelid drooping that occurs at birth or within the first year is called congenital ptosis.\nConsiderations\nPtosis in infants and children is often due to a problem with the muscle that raises the eyelid. A nerve problem in the eyelid can also cause it to droop.\nPtosis may also occur due to other conditions. Some of these include:\nTrauma at birth (such as from the use of forceps)\nEye movement disorders\nBrain and nervous system problems\nEyelid tumors or growths\nEyelid drooping that occurs later in childhood or adulthood may have other causes.\nSYMPTOMS\nChildren with ptosis may tip their head back to see. They may raise their eyebrows to try to move the eyelid up."}

Your child may need to:\nWear an eye patch to strengthen vision in the weaker eye.\nWear special glasses to correct an uneven curve of the cornea that causes blurred vision (\nastigmatism\n).\nChildren with mild ptosis should have regular eye exams to make sure amblyopia does not develop.\nSurgery often works well to improve the look and function of the eye.
