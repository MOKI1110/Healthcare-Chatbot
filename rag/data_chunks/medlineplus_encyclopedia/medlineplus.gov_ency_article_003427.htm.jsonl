Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCapillary sample\nCapillary sample\nA capillary sample is a blood sample collected by pricking the skin. Capillaries are tiny blood vessels near the surface of the skin.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is done in the following way:\nThe area is cleansed with antiseptic.\nThe skin of the finger, heel, or another area is pricked with a sharp needle or a lancet.\nThe blood may be collected in a pipette (small glass tube), on a slide, onto a test strip, or into a small container.\nCotton or a bandage may be applied to the puncture site if there is any continued bleeding.\nHow the Test will Feel\nSome people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nBlood transports oxygen, food, waste products, and other materials within the body. It also helps regulate body temperature. Blood is made up of cells and a fluid called plasma. Plasma contains various dissolved substances."}

It also helps regulate body temperature. Blood is made up of cells and a fluid called plasma. Plasma contains various dissolved substances. The cells are mainly red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.\nBecause blood has many functions, tests on the blood or its components provide valuable clues in the diagnosis of medical conditions.\nCapillary blood sampling has several advantages over drawing blood from a vein:\nIt is easy to obtain (it can be difficult to obtain blood from the veins, especially in infants).\nThere are several collection sites on the body, and these sites can be rotated.\nTesting can be done at home and with little training. For example, persons with diabetes must check their blood sugar several times a day using capillary blood sampling.\nDisadvantages to capillary blood sampling include:\nOnly a limited amount of blood can be drawn using this method.\nThe procedure has some risks (see below).\nCapillary blood sampling may result in inaccurate results, such as falsely elevated sugar, electrolyte, and blood count values.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nResults vary depending on the test done."}
