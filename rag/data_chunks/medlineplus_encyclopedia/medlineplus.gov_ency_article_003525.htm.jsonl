Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCoccidioides precipitin test\nCoccidioides precipitin test\nCoccidioides precipitin is a blood test that looks for infections due to a fungus called Coccidioides, which causes the disease\ncoccidioidomycosis\nor valley fever.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample is needed\n.\nThe sample is sent to a laboratory. There, it is examined for bands called precipitin that form when specific\nantibodies\nare present.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no special preparation for the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe precipitin test is one of several tests that can be done to determine if you are infected with Coccidioides, which causes the disease coccidioidomycosis.\nAntibodies are specialized proteins that defend the body against bacteria, viruses, and fungi. These and other foreign substances are called\nantigens\n."}

These and other foreign substances are called\nantigens\n. When you are exposed to antigens, your body produces antibodies.\nThe precipitin test helps check if the body has produced antibodies to a specific antigen, in this case, the Coccidioides fungus.\nNormal Results\nA normal result is when no precipitins are formed. This means the blood test did not detect the antibody to Coccidioides.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal (positive) result means the antibody to Coccidioides has been detected.\nIn this case, another test is done to confirm that you have an infection. Your health care provider can tell you more.\nDuring the early stage of an illness, few antibodies may be detected. Antibody production increases during the course of an infection. For this reason, this test may be repeated several weeks after the first test.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other."}
