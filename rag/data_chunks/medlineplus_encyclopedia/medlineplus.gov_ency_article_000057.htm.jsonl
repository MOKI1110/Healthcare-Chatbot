Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFrostbite\nFrostbite\nFrostbite is damage to the skin and underlying tissues caused by extreme cold. Frostbite is the most common freezing injury.\nCauses\nFrostbite occurs when the skin and body tissues are exposed to cold temperature for a long period of time.\nYou are more likely to develop frostbite if you:\nTake medicines called beta-blockers\nHave poor blood supply to the legs (\nperipheral vascular disease\n)\nSmoke or use tobacco\nHave\ndiabetes\nHave\nRaynaud phenomenon\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of frostbite may include:\nPins and needles feeling, followed by numbness\nHard, pale, and cold skin that has been exposed to the cold for too long\nAching, throbbing or lack of feeling in the affected area\nRed and extremely painful skin and muscle as the area thaws\nVery severe frostbite may cause:\nBlisters\nGangrene\n(blackened, dead tissue)\nDamage to tendons, muscles, nerves, and bone\nFrostbite may affect any part of the body."}

The hands, feet, nose, and ears are the places most prone to frostbite.\nIf the frostbite did not affect your blood vessels, a complete recovery is possible.\nIf the frostbite affected the blood vessels, the damage is permanent. Gangrene may occur. This may require removal of the affected body part (amputation).\nFirst Aid\nA person with frostbite on the arms or legs may also have\nlowered body temperature\n(hypothermia). Check for hypothermia and treat those symptoms first.\nTake the following steps if you think someone might have frostbite:\nShelter the person from the cold and move them to a warmer place. Remove any tight jewelry and wet clothes. Look for signs of hypothermia and treat that condition first.\nIf you can get medical help quickly, it is best to wrap the damaged areas in sterile dressings. Separate affected fingers and toes with bandage material."}

Separate affected fingers and toes with bandage material. Transport the person to an emergency department for further care.\nIf medical help is not nearby, you may give the person rewarming first aid. Soak the affected areas in warm (never hot) water -- for 20 to 30 minutes. For ears, nose, and cheeks, apply a warm cloth repeatedly. The recommended water temperature is 104 °F to 108 °F (40 °C to 42.2 °C). Keep circulating the water to aid the warming process. Severe burning pain, swelling, and color changes may occur during warming. Warming is complete when the skin is soft and feeling returns.\nApply dry, sterile dressings to the frostbitten areas. Put dressings between frostbitten fingers or toes to keep them separated.\nMove thawed areas as little as possible.\nRefreezing of thawed extremities can cause more severe damage. Prevent refreezing by wrapping the thawed areas and keeping the person warm."}
