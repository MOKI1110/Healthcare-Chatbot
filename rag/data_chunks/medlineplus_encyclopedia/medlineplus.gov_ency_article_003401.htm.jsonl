Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEsophageal pH monitoring\nEsophageal pH monitoring\nEsophageal pH monitoring is a test that measures how often stomach acid enters the tube that leads from the mouth to the stomach (called the esophagus). The test also measures how long the acid stays there.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA thin tube is passed through your nose or mouth to your stomach. The tube is then pulled back into your esophagus. A monitor attached to the tube measures the acid level (pH) in your esophagus.\nYou will wear the monitor on a strap and record your symptoms and activities over the next 24 hours in a diary. You will return to the hospital the next day and the tube will be removed. The information from the monitor will be compared with your diary notes.\nInfants and children may need to stay in the hospital for the esophageal pH monitoring test.\nA newer method of monitoring esophageal acid (pH monitoring) is by use of a wireless pH probe."}

This is called the Bravo pH monitor system.\nThis capsule-like device is attached to the lining of the upper esophagus with an endoscope.\nIt remains in the esophagus where it measures acidity and transmits pH levels to a recording device worn on the wrist.\nThe capsule falls off after a 4 to 10 days and moves down through gastrointestinal tract. It is then expelled with a bowel movement and flushed down the toilet.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider will ask you to not eat or drink after midnight before the test. You should also avoid smoking.\nSome medicines may change the test results. Your provider may ask you to not take these for between 24 hours and 2 weeks (or more) before the test. You also may be told to avoid alcohol."}

It also checks how well the acid is cleared downward into the stomach."}
