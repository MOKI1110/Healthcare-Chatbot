Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nIntravitreal injection\nIntravitreal injection\nAn intravitreal injection is a shot of medicine into the eye. The inside of the eye is filled with a jelly-like fluid (vitreous). During this procedure, your health care provider (usually an ophthalmologist) injects medicine into the vitreous, near the retina at the back of the eye. The medicine can treat certain eye problems and help protect your vision. This method is most often used to get a higher level of medicine to the retina.\nDescription\nThe procedure is done in your provider's office. It takes about 15 to 30 minutes.\nDrops will be placed in your eyes to widen (dilate) the pupils.\nYou will lie face up in a comfortable position.\nYour eyes and eyelids will be cleaned.\nNumbing drops will be placed in your eye.\nA small device will keep your eyelids open during the procedure.\nYou will be asked to look toward the other eye.\nMedicine will be injected into your eye with a small needle."}

You may feel pressure, but not pain.\nAntibiotic drops may be placed in your eye.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nYou may have this procedure if you have:\nMacular degeneration\n-- an eye disorder that slowly destroys sharp, central vision\nMacular edema -- swelling or thickening of the macula, the part of your eye that provides sharp, central vision\nDiabetic retinopathy\n-- a complication of diabetes, which can cause new, abnormal blood vessels to grow in the retina, the back part of your eye\nUveitis\n-- swelling and inflammation within the eyeball\nRetinal vein occlusion\n-- a blockage of the veins that carry blood away from the retina and out of the eye\nEndophthalmitis\n-- infection in the inside of the eye\nSometimes, an intravitreal injection of antibiotics and steroids is given as part of routine cataract surgery. This avoids having to use drops after surgery.\nRisks\nSide effects are rare, and many can be managed."}
