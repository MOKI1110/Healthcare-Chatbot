Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRheumatoid factor (RF)\nRheumatoid factor (RF)\nRheumatoid factor (RF) is a blood test that measures the amount of the RF\nantibody\nin the blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nMost of the time, blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\nIn infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin.\nThe blood collects in a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip.\nA bandage is put over the spot to stop any bleeding.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou do not need to take special steps before this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is most often used to help diagnose\nrheumatoid arthritis\nor\nSjÃ¶gren syndrome\n.\nNormal Results\nResults are usually reported in one of two ways:\nValue, normal less than 15 IU/mL\nTiter, normal less than 1:80 (1 to 80)\nIf the result is above the normal level, it is positive."}

A low number (negative result) most often means you do not have rheumatoid arthritis or SjÃ¶gren syndrome. However, some people who do have these conditions still have a negative or low RF.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result means the test is positive, which means a higher level of RF has been detected in your blood.\nMany people with rheumatoid arthritis or SjÃ¶gren syndrome have positive RF tests.\nThe higher the level, the more likely one of these conditions is present. There are also other tests that can be done to help make the diagnosis.\nNot everyone with a higher level of RF has rheumatoid arthritis or SjÃ¶gren syndrome.\nYour provider should also do another blood test (anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody or anti-CCP antibody), to help diagnose rheumatoid arthritis (RA)."}
