During this stage, there are no symptoms of HIV infection. This stage is also called chronic HIV infection or clinical latency.\nDuring this stage, the virus keeps multiplying in the body and the immune system slowly weakens, but the person has no symptoms. How long this stage lasts depends on how quickly the HIV virus copies itself, and how the person's genes affect the way the body handles the virus.\nSome people may have symptoms and worsening immune function within a few years after the original infection. Others can go 10 years or longer without symptoms.\nImages\nAsymptomatic HIV infection\nReferences\nReitz MS, Gallo RC. Human immunodeficiency viruses.
