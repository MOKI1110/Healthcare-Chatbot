The condition is present at birth (congenital).\nThe condition is caused by a defect in the kidneys' ability to reabsorb sodium. People affected by Bartter syndrome lose too much sodium through the urine. This causes a rise in the level of the hormone aldosterone, and makes the kidneys remove too much potassium from the body. This is known as potassium wasting.\nThe condition also results in an abnormal acid balance in the blood called hypokalemic alkalosis, which causes too much calcium in the urine.\nSymptoms\nThis disease usually occurs in childhood. Symptoms include:\nConstipation\nLess weight gain than other children of similar age and sex (\ngrowth failure\n)\nFrequent urination (\nurinary frequency\n)\nLow blood pressure\nKidney stones\nMuscle cramping and weakness\nExams and Tests\nBartter syndrome is usually suspected when a blood test finds a\nlow level of potassium in the blood\n."}

Unlike other forms of kidney disease, this condition does not cause high blood pressure. There is a tendency toward low blood pressure. Laboratory tests may show:\nHigh urine\npotassium\n, calcium, and\nchloride levels\nHigh blood levels of the hormones,\nrenin\nand aldosterone\nLow blood chloride level\nMetabolic\nalkalosis\nThese same signs and symptoms can also occur in people who take too many diuretics (water pills) or laxatives. Urine tests can be done to rule out other causes.\nAn ultrasound of the kidneys may be done.\nTreatment\nBartter syndrome is treated by eating foods rich in potassium or taking potassium supplements.\nMany people also need salt and magnesium supplements. Medicine may be needed that blocks the kidney's ability to get rid of potassium. High doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may also be used.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nInfants who have severe growth failure may grow normally with treatment."}
