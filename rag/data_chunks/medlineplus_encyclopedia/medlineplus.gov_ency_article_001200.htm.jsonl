Alkaptonuria is part of a group of conditions known as an\ninborn error of metabolism\n.\nCauses\nA change in the\nHGD\ngene causes alkaptonuria.\nThe change in the gene makes the body unable to properly break down the amino acids tyrosine and phenylalanine. As a result, a substance called homogentisic acid builds up in the skin and other body tissues. The acid leaves the body through the urine. The urine turns brownish-black when it mixes with air.\nAlkaptonuria is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance.\nSymptoms\nUrine in an infant's diaper may darken and can turn almost black after several hours. However, many people with this condition may not know they have it."}

However, many people with this condition may not know they have it. The disease is most often discovered in mid-adulthood (around age 40), when joint and other problems occur.\nSymptoms may include:\nArthritis\n(especially of the spine) that gets worse over time\nDarkening of the ear\nDark spots on the white of the eye and cornea\nExams and Tests\nA urine test is done to test for alkaptonuria. If ferric chloride is added to the urine, it will turn the urine black in people with this condition.\nTreatment\nManagement of alkaptonuria has traditionally been focused on controlling symptoms. Eating a low protein diet may be helpful, but many people find this restriction difficult."}

Medicines, such as NSAIDs and physical therapy may help relieve joint pain.\nClinical trials are underway for other medicines to treat this condition and to assess whether the drug nitisinone provides long-term help with this illness.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome is expected to be good.\nPossible Complications\nThe build-up of homogentisic acid in the cartilage causes arthritis in many adults with alkaptonuria.\nHomogentisic acid also can build up on the heart valves, especially the mitral valve."}
