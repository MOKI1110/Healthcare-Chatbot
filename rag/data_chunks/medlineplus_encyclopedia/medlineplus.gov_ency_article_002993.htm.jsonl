Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPatent urachus repair\nPatent urachus repair\nPatent urachus repair is surgery to fix a bladder defect. In an open (or patent) urachus, there is an opening between the bladder and the belly button (navel). The urachus is a tube between the bladder and the belly button that is present before birth. In most cases, it closes along its full length before the baby is born. An open urachus is diagnosed mostly in infants.\nDescription\nChildren who have this surgery will have\ngeneral anesthesia\n(asleep and pain-free).\nThe surgeon will make a cut in the child's lower belly. Next, the surgeon will find the urachal tube and remove it. The bladder opening will be repaired, and the cut will be closed.\nThe surgery can also be done with a laparoscope. This is an instrument that has a tiny camera and light on the end.\nThe surgeon will make 3 small surgical cuts in the child's belly."}

The surgeon will insert the laparoscope through one of these cuts and other tools through the other cuts.\nThe surgeon uses the tools to remove the urachal tube and close off the bladder and area where the tube connects to the umbilicus (belly button).\nThis surgery can be done in children as young as 6 months.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nSurgery is recommended for a patent urachus that does not close after birth."}
