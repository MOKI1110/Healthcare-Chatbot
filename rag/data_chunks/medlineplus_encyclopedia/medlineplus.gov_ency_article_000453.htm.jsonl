Gonococcal arthritis affects women more often than men. It is most common among sexually active young adults.\nGonococcal arthritis occurs when the bacteria spread through the blood to a joint. Sometimes, more than one joint is infected.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of joint infection may include:\nFever\nJoint pain\nfor 1 to 4 days\nPain in the hands or wrists due to tendon inflammation\nPain or burning during urination\nSingle joint pain\nSkin rash (sores are slightly raised, pink to red, and may later contain pus or appear purple)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about the symptoms.\nTests will be done to check for a gonorrhea infection. This may involve taking samples of tissue, joint fluids, or other body material and sending them to a lab for examination under a microscope. Examples of such tests include:\nCervical Gram stain\nCulture of joint aspirate\nJoint fluid Gram stain\nThroat culture\nUrine test for gonorrhea\nTreatment\nThe gonorrhea infection must be treated.\nThere are two aspects of treating a sexually transmitted disease, especially one as easily spread as gonorrhea. The first is to cure the infected person."}

The first is to cure the infected person. The second is to locate, test, and treat all sexual contacts of the infected person. This is done to prevent further spread of the disease.\nSome locations allow you to take counseling information and treatment to your partner(s) yourself. In other locations, the health department will contact your partner(s).\nA treatment routine is recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Your provider will determine the best and most up-to-date treatment. A follow-up visit 7 days after treatment is important if the infection was complicated, to recheck blood tests and confirm that the infection was cured.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSymptoms usually improve within 1 to 2 days of starting treatment."}

Full recovery can be expected.\nPossible Complications\nUntreated, this condition may lead to persistent joint pain.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of gonorrhea or gonococcal arthritis.\nPrevention\nNot having sexual intercourse (abstinence) is the only sure method to prevent gonorrhea. A monogamous sexual relationship with a person who you know does not have any sexually transmitted disease (STD) can reduce your risk. Monogamous means you and your partner do not have sex with any other people.\nYou can greatly lower your risk for infection with an STD by\npracticing safer sex\n. This means using a condom every time you have sex. Condoms are available for both\nmen\nand\nwomen\n, but they are most commonly worn by the man."}
