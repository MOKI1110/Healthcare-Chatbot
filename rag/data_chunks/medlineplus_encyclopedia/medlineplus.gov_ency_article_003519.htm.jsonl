Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAllergy testing - skin\nAllergy testing - skin\nAllergy skin tests are used to find out which substances cause a person to have an\nallergic reaction\n. These substances are called allergens.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThere are three common methods of allergy skin testing.\nThe skin prick test involves:\nPlacing a small amount of substances (\nallergens\n) that may be causing your symptoms on the skin, most often on the forearm, upper arm, or back.\nThe skin is then pricked so the allergen goes under the skin's surface.\nThe health care provider closely watches the skin for\nswelling\nand redness or other signs of a reaction. Results are usually seen within 15 to 20 minutes.\nSeveral allergens can be tested at the same time.\nThe intradermal skin test involves:\nInjecting a small amount of allergen into the skin.\nThe provider then watches for a reaction at the site.\nThis test is more likely to be used to find out if you're allergic to bee venom or penicillin."}

Or it may be used if the skin prick test was negative and the provider still thinks that you're allergic to the allergen.\nPatch testing is a method to diagnose the cause of skin reactions that occur after the substance touches the skin:\nPossible allergens are taped to the skin for 48 hours.\nThe provider will look at the area in 72 to 96 hours.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nBefore any allergy testing, the provider will ask about:\nIllnesses\nWhere you live and work\nLifestyle\nFoods and eating habits\nMedicines that contain antihistamines - whether prescription or over-the-counter - can change the results of skin tests. Your provider will tell you which medicines to avoid and when to stop taking them before the test. If you don't want to stop taking a medicine due to the severity of your symptoms, please tell your provider."}

If you don't want to stop taking a medicine due to the severity of your symptoms, please tell your provider. They may be able to use a different approach to allergy testing.\nYou don't need to stop taking non-antihistamine medicines such as asthma inhalers, montelukast, and nasal steroids.\nHow the Test will Feel\nSkin tests may cause very mild discomfort when the skin is pricked. Positive skin tests will become red, itchy and swollen like a bug bite.\nYou may have symptoms such as itching, a stuffy nose, red watery eyes, or a skin rash if you're allergic to the substance in the test.\nIn rare cases, people can have a whole-body allergic reaction (called\nanaphylaxis\n), which can be life threatening. This usually only occurs with intradermal testing. Your provider will be prepared to treat this serious response.\nPatch tests may be irritating or itchy."}

These symptoms will go away when the patch tests are removed.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nAllergy tests are done to find out which substances are causing your allergy symptoms.\nYour provider may order allergy skin tests if you have:\nHay fever (\nallergic rhinitis\n) and asthma symptoms that are not well controlled with medicine\nHives\nand\nangioedema\nFood allergies\nSkin rashes (\ndermatitis\n), in which the skin becomes red, sore, or swollen after contact with the substance\nPenicillin allergy\nVenom allergy\nAllergies to penicillin and related medicines are the only medicine allergies that can be tested using skin tests.\nThe skin prick test may also be used to diagnose food allergies. Intradermal tests are not used to test for food allergies because of high false-positive results and the danger of causing a severe allergic reaction.\nNormal Results\nA negative test result means there were no skin changes in response to the allergen."}

This negative reaction most often means that you are not allergic to the substance.\nIn rare cases, a person may have a negative allergy test and still be allergic to the substance.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA positive result means you reacted to a substance. Your provider will see a red, raised area called a wheal.\nOften, a positive result means the symptoms you're having are due to exposure to that substance. A stronger response means you are likely more sensitive to the substance.\nPeople can have a positive response to a substance with allergy skin testing, but not have any problems with that substance in everyday life. Food allergy testing particularly carries a high risk of these false positive results.\nSkin tests are usually accurate."}
