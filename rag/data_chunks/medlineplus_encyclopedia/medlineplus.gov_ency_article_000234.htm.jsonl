Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMeckel diverticulum\nMeckel diverticulum\nA Meckel diverticulum is a pouch on the wall of the lower part of the small intestine that is present at birth (congenital). The diverticulum may contain tissue similar to that of the stomach or pancreas.  The abnormal tissue can secrete acid, which may irritate the tissues.\nCauses\nA Meckel diverticulum is tissue left over from when a baby's digestive tract was forming before birth. A small number of people have a Meckel diverticulum. However, only a few develop symptoms.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nPain in the abdomen that can be mild or severe.\nBlood in the stool.  This may be red, black and sticky, or maroon and jelly-like (called currant-jelly stools). Bleeding is often painless.\nNausea and vomiting.\nSymptoms often occur during the first few years of life."}

However, they may not start until adulthood.\nExams and Tests\nYou may have the following tests:\nHematocrit\nHemoglobin\nStool smear for invisible blood (\nstool occult blood test\nor fecal immunochemical test)\nCT scan\nTechnetium scan\n(also called a Meckel scan)\nTreatment\nYou may need surgery to remove the diverticulum if bleeding develops, a blockage occurs, or a hole (perforated ulcer) in the small intestine happens. The segment of small intestine that contains the diverticulum is taken out. The ends of the intestine are sewn back together.\nYou may need to take iron supplements to treat\nanemia\n. You may need a blood transfusion if you have a lot of bleeding,\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people recover fully from surgery and will not have the problem come back."}
