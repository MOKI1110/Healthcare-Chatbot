A strong form of the drug is illegally sold on the streets. A much weaker form of the drug is used to treat narcolepsy and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). This weaker form is sold as a prescription. Medicines that are legally used to treat cold symptoms, such as decongestants, can be made into methamphetamines. Other related compounds include MDMA, ('ecstasy,' 'Molly,' 'E'), MDEA, ('Eve'), and MDA, ('Sally,' 'sass').\nThis article focuses on the illegal street drug. The street drug is usually a white crystal-like powder, called \"crystal meth.\" This powder can be snorted up the nose, smoked, swallowed, or dissolved and injected into a vein.\nA methamphetamine\noverdose\nmay be acute (sudden) or chronic (long-term).\nAn acute methamphetamine overdose occurs when someone takes this drug by accident or on purpose and has side effects."}

These side effects can be life threatening.\nA chronic methamphetamine overdose refers to the health effects in someone who uses the drug on a regular basis.\nInjuries during illegal methamphetamine production or police raids include exposure to dangerous chemicals, as well as burns and explosions. All of these can cause serious, life threatening injuries and conditions.\nThis is for information only and not for use in the treatment or management of an actual overdose.

It may be called meth, crystal meth, crank, speed, glass, tweak, chalk, Tina, or ice.\nA much weaker form of methamphetamine is sold as a prescription with the brand name Desoxyn. It is sometimes used to treat narcolepsy. Adderall, a brand name drug containing amphetamine, is used to treat ADHD.\nSymptoms\nMethamphetamine most often causes a general feeling of wellness (euphoria) that is most often called a \"rush.\" Other symptoms are increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, sweating, restlessness, dry mouth, elevated body temperature, and large, wide pupils.\nIf you take a large amount of the drug, you will be at higher risk for more dangerous side effects, including:\nAgitation\nChest pain\nComa or unresponsiveness (in extreme cases)\nHeart attack\nIrregular or stopped heartbeat\nDifficulty breathing\nVery high body temperature\nKidney damage and possibly kidney failure\nParanoia\nSeizures\nSevere stomach pain\nStroke\nLong-term use of methamphetamine can lead to significant psychological probl"}

Take extreme caution around them, especially if they appear to be extremely excited or paranoid.\nIf they are having a seizure, gently hold the back of their head to prevent injury. If possible, turn their head or body to the side in case they vomit."}
