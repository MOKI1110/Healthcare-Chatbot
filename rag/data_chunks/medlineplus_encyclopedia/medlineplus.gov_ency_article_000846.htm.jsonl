Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAngioedema\nAngioedema\nAngioedema is swelling that is similar to\nhives\n, but the swelling is under the skin instead of on the surface.\nHives are often called welts. They are a surface swelling. It is possible to have angioedema without hives, and many times angioedema can come with hives.\nCauses\nAngioedema may be caused by an\nallergic reaction\n. Angioedema typically is not itchy while hives are very itchy. During the reaction, histamine and other chemicals are released into the bloodstream."}

Angioedema typically is not itchy while hives are very itchy. During the reaction, histamine and other chemicals are released into the bloodstream. The body releases histamine when the immune system detects a foreign substance called an\nallergen\n.\nHowever, in most cases, the cause of angioedema is never found.\nThe following may cause angioedema:\nAllergies due to animal dander (\nscales\nof shed skin), foods, insect bites or pollen\nExposure to water, sunlight, cold or heat\nMedicines (\ndrug allergy\n) such as antibiotics (penicillin and sulfa drugs), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and certain blood pressure medicines (ACE inhibitors)\nAutoimmune diseases such as lupus\nHives and angioedema may also occur after infections. Angioedema may occur alone or with other illnesses (including\nautoimmune disorders\nsuch as lupus,\nleukemia\n, and lymphoma).\nA rare form of angioedema runs in families and has different triggers, complications, and treatments. This is called\nhereditary angioedema\n.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom is sudden swelling below the skin surface."}

This is called\nhereditary angioedema\n.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom is sudden swelling below the skin surface. Welts or swelling on the surface of the skin can also develop.\nThe swelling usually occurs around the eyes and lips. It may also be found on the hands, feet, and throat. The swelling may form a line or be more spread out.\nThe welts are painful and may be itchy. This is known as hives (urticaria). They turn pale and swell if irritated. The deeper swelling of angioedema may also be painful.\nOther symptoms may include:\nAbdominal cramping\nBreathing difficulty\nSwollen eyes and mouth\nSwollen lining of the eyes (\nchemosis\n)\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will look at your skin and ask if you have been exposed to any irritating substances. If your throat is affected, a physical exam might reveal abnormal sounds (\nstridor\n) when you breathe in.\nBlood tests or\nallergy testing\nmay be ordered, but often no cause of the swelling or hives is found.\nTreatment\nMild symptoms may not need treatment. Moderate to severe symptoms may need to be treated."}
