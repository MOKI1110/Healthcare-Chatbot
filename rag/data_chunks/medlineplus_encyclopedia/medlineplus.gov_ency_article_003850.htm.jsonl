For large sores or sores of the throat,\ngeneral anesthesia\nmay be needed. This means you will be asleep during the procedure.\nAll or part of the problem area (lesion) is removed. It is sent to the laboratory to check for diseases. If a growth in the mouth or throat needs to be removed, the biopsy will be done first. This is followed by the actual removal of the growth.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nIf a simple painkilling or local numbing medicine is to be used, there is no special preparation. If the test is part of a growth removal or if general anesthesia is used, you will likely be asked not to eat for 6 to 8 hours before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel pressure or tugging while the tissue is being removed."}
