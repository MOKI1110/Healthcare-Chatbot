Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLH response to GnRH blood test\nLH response to GnRH blood test\nLH response to GnRH is a blood test to help determine if your pituitary gland can correctly respond to gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH). LH stands for luteinizing hormone.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample is taken\n, and then you are given a shot of GnRH. After a specified time, more blood samples are taken so that\nLH\ncan be measured.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nGnRH is a hormone made by the hypothalamus gland. LH is made by the pituitary gland. GnRH causes (stimulates) the pituitary gland to release LH.\nThis test is used to tell the difference between primary and secondary\nhypogonadism\n. Hypogonadism is a condition in which the sex glands make little or no hormones."}

Hypogonadism is a condition in which the sex glands make little or no hormones. In men, the sex glands (gonads) are the testes. In women, the sex glands are the ovaries.\nDepending on the type of hypogonadism:\nPrimary hypogonadism starts in the testicle or ovary\nSecondary hypogonadism starts in the hypothalamus or pituitary gland\nThis test may also be done to check for the reason why there is a:\nLow\ntestosterone\nlevel in men\nLow\nestradiol\nlevel in women\nNormal Results\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn increased LH response suggests a problem in the ovaries or testes.\nA reduced LH response suggests a problem with the hypothalamus gland or pituitary gland.\nAbnormal results may also be due to:\nPituitary gland problems, such as release of too much hormone (\nhyperprolactinemia\n)\nLarge\npituitary tumors\nDecrease in hormones made by the\nendocrine glands\nToo much iron in the body (\nhemochromatosis\n)\nEating disorders, such as\nanorexia\nRecent significant weight loss, such as after bariatric surgery\nDelayed or absent puberty (Kallmann syndrome)\nLack of periods in women (\namenorrhea\n)\nObesity\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
