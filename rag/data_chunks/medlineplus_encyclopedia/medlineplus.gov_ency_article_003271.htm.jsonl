A child with short stature's height is:\nTwo standard deviations (SD) or more below the average height for children of the same sex and age.\nBelow the 2.3rd percentile on the growth chart. This means that out of 1,000 boys (or girls) who were born on the same day, 977 of the children are taller than your son or daughter.\nConsiderations\nYour child's provider checks how your child is growing at regular checkups. Your child's provider will:\nRecord your child's height and weight on a growth chart.\nMonitor your child's growth rate over time.

They will probably start puberty later than their friends. Your child will most likely keep growing after most of their peers have stopped growing, and will probably be as tall as their parents. Providers call this \"constitutional growth delay.\"\nIf one or both parents are short, your child will most likely also be short."}
