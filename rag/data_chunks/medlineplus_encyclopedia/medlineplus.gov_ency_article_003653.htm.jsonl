Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPartial thromboplastin time (PTT)\nPartial thromboplastin time (PTT)\nPartial thromboplastin time (PTT) is a blood test that looks at how long it takes for blood to clot. It can help tell if you have a bleeding problem or if your blood does not clot properly. This test measures the function of a part of the coagulation (clotting) system.\nA related blood test is\nprothrombin time (PT)\n, which measures the function of a different part of the clotting system.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed. If you are taking any blood-thinning medicines, you will be watched for signs of bleeding.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour health care provider may tell you to temporarily stop taking medicines that may affect the test results. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take. Also, tell your provider about any herbal remedies you take.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou may need this test if you have problems with bleeding or your blood does not clot properly. When you bleed, a series of actions involving many different proteins (clotting factors) take place in the body that helps the blood clot. This is called the coagulation cascade. The PTT test looks at some of the proteins or factors involved in this process and measures their ability to help blood clot.\nThe test may also be used to monitor people who are taking heparin, a blood thinner.\nA PTT test is usually done with other tests, such as the prothrombin test or PT.\nNormal Results\nIn general, the PTT should be 25 to 35 seconds. If the person is taking blood thinners, clotting takes longer.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal (too long) PTT result may also be due to:\nBleeding disorders\n, a group of conditions in which there is a problem with the body's blood clotting process\nDisorder in which the proteins that control blood clotting become over active (\ndisseminated intravascular coagulation\n)\nLiver disease\nDifficulty absorbing nutrients from food (\nmalabsorption\n)\nLow level of vitamin K\nMedicines such as heparin\nPresence of antibodies called lupus anticoagulant but this is associated with a clotting problem rather than bleeding\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other."}

Their risk of bleeding is slightly higher than it is for people without bleeding problems.\nAlternative Names\nAPTT; PTT; Activated partial thromboplastin time\nPatient Instructions\nDeep vein thrombosis - discharge\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nLee GM, Ortel TL.
