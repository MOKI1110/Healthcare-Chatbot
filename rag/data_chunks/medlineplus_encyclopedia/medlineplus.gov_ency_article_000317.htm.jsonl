Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nToxic nodular goiter\nToxic nodular goiter\nToxic nodular goiter involves an enlarged thyroid gland. The gland contains areas that have increased in size and formed nodules. One or more of these nodules produce too much thyroid hormone.\nCauses\nToxic nodular goiter starts from an existing\nsimple goiter\n. It occurs most often in older adults. Risk factors include being female and over 55 years old. This disorder is rare in children. Most people who develop it have had a goiter with nodules for many years. Sometimes the thyroid gland is only slightly enlarged, and the goiter was not already diagnosed.\nSometimes, people with toxic multinodular goiter will develop high thyroid hormone levels for the first time after:\nTaking iodine through a vein (\nintravenously\n) or by mouth."}

The iodine may be used as contrast for a\nCT scan\nor\nheart catheterization\n(most common)\nTaking medicines that contain iodine, such as amiodarone\nMoving from a country with iodine deficiency to a country with a lot of iodine in the diet\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nFatigue\nFrequent bowel movements\nHeat intolerance\nIncreased appetite\nIncreased sweating\nIrregular menstrual period (in women)\nMuscle cramps\nNervousness\nRestlessness\nWeight loss\nOlder adults may have symptoms that are less specific. These may include:\nWeakness and fatigue\nPalpitations\nand chest pain or pressure\nChanges in memory and mood\nToxic nodular goiter does not cause the bulging eyes that can occur with\nGraves disease\n. Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder that leads to an overactive thyroid gland (\nhyperthyroidism\n).\nExams and Tests\nphysical exam\nmay show one or many nodules in the thyroid. The thyroid is often enlarged."}

These may be used to control the overactive thyroid gland in any of the following cases:\nBefore surgery or radioiodine therapy occurs\nAs a long term treatment\nRadioiodine therapy may be used. Radioactive iodine is given by mouth. It concentrates in the overactive thyroid tissue and causes damage."}

So, other\nchronic\nhealth problems may affect the outcome of this condition. An older adult may be less able to tolerate the effect of the disease on the heart. However, the condition is often treatable with medicines.\nPossible Complications\nHeart complications:\nHeart failure\nIrregular heartbeat (\natrial fibrillation\n)\nRapid heart rate\nOther complications:\nBone loss leading to\nosteoporosis\nThyroid crisis or storm is a sudden worsening of hyperthyroidism symptoms.

This is due to pressure on the airway passage (trachea) or esophagus, which lies behind the thyroid.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have symptoms of this disorder listed above. Follow your provider's instructions for follow-up visits.\nPrevention\nTo prevent toxic nodular goiter, treat hyperthyroidism and simple goiter as your provider suggests.\nAlternative Names\nToxic multinodular goiter; Plummer disease; Thyrotoxicosis - nodular goiter; Overactive thyroid - toxic nodular goiter; Hyperthyroidism - toxic nodular goiter; Toxic multinodular goiter; MNG\nImages\nThyroid enlargement - scintiscan\nThyroid gland\nReferences\nFiletti S, Tuttle RM, Leboulleux S, Alexander EK."}
