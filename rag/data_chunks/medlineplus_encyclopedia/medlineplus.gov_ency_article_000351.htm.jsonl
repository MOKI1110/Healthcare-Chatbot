Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension\nIdiopathic intracranial hypertension  (IIH) is a condition in which the pressure inside the skull is increased. The brain is affected in a way that the condition appears to be, but is not, a tumor.\nCauses\nThe condition occurs more often in women than men, especially in young obese women 20 to 40 years old. It is rare in infants, but can occur in children. Before puberty, it occurs equally in boys and girls.\nThe cause is unknown.\nCertain medicines can increase the risk of developing this condition."}

The main goal of treatments is to preserve vision and reduce the severity of headaches.\nlumbar puncture\n(spinal tap) can help relieve pressure in the brain and prevent vision problems.  Repeat lumbar punctures are helpful for pregnant women in order to delay surgery until after delivery.\nOther treatments may include:\nFluid or salt restriction\nMedicines such as corticosteroids, acetazolamide, furosemide, and topiramate\nShunting procedures to relieve pressure from spinal fluid buildup\nSurgery to relieve pressure on the optic nerve\nWeight loss\nTreatment of the underlying disease, such as vitamin A overdose\nPeople will need to have their vision closely monitored. There can be vision loss, which is sometimes permanent.
