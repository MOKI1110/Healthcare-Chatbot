Involuntary means you shake without trying to do so and are not able to stop the shaking at will.\nCauses\nET is the most common type of tremor. Everyone has some tremor at times, but the movements are usually so small that they can't be seen. ET affects both men and women. It is most common in people older than 65 years.\nThe exact cause of ET is unknown. Research suggests that the part of the brain that controls muscle movements does not work correctly in people with ET.\nIf an ET occurs in more than one member of a family, it is called a familial tremor. This type of ET is passed down through families (inherited). This suggests that genes play a role in its cause.\nFamilial tremor is usually a dominant trait. This means that you only need to get the gene from one parent to develop the tremor."}

It often starts in early middle age, but may be seen in people who are older or younger, or even in children.\nSymptoms\nThe tremor is more likely to be noticed in the forearm and hands. The arms, head, eyelids, or other muscles may also be affected. The tremor rarely occurs in the legs or feet. A person with ET may have trouble holding or using small objects such as silverware or a pen.\nThe shaking most often involves small, rapid movements occurring 4 to 12 times a second.\nSpecific symptoms may include:\nHead nodding\nA shaking or quivering sound to the voice if the tremor affects the voice box\nProblems with writing, drawing, drinking from a cup, or using tools if the tremor affects the hands\nThe tremors may:\nOccur during movement (action-related tremor) and may be less noticeable with rest\nCome and go, but often get worse with age\nWorsen with stress, caffeine, lack of sleep, and certain medicines\nNot affect both sides of the body the same way\nImprove slightly by drinking a small amount"}

For tremors of any cause, avoid caffeine and get enough sleep.\nFor tremors caused or made worse by a medicine, talk to your provider about stopping the medicine, reducing the dosage, or switching."}

This may include:\nFocusing high-powered x-rays on a small area of the brain (\nstereotactic radiosurgery\n)\nImplanting a stimulating device in the brain to signal the area that controls movement (deep brain stimulation)\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAn ET is not a dangerous problem.
