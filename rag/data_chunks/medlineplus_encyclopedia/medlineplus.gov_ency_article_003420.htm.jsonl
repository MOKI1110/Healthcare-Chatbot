Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nThoracentesis\nThoracentesis\nThoracentesis is a procedure to remove fluid from the space between the lining of the outside of the lungs (pleura) and the wall of the chest.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is done in the following way:\nYou sit on a bed or on the edge of a chair or bed. Your head and arms rest on a table.\nThe skin around the procedure site is cleaned. A local numbing medicine (anesthetic) is injected into the skin.\nA needle is placed through the skin and muscles of the chest wall into the space around the lungs, called the pleural space."}

Your health care provider will likely use\nultrasound\nto find the best spot to insert the needle.\nYou may be asked to hold your breath or breathe out during the procedure.\nYou should not cough, breathe deeply, or move during the test to avoid injury to the lung.\nFluid is drawn out with the needle or a temporary catheter is placed to allow the fluid to be removed.\nThe needle or catheter is removed and the area is bandaged.\nA chest x-ray or ultrasound is usually done after the thoracentesis to check for injury to the lung.\nThe fluid may be sent to a laboratory for testing (\npleural fluid analysis\n).\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed before the test. A\nchest x-ray\nor ultrasound will be done before and after the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will feel a stinging sensation when the local anesthetic is injected."}

You may feel pain or pressure when the needle is inserted into the pleural space.\nTell your provider if you feel\nshort of breath\nor have\nchest pain\n, during or after the procedure.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nNormally, very little fluid is in the pleural space. A buildup of too much fluid between the layers of the pleura is called a\npleural effusion\n.\nThe test is performed to determine the cause of the extra fluid and to relieve symptoms from the fluid buildup.\nNormal Results\nNormally the pleural cavity contains only a very small amount of fluid.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nTesting the fluid will help your provider determine the cause of pleural effusion."}
