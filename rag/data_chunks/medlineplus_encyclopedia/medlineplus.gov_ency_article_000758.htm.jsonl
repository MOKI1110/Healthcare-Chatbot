Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMultiple system atrophy - cerebellar subtype\nMultiple system atrophy - cerebellar subtype\nMultiple system atrophy - cerebellar subtype (MSA-C) is a rare disease that causes areas deep in the brain, just above the spinal cord, to shrink (atrophy). MSA-C used to be known as olivopontocerebellar atrophy (OPCA).\nCauses\nMSA-C can be passed down through families (inherited form). It can also affect people without a known family history (sporadic form).\nResearchers have identified certain genes that are involved in the inherited form of this condition.\nThe cause of MSA-C in people with the sporadic form is not known. The disease slowly gets worse (is progressive).\nMSA-C is slightly more common in men than in women. The average age of onset is 54 years.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of MSA-C tend to start at a younger age in people with the inherited form. The main symptom is clumsiness (\nataxia\n) that slowly gets worse."}

But, no specific test is available in many cases. An\nMRI of the brain\nmay show changes in the size of affected brain structures, especially as the disease gets worse."}

But it is possible to have the disorder and have a normal MRI.\nOther tests such as\npositron emission tomography (PET)\nmay be done to rule out other conditions. These may include swallowing studies to see if a person can safely swallow food and liquid.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment or cure for MSA-C. The aim is to treat the symptoms and prevent complications. This may include:\nTremor medicines, such as those for\nParkinson disease\nSpeech, occupational and physical therapy\nWays to prevent choking\nWalking aids to help with balance and prevent falls\nDevices to treat sleep apnea (such as CPAP)\nTreatment for low blood pressure\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with MSA-C and their families can be found at:\nDefeat MSA Alliance --\ndefeatmsa.org/patient-programs/\nMission MSA --\nmissionmsa.org/resource-library/\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMSA-C slowly gets worse, and there is no cure.

You will need to be seen by a neurologist.
