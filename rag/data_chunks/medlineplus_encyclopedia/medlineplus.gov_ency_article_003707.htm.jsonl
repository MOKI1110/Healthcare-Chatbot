Both men and women produce this hormone.\nThe test described in this article measures the total amount of testosterone in the blood. Much of the testosterone in the blood is bound to a protein called sex hormone binding globulin (SHBG). Another blood test can measure the \"free\" testosterone. However, this type of test is often not very accurate.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis taken from a vein. The best time for the blood sample to be taken is between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m. A second sample is often needed to confirm a result that is lower than expected.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThe health care provider may advise you to stop taking medicines that may affect the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel a slight prick or sting when the needle is inserted."}

There may be some throbbing afterward.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test may be done if you have symptoms of abnormal male hormone (androgen) production.\nIn males, the testicles produce most of the testosterone in the body. Levels are most often checked to evaluate signs of abnormal testosterone such as:\nEarly or late puberty (in boys)\nInfertility,\nerectile dysfunction\n, low level of sexual interest, or\nthinning of the bones\n(in men)\nIn females, the ovaries produce most of the testosterone. The adrenal glands can also produce too much of other androgens that are converted to testosterone."}

Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nCertain health conditions, medicines, or injury can lead to\nlow testosterone\n. The testosterone level also naturally drops with age."}
