High levels of hemoglobin derivatives prevent adequate transport of oxygen and carbon dioxide and cause illness.\nThis article discusses the test used to detect and measure the amount of hemoglobin derivatives in your blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is done using a small needle to collect a sample of blood from a vein or an artery. The sample may be collected from a vein or artery in the wrist, groin, or arm.\nBefore blood is drawn, your health care provider may test circulation to the hand (if the wrist is the site). After the blood is drawn, pressure applied to the puncture site for a few minutes stops the bleeding.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed.\nFor children, it may help to explain how the test will feel and why it is done."}

This may make the child feel less nervous.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nCarboxyhemoglobin is a hemoglobin derivative to which carbon monoxide has attached. High amounts of carboxyhemoglobin (\"carbon monoxide poisoning\") prevent the normal movement of oxygen and carbon dioxide by the blood. Carbon monoxide is released in the exhaust from cars, trucks, small engines, stoves, lanterns, grills, fireplaces, gas ranges, and furnaces. In closed spaces such as homes or garages that are not adequately ventilated, carbon monoxide can build up to dangerous levels.\nSulfhemoglobin and methemoglobin are rare hemoglobin derivatives to which oxygen cannot attach."}

They may occur when you take certain medicines such as dapsone, metoclopramide, nitrates, or sulfonamides.\nNormal Results\nSome levels of hemoglobin derivatives may be normal:\nCarboxyhemoglobin -- less than 1.5% (but may be as high as 9% in smokers)\nMethemoglobin -- less than 2%\nSulfhemoglobin -- undetectable\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nHigh levels of hemoglobin derivatives can lead to major health problems.\nCarboxyhemoglobin:\n10% to 20% -- symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning begin to appear\n30% -- symptoms of carbon monoxide poisoning may be severe\n50% to 80% -- potentially deadly\nMethemoglobin:\n10% to 25% --\nbluish skin color\n(cyanosis)\n35% to 40% -- shortness of breath and headache\nOver 60% --\nlethargy\nand\nstupor\nOver 70% -- potentially deadly\nSulfhemoglobin:\nValues of greater than 10 grams per deciliter (g/dL) or 6.2 millimoles per liter (mmol/L"}
