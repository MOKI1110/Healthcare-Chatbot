But it may continue into the adult years. ADHD is diagnosed more often in boys than in girls.\nIt is not clear what causes ADHD. It may be linked to genes and home or social factors. Experts have found that the brains of children with ADHD are different from those of children without ADHD. Brain chemicals are also different.\nSymptoms\nADHD symptoms fall into three groups:\nNot being able to focus (inattentiveness)\nBeing extremely active (\nhyperactivity\n)\nNot being able to control behavior (impulsivity)\nSome people with ADHD have mainly inattentive symptoms. Some have mainly hyperactive and impulsive symptoms."}

For these problems to be diagnosed as ADHD, they must be out of the normal range for a person's age and development.\nExams and Tests\nThere is no test that can diagnose ADHD. Diagnosis is based on a pattern of the symptoms listed above. When a child is suspected to have ADHD, parents and teachers are often involved during the evaluation.\nMost children with ADHD have at least one other developmental or mental health issue. This may be a mood, anxiety, or substance use disorder. Or, it may be a learning issue or a tic disorder.\nTreatment\nTreating ADHD is a partnership between your health care provider and the person with ADHD.

Different ADHD medicines can be used alone or combined with each other. Your provider will decide which medicine is right, based on your child's symptoms and needs.\nPsychostimulants (also known as stimulants) are the most commonly used medicines. Although these medicines are called stimulants, they actually have a calming effect on people with ADHD. Other medicines that are not stimulants are FDA approved for some people with ADHD."}

Your provider needs to monitor if the medicine is working and if there are any problems with it. So, be sure to keep all appointments with your provider.\nSome ADHD medicines have side effects. If you or your child has side effects, contact your provider right away. The dosage or medicine itself may need to be changed.\nTHERAPY\nA common type of ADHD therapy is called behavioral therapy. It teaches children and parents healthy behaviors and how to manage disruptive behaviors.
