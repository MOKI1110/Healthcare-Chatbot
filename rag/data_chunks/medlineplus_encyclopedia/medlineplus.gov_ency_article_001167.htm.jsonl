Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPituitary apoplexy\nPituitary apoplexy\nPituitary apoplexy is a rare, but serious condition of the pituitary gland.\nCauses\nThe pituitary is a small gland at the base of the brain. The pituitary produces many of the hormones that control essential body processes.\nPituitary apoplexy can be caused by bleeding into the pituitary or by blocked blood flow to the pituitary. Apoplexy means bleeding into an organ or loss of blood flow to an organ.\nPituitary apoplexy is commonly caused by bleeding inside a noncancerous (\nbenign\n) tumor of the pituitary. These tumors are very common and are often not diagnosed. The pituitary is damaged when the tumor suddenly enlarges. It either bleeds into the pituitary or blocks blood supply to the pituitary. The larger the tumor, the higher the risk for future pituitary apoplexy.\nWhen pituitary bleeding occurs in a woman during or right after childbirth, it is called\nSheehan syndrome\n."}

This is a very rare condition.\nRisk factors for pituitary apoplexy in non-pregnant women without a tumor include:\nBleeding disorders\nDiabetes\nHead injury\nRadiation to the pituitary gland\nUse of a breathing machine\nPituitary apoplexy in these situations is very rare.\nSymptoms\nPituitary apoplexy usually has a short period of symptoms (acute), which can be life threatening. Symptoms often include:\nSevere headache (worst of your life)\nParalysis of the eye muscles, causing double vision (\nophthalmoplegia\n) or problems opening an eyelid\nLoss of peripheral vision or loss of all vision in one or both eyes\nLow blood pressure, nausea, loss of appetite, and vomiting from\nacute adrenal insufficiency\nPersonality changes due to sudden narrowing or spasm of one of the arteries in the brain (anterior cerebral artery)\nLess commonly, pituitary dysfunction may appear more slowly."}

In Sheehan syndrome, for example, the first symptom may be a failure to produce milk caused by a lack of the hormone prolactin after delivery.\nOver time, problems with other pituitary hormones may develop, causing symptoms of the following conditions:\nGrowth hormone deficiency\nAdrenal insufficiency (if not already present or treated)\nHypogonadism\n(body's sex glands produce little or no hormones)\nHypothyroidism\n(thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone)\nIn rare cases, when the posterior (back part) of the pituitary is involved, symptoms may include:\nFailure of the uterus to contract to give birth to a baby (in women)\nFailure to produce breast milk (in women)\nFrequent urination and severe thirst (\ndiabetes insipidus\n)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.\nTests that may be ordered include:\nEye exams\nMRI\nor\nCT scan\nBlood tests will be done to check levels of:\nACTH\n(adrenocorticotropic hormone)\nCortisol\nFSH\n(follicle-s"}

Severe cases need emergency surgery. If vision is not affected, surgery is often not necessary.\nImmediate treatment with adrenal replacement hormones (glucocorticoids) may be needed. These hormones are often given through the vein (by IV). Other hormones may eventually be replaced, including:\nGrowth hormone\nSex hormones (estrogen/testosterone)\nThyroid hormone\nVasopressin (ADH)\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAcute pituitary apoplexy can be life threatening."}
