This occurs as a result of bleeding into the glands.\nCauses\nThe\nadrenal glands\nare two triangle-shaped glands. One gland is located on top of each kidney. The adrenal glands produce and release different hormones that the body needs to function normally. The adrenal glands can be affected by many diseases, such as infections like WFS.\nWFS is caused by severe infection with meningococcus bacteria or other bacteria such as:\nGroup B streptococcus\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\nStaphylococcus aureus\nSymptoms\nSymptoms occur suddenly. They are due to the bacteria growing in large numbers inside the body."}

They are due to the bacteria growing in large numbers inside the body. Symptoms include:\nFever and chills\nJoint and muscle pain\nHeadache\nVomiting\nThe infection with bacteria causes bleeding throughout the body, which causes:\nA rash throughout the body\nDisseminated intravascular coagulation\nin which small blood clots cut off blood supply to the organs\nSeptic shock\nBleeding into the adrenal glands makes the glands unable to produce enough adrenal hormones. This is called adrenal crisis, and it leads to symptoms such as:\nDizziness, weakness\nVery low blood pressure\nVery fast heart rate\nConfusion or coma\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.\nBlood tests will be done to confirm a bacterial infection."}
