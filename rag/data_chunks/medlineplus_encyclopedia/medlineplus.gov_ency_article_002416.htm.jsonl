Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nZinc in diet\nZinc in diet\nZinc is an important trace element that people need to stay healthy. Of the trace elements, this element is second only to\niron\nin its concentration in the body.\nFunction\nZinc is found in cells throughout the body. It is needed for the body's defensive (immune) system to properly work. It plays a role in cell division, cell growth, wound healing, and the breakdown of\ncarbohydrates\n.\nZinc is also needed for the senses of smell and taste. During pregnancy, infancy, and childhood the body needs zinc to grow and develop properly. Zinc also enhances the action of insulin.\nInformation from an expert review on zinc supplements showed that:\nWhen taken for at least 5 months, zinc may reduce your risk of becoming sick with the common cold.\nStarting to take zinc supplements within 24 hours after cold symptoms begin may reduce how long the symptoms last and make the symptoms less severe."}

However, supplementation beyond the recommended dietary allowance (RDA and adequate intake (AI) see below) is not recommended at this time.\nFood Sources\nAnimal proteins are a good source of zinc. Beef, pork, and lamb contain more zinc than fish. The dark meat of a chicken has more zinc than the light meat.\nOther good sources of zinc are nuts, whole grains, legumes, and yeast.\nFruits and vegetables are not good sources, because the zinc in plant foods  is not as available for use by the body as the zinc from animal sources. Therefore, low-protein diets and vegetarian diets tend to be low in zinc.\nZinc is in most multivitamin and mineral supplements. These supplements may contain zinc gluconate, zinc sulfate, or zinc acetate."}

These supplements may contain zinc gluconate, zinc sulfate, or zinc acetate. It is not known whether one form is better than the others.\nZinc is also found in some over-the-counter medicines, such as cold lozenges, nasal sprays, and nasal gels.\nSide Effects\nSymptoms of zinc deficiency include:\nFrequent infections\nHypogonadism\nin males\nLoss of hair\nPoor appetite\nProblems with the sense of taste\nProblems with the sense of smell\nSkin sores\nSlow growth\nTrouble seeing in the dark\nWounds that take a long time to heal\nZinc supplements taken in large amounts may cause diarrhea, abdominal cramps, and vomiting. These symptoms most often appear within 3 to 10 hours of swallowing the supplements. The symptoms go away within a short period of time after stopping the supplements."}

A long-term excess intake of zinc can lead to copper, iron, or magnesium deficiency.\nPeople who use nasal sprays and gels that contain zinc may have side effects, such as losing their sense of smell.\nRecommendations\nREFERENCE INTAKES\nDosages for zinc, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) -- The average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people. An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence.\nAdequate Intake (AI) -- This level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA."}
