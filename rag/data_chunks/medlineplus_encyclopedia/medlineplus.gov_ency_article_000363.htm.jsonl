Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFamilial Mediterranean fever\nFamilial Mediterranean fever\nFamilial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is a rare disorder that may be passed down through families (inherited). It involves repeated fevers and inflammation that often affects the lining of the abdomen, chest, or joints.\nCauses\nFMF is most often caused by a variation in a gene named\nMEFV\n. This gene creates a protein involved in regulating inflammation. The disease usually appears only in people who received two copies of the variant gene, one from each parent. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance or an autosomal recessive condition.\nFMF most often affects people of Mediterranean ancestry. These include non-Ashkenazi (Sephardic) Jews, Armenians, and Arabs. People from other ethnic groups can also be affected.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms usually begin between ages 5 and 15. Inflammation in the lining of the abdominal cavity, chest cavity, skin, or joints occurs along with high fevers that usually peak in 12 to 24 hours. Attacks may vary in severity of symptoms."}

Inflammation in the lining of the abdominal cavity, chest cavity, skin, or joints occurs along with high fevers that usually peak in 12 to 24 hours. Attacks may vary in severity of symptoms. People are usually symptom-free between attacks.\nSymptoms may include repeated episodes of:\nAbdominal pain\nChest pain that is sharp and gets worse when taking a breath\nFever or alternating chills and fever\nJoint pain\nSkin sores (lesions) that are red and swollen and range from 5 to 20 centimeters (cm) in diameter\nExams and Tests\nIf genetic testing shows that you have two pathogenic variants and your symptoms match the typical pattern, the diagnosis is nearly certain. Lab tests and\nx-rays\nor other imaging tests are used to check for other possible diseases to help confirm the diagnosis.\nLevels of certain blood tests may be higher than normal when done during an attack. Tests may include:\nComplete blood count\n(CBC) that includes white blood cell count\nC-reactive protein\n(CRP) to check for inflammation\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate\n(ESR) to check for inflammation\nFibrinogen test\nto check blood clotting\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment for FMF is to regulate symptoms."}

Colchicine, a medicine that reduces inflammation, may help during an attack and may prevent further attacks. It can also help prevent a serious complication called systemic\namyloidosis\n, which is common in people with FMF.\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be used to treat fever and pain.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThere is no known cure for FMF. Most people continue to have attacks, but the number and severity of attacks is different from person to person.\nPossible Complications\nAmyloidosis may lead to kidney damage or not being able to absorb nutrients from food (malabsorption)."}
