Sneezing and coughing can put contaminated droplets into the air.\nIf one person has the measles, 90% of the people who come in contact with that person will get the measles, unless they have been vaccinated.\nPeople who had measles or who have been vaccinated against measles are protected from the disease. As of 2000, measles had been eliminated in the United States. However, unvaccinated people who travel to other countries where measles is common have brought the disease back to the United States. This has led to recent outbreaks of measles in groups of people who are unvaccinated.\nSome parents do not let their children get vaccinated. This is because of unfounded fears that the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella, can cause autism."}

This is because of unfounded fears that the MMR vaccine, which protects against measles, mumps, and rubella, can cause autism. Parents and caregivers should know that:\nLarge studies of thousands of children have found no connection between this or any vaccine and autism.\nReviews by all major health organizations in the United States, Great Britain, and elsewhere all found no link between the MMR vaccine and autism.\nThe study that had first reported a risk of autism from this vaccine has been proven to be fraudulent.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of measles usually begin 10 to 14 days after exposure to the virus. This is called the incubation period.\nRash is often the main symptom."}

People who are not immunized, or who have not received the full immunization, are at high risk of catching the disease if they are exposed.\nTaking serum immune globulin within 6 days after being exposed to the virus can reduce the risk of developing measles or make the disease less severe.\nIt is important to know that taking vitamin A will not prevent measles. In fact, taking too much vitamin A can cause serious illnesses, such as liver damage. Most people in the United States get plenty of vitamin A in their diet.\nAlternative Names\nRubeola\nImages\nMeasles, Koplik spots - close-up\nMeasles on the back\nAntibodies\nReferences\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention website.
