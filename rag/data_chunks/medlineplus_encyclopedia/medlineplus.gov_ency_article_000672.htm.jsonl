It is not common.\nRisks for this condition include:\nChemotherapy\nDiabetes\nWeakened immune system\nExternal otitis is often caused by bacteria that are hard to treat, such as pseudomonas. The infection spreads from the floor of the ear canal to the nearby tissues and into the bones at the base of the skull. The infection and swelling may damage or destroy the bones. The infection may affect the cranial nerves, brain, or other parts of the body if it continues to spread.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nOngoing\ndrainage from the ear\nthat is yellow or green and smells bad.\nEar pain\ndeep inside the ear."}

The head around and behind the ear may be tender to touch. A nervous system (neurological) exam may show that the cranial nerves are affected.\nIf there is any drainage, the provider may send a sample of it to the lab. The lab will culture the sample to try to find the cause of the infection.\nTo look for signs of a\nbone infection\nnext to the ear canal, the following tests may be done:\nCT scan of the head\nMRI scan of the head\nRadionuclide scan\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to cure the infection. Treatment often lasts for several months, because it is difficult to treat the bacteria and reach an infection in bone tissue.\nYou will need to take antibiotic medicines for a long period of time."}

Treatment often lasts for several months, because it is difficult to treat the bacteria and reach an infection in bone tissue.\nYou will need to take antibiotic medicines for a long period of time. The medicines may be given through a vein (intravenously), or by mouth. Antibiotics should be continued until scans or other tests show the inflammation has gone down.\nDead or infected tissue may need to be removed from the ear canal, using a procedure called debridement. In some cases, surgery may be needed to remove dead or damaged tissue in the skull.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMalignant otitis externa most often responds to long-term treatment, especially if treated early. It may return in the future."}
