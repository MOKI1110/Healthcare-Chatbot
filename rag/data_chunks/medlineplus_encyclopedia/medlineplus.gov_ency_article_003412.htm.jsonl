The pressure causes veins below the area to fill with blood.\nThe arm is cleaned with a germ killer (antiseptic). A needle is placed into your vein, usually near the inside of the elbow or back of the hand. A thin tube, called a catheter, is placed into the vein. (This may be called an IV, which means intravenous). While the tube stays in place, the needle and tourniquet are removed.\nA dark green powder called methylene blue goes through the tube into your vein. The provider looks at how the powder turns a substance in the blood called methemoglobin into normal\nhemoglobin\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is required for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThere are several types of oxygen-carrying proteins in the blood. One of them is methemoglobin. Normal methemoglobin levels in blood are usually 1%. If the level is higher, you can become sick because the protein is not carrying oxygen. This can make your blood look brown instead of red.\nMethemoglobinemia has several causes, many of which are genetic (problem with your genes). This test is used to tell the difference between methemoglobinemia caused by the lack of a protein called\ncytochrome b5 reductase\nand other types that are passed down through families (inherited). Your provider will use the results of this test to help determine your treatment.\nNormal Results\nNormally, methylene blue quickly lowers the level of methemoglobin in the blood.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nYou may have a rare form of methemoglobinemia if this test does not significantly lower the blood level of methemoglobin.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Inserting an IV may be more difficult for you or your child than for other people.\nOther risks associated with this type of blood test are minor, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin causing bruising)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken, but the chances of infection increase the longer the IV remains in the vein)\nAlternative Names\nMethemoglobinemia - methylene blue test\nReferences\nBenz EJ Jr, Ebert BL."}
