When you breathe, air goes through your nose, down your windpipe (trachea), and into the lungs, where it flows through tubes called bronchi. Most lung cancer begins in the cells that line these tubes.\nThere are two main types of lung cancer:\nNon-small cell lung cancer\n(NSCLC) is the most common type of lung cancer.\nSmall cell lung cancer\n(SCLC) makes up about 20% of all lung cancer cases.\nIf the cancer started somewhere else in the body and spreads to the lungs, it is called\nmetastatic cancer to the lung\n.\nCauses\nLung cancer is the deadliest type of cancer for both men and women. Each year, more people die of lung cancer than of breast, colon, and prostate cancers combined.\nLung cancer is more common in older adults. It is rare in people under age 45.\nSmoking\ncauses most cases (around 90%) of lung cancer. The risk depends on the number of cigarettes you smoke each day and for how long you have smoked."}

It is rare in people under age 45.\nSmoking\ncauses most cases (around 90%) of lung cancer. The risk depends on the number of cigarettes you smoke each day and for how long you have smoked. Being around the smoke from other people (secondhand smoke) also raises your risk of lung cancer. The risk decreases with time after you stop smoking. But some people who have never smoked do develop lung cancer. There is no evidence that smoking low-tar cigarettes lowers the risk.\nResearch shows that smoking marijuana may help cancer cells grow. But there is no direct link between smoking marijuana and developing lung cancer.\nConstant exposure to high levels of air pollution and drinking water that has a high level of arsenic can increase your risk of lung cancer. A history of radiation therapy to the lungs can also increase risk.\nWorking with or living near cancer-causing chemicals or materials can also increase the risk of developing lung cancer."}

You will be asked if you smoke. If so, you'll be asked how much you smoke and for how long you have smoked. You will also be asked about other things that may have put you at risk for lung cancer, such as exposure to certain chemicals.\nWhen listening to your chest with a stethoscope, your provider may hear fluid around your lungs. This may suggest cancer.\nTests that may be done to diagnose lung cancer or to see if it has spread include:\nBone scan\nChest x-ray\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nComprehensive metabolic panel\nCT scan of the chest\nand abdomen\nMRI of the chest\nPositron emission tomography\n(PET) scan\nSputum test to look for cancer cells\nThoracentesis\n(sampling of fluid buildup around the lung)\nIn most cases, a piece of tissue is removed from your lungs for examination under a microscope.
