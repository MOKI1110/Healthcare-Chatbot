It is the leading cause of death from skin disease.\nOther common types of skin cancer are\nsquamous cell carcinoma\nand\nbasal cell carcinoma\n.\nCauses\nMelanoma is caused by changes (mutations) in skin cells called melanocytes. These cells make a skin color pigment called melanin. Melanin is responsible for skin and hair color.\nMelanoma can appear on normal skin. Sometimes it can develop from moles. Moles that are present at birth may develop into melanomas. Larger moles that are present at birth may be at higher risk for developing melanoma.\nThere are four major types of melanoma:\nSuperficial spreading melanoma\nis the most common type. It is usually flat and irregular in shape and color, with different shades of black and brown. It is most common in fair skin people.\nNodular melanoma\nusually starts as a raised area that is dark blackish-blue or bluish-red. Some do not have any color (amelanotic melanoma).\nLentigo maligna melanoma\nusually occurs in older people."}

Some do not have any color (amelanotic melanoma).\nLentigo maligna melanoma\nusually occurs in older people. It is most common in sun-damaged skin on the face, neck, and arms. The abnormal skin areas are usually large, flat, and tan with areas of brown.\nAcral lentiginous melanoma\nis the least common form. It usually occurs on the palms, soles, or under the nails.\nThe risk for developing melanoma increases with age. However, more and more young people are developing it.\nYou are more likely to develop melanoma if you:\nHave fair skin, blue or green eyes, or red or blond hair\nLive in sunny climates or at high altitudes\nSpent a lot of time in high levels of strong sunlight because of a job or other activities\nHave had one or more blistering sunburns during childhood\nUse tanning devices, such as tanning beds\nOther risk factors include:\nHaving close relatives with melanoma\nCertain types of moles (atypical or dysplastic) or many birthmarks\nWeakened immune system due to disease or medicines\nSymptoms\nA mole, sore, lump, or growth on the skin can be a sign of melanoma or other skin cancer."}

A sore or growth that bleeds, or changes in color can also be a sign of skin cancer.\nThe\nABCDE\nsystem can help you remember possible symptoms of melanoma:\nsymmetry: One half of the abnormal area is different from the other half.\nB\norders: The edges of the growth are irregular.\nC\nolor: Color changes from one area to another, with shades of tan, brown, or black, and sometimes white, red, or blue. A mixture of colors may appear within one sore.\nD\niameter: The spot is usually (but not always) larger than 5 mm in diameter -- about the size of a pencil eraser.\nE\nvolution: The mole keeps changing appearance.\nAnother way to look for possible melanoma is the \"ugly duckling sign.\" This means the melanoma does not look like any of the other spots on the body."}

This is called a\nskin biopsy\n. The sample is sent to a lab for examination under a microscope.\nsentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy\nmay be done in some people with melanoma to see if the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes.\nOnce melanoma has been diagnosed,\nCT scans\nor other types of x-rays may be done to see if the cancer has spread.\nTreatment\nSurgery is almost always needed to treat melanoma. The skin cancer and some surrounding area will be removed. How much skin is removed depends on how deep the melanoma has grown.\nIf the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, these lymph nodes may also be removed."}

How much skin is removed depends on how deep the melanoma has grown.\nIf the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes, these lymph nodes may also be removed. After surgery, depending on the risk of the disease returning, you may receive chemotherapy or immunotherapy.\nTreatment is more difficult when the melanoma has spread to other organs. Treatment involves shrinking the skin cancer and treating the cancer in other areas of the body. You may receive:\nChemotherapy\n: Medicines are used to kill cancer cells directly.\nImmunotherapy: These include medicines such as interferon to help your immune system fight the cancer, or other medicines that boost your immune system's ability to find cancer cells and kill them. They may be used along with chemotherapy and surgery.\nRadiation treatments\n: These may be used to kill cancer cells.\nSurgery: Surgery may be done to remove cancer that has spread to other parts of the body."}

If it is deeper than 4 mm or has spread to the lymph nodes, the cancer is more likely to have spread to other tissues and organs.\nIf you have had melanoma and recovered, it is very important to examine your body regularly for any unusual changes.

Use the ABCDE system and the \"ugly duckling\" sign when checking your skin.\nThe best way to prevent skin cancer is to reduce your exposure to sunlight. Ultraviolet light is most intense between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Try to avoid sun exposure during these hours. Protect your skin by wearing a hat, long-sleeved shirt, long skirt, or pants when you have to be outside. The following tips can also help:\nApply high-quality sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) rating of 30 or higher, even when you are only going outdoors for a short time.\nApply a large amount of sunscreen on all exposed areas, including ears and feet.\nLook for sunscreens that block both UVA and UVB light. These will have the label \"broad spectrum.\"\nUse a waterproof formula if exposed to water.\nApply sunscreen at least 30 minutes before going outside. Reapply it often, especially after swimming.\nUse sunscreen in winter, too."}

Protect yourself even on cloudy days.\nOther important facts to help you avoid too much sun exposure:\nAvoid surfaces that reflect more light, such as water, sand, concrete, and white-painted areas.\nBe extra careful at higher altitudes, where skin burns faster.\nAvoid sun lamps, tanning beds, and tanning salons.\nEven though melanoma can develop in some moles, dermatologists feel that there is no advantage to remove moles to prevent melanoma.\nAlternative Names\nSkin cancer - melanoma; Malignant melanoma; Lentigo maligna melanoma; Melanoma in situ; Superficial spreading melanoma; Nodular melanoma; Acral lentiginous melanoma\nImages\nMelanoma of the liver - MRI scan\nSkin cancer - malignant melanoma\nSkin cancer - raised multi-color melanoma\nSkin cancer, melanoma - flat, brown lesion\nSkin cancer, melanoma on the fingernail\nSkin cancer, close-up of lentigo maligna melanoma\nSkin cancer - melanoma superficial spreading\nMelanoma\nSkin cancer, melanoma - raised, dark lesion\nMalignant melanoma\nReference"}
