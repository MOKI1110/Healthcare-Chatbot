Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPeripheral artery disease - legs\nPeripheral artery disease - legs\nPeripheral artery disease (PAD) is a condition of the blood vessels that supply the legs and feet. It occurs due to narrowing of the arteries in the legs. This causes decreased blood flow, which can injure skin, muscles, nerves and other tissues.\nCauses\nPAD is commonly caused by\natherosclerosis\n. This problem occurs when fatty material (plaque) builds up on the walls of your arteries and makes them narrower. The walls of the arteries also become stiffer and cannot widen (dilate) to allow greater blood flow when needed.\nAs a result, the muscles of your legs cannot get enough blood and oxygen when they are working harder (such as during exercise or walking). If PAD becomes severe, there may not be enough blood and oxygen, even when the muscles are resting.\nPAD is a common disorder. It most often affects men over age 50, but women can have it as well."}

People are at higher risk if they have a history of:\nAbnormal blood cholesterol level\nDiabetes\nHeart disease (coronary artery disease)\nHigh blood pressure (\nhypertension\n)\nKidney disease involving hemodialysis\nSmoking\nStroke (\ncerebrovascular disease\n)\nSymptoms\nThe main symptoms of PAD are pain, achiness, fatigue, burning, or discomfort in the muscles of your feet, calves, or thighs. These symptoms most often appear during walking or exercise, and go away after several minutes of rest.\nAt first, these symptoms may appear only when you walk uphill, walk faster, or walk for longer distances.\nOver time, these symptoms occur more quickly and with less exercise.\nYour legs or feet may feel numb when you are at rest."}

Smoking narrows the arteries, decreases the blood's ability to carry oxygen, and increases the risk for forming clots (\nthrombi and emboli\n).\nBalance exercise with rest. Walk or do another activity to the point of pain and alternate it with rest periods. Over time, your circulation may improve as new, small blood vessels form. Always talk to the provider before starting an exercise program.\nTake care of your feet, especially if you also have diabetes. Wear shoes that fit properly.
