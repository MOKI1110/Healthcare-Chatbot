It creates small, painful tears in the tendons in your elbow.\nThis injury can be caused by tennis, other racquet sports, and activities such as turning a wrench, prolonged typing, or chopping with a knife. The outside (lateral) elbow tendons are most commonly injured. The inside (medial) and backside (posterior) tendons can also be affected, but usually with different activities. The condition can be worsened if the tendons are further injured by trauma to the tendons.\nThis article discusses surgery to repair tennis elbow.\nDescription\nSurgery to repair tennis elbow is often an outpatient surgery. This means you will not stay in the hospital overnight.\nYou will be given medicine (sedative) to help you relax and make you sleepy. Numbing medicine (anesthesia) is given in your arm."}

This means you will not stay in the hospital overnight.\nYou will be given medicine (sedative) to help you relax and make you sleepy. Numbing medicine (anesthesia) is given in your arm. This blocks pain during your surgery.\nYou may be awake or asleep with\ngeneral anesthesia\nduring the surgery.\nIf you have open surgery, your surgeon will make one cut (incision) over your injured tendon. The unhealthy part of the tendon is scraped away. The surgeon may repair the tendon using something called a suture anchor. Or, it may be stitched to other tendons. When the surgery is over, the cut is closed with stitches.\nSometimes, tennis elbow surgery is done using an arthroscope. This is a thin tube with a tiny camera and light on the end. Before surgery, you will get the same medicines as in open surgery to make you relax and to block pain.\nThe surgeon makes 1 or 2 small cuts, and inserts the scope. The scope is attached to a video monitor. This helps your surgeon see inside the elbow area."}
