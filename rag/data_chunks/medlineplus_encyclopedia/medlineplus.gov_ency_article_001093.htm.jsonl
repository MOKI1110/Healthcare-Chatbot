Alveoli allow oxygen to enter the blood. They are very thin to let oxygen move from the lungs to the blood vessels, and for carbon dioxide to be removed from the blood vessels to the lungs.\nDepending on the disease, alveoli may:\nCollapse\nFuse together\nDevelop thickened linings\nFill with fluid\nFill with blood\nFill with pus\nGet destroyed\nOnce this occurs oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange do not happen normally and lead to different disorders. It requires many alveoli to be destroyed before abnormalities in carbon dioxide and oxygen levels do occur.\nThese changes can be temporary or permanent, depending on the disease.\nImages\nLungs\nReferences\nAlbertine KH, Ramirez MI, Morty RE.
