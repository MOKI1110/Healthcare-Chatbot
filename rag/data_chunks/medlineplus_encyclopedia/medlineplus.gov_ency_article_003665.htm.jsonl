Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBlood smear\nBlood smear\nA blood smear is a blood test that gives information about the number and shape of blood cells. It is often done as part of or along with a complete blood count (CBC).\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nThe blood sample is sent to a lab. There, the lab technician looks at it under a microscope. Or, the blood may be examined by an automated machine.\nThe smear provides this information:\nThe number and kinds of white blood cells (\ndifferential\n, or percentage of each type of cell)\nThe number and kinds of abnormally shaped blood cells\nA rough estimate of white blood cell and platelet counts\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test may be done as part of a general health exam to help diagnose many illnesses."}

Or, your health care provider may recommend this test if you have signs of:\nAny known or suspected blood disorder\nCancer\nLeukemia\nA blood smear may also be done to monitor the side effects of chemotherapy or to help diagnose an infection, such as malaria.\nNormal Results\nRed blood cells (RBCs) normally are of similar size and color and  are a lighter color in the center. The blood smear is considered normal if there is:\nNormal appearance of cells\nNormal white blood cell differential\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results mean the size, shape, color, or coating of the RBCs is not normal.\nSome abnormalities may be graded on a 4-point scale:\n1+ means one quarter of cells are affected\n2+ means one half of cells are affected\n3+ means three quarters of cells are affected\n4+ means all of the cells are affected\nPresence of cells called target cells may be due to:\nAbnormal\nhemoglobin\n, the protein in RBCs that carries oxygen (hemoglobinopathies)\nDeficiency of an enzyme called lecithin cholesterol acyltransferase\nIron deficiency\nLiver disease\nSpleen removal (splenectomy)\nPresence of sphere-shaped cells may be due to:\nLow number of RBCs due to the body destroying them (\nimmune hemolytic anemia\n)\nLow number of RBCs due to some RBCs shaped like spheres (\nhereditary spherocytosis\n)\nIncreased breakdown of RBCs\nPresence of RBCs with an oval shape may be a sign of\nhereditary elliptocytosis\nor\nhereditary ov"}
