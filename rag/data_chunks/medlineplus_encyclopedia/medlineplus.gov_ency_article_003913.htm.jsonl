The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina. Abnormal changes in the cells on the surface of your cervix is called cervical dysplasia.\nColposcopy uses a light and a low-powered microscope to make the cervix appear much larger. This helps your health care provider find and then\nbiopsy\nabnormal areas in your cervix.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will lie on a table and place your feet in stirrups, to position your pelvis for exam. The provider will place an instrument (called a speculum) into your\nvagina\nto see the cervix clearly.\nThe cervix and vagina are gently cleaned with a vinegar or iodine solution. This removes the mucus that covers the surface and highlights abnormal areas.\nThe provider will place the colposcope at the opening of your vagina and examine the area. Photographs may be taken."}

This removes the mucus that covers the surface and highlights abnormal areas.\nThe provider will place the colposcope at the opening of your vagina and examine the area. Photographs may be taken. The colposcope does not touch you.\nIf any areas look abnormal, a small sample of the tissue will be removed using small biopsy tools. Several samples may be taken. Sometimes a tissue sample from inside the cervix is removed. This is called endocervical curettage (ECC).\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no special preparation. You may be more comfortable if you empty your bladder and bowel before the procedure.\nBefore the exam:\nDo not douche (this is never recommended).\nDo not place any products into the vagina.\nDo not have sex for 24 hours before the exam.\nTell your provider if you are pregnant or could be pregnant.\nThis test should not be done during a heavy period, unless it is abnormal. Keep your appointment if you are:\nAt the very end or beginning of your regular period\nHaving abnormal bleeding\nYou may be able to take ibuprofen or acetaminophen (Tylenol) before the colposcopy."}

It may be more uncomfortable than a regular\nPap test\n.\nSome women feel a slight sting from the cleansing solution.\nYou may feel a pinch or cramp each time a tissue sample is taken.\nYou may have some cramping or slight bleeding after the biopsy.\nDo not use tampons or put anything in your vagina for several days after a biopsy.\nSome women may hold their breath during pelvic procedures because they expect pain. Slow, regular breathing will help you relax and relieve pain. Ask your provider about bringing a support person with you if that will help.\nYou may have some bleeding after the biopsy, for about 2 days.\nYou should not douche, place tampons or creams into your vagina, or have sex for up to a week afterward."}

Ask your provider how long you should wait.\nYou can use sanitary pads.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nColposcopy is done to detect cervical cancer and changes that may lead to cervical cancer.\nIt is most often done when you have had an abnormal Pap smear or HPV test. It may also be recommended if you have bleeding after sexual intercourse.\nColposcopy may also be done when your provider sees abnormal areas on your cervix during a pelvic exam. These may include:\nAny abnormal growth on the cervix, or elsewhere in the vagina\nGenital warts\nor HPV\nIrritation or inflammation of the cervix (\ncervicitis\n)\nThe colposcopy may be used to keep track of HPV, and to look for abnormal changes that can come back after treatment.\nNormal Results\nA smooth, pink surface of the cervix is normal.\nA specialist called a pathologist will examine the tissue sample from the cervical biopsy and send a report to your provider. Biopsy results most often take 1 to 2 weeks."}
