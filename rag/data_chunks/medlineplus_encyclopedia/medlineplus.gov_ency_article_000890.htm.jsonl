It is considered to be a variant of preeclampsia. Sometimes the presence of HELLP syndrome is due to an underlying disease, such as\nantiphospholipid antibody syndrome\n.\nHELLP syndrome occurs in about 1 to 2 out of 1,000 pregnancies. In women with\npreeclampsia\nor\neclampsia\n, the condition develops in 10% to 20% of pregnancies.\nRisk factors for HELLP syndrome include:\nAge greater than 35\nObesity (metabolic syndrome)\nHistory of preeclampsia\nHistory of diabetes or renal disease\nHistory of multiple births\nHistory of high blood pressure\nMost often, HELLP develops during the third trimester of pregnancy (between 26 to 40 weeks gestation). Sometimes it develops in the week after the baby is born.\nMany women have high blood pressure and are diagnosed with preeclampsia before they develop HELLP syndrome."}

Tests include\nfetal non-stress test\nand\nultrasound\n, among others.\nTreatment\nThe main treatment is to deliver the baby as soon as possible, even if the baby is premature. Problems with the liver and other complications of HELLP syndrome can quickly get worse and be harmful to both the mother and child.\nYour provider may induce labor by giving you medicines to start labor, or may perform a\nC-section\n.\nYou may also receive:\nA blood transfusion if bleeding problems become severe\nCorticosteroid medicines to help the baby's lungs develop faster\nMedicines to treat high blood pressure\nMagnesium sulfate infusion to prevent seizures\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nOutcomes are most often good if the problem is diagnosed early. It is very important to have regular prenatal checkups. You should also let your provider know right away if you have symptoms of this condition.\nWhen the condition is not treated early, up to 1 of 4 women develop serious complications."}
