It stores bile, which your body uses to digest fats in the small intestine.\nDescription\nSurgery is done while you are under\ngeneral anesthesia\nso you will be asleep and pain-free. To perform the surgery:\nYour surgeon makes a 5 to 7 inch (12.5 to 17.5 centimeters) cut in the upper right part of your belly, just below your ribs.\nThe area is opened up so your surgeon can view the gallbladder and separate it from the other organs.\nYour surgeon cuts the bile duct and blood vessels that lead to the gallbladder.\nThe gallbladder is gently lifted out and removed from your body.\nAn x-ray called a\ncholangiogram\nmay be done during your surgery.\nTo do this test, dye is injected into your common bile duct and an x-ray is taken."}

The dye helps find stones that may be inside the common bile duct.\nIf other stones are found, your surgeon will remove them with a special instrument.\nThe surgery takes about 1 to 2 hours.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nYou may need this surgery if you have pain or other symptoms from gallstones. You may also need surgery if your gallbladder is not working normally.\nCommon symptoms may include:\nIndigestion\n, including bloating, heartburn, and gas\nNausea and vomiting\nPain after eating, usually in the upper right or upper middle area of your\nbelly\n(epigastric pain)\nThe most common way to remove the gallbladder is by using a medical instrument called a laparoscope (\nlaparoscopic cholecystectomy\n). Open gallbladder surgery is used when laparoscopic surgery cannot be done safely."}
