Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBulimia\nBulimia\nBulimia is an eating disorder in which a person has regular episodes of eating a very large amount of food (bingeing) during which the person feels a loss of control over their eating. The person then uses different ways, such as vomiting or laxatives (purging), to prevent weight gain.\nMany people with bulimia also have\nanorexia\n.\nCauses\nMany more women than men have bulimia.  The disorder is most common in teenage girls and young women. The person usually knows that their eating pattern is abnormal. They may feel fear or guilt with the binge-purge episodes.\nThe exact cause of bulimia is unknown. Genetic, psychological, family, society, or cultural factors may play a role. Bulimia is likely due to more than one factor.\nSymptoms\nWith bulimia, eating binges may occur as often as several times a day for many months. The person often eats large amounts of high-calorie foods, usually in secret. During these episodes, the person feels a lack of control over the eating.\nBinges lead to self-disgust, which causes purging to prevent weight gain."}

Purging may include:\nForcing oneself to vomit\nExcessive exercise\nUsing laxatives, enemas, or diuretics (water pills)\nPurging often brings a sense of relief.\nPeople with bulimia are often at a normal weight, but they may see themselves as being overweight. Because the person's weight is often normal, other people may not notice this eating disorder.\nSymptoms that other people can see include:\nSpending a lot of time exercising\nSuddenly eating large amounts of food or buying large amounts of food that disappear right away\nRegularly going to the bathroom right after meals\nThrowing away packages of laxatives, diet pills, emetics (medicines that cause vomiting), or diuretics\nExams and Tests\nA dental exam may show\ncavities\nor gum infections (such as\ngingivitis\n)."}

Treatment depends on how severe the bulimia is, and the person's response to treatments:\nSupport groups may be helpful for mild bulimia without other health problems.\nCounseling, such as talk therapy and nutritional therapy are the first treatments for bulimia that does not respond to support groups.\nMedicines that also treat depression, known as selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are often used for bulimia. Combining talk therapy with SSRIs may help, if talk therapy alone does not work.\nPeople may drop out of programs if they have unrealistic hopes of being cured by therapy alone. Before a program begins, people should know that:\nDifferent therapies will likely be needed to manage this disorder.\nIt is common for bulimia to return (relapse), and this is no cause for despair.\nThe process is painful, and the person and their family will need to work hard.\nSupport Groups\nThe stress of illness can be eased by joining a\nsupport group\n."}

Many people will still have some symptoms, even with treatment.\nPeople with fewer medical complications of bulimia and those willing and able to take part in therapy have a better chance of recovery.\nPossible Complications\nBulimia can be dangerous. It may lead to serious health problems over time. For example, vomiting over and over can cause:\nStomach acid in the esophagus (the tube that moves food from the mouth to the stomach)."}
