This bump is called the anterior tibial tubercle.\nCauses\nOsgood-Schlatter disease is thought to be caused by small injuries to the knee area from overuse before the knee is finished growing.\nThe quadriceps muscle is a large, strong muscle on the front part of the upper leg. When this muscle squeezes (contracts), it straightens the knee. The quadriceps muscle is an important muscle for running, jumping, and climbing.\nWhen the quadriceps muscle is used a lot in sports activities during a child's growth spurt, this area becomes irritated or swollen and causes pain.\nIt is common in adolescents who play soccer, basketball, and volleyball, and who participate in gymnastics. Osgood-Schlatter disease affects more boys than girls.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom is painful\nswelling\nover a bump on the lower leg bone (shinbone)."}

This is a bony bump below the knee. X-rays are rarely needed unless the provider wants to check for other causes of the pain.\nTreatment\nOsgood-Schlatter disease will almost always go away on its own once the child stops growing.\nTreatment includes:\nResting the knee and decreasing activity when symptoms develop\nPutting ice over the painful area 2 to 4 times a day, and after activities\nTaking ibuprofen or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or acetaminophen (Tylenol)\nIn many cases, the condition will get better using these methods.\nAdolescents may play sports if the activity does not cause too much pain. However, symptoms will get better faster if activity is limited. Sometimes, a child will need to take a break from most or all sports for 2 or more months.\nRarely, a cast or brace may be used to support the leg until it heals if symptoms do not go away. This most often takes 6 to 8 weeks."}

Crutches may be used for walking to keep weight off the painful leg.\nSurgery may be needed in rare cases.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost cases get better on their own after a few weeks or months. Most cases go away once the child finished growing.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your child has knee or leg pain, or if pain does not get better with treatment.\nPrevention\nThe small injuries that may cause this disorder often go unnoticed, so prevention may not be possible. Regular stretching, both before and after exercise and athletics, can help prevent injury.\nAlternative Names\nOsteochondrosis; Knee pain - Osgood-Schlatter\nImages\nLeg pain (Osgood-Schlatter)\nReferences\nCoyle AM, Lawrence JTR.
