Ticks attach to the skin to feed on blood. The poison enters the bloodstream during this feeding process.\nThe paralysis is ascending. That means it starts in the lower body and moves up.\nSymptoms\nChildren with tick paralysis develop an\nunsteady gait\nfollowed several days later by weakness in the lower legs. This\nweakness\ngradually moves up to involve the upper limbs.\nParalysis may cause\nbreathing difficulties\n, which may require the use of a breathing machine.\nThe child may also have mild, flu-like symptoms (muscle aches, tiredness).\nExams and Tests\nPeople can be exposed to ticks in many ways. For example, they may have gone on a camping trip, live in a tick-infested area, or have dogs or other animals that can pick up ticks."}

For example, they may have gone on a camping trip, live in a tick-infested area, or have dogs or other animals that can pick up ticks. Often, the tick is found only after thoroughly searching a person's hair.\nFinding a tick embedded in the skin and having the above symptoms confirms the diagnosis. No other testing is required.\nTreatment\nRemoving the tick removes the source of the poison. Recovery is rapid after the tick is removed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nFull recovery is expected following the removal of the tick.\nPossible Complications\nBreathing difficulties can cause\nrespiratory\nfailure. When this happens, the body's organs do not have enough oxygen to work well.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIf your child suddenly becomes unsteady or weak, have the child examined right away. Breathing difficulties require emergency care.\nPrevention\nUse insect repellents and protective clothing when in tick-infested areas. Tuck pant legs into socks. Carefully check the skin and hair after being outside and remove any ticks you find.\nIf you find a tick on your child, write the information down and keep it for several months."}
