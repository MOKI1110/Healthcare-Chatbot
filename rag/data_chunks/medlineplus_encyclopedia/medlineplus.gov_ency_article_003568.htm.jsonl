Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nDigoxin test\nDigoxin test\nA digoxin test checks how much digoxin you have in your blood. Digoxin is a type of medicine called a cardiac glycoside. It is used to treat certain heart problems, although much less often than in the past.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nAsk your health care provider whether you should take your usual medicines before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing where the needle was inserted.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe main purpose of this test is to determine the best dosage of digoxin and prevent side effects.\nIt is important to monitor the level of digitalis medicines such as digoxin. That is because the difference between a safe treatment level and a\nharmful level\nis small.\nNormal Results\nIn general, normal values range from 0.5 to 1.9 nanograms per milliliter of blood."}

That is because the difference between a safe treatment level and a\nharmful level\nis small.\nNormal Results\nIn general, normal values range from 0.5 to 1.9 nanograms per milliliter of blood. But the right level for some people may vary depending on the situation.\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may mean you are getting too little or too much digoxin.\nA very high value could mean that you have or are likely to develop a digoxin overdose (toxicity).\nRisks\nRisks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nHeart failure - digoxin test\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nAronson JK.
