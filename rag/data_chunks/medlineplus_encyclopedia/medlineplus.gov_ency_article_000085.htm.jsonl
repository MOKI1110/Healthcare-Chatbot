Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nObesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS)\nObesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS)\nObesity hypoventilation syndrome (OHS) causes poor breathing in some people with obesity. It leads to lower oxygen and higher carbon dioxide levels in the blood.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of OHS is not known. It is believed that OHS results from a defect in the brain's control over breathing. Excess weight against the chest wall also makes it harder for the muscles to draw in a deep breath and to breathe quickly enough. This worsens the brain's breathing control. As a result, the blood contains too much carbon dioxide and not enough oxygen.\nDuring stable conditions, people are not acidemic as the kidneys have enough time to correct the acidity caused by the high carbon dioxide.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptoms of OHS are due to lack of sleep and include:\nPoor sleep quality\nSleep apnea\nDaytime sleepiness\nDepression\nHeadaches\nTiredness\nSymptoms of low blood oxygen level (chronic hypoxia) and high carbon dioxide can occur."}

Symptoms include shortness of breath or feeling tired after little effort.\nExams and Tests\nPeople with OHS have obesity (body mass index of 30 kg/m\n2\nor greater). A physical exam may show:\nBluish color in the lips, fingers, toes, or skin (\ncyanosis\n)\nReddish skin\nSigns of right-sided heart failure (\ncor pulmonale\n), such as swollen legs or feet, shortness of breath, or feeling tired after little effort\nSigns of extreme sleepiness\nTests used to help diagnose OHS include:\nArterial blood gas\nChest x-ray\nor\nCT scan of the chest\nto rule out other possible causes\nLung function tests (\npulmonary function tests\n)\nSleep study (polysomnography)\nEchocardiogram\n(ultrasound of the heart)\nHealth care providers can tell OHS from obstructive sleep apnea because a person with OHS has a high carbon dioxide level in their blood when awake.\nTreatment\nTreatment involves breathing assistance using special machines (mechanical ventilation)."}
