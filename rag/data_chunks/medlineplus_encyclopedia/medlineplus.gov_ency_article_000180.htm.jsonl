In this condition, the valve does not close normally.\nCauses\nThe mitral valve helps blood on the left side of the heart flow in one direction. It closes to keep blood from moving backwards when the heart beats (contracts).\nMitral valve prolapse is the term used when the valve does not close properly. It can be caused by many different things.\nIn most cases, it is harmless. The problem generally does not affect health and most people with the condition are not aware of it. In a small number of cases, the prolapse can cause blood to leak backwards. This is called mitral regurgitation.\nMitral valve prolapse often affects thin women who may have minor chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or other disorders."}

This is called mitral regurgitation.\nMitral valve prolapse often affects thin women who may have minor chest wall deformities, scoliosis, or other disorders. Some forms of mitral valve prolapse seem to be passed down through families (inherited).\nMitral valve prolapse is also seen with some connective tissue disorders such as\nMarfan syndrome\nand other rare genetic disorders.\nIt is also sometimes seen in isolation in people who are otherwise normal.\nSymptoms\nMany people with mitral valve prolapse Do not have symptoms. A group of symptoms sometimes found in people with mitral valve prolapse has been called \"mitral valve prolapse syndrome,\" and includes:\nChest pain (not caused by coronary artery disease or a heart attack)\nDizziness\nFatigue\nPanic attacks\nSensation of feeling the heart beat (\npalpitations\n)\nShortness of breath with activity or when lying flat (orthopnea)\nThe exact relationship is between these symptoms and the valve problem is not clear."}

Some of the findings may be coincidental.\nWhen mitral regurgitation occurs, symptoms may be related to the leaking, particularly when severe.\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and use a stethoscope to listen to your heart and lungs. The provider may feel a thrill (vibration) over the heart and hear a\nheart murmur\nand an extra sound (midsystolic click). The murmur usually gets longer and louder when you stand up.\nBlood pressure is most often normal.\nEchocardiogram is the most common test used to diagnose mitral valve prolapse."}

However, antibiotics are now used much less often. Check with your provider to see if you need antibiotics.\nThere are many heart medicines that may be used to treat aspects of this condition. However, most people will not need any treatment. You may need surgery to repair or replace your mitral valve if it becomes very leaky (regurgitation), and if the leakiness also causes symptoms. However, this may not occur."}
