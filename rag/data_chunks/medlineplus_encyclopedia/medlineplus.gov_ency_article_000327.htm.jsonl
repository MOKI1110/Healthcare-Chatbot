It is also called iron overload.\nCauses\nHemochromatosis may be a genetic disorder passed down through families.\nPeople with this type absorb too much iron through their digestive tract. Iron builds up in the body. The liver, heart, and pancreas are common organs where iron builds up.\nIt is present at birth, but may not be diagnosed for years.\nHemochromatosis may also occur as a result of:\nToo many\nblood transfusions\nin a person with blood disorders such as\nthalassemia\nor certain\nanemias\n. Over time this may lead to iron overload.\nLong-term alcohol use and other health conditions.\nThis disorder affects more men than women."}

Over time this may lead to iron overload.\nLong-term alcohol use and other health conditions.\nThis disorder affects more men than women. It is most common in white people of northern European descent.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nAbdominal pain\nFatigue, lack of energy, weakness\nGeneralized darkening of skin color (often referred to as bronzing)\nJoint pain\nLoss of body hair\nLoss of sexual desire\nWeight loss\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may show liver and spleen swelling, and skin color changes.\nBlood tests may help make the diagnosis. Tests may include:\nFerritin level\nIron level\nPercentage of transferrin saturation (high)\nGenetic testing\nOther tests may include:\nBlood sugar (glucose) level\nAlpha fetoprotein\nEchocardiogram\nto examine the heart's function\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG) to look at the electrical activity of the heart\nImaging tests such as\nCT scans\n,\nMRI\n, and\nultrasound\nLiver function tests\nThe condition may be confirmed with a\nliver biopsy\nor genetic testing."}

If a genetic defect is confirmed, other blood tests can be used to find out if other family members are at risk for iron overload.\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to remove excess iron from the body and treat any organ damage.\nA procedure called phlebotomy is the best method for removing excess iron from the body:\nOne half liter of blood is removed from the body each week until the body's iron stores are depleted."}

This may take many months to do.\nAfter that, the procedure may be done less often to maintain normal iron stores.\nWhy the procedure is needed depends on your symptoms and levels of hemoglobin and serum ferritin and how much iron you take in your diet.\nFor people unable to undergo phlebotomy, medicines may be prescribed to reduce the body's iron.\nOther health problems such as diabetes, decreased testosterone levels in men, arthritis, liver failure, and heart failure will be treated.\nIf you are diagnosed with hemochromatosis, your provider may recommend a diet to reduce how much iron is absorbed through your digestive tract."}
