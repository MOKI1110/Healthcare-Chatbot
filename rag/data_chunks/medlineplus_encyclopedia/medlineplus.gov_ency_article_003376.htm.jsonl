Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nGrowth hormone suppression test\nGrowth hormone suppression test\nThe growth hormone suppression test determines whether growth hormone (GH) production can be suppressed by taking a specific amount of glucose (called a glucose load).\nHow the Test is Performed\nAt least three\nblood samples\nare taken.\nThe test is done in the following way:\nThe first blood sample is collected between 6 a.m. and 8 a.m. before you eat or drink anything.\nYou then drink a solution containing glucose (sugar). You may be told to drink slowly to avoid becoming nauseated. But you must drink the solution within 5 minutes to ensure the test result is accurate.\nThe next blood samples are usually collected for 1 to 2 hours after you finish drinking the glucose solution. Sometimes they are taken every 30 or 60 minutes.\nEach sample is sent to the laboratory right away."}

Sometimes they are taken every 30 or 60 minutes.\nEach sample is sent to the laboratory right away. The lab measures the glucose and GH levels in each sample.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nDo not eat anything and limit physical activity for 10 to 12 hours before the test.\nYou may also be told to stop taking medicines that can affect the test results. These medicines include glucocorticoids such as prednisone, hydrocortisone, or dexamethasone. Check with your health care provider before stopping any medicines.\nYou will be asked to relax for at least 90 minutes before the test. This is because exercise or increased activity can change GH levels.\nIf your child is to have this test done, it may be helpful to explain how the test will feel and even demonstrate on a doll. The more familiar your child is with what will happen and why, the less anxiety the child will feel.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test checks to see if a high level of GH can be suppressed by taking a glucose load. If it cannot, this may lead to\ngigantism\nin children and\nacromegaly\nin adults. It is not used as a routine screening test. This test is only done if you show signs of increased GH.\nNormal Results\nNormal test results show a GH level of less than 1 ng/mL. In children, GH level may be increased due to reactive\nhypoglycemia\n.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf the GH level is not changed and stays high during the suppression test, your provider will suspect gigantism or acromegaly. You may need to be retested to confirm the test results.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken."}
