Lacquer is dangerous to swallow. Breathing in the fumes for a long period is also harmful.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\nPoisonous Ingredient\nPoisoning from lacquers is due to hydrocarbons, which are substances that contain only hydrogen and carbon.\nWhere Found\nLacquers are products that are used as a clear finish for wooden surfaces, particularly floors."}

The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\nSwallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue death. This may result in infection, shock and death, even several months after substance was swallowed. Scar tissue in the affected areas can lead to long-term problems with breathing, swallowing, and digestion.\nProlonged exposure to lacquer fumes can cause serious, long-term problems in the lungs and brain.\nReferences\nKuschner WG, Blanc PD.
