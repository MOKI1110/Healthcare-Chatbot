This blocks blood flow to the affected regions and causes discoloration\nCauses\nWhen Raynaud phenomenon is a primary condition, meaning it occurs by itself and not in association with other diseases, it is referred to as Raynaud disease. It most often begins in women younger than age 30. Secondary Raynaud phenomenon is when the condition is linked to other conditions and can occur at any age.\nCommon causes of secondary Raynaud phenomenon are:\nDiseases of the arteries (such as\natherosclerosis\nand\nBuerger disease\n)\nDrugs that cause narrowing of arteries (such as amphetamines, certain types of beta-blockers, some cancer drugs, certain drugs used for migraine headaches)\nArthritis and autoimmune conditions (such as\nscleroderma\n,\nSjÃ¶gren syndrome\n,\nrheumatoid arthritis\n, and\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\n)\nCertain blood disorders, such as cold agglutinin disease or cryoglobulinemia\nRepeated injury or usage such as from h"}

Fingers are most commonly involved, but toes, ears, lips or the nose can also change color as well.\nWhen blood flow returns, the area becomes red and then later returns to normal color.\nThe attacks may last from minutes to hours.\nPeople with Raynaud disease have problems in the same fingers on both sides. Most people do not have much pain. The skin of the arms or legs may develop bluish blotches which goes away when the skin is warmed up.\nPeople with secondary Raynaud phenomenon are more likely to have pain or tingling in the fingers."}

Painful ulcers may form on the affected fingers if the attacks are severe.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can often discover the condition causing Raynaud phenomenon by asking you questions and doing a physical exam.\nTests that may be done to confirm the diagnosis include:\nExamination of the blood vessels in the fingertips using a special lens called nailfold capillary microscopy\nVascular ultrasound\nBlood tests to look for arthritic and autoimmune conditions that may cause Raynaud phenomenon\nTreatment\nTaking these steps may help control Raynaud phenomenon:\nKeep the body warm. Avoid exposure to cold in any form. Wear mittens or gloves outdoors and when handling ice or frozen food. Avoid getting chilled, which may happen after any active recreational sport.\nStop smoking. Smoking causes blood vessels to narrow even more.\nAvoid caffeine.\nAvoid taking medicines that cause blood vessels to tighten or spasm.\nWear comfortable, roomy shoes and wool socks."}

Smoking causes blood vessels to narrow even more.\nAvoid caffeine.\nAvoid taking medicines that cause blood vessels to tighten or spasm.\nWear comfortable, roomy shoes and wool socks. When outside, always wear shoes.\nYour provider may prescribe medicines to dilate the walls of the blood vessels. These include topical nitroglycerin cream that you rub on your skin, calcium channel blockers, sildenafil (Revatio), and tadalafil (Adcirca).\nLow dose aspirin is often used to prevent blood clots.\nFor severe disease (such as when gangrene begins in fingers or toes), intravenous medicines may be used. Surgery may also be done to cut nerves that cause spasm in the blood vessels. People are most often hospitalized when the condition is this serious.\nIt is vital to treat the condition causing Raynaud phenomenon.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome varies. It depends on  the cause of the problem and how bad it is.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nGangrene\nor\nskin ulcers\nmay occur if an artery becomes completely blocked."}

This problem is more likely in people who also have arthritis or autoimmune conditions.\nFingers may become thin and tapered with smooth shiny skin and nails that grow slowly. This is due to the poor blood flow to the areas.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nYou have a history of Raynaud phenomenon and the affected body part (hand, foot, or other part) becomes infected or develops a sore.\nYour fingers change color, especially white or blue, when they are cold and don't return to their usual color.\nYour fingers or toes turn black or the skin breaks down.\nYou have a sore on the skin of your feet or hands which does not heal.\nYou have a fever, swollen or painful joints, or skin rashes.\nAlternative Names\nRaynaud disease; Primary Raynaud; Secondary Raynaud\nImages\nRaynaud's phenomenon\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\nCirculatory system\nReferences\nCameron J.
