Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTroponin test\nTroponin test\nA troponin test measures the levels of troponin T or troponin I proteins in the blood. These proteins are released when the heart muscle has been damaged, such as occurs with a heart attack. The more damage there is to the heart, the greater the amount of troponin T and I there will be in the blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special steps are needed to prepare, most of the time.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe most common reason to perform this test is to see if a heart attack has occurred. Your health care provider will order this test if you have chest pain or other signs of a heart attack. The test is usually repeated two more times over the next 6 to 24 hours.\nYour provider may also order this test if you have\nangina\nthat is getting worse, but no other signs of a heart attack."}

(Angina is chest pain thought to be from a part of your heart not getting enough blood flow.)\nThe troponin test may also be done to help detect and evaluate other causes of heart injury.\nThe test may be done along with other cardiac marker tests, such as\nCPK isoenzymes\nor\nmyoglobin\n.\nNormal Results\nCardiac troponin levels are normally so low they cannot be detected with most blood tests.\nHaving normal troponin levels 12 hours after chest pain has started means a heart attack is unlikely.\nA normal value range may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements (for example, \"high sensitivity troponin test\") or test different samples. Also, some labs have different cutoff points for \"normal\" and \"probable myocardial infarction.\" Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nEven a slight increase in the troponin level will often mean there has been some damage to the heart."}

Very high levels of troponin are a sign that a heart attack has occurred.\nMost patients who have had a heart attack have increased troponin levels within 6 hours. After 12 hours, almost everyone who has had a heart attack will have raised levels.\nTroponin levels may remain high for 1 to 2 weeks after a heart attack.\nIncreased troponin levels may also be due to:\nAbnormally fast heartbeat\nHigh blood pressure in lung arteries (\npulmonary hypertension\n)\nBlockage of a lung artery by a blood clot, fat, or tumor cells (\npulmonary embolus\n)\nCongestive heart failure\nCoronary artery spasm\nInflammation of the heart muscle usually due to a virus (\nmyocarditis\n)\nProlonged exercise (for example, due to marathons or triathlons)\nTrauma that injures the heart, such as a car accident\nWeakening of the heart muscle (\ncardiomyopathy\n)\nLong-term kidney disease\nIncreased troponin levels may also result from certain medical procedures such as:\nCardiac angioplasty/stenting\nHeart defibrillation or\nelectrical ca"}
