Artificial joint parts (prosthetics) are used to replace your own bones. There are different types of ankle replacement surgeries.\nDescription\nAnkle replacement surgery is most often done while you are under general anesthesia. This means you will be asleep and not feel the pain.\nYou may have spinal anesthesia. You can be awake but will not feel anything below your waist. If you have spinal anesthesia, you will also be given medicine to help you relax during the operation.\nYour surgeon will make a surgical cut in the front of your ankle to expose the ankle joint. Your surgeon will then gently push the tendons, nerves, and blood vessels to the side."}

After this, your surgeon will remove the damaged bone and cartilage.\nYour surgeon will remove the damaged part of:\nThe lower end of your shin bone (tibia).\nThe top of your foot bone (talus) that the leg bones rest on.\nThe metal parts of the new artificial joint are then attached to the cut bony surfaces. A special glue/bone cement may be used to hold them in place. A piece of plastic is inserted between the two metal parts. Screws may be placed to stabilize your ankle.\nThe surgeon will put the tendons back into place and close the wound with sutures (stitches). You may need to wear a splint, cast, or brace for a while to keep the ankle from moving. You will also be instructed to not put weight on the leg until the implant has healed into the ankle.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThis surgery may be done if the ankle joint is badly damaged. Your symptoms may be pain and loss of movement of the ankle."}
