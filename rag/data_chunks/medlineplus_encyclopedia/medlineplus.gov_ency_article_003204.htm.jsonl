Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSpeech impairment in adults\nSpeech impairment in adults\nSpeech and language impairment may be any of several problems that make it difficult to communicate.\nConsiderations\nThe following are common speech and language disorders.\nAPHASIA\nAphasia is loss of the ability to understand or express spoken or written language. It commonly occurs after strokes or traumatic brain injuries. It can also occur in people with brain tumors or degenerative diseases that affect the language areas of the brain. This term does not apply to children who have never developed communication skills. There are many different types of aphasia.\nIn some cases of aphasia, the problem eventually corrects itself, but in others, it doesn't get better.\nDYSARTHRIA\nWith\ndysarthria\n, the person has problems expressing certain sounds or words. They have poorly pronounced speech (such as slurring) and the rhythm or speed of speech is changed."}

They have poorly pronounced speech (such as slurring) and the rhythm or speed of speech is changed. Usually, a nerve or brain disorder has made it difficult to control the tongue, lips, larynx, or vocal cords, which make speech.\nDysarthria, which is difficulty pronouncing words, is sometimes confused with aphasia, which is difficulty producing language. They have different causes.\nPeople with dysarthria may also have problems swallowing.\nVOICE DISTURBANCES\nAnything that changes the shape of the vocal cords or the way they work will cause a voice disturbance. Lump-like growths such as nodules, polyps, cysts, papillomas, granulomas, and cancers can be to blame. These changes cause the voice to sound different from the way it normally sounds.\nCauses\nSome of these disorders develop gradually, but anyone can develop a speech and language impairment suddenly, usually due to a stroke or trauma."}

Family and friends need to provide plenty of time for those with dysarthria to express themselves. Typing on an electronic device or using pen and paper can also help with communication. People with aphasia or dysarthria may benefit from speech therapy.\nFor aphasia, family members may need to provide frequent orientation reminders, such as the day of the week. Disorientation and confusion often occur with aphasia."}
