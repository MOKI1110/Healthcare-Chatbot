It can come from any event or thought that makes you feel frustrated, angry, or nervous.\nStress is your body's reaction to a challenge or demand. In short bursts, stress can be positive, such as when it helps you avoid danger or meet a deadline. But when stress lasts for a long time, it may harm your health.\nConsiderations\nStress is a normal feeling. There are two main types of stress:\nAcute stress.\nThis is short-term stress that goes away quickly. You feel it when you slam on the brakes, have a fight with your partner, or ski down a steep slope. It helps you manage dangerous situations. It also occurs when you do something new or exciting. All people have acute stress at one time or another.\nChronic stress.\nThis is stress that lasts for a longer period of time. You may have chronic stress if you have money problems, an unhappy marriage, trouble at work, or significant health concerns."}

You may have chronic stress if you have money problems, an unhappy marriage, trouble at work, or significant health concerns. Any type of stress that goes on for weeks or months is chronic stress. You can become so used to chronic stress that you don't realize it is a problem. If you don't find ways to\nmanage stress\n, it may lead to health problems.\nSTRESS AND YOUR BODY\nYour body reacts to stress by releasing hormones. These hormones make your brain more alert, cause your muscles to tense, and increase your pulse. In the short term, these reactions are good because they can help you handle the situation causing stress. This is your body's way of protecting itself.\nWhen you have chronic stress, your body stays alert, even though there is no danger. Over time, this puts you at risk for health problems, including:\nHigh blood pressure\nHeart disease\nDiabetes\nObesity\nDepression\nor anxiety\nSkin problems, such as\nacne\nor\neczema\nMenstrual problems\nIf you already have a health condition, chronic stress can make it worse.\nSIGNS OF TOO MUCH STRESS\nStress can cause many types of physical and emotional symptoms."}
