Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBleeding esophageal varices\nBleeding esophageal varices\nThe esophagus (food pipe) is the tube that connects your throat to your stomach. Varices are enlarged veins that may be found in the esophagus in people with cirrhosis of the liver. These veins may rupture and bleed.\nCauses\nScarring (\ncirrhosis\n) of the liver is the most common cause of esophageal varices. This scarring cuts down on blood flowing through the liver. As a result, more blood flows through the veins of the esophagus.\nThe extra blood flow causes the veins in the esophagus to balloon outward forming esophageal varices. Heavy bleeding can occur if the varices tear.\nAny type of long-term (chronic) liver disease can cause esophageal varices.\nVarices can also occur in the upper part of the stomach."}

Heavy bleeding can occur if the varices tear.\nAny type of long-term (chronic) liver disease can cause esophageal varices.\nVarices can also occur in the upper part of the stomach. These are called gastric varices.\nSymptoms\nPeople with chronic liver disease and esophageal varices may have no symptoms.\nIf there is only a small amount of bleeding, the only symptom may be dark or black streaks in the stools.\nIf larger amounts of bleeding occur, symptoms may include:\nBlack, tarry stools\nBloody stools\nLightheadedness\nPaleness\nSymptoms of chronic liver disease\nVomiting blood\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will do a physical exam which may show:\nBloody or black stool (in a rectal exam)\nLow blood pressure\nRapid heart rate\nSigns of chronic liver disease or cirrhosis\nTests to find the source of the bleeding and check if there is active bleeding include:\nEGD\nor upper endoscopy, which involves the use of a camera on a flexible tube to examine the esophagus and stomach.\nInsertion of a tube through the nose into the stomach (nasogastric tube) to look for signs of bleeding.\nSome providers suggest EGD for people who are newly diagnosed with mild to moderate cirrhosis."}

Bleeding must be controlled quickly to prevent\nshock\nand death.\nIf massive bleeding occurs, a person may need to be put on a ventilator to protect their airway and prevent blood from going down into the lungs.\nTo stop the bleeding, the provider may pass an\nendoscope\n(tube with a small light at the end) into the esophagus:\nA clotting medicine may be injected into the varices.\nA rubber band may be placed around the bleeding varices (called banding or band ligation). Banding is the most common endoscopic treatment for esophageal varices.\nOther treatments to stop the bleeding:\nA medicine to\ntighten blood vessels\nmay be given through a vein. Examples include octreotide or\nvasopressin\n.\nRarely, a tube may be inserted through the nose into the stomach and inflated with air."}

These include:\nDrugs called beta blockers, such as propranolol, nadolol, and carvedilol that reduce portal vein pressure and the risk of bleeding.\nA rubber band can be placed around the varices during an EGD procedure. Also, some medicines can be injected into the varices during EGD to cause them to clot.\nTransjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt\n(TIPS). This is a procedure to create new connections between two blood vessels in your liver. This can decrease pressure in the varices and prevent bleeding episodes from happening again.\nIn rare cases, emergency surgery may be used to treat people if other treatment fails."}
