If the suspected substance is present, the latex beads will clump together (agglutinate).\nLatex agglutination results take about 15 minutes to an hour.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour health care provider may tell you to limit certain foods or medicines shortly before the test. Follow instructions on how to prepare for the test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is a quick way to find out if an antigen or antibody is present or not.

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf there is an antigen-antibody match, agglutination will occur.\nRisks\nThe risk level depends on the type of test.\nURINE AND SALIVA TESTS\nThere is no risk with the urine or saliva test.\nBLOOD TEST\nVeins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Getting a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks from having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting\nor feeling lightheaded\nBlood accumulating under the skin (\nhematoma\n)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nCEREBROSPINAL FLUID TEST\nRisks of lumbar puncture include:\nBleeding into the spinal canal or around the brain (\nsubdural hematomas\n).\nDiscomfort during the test.\nHeadache after the test that can last a few hours or days."}
