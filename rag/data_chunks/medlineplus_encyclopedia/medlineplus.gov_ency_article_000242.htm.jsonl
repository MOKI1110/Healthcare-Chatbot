In this condition, you may have mild jaundice throughout life.\nCauses\nDJS is a very rare genetic disorder. In order to inherit the condition, a child must get a copy of the variant gene from both parents.\nThe syndrome interferes with the body's ability to move bilirubin through the liver into the bile. When the liver and spleen break down worn out red blood cells, bilirubin is produced. Bilirubin normally moves into the bile, which is produced by the liver. It then flows into the bile ducts, is stored in the gallbladder, and then flows into the digestive system.\nWhen bilirubin is not properly transported into the bile, it builds up in the bloodstream. This causes the skin and the whites of the eyes to turn yellow. This is called jaundice."}
