Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAtherosclerosis\nAtherosclerosis\nAtherosclerosis, sometimes called \"hardening of the arteries,\" occurs when fat, cholesterol, and other substances build up in the walls of arteries. These deposits are called plaques. Over time, these plaques can narrow or completely block the arteries and cause problems throughout the body.\nAtherosclerosis is a common disorder.\nCauses\nWatch this video about:\nAtherosclerosis\nAtherosclerosis often occurs with aging. As you grow older, plaque buildup narrows your arteries and makes them stiffer. These changes make it harder for blood to flow through them.\nClots may form in these narrowed arteries and block blood flow. Pieces of plaque can also break off and move to smaller blood vessels, blocking them.\nThese blockages starve tissues of blood and oxygen. This can result in damage or tissue death."}

It is a common cause of heart attack and stroke.\nHigh blood cholesterol\nlevels can cause hardening of the arteries at a younger age.\nFor many people, high cholesterol levels are due to a diet that is too high in saturated fats and trans fats.\nOther factors that can contribute to hardening of the arteries include:\nDiabetes\nFamily history of hardening of the arteries\nHigh blood pressure\nLack of exercise\nBeing overweight or obese\nSmoking\nSymptoms\nAtherosclerosis does not cause symptoms until blood flow to part of the body becomes slowed or blocked.\nIf the arteries supplying the heart become narrow, blood flow can slow down or stop. This can cause chest pain (stable angina), shortness of breath, and other symptoms.\nNarrowed or blocked arteries may also cause problems in the intestines, kidneys, legs, and brain.\nExams and Tests\nA health care provider will perform a physical exam and listen to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope."}

Atherosclerosis can create a whooshing or blowing sound (\"bruit\") over an artery.\nAll people age 18 or older should have their blood pressure checked every year. More frequent measurement may be needed for those with a history of high blood pressure readings or those with risk factors for high blood pressure.\nCholesterol testing is recommended in all adults. The major national guidelines differ on the suggested age to start testing.\nScreening should begin between ages 20 to 35 for men and ages 20 to 45 for women.\nRepeat testing is not needed for five years for most adults with normal cholesterol levels.\nRepeat testing may be needed if lifestyle changes occur, such as large increase in weight or a change in diet.\nMore frequent testing is needed for adults with a history of high cholesterol, diabetes, kidney problems, heart disease, stroke, and other conditions\nA number of imaging tests may be used to see how well blood moves through your arteries."}

For weight loss, exercise for 60 to 90 minutes a day. Talk to your provider before starting a new exercise plan, especially if you have been diagnosed with heart disease or you have ever had a heart attack.\nIf your blood pressure is high, it is important for you to lower it and keep it under control.\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce your blood pressure so that you have a lower risk of health problems caused by high blood pressure."}

However, lifestyle changes and treating high cholesterol levels can prevent or slow the process from becoming worse. This can help reduce the chances of having a heart attack and stroke as a result of atherosclerosis.\nPossible Complications\nIn some cases, the plaque is part of a process that causes a weakening of the wall of an artery. This can lead to a bulge in an artery called an\naneurysm\n. Aneurysms can break open (rupture)."}
