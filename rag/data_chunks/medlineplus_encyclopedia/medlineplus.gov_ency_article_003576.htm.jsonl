The\nantibody\naffects the part of the muscle that receives signals from nerves.\nThis article discusses the blood test for acetylcholine receptor antibody.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. Most of the time, blood is\ndrawn from a vein\nlocated on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nMost of the time, you do not need to take special steps before this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is used to help diagnose myasthenia gravis.\nNormal Results\nNormally, there is no acetylcholine receptor antibody (or less than 0.02 nmol/L) in the bloodstream.\nNote: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs."}

Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result means acetylcholine receptor antibody has been found in your blood. It confirms the diagnosis of myasthenia gravis in people who have symptoms of myasthenia gravis. Nearly one half of people with myasthenia gravis that is limited to their eye muscles (ocular myasthenia gravis) have this antibody in their blood. This antibody can also be present in the blood of people who have a thymus gland tumor (thymoma), with or without myasthenia gravis.\nHowever, the lack of this antibody does not rule out myasthenia gravis. About 1 in 5 people with myasthenia gravis do not have signs of this antibody in their blood. Your provider may also consider testing you for the muscle specific kinase (MuSK) or other antibodies.\nImages\nBlood test\nCentral nervous system and peripheral nervous system\nPtosis - drooping of the eyelid\nReferences\nGuptill JT, Sanders DB."}
