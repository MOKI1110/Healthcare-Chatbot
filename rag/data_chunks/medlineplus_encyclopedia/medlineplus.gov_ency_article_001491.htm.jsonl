Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCervical dysplasia\nCervical dysplasia\nCervical dysplasia refers to abnormal changes in the cells on the surface of the\ncervix\n. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina.\nThe changes are not cancer, but they can lead to cancer of the cervix if not treated.\nCauses\nCervical dysplasia can develop at any age. However, treatment and follow-up will depend on your age. Cervical dysplasia is most commonly caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual contact. There are many types of HPV. Some types lead to cervical dysplasia or cancer."}

HPV is a common virus that is spread through sexual contact. There are many types of HPV. Some types lead to cervical dysplasia or cancer. Other types of HPV can cause genital warts.\nThe following may increase your risk for cervical dysplasia:\nHaving sex before age 18\nHaving a baby at very young age\nHaving had multiple sexual partners\nHaving other illnesses, such as tuberculosis or HIV\nUsing medicines that suppress your immune system\nSmoking\nMaternal history of exposure to DES (diethylstilbestrol)\nSymptoms\nMost of the time, there are no symptoms.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a pelvic exam to check for cervical dysplasia. The initial test is usually a Pap test and a test for the presence of HPV.\nCervical dysplasia that is seen on a\nPap test\nis called squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL). On the Pap test report, any abnormal changes will be described as:\nLow-grade (LSIL)\nHigh-grade (HSIL)\nPossibly cancerous (malignant)\nAtypical glandular cells (AGC)\nAtypical squamous cells (ASC)\nYou will need more tests if a Pap test shows abnormal cells or cervical dysplasia."}

If the changes were mild, follow-up Pap tests may be all that is needed.\nThe provider may perform a biopsy to confirm the condition. This may be done with the use of\ncolposcopy\n. Any areas of concern will be biopsied. The biopsies are very small and most women feel only a small cramp.\nDysplasia that is seen on a biopsy of the cervix is called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). It is grouped into 3 categories:\nCIN I -- mild dysplasia\nCIN II -- moderate to marked dysplasia\nCIN III -- severe dysplasia to carcinoma in situ\nSome strains of HPV are known to cause cervical cancer. An HPV DNA test can identify the high-risk types of HPV linked to this cancer. This test may be done:\nAs a screening test for women age 30 or more\nFor women of any age who have a slightly abnormal Pap test result\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the degree of dysplasia. Mild dysplasia (LSIL or CIN I) may go away without treatment."}

This vaccine prevents many cervical cancers.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nEarly diagnosis and prompt treatment cures most cases of cervical dysplasia."}

Girls who receive this vaccine before they become sexually active reduce their chance of getting cervical cancer.\nYou can reduce your risk of developing cervical dysplasia by taking the following steps:\nGet vaccinated for HPV between ages 9 to 45.\nDo not smoke. Smoking increases your risk of developing more severe dysplasia and cancer.\nDo not have sex until you are 18 or older.\nPractice safe sex. Use a condom.\nPractice monogamy."}
