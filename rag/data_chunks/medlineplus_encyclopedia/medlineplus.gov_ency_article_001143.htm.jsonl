Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBarrett esophagus\nBarrett esophagus\nBarrett esophagus (BE) is a disorder in which the lining of the esophagus is damaged by stomach acid leading to changes in the cells of the lining. The esophagus is also called the food pipe, and it connects your throat to your stomach.\nPeople with BE have an increased risk for cancer in the area involved. However, cancer is not common.\nCauses\nWhen you eat, food passes from your throat to your stomach through the esophagus. A ring of muscle fibers in the lower esophagus keeps stomach contents from moving backward.\nIf these muscles do not close tightly, harsh stomach acid can leak into the esophagus. This is called reflux or\ngastroesophageal reflux (GERD)\n. It may cause tissue damage over time. The lining becomes similar to that of the intestine.\nBE occurs more often in men than women. People who have had GERD for a long time are more likely to have this condition.\nSymptoms\nBE itself does not cause symptoms. The\nacid reflux\nthat causes BE often leads to symptoms of heartburn."}

People who have had GERD for a long time are more likely to have this condition.\nSymptoms\nBE itself does not cause symptoms. The\nacid reflux\nthat causes BE often leads to symptoms of heartburn. Many people with this condition do not have any symptoms.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will recommend an endoscopy (EGD) to screen for BE if you are a high risk person. You may also need an\nendoscopy\nif GERD symptoms are severe or come back after treatment.\nDuring the endoscopy, your endoscopist (usually a gastroenterologist or specialist in conditions of the GI tract) may take tissue samples (\nbiopsies\n) from different parts of the esophagus. These samples help detect the condition. They also help look for changes that could lead to cancer.\nIf you have BE, your provider may recommend a follow-up endoscopy to look for cell changes that indicate cancer at regular intervals.\nSome patients may choose to screen with a swallowed capsule, but this is not widely available.\nTreatment\nTREATMENT OF GERD\nTreatment should improve\nacid reflux symptoms\n, and may keep BE from getting worse."}

Treatment of GERD may involve lifestyle changes and medicines such as:\nAntacids\nafter meals and at bedtime\nHistamine H2 receptor blockers\nProton pump inhibitors\n(PPIs)\nAvoiding use of tobacco, chocolate, and caffeine\nHowever in BE, PPIs are the recommended medicine\nLifestyle changes, medicines, and\nanti-reflux surgery\nmay help with symptoms of GERD. However, these steps will not make BE go away.\nTREATMENT OF BARRETT ESOPHAGUS\nEndoscopic biopsy can show changes in the cells of the esophagus that may be cancer. You provider may advise surgery or other procedures to treat it.\nThe recommended procedure to treat abnormal tissues in BE is radiofrequency ablation (RFA), which is done at the time of an endoscopy. Sometimes this is combined with endoscopic removal of particular sections of abnormal tissue."}

After RFA you will have follow-up endoscopy and further treatment if necessary.\nSome people may choose to have surgery to correct anatomic abnormalities such as hiatal hernia, that may lead to BE.\nIf you have esophageal cancer, you may need surgery to remove the esophagus (esophagectomy).\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nTreatment should improve acid reflux symptoms and may keep BE from getting worse. RFA removes the BE tissue as does endoscopic removal, but BE often comes back and this is why surveillance with EGDs is done after RFA.\nPeople with chronic GERD or BE generally need to be monitored for cancer of the esophagus.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nHeartburn lasts for longer than a few days, or you have pain or problems swallowing.\nYou have been diagnosed with BE and your symptoms get worse.\nYou develop new symptoms (such as weight loss, problems swallowing).\nPrevention\nEarly detection and treatment of GERD may prevent BE.\nAlternative Names\nBarrett's esophagu"}
