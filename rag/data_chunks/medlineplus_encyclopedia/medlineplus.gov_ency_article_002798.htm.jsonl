Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue death. This may result in infection, shock, and death, even several months after substance was swallowed. Scar tissue in the affected areas can lead to long-term problems with breathing, swallowing, and digestion.\nReferences\nMofenson HC, Caraccio TR, McGuigan M, Greensher J. Medical toxicology.
