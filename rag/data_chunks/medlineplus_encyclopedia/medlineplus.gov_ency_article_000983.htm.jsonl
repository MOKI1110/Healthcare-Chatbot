Dislocation means the bone slips out of its normal position.\nThe injury is also called radial head dislocation.\nCauses\nNursemaid's elbow is a common condition in young children, especially under age 5. The injury occurs when a child is pulled up too hard by their hand or wrist. It is often seen after someone lifts a child up by one arm. This might occur, for example when trying to lift the child over a curb or high step.\nOther ways this injury may happen include:\nStopping a fall with the arm\nRolling over in an unusual way\nSwinging a young child from their arms while playing\nOnce the elbow dislocates, it is likely to do so again, especially in the 3 or 4 weeks after the injury.\nNursemaid's elbow does not usually occur after age 5. By this time, a child's joints and the structures around them are stronger. Also, the child is less likely to be in a situation where this injury might occur."}

By this time, a child's joints and the structures around them are stronger. Also, the child is less likely to be in a situation where this injury might occur. In some cases, the injury can happen in older children or adults, usually with a fracture of the forearm.\nSymptoms\nWhen the injury occurs:\nYour child usually begins crying right away and refuses to use the arm because of elbow pain.\nYour child may hold the arm slightly bent (flexed) at the elbow and pressed up against their belly (abdominal) area.\nYour child will move the shoulder, but not the elbow. Some children stop crying as the first pain goes away, but continue to refuse to move their elbow.\nExams and Tests\nYour child's health care provider will examine them.\nYour child will be unable to rotate their arm at the elbow. The palm will be up, and your child will have trouble bending (flexing) the elbow all the way.\nTreatment\nSometimes the elbow will slip back into place on its own. Even then, it is best for your child to see their provider.\nDo not try to straighten the arm or change its position. Apply an ice pack to the elbow."}

Even then, it is best for your child to see their provider.\nDo not try to straighten the arm or change its position. Apply an ice pack to the elbow. Keep the areas above and below the injured elbow (including the shoulder and wrist) from moving, if possible.\nTake your child to their provider's office or an emergency room.\nTheir provider will fix the dislocation by gently flexing the elbow and rotating the forearm so that the palm faces upward. Do not try to do this yourself because you may harm your child.\nIf nursemaid's elbow returns several times, your provider may teach you how to correct the problem yourself.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf nursemaid's elbow is not treated, the child may be permanently unable to fully move the elbow. With treatment, there is usually no permanent damage.\nPossible Complications\nIn some cases, children may have problems that limit movement of the arm.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you suspect your child has a dislocated elbow or refuses to use an arm.\nPrevention\nDo not lift a child by a single arm, such as from their wrist or hand."}
