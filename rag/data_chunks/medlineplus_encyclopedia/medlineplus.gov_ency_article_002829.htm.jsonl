The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.\nInhaling these substances for long periods of time can cause permanent brain damage. This type of damage is seen in people who sniff these substances on purpose to get high.\nSwallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue necrosis, resulting in infection, shock, and death, even several months after the substance was first swallowed. Scars may form in these tissues leading to long-term difficulties with breathing, swallowing, and digestion.\nAlternative Names\nXylene poisoning\nReferences\nAronson JK. Organic solvents.
