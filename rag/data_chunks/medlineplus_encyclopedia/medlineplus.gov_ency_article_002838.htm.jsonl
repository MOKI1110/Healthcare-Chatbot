But contact with a very large amount of it can cause severe symptoms. Care will begin by contaminating the person while starting other treatments.\nThe provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. The person may receive:\nBlood and urine tests.\nBreathing support, including oxygen."}

This may need to be continued for several days.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPeople who continue to improve over the first 4 to 6 hours after receiving medical treatment usually fully recover.\nKeep all chemicals, cleaners, and industrial products in their original containers and marked as poison, and out of the reach of children. This will reduce the risk of poisoning and overdose.\nAlternative Names\nWeedoff poisoning; Roundup poisoning\nReferences\nWelker KL, Thompson TM. Pesticides.
