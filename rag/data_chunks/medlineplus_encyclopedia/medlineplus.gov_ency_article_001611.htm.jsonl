The lacrimal gland is located under the outer part of each eyebrow. Lacrimal gland tumors can be harmless (\nbenign\n) or cancerous (\nmalignant\n). About half of lacrimal gland tumors are benign. Some masses in the lacrimal gland are not really tumors but may be due to inflammation or overgrowth of lymphoid tissue.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nDouble vision\nFullness in one eyelid or the side of the face\nPain\nExams and Tests\nYou may first be examined by an eye doctor (ophthalmologist). You may then be evaluated by a head and neck doctor (otolaryngologist, or ENT), or a doctor who specializes in problems with the bony eye socket (orbit).\nTests most often include a\nCT\nor\nMRI scan\n.\nTreatment\nMost lacrimal gland tumors will need to be removed with surgery. Cancerous tumors may need other treatment too, such as radiation or chemotherapy.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook is most often excellent for noncancerous growths."}
