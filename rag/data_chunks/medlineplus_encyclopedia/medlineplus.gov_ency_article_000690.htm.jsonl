It affects the function of the sixth cranial (skull) nerve. As a result, the person may have double vision.\nCauses\nCranial mononeuropathy VI is damage to the sixth cranial nerve. This nerve is also called the abducens nerve. It helps you move your eye sideways toward your temple.\nDisorders of this nerve can occur with:\nBrain\naneurysms\nNerve damage from diabetes (\ndiabetic neuropathy\n)\nGradenigo syndrome (which also causes discharge from the ear and eye pain)\nTolosa-Hunt syndrome (inflammation of the area behind the eye)\nIncreased or decreased pressure in the skull\nInfections (such as\nmeningitis\nor\nsinusitis\n)\nMultiple sclerosis\n(MS), a disease that affects the brain and spinal cord\nPregnancy\nStroke\nTrauma (caused by head injury or accidentally during surgery)\nTumors around or behind the eye\nWhile rare, it can also be present at birth (congenital).\nThe exact cause of vaccination-related cranial nerve palsy in children is not known.\nBecause there are com"}

You can still move your eye up, down, and toward the nose, unless other nerves are affected.\nSymptoms may include:\nDouble vision\nwhen looking to one side\nHeadaches\nPain around the eye\nExams and Tests\nTests often show that one eye has trouble looking to the side while the other eye moves normally. An exam shows the eyes do not line up either at rest or when looking in the direction of the weak eye.\nYour health care provider will do a complete exam to determine the possible effect on other parts of the nervous system."}

Depending on the suspected cause, you may need:\nBlood tests\nHead imaging study (such as an\nMRI\nor\nCT scan\n)\nSpinal tap\n(lumbar puncture)\nYou may need to be referred to a doctor who specializes in vision problems related to the nervous system (neuro-ophthalmologist).\nTreatment\nIf your provider diagnoses swelling or inflammation of, or around the nerve, medicines called corticosteroids may be used.\nSometimes, the condition disappears without treatment. If you have diabetes, you'll be advised to keep tight control of your\nblood sugar level\n.\nYour provider may prescribe an eye patch to relieve the double vision. The patch can be removed after the nerve heals.\nSurgery or special glasses (prisms) may be advised if there is no recovery in 6 to 12 months.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nTreating the cause may improve the condition. Recovery often occurs within 3 months in older adults who have hypertension or diabetes. There is less chance of recovery in case of complete paralysis of the sixth nerve."}

The chances of recovery are less in children than in adults in case of traumatic injury of the nerve. Recovery is usually complete in cases of benign sixth nerve palsy in childhood.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include permanent vision changes.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have double vision.\nPrevention\nThere is no way to prevent this condition.
