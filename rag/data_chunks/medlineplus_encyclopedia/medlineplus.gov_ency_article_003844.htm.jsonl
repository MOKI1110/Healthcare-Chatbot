Both of these professionals are often called an \"eye doctor.\"\nYou sit in a chair that has a special device (called a phoroptor or refractor) attached to it. You look through the device and focus on an eye chart 20 feet (6 meters) away. The device contains lenses of different strengths that can be moved into your view. The test is performed one eye at a time.\nThe eye doctor will then ask if the chart appears more or less clear when different lenses are in place.The results depend on your responses.\nThen, a device shines specialized light into your eyes and also determines your refraction. Responses from you are not needed."}

Responses from you are not needed. Each type of refraction has their own benefits.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nIf you wear contact lenses, ask the doctor if you need to remove them and for how long before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThere is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test can be done as part of a\nroutine eye exam\n. The purpose is to determine whether you have a refractive error (a need for glasses or contact lenses).\nFor people over age 40 who have normal distance vision but difficulty with near vision, a refraction test can determine the right power of reading glasses.\nNormal Results\nIf your uncorrected vision (without glasses or contact lenses) is normal, then the refractive error is zero (also called plano) and your vision should be 20/20 (6/6).\nA value of 20/20 (6/6) is normal vision. This means you can read 3/8-inch (1 centimeter) tall letters at 20 feet (6 meters)."}

This means you can read 3/8-inch (1 centimeter) tall letters at 20 feet (6 meters). A small type size is also used to determine normal near vision.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nYou have a refractive error if you need a combination of lenses to see 20/20 (6/6). Glasses or contact lenses should give you good vision. If you have a refractive error, you have a \"prescription.\" Your prescription is a series of numbers that describe the powers of the lenses needed to allow you to see clearly.\nIf your final vision is less than 20/20 (6/6), even with lenses, then there is probably another, non-optical problem with your eye.\nThe vision level you achieve during the refraction test is called the best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA).\nAbnormal results may be due to:\nAstigmatism\n(abnormally curved cornea causing blurred vision)\nHyperopia\n(farsightedness)\nMyopia\n(nearsightedness)\nPresbyopia\n(inability to focus on near objects that develops with age)\nOther conditions under which the test may be performed:\nCorneal ulcers and infections\nLoss of sharp vision due to\nmacular degeneration\nReti"}

If your vision becomes blurry, worsens, or if there are other noticeable changes, schedule an exam right away.\nAfter age 40 (or for people with a family history of\nglaucoma\n), eye exams should be scheduled at least once a year to test for glaucoma."}
