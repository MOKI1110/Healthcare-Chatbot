Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPancreatic neuroendocrine tumors\nPancreatic neuroendocrine tumors\nPancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET) are rare\ntumors\nof the pancreas that start from a type of cell called the islet cell.\nCauses\nIn the healthy pancreas, cells called islet cells produce hormones that regulate several bodily functions. These include blood sugar level and the production of stomach acid.\nTumors that arise from islet cells of the pancreas can also produce a variety of hormones, which can lead to specific symptoms.\nPancreatic NETs can be noncancerous (\nbenign\n) or cancerous (\nmalignant\n).\nNETs include:\nGastrinoma (\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome\n)\nGlucagonoma\nInsulinoma\nSomatostatinoma\nVIPoma (\nVerner-Morrison syndrome\n)\nA family history of multiple\nendocrine\nneoplasia, type I (\nMEN I\n) is a risk factor for the development of NETs.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms depend on which hormone is made by the tumor.\nFor example, insulinomas produce insulin, which lowers blood sugar level."}

Symptoms may include:\nFeeling tired or weak\nShaking or sweating\nHeadache\nHunger\nNervousness, anxiety, or feeling irritable\nUnclear thinking or feeling uneasy\nDouble or blurry vision\nFast or pounding heartbeat\nIf your blood sugar level gets too low, you may faint, have a seizure, or even go into a coma.\nGastrinomas make the hormone gastrin, which tells the body to make stomach acid. Symptoms may include:\nAbdominal pain\nDiarrhea\nUlcers in the stomach and small bowel\nVomiting blood (occasionally)\nGlucagonomas make the hormone glucagon, which helps the body raise blood sugar level. Symptoms can include:\nDiabetes\nRed, blistery rash in the groin or buttocks\nWeight loss\nFrequent urination and thirst\nSomatostatinomas make the hormone somatostatin."}

VIPomas may cause:\nSevere diarrhea that may lead to dehydration\nLow blood potassium levels, and high calcium levels\nAbdominal cramps\nWeight loss\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will take your medical history and perform a physical exam.\nBlood tests may vary, depending upon the symptoms, but may include:\nFasting glucose\nlevel\nGastrin level\nGlucose tolerance test\nSecretin stimulation test\nfor pancreas\nBlood glucagon\nlevel\nBlood insulin C-peptide\nlevel\nBlood insulin level\nFasting serum somatostatin level\nSerum vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) level\nImaging tests may be done:\nAbdominal CT scan\nAbdominal ultrasound\nEndoscopic\nultrasound\nMRI of abdomen\nA blood sample may also be taken"}

During this procedure, the surgeon examines the pancreas by hand and with ultrasound.\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the type of tumor and if it is cancerous.\nCancerous tumors can grow quickly and spread to other organs. They may not be treatable. Tumors are often removed with surgery, if possible.\nIf cancer cells spread to the liver, a part of the liver may also be removed, if possible. If the cancer is widespread, chemotherapy may be used to try to shrink the tumors.\nIf the abnormal production of hormones is causing symptoms, you may receive medicines to counteract their effects. For example, with gastrinomas, the overproduction of gastrin leads to too much acid in the stomach. Medicines that block stomach acid release can reduce symptoms.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\ncancer support group\n."}

Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nYou may be cured if the tumors are surgically removed before they have spread to other organs. If tumors are cancerous, chemotherapy may be used, but it usually cannot cure people.\nLife-threatening problems (such as very low blood sugar) can occur due to excess hormone production, or if the cancer spreads throughout the body.\nPossible Complications\nComplications of these tumors include:\nDiabetes\nHormone crises (if the tumor releases certain types of hormones)\nSevere low blood sugar (from insulinomas)\nSevere ulcers in the stomach and small intestine (from gastrinomas)\nSpread of the tumor to the liver\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of these tumors, especially if you have a family history of MEN I.\nPrevention\nThere is no known prevention for these tumors.\nAlternative Names\nCancer - pancreas; Cancer - pancreatic; Pancreatic canc"}
