Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEndovascular embolization\nEndovascular embolization\nEndovascular embolization is a procedure to treat abnormal blood vessels in the brain and other parts of the body. It is an alternative to open surgery.\nThis procedure cuts off the blood supply to a certain part of the body.\nDescription\nYou may have\ngeneral anesthesia\n(asleep and pain-free) and a breathing tube. Or, you may be given medicine to relax you, but you will not be asleep.\nA small surgical cut will be made in the groin area or wrist. The doctor will use a needle to create a hole in the femoral artery, a large blood vessel in the groin."}

The doctor will use a needle to create a hole in the femoral artery, a large blood vessel in the groin. It may also be done through the radial artery in the wrist\nA thin, flexible tube called a catheter is passed through the open skin and into the artery.\nDye is injected through this tube so that the blood vessel can be seen on x-ray images.\nThe doctor gently moves the catheter through the blood vessel up to the area being treated.\nOnce the catheter is in place, the doctor places small plastic particles, glue, metal coils, foam, or a balloon through it to seal off the faulty blood vessel. (If coils are used, it is called coil embolization.)\nThis procedure can take several hours.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThe procedure is most often used to treat\naneurysms\nin the brain. It can also be used for other medical conditions when open surgery might be risky."}

It can also be used for other medical conditions when open surgery might be risky. The goal of the treatment is to prevent bleeding in the problem area and to reduce the risk that the blood vessel feeding it will break open (rupture).\nYour doctor will help you decide whether it is safer to have surgery to block off the aneurysm before it can rupture.\nThis procedure may be used to treat:\nArteriovenous malformation\n(AVM)\nBrain aneurysm\nCarotid artery cavernous fistula (a problem with the large artery in the neck)\nCertain tumors\nRisks\nRisks from the procedure may include:\nBleeding at the site of the needle puncture\nBleeding in the brain\nDamage to the artery where the needle is inserted\nDislodged coil or balloon\nFailure to completely treat the abnormal blood vessel\nInfection\nStroke\nSymptoms that keep returning\nDeath\nBefore the Procedure\nThis procedure is often done on an emergency basis."}

Ask your provider for help\nquitting smoking\n.\nIf needed,\nprepare your home\nto make it easier to recover after the procedure.\nAsk your doctor if you need to arrange to have someone drive you home after your surgery.\nDuring the week before your surgery:\nYou may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners."}
