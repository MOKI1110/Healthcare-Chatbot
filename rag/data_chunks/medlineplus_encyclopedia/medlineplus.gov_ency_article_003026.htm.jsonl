Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPrognathism\nPrognathism\nPrognathism is an extension or bulging out (protrusion) of the lower jaw (mandible). It occurs when the teeth are not properly aligned due to the shape of the face bones.\nConsiderations\nPrognathism may cause malocclusion (misalignment of the biting surfaces of the upper and lower teeth). It can give a person an angry, or fighter's appearance. Prognathism may be a symptom of other syndromes or conditions.\nCauses\nAn extended (protruding) jaw can be part of a person's normal face shape that is present at birth.\nIt can also be caused by inherited conditions, such as Crouzon syndrome or\nbasal cell nevus syndrome\n.\nIt may develop over time in children or adults as the result of excess growth in conditions such as\ngigantism\nor\nacromegaly\n.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nA dentist or orthodontist may be able to treat abnormal alignment of the jaw and teeth."}
