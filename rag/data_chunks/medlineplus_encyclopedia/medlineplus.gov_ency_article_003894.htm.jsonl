The sample is examined under a microscope.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA sample for a biliary tract biopsy can be obtained in different ways.\nA needle biopsy can be done if you have a well-defined tumor.\nThe biopsy site is cleaned.\nA thin needle is inserted into the area to be tested, and a sample of cells and fluid are removed.\nThe needle is then removed.\nPressure is put on the area to stop any bleeding. The site will be covered with a bandage.\nIf you have a narrowing or blockage of the bile or pancreatic ducts, a sample can be taken during procedures such as:\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)\nPercutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram (PTCA)\nEndoscopic ultrasound (EUS)\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may not be able to eat or drink 8 to 12 hours or more before the test."}

Your health care provider will tell you ahead of time what you need to do.\nMake sure you have someone to drive you home.  For some of these tests, you will have sedation. If you have sedation, you shouldn't drive, operate machinery, or make legal decisions for 24 hours after.\nHow the Test will Feel\nHow the test will feel depends on the type of procedure used to remove the biopsy sample. With a needle biopsy, you may feel a sting as the needle is inserted. Some people feel a cramping or pinching feeling during the procedure.\nMedicines that stop pain and help you relax are commonly used for biliary tract biopsy procedures.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA biliary tract biopsy can determine if a tumor started in the liver or spread from another location."}
