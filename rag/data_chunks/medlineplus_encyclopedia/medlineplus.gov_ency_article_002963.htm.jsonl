Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBone graft\nBone graft\nA bone graft is surgery to place new bone or bone substitutes into spaces around a\nbroken bone\nor bone defects to stimulate healing.\nDescription\nA bone graft can be taken from the person's own healthy bone (this is called an autograft). Or, it can be taken from frozen, donated bone (allograft). In some cases, a manmade (synthetic) bone substitute is used.\nYou will be asleep and feel no pain (\ngeneral anesthesia\n).\nDuring surgery, the surgeon makes a cut over the bone defect. The bone graft can be taken from areas close to the bone defect or more commonly from the pelvis. The bone graft is shaped and inserted into and around the area."}

The bone graft may need to be held in place with pins, plates, or screws.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nBone grafts are used to:\nFuse joints to prevent movement\nRepair\nbroken bones (fractures)\nthat have bone loss\nRepair injured bone that has not healed\nRisks\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general include:\nReactions to medicines, breathing problems\nBleeding, blood clots, infection\nRisks of this surgery include:\nPain at the body area where the bone was removed\nInjury of nerves near the bone grafting area\nStiffness of the area\nBefore the Procedure\nTell your surgeon or nurse if:\nYou are or could be pregnant\nYou are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\nDuring the week before your surgery:\nYou may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners."}

These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\nOn the day of the surgery:\nFollow instructions about not eating or drinking anything before surgery.\nTake the medicines your provider told you to take with a small sip of water.\nIf you are going to the hospital from home, be sure to arrive at the scheduled time.\nAfter the Procedure\nRecovery time depends on the injury or defect being treated and the size of the bone graft. Your recovery may take 2 weeks to 3 months. The bone graft itself will take up to 3 months or longer to heal.\nYou may be told to avoid extreme exercise for up to 6 months. Ask your surgeon or nurse what you can and cannot safely do.\nYou will need to keep the bone graft area clean and dry. Follow instructions about showering.\nDo not smoke."}

Ask your surgeon or nurse what you can and cannot safely do.\nYou will need to keep the bone graft area clean and dry. Follow instructions about showering.\nDo not smoke. Smoking slows or prevents bone healing. If you smoke, the graft is more likely to fail. Be aware that nicotine patches slow healing just like smoking does. You may also be told not to take non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or naproxen. These medicines can slow down bone fusion.\nYou may need to use a bone stimulator. These are machines that can be worn over the surgical area to stimulate bone growth. Not all bone graft surgeries require the use of bone stimulators. Your surgeon will let you know if you'll need to use a bone stimulator.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost bone grafts help the bone defect heal with little risk of graft rejection.\nAlternative Names\nAutograft - bone; Allograft - bone; Fracture - bone graft; Surgery - bone graft; Autologous bone graft\nImages\nSpinal bone graft  - series\nBone graft harvest\nReferences\nBrinker MR, O'Connor DP.
