Amino acids are the building blocks for proteins in the body.\nHow the Test is Performed\nclean-catch urine sample\nmay be needed. This is often done at your health care provider's office or health clinic.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nMost of the time, you do not need to take special steps before this test. Make sure your provider knows all of the medicines you recently used. If this test is being done on an infant who is breastfeeding, make sure the provider knows what medicines the nursing mother is taking.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to measure amino acid levels in the urine. There are many different types of amino acids. It is common for some of each kind to be found in the urine. Increased levels of individual amino acids can be a sign of a problem with metabolism.\nNormal Results\nThe specific value is measured in mmol/mol creatinine."}
