This means there is a problem with the body's immune system.\nNormally, the immune system helps protect the body from infection or harmful substances. But in people with an autoimmune disease, the immune system cannot tell the difference between harmful substances and healthy ones. As a result, the immune system attacks otherwise healthy cells and tissues.\nSLE may damage different parts of the kidney. This can lead to disorders such as:\nInterstitial nephritis\nNephrotic syndrome\nMembranous glomerulonephritis\nKidney failure\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of lupus nephritis include:\nBlood in the urine\nFoamy appearance to urine\nSwelling\n(edema) of any area of the body\nHigh blood pressure\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms."}

Abnormal sounds may be heard when the provider listens to your heart and lungs.\nTests that may be done include:\nANA\ntiter\nBUN\nand\ncreatinine\nComplement\nlevels\nUrinalysis\nUrine protein\nKidney biopsy\n, to determine appropriate treatment\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to improve kidney function and to delay kidney failure.\nMedicines may include drugs that suppress the immune system, such as corticosteroids, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, or azathioprine.\nYou may need\ndialysis\nto control symptoms of kidney failure, sometimes for only a while. A kidney transplant may be recommended. People with active lupus should not have a transplant because the condition can occur in the transplanted kidney.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well you do depends on the specific form of lupus nephritis."}
