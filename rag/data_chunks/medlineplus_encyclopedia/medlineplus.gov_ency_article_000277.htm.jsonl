Cancers that often spread to the liver include:\nBreast cancer\nColorectal cancer\nEsophageal cancer\nLung cancer\nMelanoma\nPancreatic cancer\nStomach cancer\nThe risk for cancer spreading to the liver depends on the location (site) of the original cancer. A liver metastasis may be present when the original (primary) cancer is diagnosed or it may occur months or years after the primary tumor is removed.\nSymptoms\nIn some cases, there are no symptoms."}

The type of chemotherapy used depends on the original type of cancer.\nWhen the cancer has only spread to the liver, systemic chemotherapy may still be used.\nChemoembolization is a type of chemotherapy to one area. A thin tube called a catheter is inserted into an artery in the groin. The catheter is threaded into an artery in the liver. Cancer-killing medicine is sent through the catheter. Then another medicine is sent through the catheter to block blood flow to the part of the liver with the tumor. This \"starves\" the cancer cells.\nOTHER TREATMENTS\nAlcohol (ethanol) injected into the liver tumor -- A needle is sent through the skin directly into the liver tumor. The alcohol kills cancer cells.\nHeat, using radio or microwave energy -- A large needle called a probe is placed into the center of the liver tumor. Energy is sent through thin wires called electrodes, which are attached to the probe. The cancer cells are heated and die."}

It is called microwave ablation when microwave energy is used.\nFreezing, also called cryotherapy -- A probe is placed in contact with the tumor. A chemical is sent through the probe that causes ice crystals to form around the probe. The cancer cells are frozen and die.\nRadioactive beads/spheres -- These beads/spheres deliver radiation to kill the cancer cells.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well you do depends on the location of the original cancer and how much it has spread to the liver or anywhere else. In rare cases, surgery to remove the liver tumors leads to a cure. This is usually only possible when there are a limited number of tumors in the liver.\nIn most cases, cancer that has spread to the liver cannot be cured. People whose cancer has spread to the liver often die of their disease."}
