The most common lumps or swellings are\nenlarged lymph nodes\n. These can be caused by bacterial or viral infections, cancer (\nmalignancy\n), or other rare causes.\nSwollen salivary glands under the jaw may be caused by infection or cancer. Lumps in the muscles of the neck are caused by injury or spasm of the neck muscles (\ntorticollis\n). These lumps are often at the front of the neck. Lumps in the skin or just below the skin are often caused by\ncysts\n, such as\nsebaceous cysts\n.\nThe thyroid gland may also produce swelling or one or more lumps. This can be due to thyroid disease or\ncancer\n. Most cancers of the thyroid gland grow very slowly. They are often cured with surgery, even if they have been present for several years.\nAll neck lumps in children and adults should be checked right away by a health care provider. In children, most neck lumps are caused by infections that can be treated."}
