Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMeatal stenosis\nMeatal stenosis\nMeatal stenosis is a narrowing of the opening of the urethra, the tube through which urine leaves the body.\nCauses\nMeatal stenosis can affect both males and females. It is more common in males.\nIn males, it is often caused by swelling and irritation (inflammation). In most cases, this problem occurs in newborns after\ncircumcision\n. Abnormal scar tissue can grow across the opening of the urethra, causing it to narrow. The problem may not be detected until the child is toilet trained.\nIn adult men, the condition can result from surgery on the urethra, ongoing use of an\nindwelling catheter\n, or a procedure to treat an\nenlarged prostate gland\n(BPH).\nIn females, this condition is most often present at birth (congenital)."}

The narrowing may also be found during a physical exam or when a health care provider tries to place a\nFoley catheter\n.\nOther tests may include:\nKidney and bladder\nultrasound\nUrine analysis\nUrine culture\nTreatment\nIn females, meatal stenosis is most often treated in the provider's office. This is done using local anesthesia to numb the area."}

This is done using local anesthesia to numb the area. Then the opening of the urethra is widened (dilated) with special instruments.\nIn boys, a minor outpatient surgery called meatoplasty is the treatment of choice. Dilation of the meatus may also be appropriate in some cases.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people will urinate normally after treatment.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nAbnormal urine stream\nBlood in the urine\nFrequent urination\nPainful urination\nUrinary incontinence\nUrinary tract infections\nDamage to bladder or kidney function in severe cases\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your child has symptoms of this disorder.\nPrevention\nIf your baby boy has recently been circumcised, try to keep the diaper clean and dry. Avoid exposing the newly circumcised penis to any irritants. They may cause inflammation and narrowing of the opening.\nAlternative Names\nUrethral meatal stenosis\nImages\nFemale urinary tract\nMale urinary tract\nMeatal stenosis\nReferences\nChaudhry R, Cannon GM."}
