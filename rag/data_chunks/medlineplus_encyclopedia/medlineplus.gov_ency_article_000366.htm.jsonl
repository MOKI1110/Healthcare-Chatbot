This means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene that can cause galactosemia, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of being affected with it. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance.\nThere are 3 forms of the disease:\nGalactose-1 phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT) deficiency: Classic galactosemia, the most common and most severe form\nDeficiency of galactose kinase (GALK)\nDeficiency of galactose-6-phosphate epimerase (GALE)\nPeople with galactosemia are unable to fully break down the simple sugar galactose. Galactose makes up one half of lactose, the sugar found in milk.\nIf an infant with galactosemia is given milk, substances made from galactose build up in the infant's system. These substances damage the liver, brain, kidneys, and eyes.\nPeople with galactosemia cannot tolerate any form of milk (human or animal)."}

These substances damage the liver, brain, kidneys, and eyes.\nPeople with galactosemia cannot tolerate any form of milk (human or animal). They must be careful about eating other foods containing galactose.\nSymptoms\nInfants with galactosemia may show symptoms in the first few days of life if they eat formula or breast milk that contains lactose. They may develop a serious blood infection with the bacteria\nE coli\n.\nSymptoms of galactosemia are:\nConvulsions\nIrritability\nLethargy\nPoor feeding -- baby refuses to eat formula containing milk\nPoor weight gain\nYellow skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\nVomiting\nExams and Tests\nTests to check for galactosemia include:\nEnzyme\nactivity in the red blood cells\nKetones in the urine\nPrenatal diagnosis by directly measuring the enzyme\ngalactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase\n\"Reducing substances\" in the infant's urine, and normal or\nlow blood sugar\nwhile the infant is being fed breast milk or a formula containing lactose\nGenetic testing for the gene that causes this disorder\nIn many states, newborn screening tests check for galactosemia.\nTest results may show:\nAmino acids in the urine"}

Read product labels to make sure you or your child with the condition are not eating foods that contain galactose.\nInfants can be fed:\nSoy formula\nAnother lactose-free formula\nMeat-based formula or a\nprotein\nhydrolysate formula\nCalcium supplements are recommended.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with galactosemia and their families can be found at:\nGalactosemia Foundation --\nwww.galactosemia.org\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPeople who are diagnosed early and strictly avoid milk products and other foods that contain lactose can live a relatively normal life."}

Once the diagnosis of galactosemia is made, genetic counseling is recommended for other members of the family.\nMany states screen all newborns for galactosemia. If the newborn test shows possible galactosemia, they should contact the child's provider right away for advice about giving their infant milk products. They should also ask the provider about having blood tests that can be done to confirm a diagnosis of galactosemia.\nAlternative Names\nGalactose-1-phosphate uridyl transferase deficiency; Galactokinase deficiency; Galactose-6-phosphate epimerase deficiency; GALT; GALK; GALE; Epimerase deficiency galactosemia; GALE deficiency; Galactosemia type III; UDP-galactose-4; Duarte variant\nImages\nGalactosemia\nReferences\nBerry GT.
