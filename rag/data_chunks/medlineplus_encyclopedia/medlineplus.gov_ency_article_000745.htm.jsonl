Chronic tics may be forms of Tourette syndrome. Tics usually start at age 5 or 6 and get worse until age 12. They often improve during adulthood.\nSymptoms\nA tic is a sudden, fast, repeated movement or sound that has no reason or goal. Tics can involve:\nExcessive blinking\nGrimaces of the face\nQuick movements of the arms, legs, or other areas\nSounds (grunts, throat clearing, contractions of the abdomen or diaphragm)\nSome people have many kinds of tics.\nPeople with the condition can hold off these symptoms for a short time. But they feel relief when they carry out these movements. They often describe the tics as a response to an inner urge."}

But they feel relief when they carry out these movements. They often describe the tics as a response to an inner urge. Some say they have abnormal sensations in the area of the tic before it occurs.\nTics may continue during all stages of sleep, though may be less frequent. They may get worse with:\nExcitement\nFatigue\nHeat\nStress\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can usually diagnose a tic during a physical examination. Tests are generally not needed.\nPeople are diagnosed with the disorder when:\nThey have had the tics for more than a year\nThere is no other medical problem or substance use causing the symptoms\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on how severe the tics are and how the condition affects you. Medicines and talk therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy) are used when the tics greatly affect daily activities, such as school and job performance.\nMedicines can help control or reduce tics. But they have side effects, such as movement and thinking problems.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nChildren who develop this disorder between ages 6 and 8 often do very well."}

Symptoms may last 4 to 6 years, and then stop in the early teens without treatment.\nWhen the disorder begins in older children and continues into the 20s, it may become a lifelong condition.\nPossible Complications\nThere are usually no complications.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nThere is usually no need to see your provider for a tic unless it is severe or disrupts daily life.\nIf you cannot tell whether you or your child's movements are a tic or something more serious (such as a\nseizure\n), contact your provider.\nAlternative Names\nChronic vocal tic disorder; Tic - chronic motor tic disorder; Persistent (chronic) motor or vocal tic disorder; Chronic motor tic disorder\nImages\nCentral nervous system and peripheral nervous system\nBrain\nBrain and nervous system\nBrain structures\nReferences\nKim JW, Walter HJ, DeMaso DR.
