Some primary spinal tumors occur with certain inherited gene mutations.\nSpinal tumors can be located:\nInside the spinal cord (intramedullary)\nIn the membranes (meninges) covering the spinal cord (extramedullary - intradural)\nBetween the meninges and bones of the spine (extradural)\nIn the spine bones (vertebrae)\nAs it grows, the tumor can affect the:\nBlood vessels\nBones of the spine\nMeninges\nNerve roots\nSpinal cord cells\nThe tumor may press on the spinal cord or nerve roots, causing damage. With time, the damage may become permanent.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms depend on the location, type of tumor, and your general health.

The more quickly symptoms develop, the sooner treatment is needed to prevent permanent injury. Any new or unexplained back pain in a person with cancer should be promptly and thoroughly investigated.\nTreatments may include:\nCorticosteroids (dexamethasone) may be given to reduce inflammation and swelling around the spinal cord.\nEmergency surgery may be needed to relieve compression on the spinal cord."}
