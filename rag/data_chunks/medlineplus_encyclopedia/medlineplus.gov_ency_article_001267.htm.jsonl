Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nUreteropelvic junction obstruction\nUreteropelvic junction obstruction\nUreteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction is a blockage at the point where part of the kidney attaches to one of the tubes to the bladder (ureters). This blocks the flow of urine out of the kidney.\nCauses\nUPJ obstruction mostly occurs in children. It often happens when a baby is still growing in the womb. This is called a congenital condition (present from birth).\nThe blockage is caused when there is:\nA narrowing of area between the ureter and the part of the kidney called the renal pelvis\nAn abnormal blood vessel crossing over the ureter\nAs a result, urine builds up and damages the kidney.\nIn older children and adults, the problem may be due to scar tissue, infection, earlier treatments for a blockage, or kidney stones.\nUPJ obstruction is the most common cause of urinary blockages in children. It is now commonly found before birth with ultrasound tests. In some cases, the condition may not show up until after birth."}

It is now commonly found before birth with ultrasound tests. In some cases, the condition may not show up until after birth. Surgery may be needed early in life if the problem is severe. Most of the time, surgery is not needed until later. Some cases do not require surgery at all.\nSymptoms\nThere may not be any symptoms. When symptoms occur, they may include:\nBack or\nflank pain\nespecially when consuming diuretics such as alcohol or caffeine\nBloody urine\n(hematuria)\nLump in the abdomen (abdominal mass)\nKidney infection\nPoor growth in infants (failure to thrive)\nUrinary tract infection\n, usually with fever\nVomiting\nExams and Tests\nAn ultrasound during pregnancy may show kidney problems in the unborn baby.\nTests after birth may include:\nBUN\nand serum creatinine\nCreatinine clearance\nCT scan\nElectrolytes\nIntravenous pyelogram (\nIVP\n) -- less commonly used\nCT urogram -- scan of both kidneys and ureters with IV contrast\nNuclear scan of kidneys\nVoiding cystourethrogram\nUltrasound\nTreatment\nSurgery to correct the blockage allows urine to flow normally."}

Most of the time, open (invasive) surgery is performed in infants. Adults may be treated with less-invasive procedures. These procedures involve much smaller surgical cuts than open surgery, and may include:\nEndoscopic (retrograde) technique which does not require a surgical cut on the skin. Instead, a small instrument is placed into the urethra and bladder and into the affected ureter. This allows the surgeon to open the blockage from the inside.\nPercutaneous (antegrade) technique involves a small surgical cut on the side of the body between the ribs and the hip.\nPyeloplasty removes scar tissue from the blocked area and reconnects the healthy part of the kidney to the healthy ureter.\nLaparoscopy\nhas also been used to treat UPJ obstruction in children and adults who have not had success with other procedures.\nA tube called a\nstent\nmay be placed to drain urine from the kidney until the surgery heals."}

A nephrostomy tube, which is placed in the side of the body to drain urine, may also be needed for a short time after the surgery. This type of tube may also be used to treat a bad infection before surgery.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nDetecting and treating the problem early can help prevent future kidney damage. UPJ obstruction diagnosed before birth or early after birth may actually improve on its own.\nMost children do well and have no long-term problems. Serious damage may occur in people who are diagnosed later in life.\nLong-term outcomes are good with current treatments."}
