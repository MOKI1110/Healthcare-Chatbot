It often depends on the observer. Behavior that seems excessive to  one person may not seem excessive to another. But certain children, when compared to others, are clearly far more active. This can become a problem if it interferes with school work or making friends.\nHyperactivity is often considered more of a problem for schools and parents than it is for the child. But many hyperactive children are unhappy, or even depressed. Hyperactive behavior may make a child a target for bullying, or make it harder to connect with other children."}

Examples of questions include whether the behavior is new, if your child has always been very active, and whether the behavior is getting worse.\nYour provider may recommend a psychological evaluation. There may also be a review of the home and school environments.\nAlternative Names\nActivity - increased; Hyperkinetic behavior\nImages\nCentral nervous system and peripheral nervous system\nReferences\nCastillo JMV.
