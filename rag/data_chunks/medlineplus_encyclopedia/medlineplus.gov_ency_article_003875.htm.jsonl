It is sometimes combined with coronary angiography.\nHow the Test is Performed\nBefore the test, you will be given medicine to help you relax. You will be awake and able to follow instructions during the test.\nAn\nintravenous\nline is placed in your arm. A cardiologist cleans and numbs an area on your arm or groin. Then the doctor makes a small cut in the area, and inserts a thin flexible tube (catheter) into an artery. Using x-rays as a guide, they carefully move the thin tube (catheter) into your heart.\nWhen the tube is in place, dye is injected through it. The dye flows through the blood vessels, making them easier to see.\nX-rays\nare taken as the dye moves through the blood vessels."}

The dye flows through the blood vessels, making them easier to see.\nX-rays\nare taken as the dye moves through the blood vessels. These x-ray pictures create a \"movie\" of the left ventricle as it contracts rhythmically.\nThe procedure will usually last less than one hour, but may take be considerably longer, especially if combined with other procedures.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will be told not to eat or drink for 6 to 8 hours before the test. The procedure takes place in the hospital or a specialized procedure unit. Some people may need to stay in the hospital the night before the test.\nYour cardiologist will explain the procedure and its risks. You must sign a consent form for the procedure.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will feel a sting and burn when the local anesthetic is injected. You may feel pressure when the catheter is inserted."}

You must sign a consent form for the procedure.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will feel a sting and burn when the local anesthetic is injected. You may feel pressure when the catheter is inserted. Occasionally, a flushing sensation or a feeling that you need to urinate occurs when the dye is injected.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nLeft heart angiography is performed to assess the blood flow through the left side of the heart.\nNormal Results\nA normal result shows normal blood flow through the left side of the heart. Blood volumes and pressures are also normal.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be due to:\nA hole in the heart (\nventricular septal defect\n) or other abnormal connections (congenital heart disease)\nAbnormalities of the left heart valves\nAn\naneurysm\nof the heart wall\nAreas of the heart that are not contracting normally\nBlood flow problems on the left side of the heart\nHeart-related blockages\nWeakened pumping function of the left ventricle\nCoronary angiography\nmay be needed when blockage of the coronary arteries or other coronary abnormalities is suspected.\nRisks\nRisks associated with this procedure include:\nAbnormal heartbeats (\narrhythmias\n)\nAllergic reaction"}
