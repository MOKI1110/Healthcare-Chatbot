Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRh incompatibility\nRh incompatibility\nRh incompatibility is a condition that develops when a pregnant woman has Rh-negative blood and the baby in her womb has Rh-positive blood.\nCauses\nDuring pregnancy, red blood cells from the unborn baby can cross into the mother's blood through the placenta.\nIf the mother is Rh-negative, her immune system treats Rh-positive fetal cells as if they were a foreign substance. The mother's body makes\nantibodies\nagainst the fetal blood cells. These antibodies may cross back through the placenta into the developing baby. They destroy the baby's circulating red blood cells.\nWhen red blood cells are broken down, they make\nbilirubin\n. This causes an infant to become yellow (\njaundiced\n). The level of bilirubin in the infant's blood may range from mild to dangerously high.\nFirstborn infants are often not affected unless the mother had past miscarriages or abortions. This would sensitize her immune system. This is because it takes time for the mother to develop antibodies."}

This would sensitize her immune system. This is because it takes time for the mother to develop antibodies. All children she has later who are also Rh-positive may be affected.\nRh incompatibility develops only when the mother is Rh-negative and the infant is Rh-positive. This problem has become less common in places that provide good prenatal care. This is because special immune globulins called RhoGAM are routinely used.\nSymptoms\nRh incompatibility can cause symptoms ranging from very mild to deadly. In its mildest form, Rh incompatibility causes the destruction of red blood cells. There are no other effects.\nAfter birth, the infant may have:\nYellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes\nLow muscle tone\n(hypotonia) and lethargy\nExams and Tests\nBefore delivery, the mother may have more amniotic fluid around her unborn baby (\npolyhydramnios\n).\nThere may be:\nA positive direct\nCoombs test\nresult\nHigher-than-normal levels of bilirubin in the baby's umbilical cord blood\nSigns of red blood cell destruction in the infant's blood\nTreatment\nRh incompatibility can be prevented with the use of RhoGAM."}

Therefore, prevention remains the best treatment. Treatment of an infant who is already affected depends on the severity of the condition.\nInfants with mild Rh incompatibility may be treated with phototherapy using\nbilirubin lights\n.\nIntravenous\n(IV) immune globulin may also be used. For infants severely affected, an exchange transfusion of blood may be needed. This is to decrease the levels of bilirubin in the blood.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nFull recovery is expected for mild Rh incompatibility.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nBrain damage due to high levels of bilirubin (\nkernicterus\n)\nFluid buildup and swelling in the baby (\nhydrops fetalis\n)\nProblems with mental function, movement, hearing, speech, and\nseizures\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you think or know you are pregnant and have not yet seen a provider.\nPrevention\nRh incompatibility is almost completely preventable."}
