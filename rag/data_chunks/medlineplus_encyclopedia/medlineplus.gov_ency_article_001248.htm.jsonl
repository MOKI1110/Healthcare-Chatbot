It leads to problems  with the bones of the hands, feet, and nose, and intellectual disability.\nCauses\nMost people with acrodysostosis have no family history of the disease. However, sometimes the condition is passed down from parent to child. Parents with the condition have a 1 in 2 chance of passing it to their children.\nThere is a slightly greater risk for children with fathers who are 45 and older at the time of conception.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of this disorder include:\nFrequent middle\near infections\nGrowth problems, short arms and legs\nHearing problems\nIntellectual disability\nThe body doesn't respond to certain hormones, even though hormone levels are normal\nDistinct facial features\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can usually diagnose this condition with a physical exam."}

This may show any of the following:\nAdvanced bone age\nBone deformities in hands and feet\nDelays in growth\nProblems with the skin, genitals, teeth, and skeleton\nShort arms and legs with small hands and feet\nShort head, measured front to back\nShort height\nSmall, upturned broad nose with flat bridge\nDistinct features of the face (short nose, open mouth, jaw that sticks out)\nUnusual head\nWide-spaced eyes, sometimes with extra skin fold at corner of eye\nIn the first months of life, x-rays may show spotty calcium deposits, called stippling, in bones (especially the nose). Infants may also have:\nAbnormally short fingers and toes\nEarly growth of bones in the hands and feet\nShort bones\nShortening of the forearm bones near the wrist\nTwo genes have been linked with this condition, and genetic testing may be done.\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the symptoms.\nHormones, such as growth hormone, may be given."}
