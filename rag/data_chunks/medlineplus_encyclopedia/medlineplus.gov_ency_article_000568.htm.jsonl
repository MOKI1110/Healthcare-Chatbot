The infection is spread by:\nBlood transfusions\nOrgan transplants\nRespiratory droplets\nSaliva\nSexual contact\nUrine\nTears\nMost people come into contact with CMV in their lifetime, often early in life. But usually, people with a weakened immune system, such as those with HIV/AIDS, become ill from CMV infection. Some otherwise healthy people with CMV infection develop mononucleosis-like symptoms.\nCMV is a type of herpes virus. Similar to all herpes viruses, CMV remains in your body for the rest of your life after infection. If your immune system becomes weakened in the future, this virus may have the chance to reactivate, causing symptoms.\nSymptoms\nMany people are exposed to CMV early in life, but do not realize it because they have no symptoms, or they have mild symptoms that resemble the common cold or flu."}

These may include:\nEnlarged lymph nodes\n, especially in the neck\nFever\nFatigue\nLoss of appetite\nMalaise\nMuscle aches\nRash\nSore throat\nCMV can cause infections in different parts of the body. Symptoms vary depending on the area that is affected. Examples of body areas that can be infected by CMV are:\nThe\nlungs\nThe\nstomach or intestine\nThe back of the eye (\nretina\n)\nA baby while still in the womb (\ncongenital CMV\n)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and feel your belly area. Your liver or spleen may be enlarged or tender when they are gently pressed (palpated). You may have a skin rash.\nSpecial lab tests such as a CMV DNA serum PCR test may be done to check for the presence of substances produced by CMV in your blood."}

Rest is needed, sometimes for a month or longer to regain full activity levels. Painkillers and warm salt-water gargles can help relieve symptoms.\nAntiviral medicines and antibody therapy are usually not used in people with healthy immune function, but may be used for people with an impaired immune system.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome is good with treatment. The symptoms may be relieved in a few weeks to months.\nPossible Complications\nThroat infection is the most common complication."}

This could be a sign of a ruptured spleen, which may require emergency surgery.\nPrevention\nCMV infection can be contagious if the infected person comes in close or intimate contact with another person."}
