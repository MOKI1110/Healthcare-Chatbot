Sunscreen poisoning occurs when someone swallows sunscreen. This can be by accident or on purpose.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\nPoisonous Ingredient\nOlder sunscreens used para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) to protect skin from the sun's rays. However, many of today's sunscreens are PABA-free. Sunscreens may contain any of these ingredients:\nCinnamates\nPadimate-O\nSalicylates (aspirin-like compounds)\nZinc oxide\nSunscreen may also contain other ingredients.\nSymptoms\nSunscreens are generally considered nonpoisonous (nontoxic). Most symptoms are caused by mild allergic reactions and skin and eye irritation."}
