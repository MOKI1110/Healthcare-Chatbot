It causes the tooth enamel to be thin and abnormally formed. Enamel is the outer layer of the visible crown portion of the teeth.\nCauses\nAmelogenesis imperfecta is passed down through families as a\ndominant trait\n.

Both baby teeth and permanent teeth can be affected.\nExams and Tests\nA dentist can identify and diagnose this condition.\nTreatment\nThe treatment depends on how severe the problem is. Full crowns may be necessary to improve the appearance of the teeth and protect them from further damage."}
