This problem can be caused by an infection with bacteria. However, this is not a common cause.\nAcute prostatitis starts quickly. Long-term (chronic) prostatitis lasts for 3 months or more.\nOngoing irritation of the prostate that is not caused by bacteria is called\nchronic nonbacterial prostatitis\n.\nCauses\nAny bacteria that can cause a\nurinary tract infection\ncan cause acute bacterial prostatitis.\nInfections spread through sexual contact can cause prostatitis. These include\nchlamydia\nand\ngonorrhea\n. Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are more likely to occur from:\nCertain sexual practices, such as having anal sex without wearing a condom\nHaving many sexual partners\nIn men over age 35 years,\nE coli\nand other common bacteria most often cause prostatitis."}
