Unlike traditional angiography that involves placing a tube (catheter) into the body, MRA is noninvasive.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou may be asked to wear a hospital gown. You can also wear clothing without metal fasteners (such as sweatpants and a t-shirt). Certain types of metal can cause blurry images.\nYou will lie on a narrow table, which slides into a large tunnel-shaped scanner.\nSome exams require a special dye (contrast). Most often, the dye is given before the test through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. The dye helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly.\nDuring the MRI, the person who operates the machine will watch you from another room. The test may take 1 hour or more.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan.\nTell your health care provider if you are afraid of close spaces (have claustrophobia)."}

You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious. Your provider may suggest an \"open\" MRI. In an open MRI, the machine is not as close to the body.\nBefore the test, tell your provider if you have:\nBrain aneurysm clips\nArtificial heart valve\nHeart defibrillator\nor pacemaker\nInner ear (cochlear) implants\nInsulin pump or chemotherapy port\nIntrauterine device (IUD)\nKidney disease or dialysis (you may not be able to receive contrast)\nNeurostimulator\nRecently placed artificial joints\nVascular\nstent\nWorked with sheet metal in the past (you may need tests to check for tiny metal pieces in your eyes)\nBecause the MRI contains strong magnets, metal objects are not allowed into the room with the MRI scanner. Avoid carrying items such as:\nPocketknives, pens, and eyeglasses\nWatches, credit cards, jewelry, and hearing aids\nHairpins, metal zippers, pins, and similar items\nRemovable dental implants\nHow the Test will Feel\nAn MRA exam causes no pain."}

If you have problems lying still or are very nervous, you may be given a medicine (sedative) to relax you. Moving too much can blur images and cause errors.\nThe table may be hard or cold, but you can ask for a blanket or pillow. The machine produces loud thumping and humming noises when turned on. You can wear ear plugs to help reduce the noise.\nAn intercom in the room allows you to speak to someone at any time. Some scanners have televisions and special headphones that you can use to help the time pass.\nThere is no recovery time, unless you were given a medicine to relax.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nMRA is used to look at the blood vessels in all parts of the body."}

The test may be done of the head, heart, abdomen, lungs, kidneys, and legs.\nIt may be used to diagnose or evaluate conditions such as:\nArterial aneurysm\n(an abnormal widening or ballooning of a part of an artery due to weakness in the wall of the blood vessel)\nAortic coarctation\nAortic dissection\nStroke\nCarotid artery disease\nAtherosclerosis\nof the arms or legs\nHeart disease, including congenital heart disease\nMesenteric artery ischemia\nRenal artery stenosis (narrowing of the blood vessels in the kidneys)\nNormal Results\nA normal result means the blood vessels do not show any signs of narrowing or blockage.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result suggests a problem with one or more blood vessels. This may suggest:\nAtherosclerosis\nTrauma\nCongenital disease\nOther vascular condition\nRisks\nMRA is generally safe. It uses no radiation.

Allergic reactions to the substance rarely occur. However, gadolinium can be harmful to people with kidney problems who require dialysis. If you have kidney problems, please tell your provider before the test.\nThe strong magnetic fields created during an MRI can cause heart pacemakers and other implants to not work as well. They can also cause a piece of metal inside your body to move or shift.\nAlternative Names\nMRA; Angiography - magnetic resonance\nImages\nMRI scans\nReferences\nCarpenter JP, Litt H, Gowda M.
