Infection in humans most often involves the skin, gastrointestinal tract, or lungs.\nCauses\nAnthrax commonly affects hoofed animals such as sheep, cattle, and goats. Humans who come into contact with infected animals can get sick with anthrax as well.\nThere are  three main routes of anthrax infection: skin (cutaneous), lung (inhalation), and mouth (gastrointestinal).\nCutaneous anthrax occurs when anthrax spores enter the body through a cut or scrape on the skin.\nIt is the most common type of anthrax infection.\nThe main risk is contact with animal hides or hair, bone products, and wool, or with infected animals. People most at risk for cutaneous anthrax include farm workers, veterinarians, tanners, and wool workers.\nInhalation anthrax develops when anthrax\nspores\nenter the lungs through the airways."}

People most at risk for cutaneous anthrax include farm workers, veterinarians, tanners, and wool workers.\nInhalation anthrax develops when anthrax\nspores\nenter the lungs through the airways. It is most commonly contracted when workers breathe in airborne anthrax spores during processes such as tanning hides and processing wool.\nBreathing in spores means a person has been exposed to anthrax. But it does not mean the person will have symptoms.\nThe bacterial spores must germinate or sprout (the same way a seed sprouts before a plant grows) before the actual disease occurs. This process usually takes 1 to 6 days.\nOnce the spores germinate, they release several toxic substances. These substances cause internal bleeding, swelling, and tissue death.\nGastrointestinal anthrax occurs when someone eats anthrax-tainted meat.\nInjection anthrax can occur in someone who self-injects drugs (heroin).\nAnthrax may be used as a biological weapon or for bioterrorism.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of anthrax differ, depending on the type of anthrax.\nSymptoms of cutaneous anthrax start 1 to 7 days after exposure:\nAn itchy sore develops that is similar to an insect bite."}

This sore may blister and form a black ulcer (sore or eschar).\nThe sore is usually painless, but it is often surrounded by swelling.\nA scab often forms, and then dries and falls off within 2 weeks. Complete healing can take longer.\nSymptoms of inhalation anthrax:\nBegins with fever,\nmalaise\n, headache, cough, shortness of breath, and chest pain\nFever and shock may occur later\nSymptoms of gastrointestinal anthrax usually occur within 1 week and may include:\nAbdominal pain\nBloody diarrhea\nDiarrhea\nFever\nMouth sores\nNausea and vomiting (the vomit may contain blood)\nSymptoms of injection anthrax are similar to those of cutaneous anthrax. In addition, the skin or muscle beneath the injection site may get infected.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical examination.\nThe tests to diagnose anthrax depend on the type of disease that is suspected.\nA culture of the skin, and sometimes a\nbiopsy\n, are done on the skin sores."}

Antibiotics that may be prescribed include penicillin, doxycycline, and ciprofloxacin.\nInhalation anthrax is treated with a combination of antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin plus another medicine. They are given by IV (intravenously). Antibiotics are usually taken for 60 days because it can take spores that long to germinate.\nCutaneous anthrax is treated with antibiotics taken by mouth, usually for 7 to 10 days. Doxycycline and ciprofloxacin are most often used.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWhen treated with antibiotics, cutaneous anthrax is likely to get better."}

Many cases in the second stage are fatal.\nGastrointestinal anthrax infection can spread to the bloodstream and may result in death.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you think you have been exposed to anthrax or if you develop symptoms of any type of anthrax.\nPrevention\nThere are two main ways to prevent anthrax:\nFor people who have been exposed to anthrax (but have no symptoms of the disease), providers may prescribe preventive antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin, penicillin, or doxycycline, depending on the strain of anthrax.\nAn anthrax vaccine is available to military personnel and some members of the general public.
