Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAnti-smooth muscle antibody\nAnti-smooth muscle antibody\nAnti-smooth muscle antibody is a blood test that detects the presence of\nantibodies\nagainst smooth muscle. The antibody is useful in making a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. This may be taken through a vein. The procedure is called a\nvenipuncture\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special steps are needed to prepare for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others may feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou may need this test if you have signs of certain liver diseases, such as\nhepatitis\nand\ncirrhosis\n. These conditions can trigger the body to form antibodies against smooth muscle.\nAnti-smooth muscle antibodies are not often seen in diseases other than\nautoimmune hepatitis\n. Therefore, it is helpful to make the diagnosis. Autoimmune hepatitis is treated with immunosuppressive medicines."}

Therefore, it is helpful to make the diagnosis. Autoimmune hepatitis is treated with immunosuppressive medicines. People with autoimmune hepatitis often have other autoantibodies. These include:\nAntinuclear antibodies.\nAnti-actin antibodies.\nAnti-soluble liver antigen/liver pancreas (anti-SLA/LP) antibodies.\nOther antibodies may be present, even when the anti-smooth muscle antibodies are absent.\nThe diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis may require a liver biopsy.\nNormal Results\nNormally, there are no antibodies present.\nNote: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}
