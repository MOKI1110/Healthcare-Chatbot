It can also occur in skin that has been injured or inflamed. Most squamous cell cancers occur on skin that is regularly exposed to sunlight or other ultraviolet radiation.\nThe earliest form of squamous cell cancer is called Bowen disease (or squamous cell carcinoma in situ). This type does not spread to nearby tissues, because it is still in the outermost layer of the skin.\nActinic keratosis\nis a precancerous skin lesion that may become a squamous cell cancer."}

This type does not spread to nearby tissues, because it is still in the outermost layer of the skin.\nActinic keratosis\nis a precancerous skin lesion that may become a squamous cell cancer. (A lesion is a problem area of the skin.)\nA keratoacanthoma is a mild type of squamous cell cancer that grows rapidly.\nRisks of squamous cell cancer include:\nHaving light-colored skin, blue or green eyes, or blond or red hair.\nLong-term, daily sun exposure (such as in people who work outside).\nMany severe sunburns early in life.\nOlder age.\nHaving had many x-rays.\nChemical exposure, such as arsenic.\nA weakened immune system, especially in people who have had an organ transplant.\nSymptoms\nSquamous cell cancer usually occurs on the face, ears, neck, hands, or arms. It may occur in other areas.\nThe main symptom is a growing bump that may have a rough, scaly surface and flat reddish patches.\nThe earliest form (squamous cell carcinoma in situ) can appear as a scaly, crusted, and large reddish patch that can be larger than 1 inch (2.5 centimeters).\nA sore that does not heal can be a sign of squamous cell cancer."}

Any change in an existing\nwart\n,\nmole\n, or other skin lesion could be a sign of skin cancer.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will check your skin and look at the size, shape, color, and texture of any suspicious areas.\nIf your provider thinks you might have skin cancer, a piece of skin will be removed. This is called a\nskin biopsy\n. The sample is sent to a lab for examination under a microscope.\nA skin biopsy must be done to confirm squamous cell skin cancer or other skin cancers.\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the size and location of the skin cancer, how far it has spread, and your overall health. Some squamous cell skin cancers may be more difficult to treat.\nTreatment may involve:\nExcision: Cutting out the skin cancer and stitching the skin together.\nCurettage and electrodessication: Scraping away cancer cells and using electricity to kill any that remain."}

It is used to treat cancers that are not very large or deep.\nCryosurgery\n: Freezing the cancer cells, which kills them. This is used for small and superficial (not very deep) cancers.\nMedicines: Skin creams containing imiquimod or 5-fluorouracil for superficial squamous cell cancer.\nMohs surgery\n: Removing a layer of skin and looking at it immediately under a microscope, then removing layers of skin until there are no signs of the cancer, usually used for skin cancers on the nose, ears, and other areas of the face.\nPhotodynamic therapy\n: Treatment using light may be used to treat superficial cancers.\nRadiation therapy\n: may be used if squamous cell cancer has spread to organs or lymph nodes or if the cancer cannot be treated with surgery.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\ncancer support group\n."}

Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well a person does depends on many things, including how soon the cancer was diagnosed, the location, and whether or not you have a weakened immune system. Most of these cancers are cured when treated early.\nSome squamous cell cancers may return. There is also a risk that squamous cell skin cancer may spread to other parts of the body.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider for an appointment if you have a sore or spot on your skin that changes in:\nAppearance\nColor\nSize\nTexture\nAlso contact your provider if a spot becomes painful or swollen or if it starts to bleed or itch.\nPrevention\nExperts disagree about the value of routine skin examinations by your provider.

Always use sunscreen:\nApply sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30, even when you are going outdoors for a short time.\nApply a large amount of sunscreen on all exposed areas, including ears and feet.\nLook for sunscreen that blocks both UVA and UVB light.\nUse a water-resistant sunscreen.\nApply sunscreen at least 30 minutes before going out. Follow package instructions about how often to reapply. Be sure to reapply after swimming or sweating.\nUse sunscreen in winter and on cloudy days too.\nOther measures to help you avoid too much sun exposure:\nUltraviolet light is most intense between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. So try to avoid the sun during these hours.\nProtect your skin by wearing wide-brim hats, long-sleeve shirts, long skirts, or pants."}

Spending 15 to 20 minutes at a tanning salon is as dangerous as a day spent in the sun.\nAlternative Names\nCancer - skin - squamous cell; Skin cancer - squamous cell; Nonmelanoma skin cancer - squamous cell; NMSC - squamous cell; Squamous cell skin cancer; Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin\nImages\nSquamous cell cancer\nSun protection\nSun's effect on skin\nBowen's disease on the hand\nKeratoacanthoma\nKeratoacanthoma\nSkin cancer, squamous cell - close-up\nSkin cancer - squamous cell on the hands\nSquamous cell carcinoma - invasive\nCheilitis - actinic\nReferences\nAmerican Cancer Society website.
