Some people feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA CBC is a commonly performed lab test. It can be used to detect or monitor many different health conditions."}

Your health care provider may order this test:\nIf you are having symptoms, such as fatigue, weight loss, fever or other signs of an infection, weakness, bruising, bleeding, or any signs of cancer\nWhen you are receiving treatments (medicines or radiation) that may change your blood count results\nTo monitor a long-term (chronic) health problem that may change your blood count results, such as chronic kidney disease\nNormal Results\nBlood counts may vary with altitude. In general, normal results are:\nRBC count:\nMale: 4.6 to 6.2 million cells/mcL\nFemale: 4.2 to 5.4 million cells/mcL\nWBC count:\n4,500 to 11,000 cells/mcL\nHematocrit:\nMale: 40% to 55%\nFemale: 36% to 48%\nHemoglobin:\nMale: 13 to 18 gm/dL\nFemale: 12 to 16 gm/dL\nRed blood cell indices:\nMCV: 80 to 100 femtoliter\nMCH: 27 to 32 pg/cell\nMCHC: 32 to 36 gm/dL\nPlatelet count:\n150,000 to 400,000/dL\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}
