Why get vaccinated?\nPneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23)\ncan prevent\npneumococcal disease\n.\nPneumococcal disease\nrefers to any illness caused by pneumococcal bacteria. These bacteria can cause many types of illnesses, including:\nPneumonia (infection of the lungs)\nEar infections\nSinus infections\nMeningitis (infection of the tissue covering the brain and spinal cord)\nBacteremia (bloodstream infection)\nAnyone can get pneumococcal disease, but young children, older adults, and people with certain risk factors are at the highest risk.\nMost pneumococcal infections are mild."}

However, some can result in long-term problems, such as brain damage or hearing loss. Meningitis, bacteremia, and pneumonia caused by pneumococcal disease can lead to death.\n2. PPSV23\nPPSV23 helps protect against 23 types of bacteria that cause pneumococcal disease.\nPPSV23 is recommended as an option for some children and adolescents with certain medical conditions or risk factors.\nFor adults, PPSV23 is recommended following a dose of 15-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV15).\nYour health care provider can give you more information.\n3. Talk with your health care provider\nTell your vaccine provider if the person getting the vaccine:\nHas had an\nallergic reaction after a previous dose of PPSV23,\nor has any\nsevere, life-threatening allergies.\nIn some cases, your provider may decide to postpone PPSV23 vaccination to a future visit.\nPeople with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated."}

Risks of a vaccine reaction\nRedness, swelling, pain, or tenderness where the shot is given; tiredness; headache; fever; chills; or muscle aches can happen after PPSV23.\nPeople sometimes faint after medical procedures, including vaccination.
