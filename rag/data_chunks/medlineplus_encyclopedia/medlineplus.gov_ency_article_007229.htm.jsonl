Calcium also helps the heart, nerves, muscles, and other body systems work well.\nA low blood calcium level is called hypocalcemia. This article discusses low blood calcium level in infants. Hypocalcemia can occur at any age.\nCauses\nA healthy baby most often has very careful control of the blood calcium level by normal bodily systems.\nA low calcium level in the blood is more likely to occur in newborns, more commonly in those who were born too early (preemies). Common causes of hypocalcemia in a newborn include:\nCertain medicines\nDiabetes in the birth mother\nEpisodes of very low oxygen levels\nInfection\nStress caused by serious illness\nThere are also some rare illnesses that can lead to low blood calcium level. These include:\nDiGeorge syndrome, a genetic disorder.\nThe parathyroid glands help control calcium use and removal by the body."}

Rarely, a child is born with underactive parathyroid glands.\nSymptoms\nBabies with hypocalcemia often have no symptoms. Sometimes, babies with low blood calcium levels are jittery or have tremors or twitching. Rarely, they have\nseizures\n.\nThese babies may also have a slow heart rate and low blood pressure.\nExams and Tests\nThe diagnosis is most often made when a blood test shows that the infant's blood calcium level is low.\nTreatment\nThe baby may get extra calcium, if needed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nProblems with a low blood calcium level in newborns or premature infants most often do not continue for a long term.\nAlternative Names\nHypocalcemia - infants\nImages\nHypocalcemia\nReferences\nDoyle DA.
