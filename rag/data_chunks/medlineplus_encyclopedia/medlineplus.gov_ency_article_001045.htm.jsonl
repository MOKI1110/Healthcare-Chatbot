Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAge-related hearing loss\nAge-related hearing loss\nAge-related hearing loss, or presbycusis, is the slow loss of hearing that occurs as people get older.\nCauses\nTiny hair cells inside your inner ear help you hear. They pick up sound waves and change them into the nerve signals that your brain interprets as sound. Hearing loss occurs when the tiny hair cells are damaged or die. The hair cells do not regrow, so hearing loss caused by hair cell damage is permanent.\nThere is no known single cause of age-related hearing loss. Most commonly, it is caused by changes in the inner ear that occur as you grow older."}

This helps find if a medical problem is causing your hearing loss. Your provider will use an instrument called an otoscope to look in your ears. Sometimes, ear wax can block the ear canals and cause hearing loss.\nYou may be sent to an ear, nose, and throat doctor and a hearing specialist (audiologist).\nHearing tests\ncan help determine the extent and type of hearing loss.\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for age-related hearing loss. Treatment is focused on\nimproving your everyday function\n. The following may be helpful:\nHearing aids\nTelephone amplifiers and other assistive devices\nSign language (for those with severe hearing loss)\nSpeech reading\n(lip reading and using visual cues to aid communication)\ncochlear implant\nmay be recommended for people with severe hearing loss. Surgery is done to place the implant."}

The hearing loss cannot be reversed and may lead to deafness.\nHearing loss may cause you to avoid leaving home. Seek help from your provider and family and friends to avoid becoming isolated. Hearing loss can be\nmanaged\nso that you can continue to live a full and active life.\nPossible Complications\nHearing loss can result in both physical (for example not hearing a fire alarm) and psychological (such as social isolation) problems.\nThe hearing loss may lead to\ndeafness\n.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nHearing loss should be checked as soon as possible.
