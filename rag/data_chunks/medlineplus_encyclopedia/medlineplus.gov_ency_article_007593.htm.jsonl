Ureters are the tubes that connect the kidneys to the bladder. This procedure can help diagnose and treat problems in the urinary tract, such as kidney stones.\nDescription\nUreteroscopy is performed with a ureteroscope. This is a small tube (rigid or flexible) with a tiny light and camera on the end.\nThe procedure usually takes 1 hour.\nYou are given\ngeneral anesthesia\n. This is medicine that allows you to sleep.\nYour groin and urethra are cleaned. The scope is then inserted through the urethra, into the bladder, and then up into the ureter.\nThe next steps are described below.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nDuring the procedure, your surgeon (urologist) may:\nUse small instruments that are sent through the scope to grab and remove\nkidney stones\nor break them up using a laser.\nPlace a stent in the ureter to allow urine and small pieces of kidney stone to pass through. If you have a stent, you will need to return to have it removed in 1 or 2 weeks."}
