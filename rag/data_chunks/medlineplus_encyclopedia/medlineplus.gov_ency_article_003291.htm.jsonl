It occurs from damage to the inner ear, the place of origin of the nerve that runs from the ear to the brain (auditory nerve), or damage to the brain itself.\nConsiderations\nSymptoms may include:\nSome sounds seem overly loud in one ear.\nYou have problems following conversations when two or more people are talking.\nYou have problems hearing in noisy areas.\nIt is easier to hear men's voices than women's voices.\nIt is hard to tell high-pitched sounds (such as \"s\" or \"th\") from one another.\nOther people's voices sound mumbled or slurred.\nYou have problems hearing when there is background noise.\nAssociated symptoms may include:\nFeeling of being off-balance or dizzy (more common with\nMeniere disease\nand\nacoustic neuromas\n)\nRinging or buzzing sound in the ears (\ntinnitus\n)\nCauses\nThe inner part of the ear contains tiny hair cells (nerve endings), that change sounds into electric signals."}

The nerves then carry these signals to the brain.\nSensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is caused by damage to these special cells, or to the nerve fibers in the inner ear. Sometimes, the hearing loss is caused by damage to the nerve that carries the signals to the brain.\nSensorineural deafness that is present at birth (congenital) is most often due to:\nGenetic syndromes\nInfections that the mother passes to her baby in the womb (\ntoxoplasmosis\n,\nrubella\n,\nherpes\n)\nSNHL may develop in children or adults later in life (acquired) as a result of:\nAge-related hearing loss\nDisease of the blood vessels\nImmune disease\nInfections, such as\nmeningitis\n,\nmumps\n,\nscarlet fever\n, and\nmeasles\nInjury of the ear or head\nLoud noises or sounds, or\nloud sounds that last for a long time\nMeniere disease\nTumor, such as\nacoustic neuroma\nUse of certain medicines\nWorking around loud noises every day\nIn some cases, the cause is unknown.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nThe goal of treatment is to improve your hea"}

The following may be helpful:\nHearing aids\nTelephone amplifiers and other assistive devices\nSafety and alert systems for your home\nSign language (for those with severe hearing loss)\nSpeech reading (such as lip reading and using visual cues to aid communication)\ncochlear implant\nmay be recommended for certain people with severe hearing loss. Surgery is done to place the implant. The implant makes sounds seem louder, but does not restore normal hearing.\nYou will also learn strategies for\nliving with hearing loss\nand advice to share with those around you for\ntalking to someone with hearing loss\n.\nAlternative Names\nNerve deafness; Hearing loss - sensorineural; Acquired hearing loss; SNHL; Noise-induced hearing loss; NIHL; Presbycusis\nImages\nEar anatomy\nReferences\nArts HA, Adams ME.
