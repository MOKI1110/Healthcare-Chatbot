Before surgery you will receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n. You will be asleep and pain-free.\nTotal laryngectomy removes the whole larynx. Part of your pharynx may be taken out as well. Your pharynx is the mucous membrane-lined passage between your nasal passages and esophagus.\nThe surgeon will make a cut in your neck to open up the area. Care is taken to preserve major blood vessels and other important structures.\nThe larynx and tissue around it will be removed. The lymph nodes may also be removed.\nThe surgeon will then make an opening in your trachea and a hole in front of your neck. Your trachea will be attached to this hole. The hole is called a stoma. After surgery you will breathe through your stoma. It will never be removed.\nYour esophagus, muscles, and skin will be closed with stitches or clips."}

The hole is called a stoma. After surgery you will breathe through your stoma. It will never be removed.\nYour esophagus, muscles, and skin will be closed with stitches or clips. You may have tubes coming from your wound for a while after surgery.\nThe surgeon may also do a tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP).\nA TEP is a small hole in your windpipe (trachea) and the tube that moves food from your throat to your stomach (esophagus).\nYour surgeon will place a small man-made part (prosthesis) into this opening. The prosthesis will allow you to speak after your voice box has been removed.\nThere are many less invasive surgeries to remove part of the larynx.\nThe names of some of these procedures are endoscopic (or transoral resection), vertical partial laryngectomy, horizontal or supraglottic partial laryngectomy, and supracricoid partial laryngectomy.\nThese procedures may work for some people. The surgery you have depends on how much your cancer has spread and what type of cancer you have.\nThe surgery can take 5 to 9 hours.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nMost often, laryngectomy is done to treat\ncancer of the larynx\n."}

This is called radiation necrosis.\nRisks\nRisks for any surgery are:\nAllergic reactions to medicines\nBreathing problems\nHeart problems\nBleeding\nInfection\nRisks for this surgery are:\nHematoma (a buildup of blood outside the blood vessels)\nWound infection\nFistulas\n(tissue connections that form between the pharynx and the skin that are not normally there)\nThe stoma opening may become too small or tight. This is called stomal stenosis.\nLeaking around the TEP and prosthesis\nDamage to other areas of the esophagus or trachea\nProblems swallowing and eating\nProblems speaking\nBefore the Procedure\nYou will have medical visits and tests before you have surgery.

An oxygen mask will be on your stoma. It's important to keep your head raised, rest a lot, and move your legs from time to time to improve blood flow.

However, it is more common to wait 5 to 7 days after your surgery to start eating through your mouth. You may have a swallow study, in which an x-ray is taken while you drink contrast material. This is done to make sure there is no leakage prior to starting to eat.\nYour surgical drain may be removed in 2 to 3 days. You will be taught how to care for your laryngectomy tube and stoma. You will learn how to safely shower. You must be careful not to let water enter through your stoma.\nSpeech rehabilitation with a speech therapist will help you relearn how to speak.\nYou will need to avoid heavy lifting or strenuous activity for about 6 weeks. You may slowly resume your normal, light activities.\nFollow up with your provider as you are told.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nYour wounds will take about 2 to 3 weeks to heal."}

You can expect full recovery in about a month. Many times, removal of the larynx will take out all the cancer or injured material. People learn how to change their lifestyle and live without their voice box. You may need other treatments, such as radiotherapy or chemotherapy. About 2 weeks after the procedure, you will most likely be able to return to an oral diet. You also may start working with a speech therapist to develop speech.\nAlternative Names\nComplete laryngectomy; Total laryngectomy; Partial laryngectomy\nPatient Instructions\nSwallowing problems\nReferences\nRassekh H, Haughey BH.
