This process is called\nmetabolism\n.\nMany diseases and conditions can cause hyperthyroidism, including:\nGraves disease\n(most common cause of hyperthyroidism)\nInflammation (thyroiditis) of the thyroid due to viral infections, some medicines, or after pregnancy (common)\nTaking too much thyroid hormone (common)\nNoncancerous growths of the thyroid gland or pituitary gland (rare)\nSome tumors of the\ntestes\nor ovaries (rare)\nGetting medical imaging tests with contrast dye that has iodine (rare, and only if there is already a problem with the thyroid)\nEating too much of foods that contain iodine (very rare, and only if there is already a problem with the thyroid)\nSym"}
