Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSVC obstruction\nSVC obstruction\nSVC obstruction is a narrowing or blockage of the superior vena cava (SVC), which is the second largest vein in the human body. The superior vena cava moves blood from the upper parts of the body to the heart.\nCauses\nSVC obstruction is a rare condition.\nIt is most often caused by\ncancer\nor a\ntumor\nin the mediastinum (the area of the chest under the breastbone and between the lungs).\nTypes of cancer that can lead to this condition include:\nBreast cancer\nLung cancer\nLymphoma\nMetastatic cancer to the lung\n(cancer that has spread to the lungs)\nTesticular cancer\nThyroid cancer\nThymus tumor\nSVC obstruction can also be caused by noncancerous conditions that cause scarring near the SVC."}

These conditions include:\nHistoplasmosis\n(a type of fungal infection)\nInflammation of a vein (\nthrombophlebitis\n)\nLung infections (such as\ntuberculosis\n)\nOther causes of SVC obstruction include:\nWidening of the artery that leaves the heart (\naortic aneurysm\n)\nBlood clots in the SVC\nTightening of the thin lining of the heart (\nconstrictive pericarditis\n)\nEffects of radiation therapy for certain medical conditions\nEnlargement of the thyroid gland (goiter)\nCatheters placed in the large veins of the upper arm and neck may cause blood clots in the SVC.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms occur when something blocks the blood flowing back to the heart. Symptoms may begin suddenly or gradually, and may worsen when you bend over or lie down.\nEarly signs include:\nSwelling around the eyes\nSwelling of the face\nSwelling of the whites of the eyes\nDistended veins in the neck\nThe swelling may be worse or more prominent when lying down than when upright."}

Blood pressure is often high in the arms and low in the legs.\nIf lung cancer is suspected, a\nbronchoscopy\nmay be done."}

Surgery to bypass the obstruction is rarely performed."}

Placement of a\nstent\n(tube placed inside a blood vessel) to open up the SVC may be performed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome varies, depending on the cause and the amount of blockage.\nSVC obstruction caused by a tumor is a sign that the tumor has spread, and it indicates a poorer long-term outlook.\nPossible Complications\nThe throat could become blocked, which can block the airways.\nIncreased pressure may develop in the brain, leading to changed levels of consciousness, nausea, vomiting, or vision changes.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of SVC obstruction. Complications are serious and can sometimes be fatal.\nPrevention\nPrompt treatment of other medical disorders may reduce the risk of developing SVC obstruction.\nAlternative Names\nSuperior vena cava obstruction; Superior vena cava syndrome\nImages\nHeart - section through the middle\nReferences\nGupta A, Kim DN, Kalva S, Reznik S, Johnson DH.
