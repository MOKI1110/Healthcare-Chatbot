Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMyasthenia gravis\nMyasthenia gravis\nMyasthenia gravis is a neuromuscular disorder. Neuromuscular disorders involve the muscles and the nerves that control them.\nCauses\nMyasthenia gravis is an\nautoimmune disorder\n. An autoimmune disorder occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.\nAntibodies\nare proteins made by the body's immune system when it detects harmful substances. Antibodies may be produced when the immune system mistakenly considers healthy tissue to be a harmful substance, such as in the case of myasthenia gravis. In people with myasthenia gravis, the body produces antibodies that block the muscle cells from receiving messages (conveyed by neurotransmitters) from the nerve cells.\nIn some cases, myasthenia gravis is linked to tumors of the thymus (an organ of the immune system).\nMyasthenia gravis can affect people at any age. It is most common in young women and older men.\nSymptoms\nMyasthenia gravis causes weakness of the voluntary muscles. These are muscles that you can control."}

It is most common in young women and older men.\nSymptoms\nMyasthenia gravis causes weakness of the voluntary muscles. These are muscles that you can control. Autonomic muscles of the heart and digestive tract are usually not affected. The muscle weakness of myasthenia gravis worsens with activity and improves with rest.\nThis muscle weakness can lead to a variety of symptoms, including:\nDouble vision\nand\ndrooping eyelids\n(ptosis) are the most common first symptoms\nBreathing difficulty\nbecause of weakness of the chest wall muscles\nChewing or swallowing difficulty, causing frequent gagging, choking, or drooling\nDifficulty climbing stairs, lifting objects, or rising from a seated position\nDifficulty talking\nDrooping head\nFacial paralysis\nor weakness of the facial muscles\nFatigue\nHoarseness or changing voice\nDifficulty maintaining steady gaze\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. This includes a detailed nervous system (neurological) examination."}

This includes a detailed nervous system (neurological) examination. This may show:\nMuscle weakness, with eye muscles usually affected first\nWeakness usually fluctuates and gets worse with exercise\nNormal reflexes and feeling (sensation)\nTests that may be done include:\nBlood test to check for\nacetylcholine receptor antibodies\n, and others, associated with this disease\nCT\nor\nMRI\nscan of the chest to look for a tumor\nNerve conduction studies\nto test how fast electrical signals move through a nerve\nElectromyography\n(EMG) to test the health of the muscles and the nerves that control the muscles\nPulmonary function tests\nto measure breathing and how well the lungs are functioning\nEdrophonium test to see if this medicine reverses the symptoms for a short time\nTreatment\nThere is no known cure for myasthenia gravis. Treatment may allow you to have periods without any symptoms (remission).\nLifestyle changes can often help you continue your daily activities."}

Treatment may allow you to have periods without any symptoms (remission).\nLifestyle changes can often help you continue your daily activities. The following may be recommended:\nResting throughout the day\nUsing an eye patch if double vision is bothersome\nAvoiding stress and heat exposure, which can make symptoms worse\nMedicines that may be prescribed include:\nNeostigmine or pyridostigmine to improve communication between the nerves and muscles\nPrednisone and other medicines (such as azathioprine, cyclosporine, or mycophenolate mofetil) to suppress the immune system response if you have severe symptoms and other medicines have not worked well\nOther immunological therapies target specific immune cells or inflammatory response\nCrisis situations (myasthenic crisis) are attacks of weakness of the breathing muscles. These attacks can occur without warning when either too much or too little medicine is taken. These attacks usually last no longer than a few weeks."}

These attacks can occur without warning when either too much or too little medicine is taken. These attacks usually last no longer than a few weeks. You may need to be admitted to the hospital, where you may need breathing assistance with a\nventilator\n.\nA procedure called plasmapheresis may also be used to help end the crisis. This procedure involves removing the clear part of the blood (plasma), which contains the antibodies. This may be replaced with donated plasma that is free of antibodies, or with other fluids. Plasmapheresis may also help reduce symptoms for 4 to 6 weeks and is often used before surgery.\nA medicine called intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) may also be used.\nSurgery to remove the thymus (thymectomy) may result in permanent remission or less need for medicines, especially when there is a tumor present.\nIf you have eye problems, your provider may suggest lens prisms to improve vision. Surgery may also be recommended to treat your eye muscles.\nPhysical therapy can help maintain your muscle strength."}

This is especially important for the muscles that support breathing.\nSome medicines can worsen symptoms and should be avoided. Before taking any medicine, ask your provider whether it is OK for you to take it.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\nmyasthenia gravis support group\n. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThere is no cure, but long-term remission is possible. You may have to restrict some daily activities. People who have only eye symptoms (ocular myasthenia gravis), may develop generalized myasthenia over time.\nA woman with myasthenia gravis can get pregnant, but careful prenatal care is important. The baby may be weak and require medicines for a few weeks after birth, but usually will not develop the disorder.\nPossible Complications\nThe condition may cause life-threatening breathing or swallowing problems."}
