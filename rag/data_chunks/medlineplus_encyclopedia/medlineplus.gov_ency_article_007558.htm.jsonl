A retrosternal thyroid refers to the abnormal  location of all or part of the thyroid gland behind the breastbone (sternum).\nDescription\nA retrosternal\ngoiter\nis always a consideration in people who have a mass in their neck. A retrosternal goiter often causes no symptoms for years. It is often detected when a\nchest x-ray\nor\nCT scan\nis done for another reason. Any symptoms are usually due to pressure on nearby structures, such as the windpipe (trachea) and swallowing tube (esophagus).\nSurgery to completely remove the goiter may be recommended, even if you do not have symptoms.\nDuring the surgery:\nYou receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n. This makes you asleep and unable to feel pain.\nYou lie on your back with your neck slightly extended.\nYour surgeon makes a cut (incision) in the front of your lower neck just above the collar bones to determine if the mass can be removed without opening the chest."}

The entire goiter is then removed.\nA tube may be left in place to drain fluid and blood. It is usually removed in 1 to 2 days.\nThe incisions are closed with stitches (sutures).\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThis surgery is done to completely remove the goiter."}
