Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFractional excretion of sodium\nFractional excretion of sodium\nFractional excretion of sodium is the amount of salt (sodium) that leaves the body through urine compared to the amount filtered and reabsorbed by the kidney.\nFractional excretion of sodium (FENa) is not a test. Instead it is a calculation based on the concentrations of sodium and creatinine in the blood and urine.\nUrine\nand\nblood chemistry\ntests are needed to perform this calculation.\nHow the Test is Performed\nBlood\nand\nurine samples\nare collected at the same time and sent to a lab. There, they are examined for salt (sodium) and creatinine levels. Creatinine is a chemical waste product of creatine. Creatine is a chemical made by the body and is used to supply energy mainly to muscles.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nEat your normal foods with a normal amount of salt, unless otherwise instructed by your health care provider.\nIf needed, you may be told to temporarily stop medicines that interfere with test results."}

For example, some diuretic medicines (water pills) can affect test results.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is usually done for people who are very ill with\nacute kidney disease\n. The test helps determine if the drop in urine production is due to reduced blood flow to the kidney or to kidney damage itself.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA meaningful interpretation of the test can be made only when your urine volume has dropped to less than 500 mL/day.\nFENa of lower than 1% indicates decreased blood flow to the kidney. This can occur with kidney damage due to\ndehydration\nor\nheart failure\n.\nFENa higher than 1% suggests damage to the kidney itself.\nRisks\nThere are no risks with providing the urine sample.\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken."}
