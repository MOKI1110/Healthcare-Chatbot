Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCerebral hypoxia\nCerebral hypoxia\nCerebral hypoxia occurs when there is not enough oxygen getting to the brain. The brain needs a constant supply of oxygen and nutrients to function.\nCerebral hypoxia refers to the largest parts of the brain, called the cerebral hemispheres. However, the term is often used to refer to a lack of oxygen supply to any part of or all of the brain.\nCauses\nIn cerebral hypoxia, sometimes only the oxygen supply is interrupted. This can be caused by:\nBreathing in smoke (smoke inhalation), such as during a fire\nCarbon monoxide poisoning\nChoking\nDiseases that prevent movement (paralysis) of the breathing muscles, such as\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n(ALS)\nHigh altitude exposure\nPressure on (compression) the windpipe (trachea)\nStrangulation\nIn other cases, both oxygen and nutrient supply are stopped, caused by:\nCardiac arrest\n(when the heart stops pumping)\nCardiac\narrhythmia\n(heart rhythm problems)\nComplications of\ngeneral anesthesia\nDrowning\nIllegal drug or medicine overdose\nInjuries to a newborn that occurred before, during, or soon a"}

Some brain cells start dying less than 5 minutes after their oxygen supply disappears. As a result, brain hypoxia can rapidly cause severe brain damage or death.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of mild cerebral hypoxia include:\nChange in attention (inattentiveness)\nPoor judgment\nSpeech disorder\nUncoordinated movement\nSymptoms of severe cerebral hypoxia include:\nComplete unawareness and unresponsiveness (\ncoma\n)\nNo breathing\nNo response of the pupils of the eye to light\nExams and Tests\nCerebral hypoxia can usually be diagnosed based on the person's medical history and a physical exam."}

Tests are done to determine the cause of the hypoxia, and may include:\nAngiogram of the brain\nBlood tests, including\narterial blood gases\nand blood chemical levels\nCT scan of the head\nEchocardiogram\n, which uses ultrasound to view the heart\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG), a measurement of the heart's electrical activity\nElectroencephalogram\n(EEG), a test of brain waves that can identify seizures and show how well brain cells work\nEvoked potentials\n, a test that determines whether certain sensations, such as vision and touch, reach the brain\nMagnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) of the head\nIf only blood pressure and heart function remain, the brain may be completely dead.\nTreatment\nCerebral hypoxia is an emergency condition that needs to be treated right away. The sooner the oxygen supply is restored to the brain, the lower the risk for severe brain damage and death.\nTreatment depends on the cause of the hypoxia. Basic life support is most important."}

Treatment involves:\nBreathing assistance (mechanical ventilation) and oxygen\nRegulating the heart rate and rhythm\nFluids, blood products, or medicines to raise blood pressure if it is low\nMedicines or general anesthetics to calm seizures\nSometimes a person with cerebral hypoxia is cooled to slow down the activity of the brain cells and decrease their need for oxygen. However, the benefit of this treatment has not been firmly established.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook depends on the extent of the brain injury. This is determined by how long the brain lacked oxygen, and whether nutrition to the brain was also affected.\nIf the brain lacked oxygen for only a brief period, a coma may be reversible and the person may have a full or partial return of function. Some people recover many functions, but have abnormal movements, such as twitching or jerking, called myoclonus."}

Some people recover many functions, but have abnormal movements, such as twitching or jerking, called myoclonus. Seizures may sometimes occur, and may be continuous (status epilepticus).\nMost people who make a full recovery were only briefly unconscious. The longer a person is unconscious, the higher the risk for death or brain death, and the lower the chances of recovery.\nPossible Complications\nComplications of cerebral hypoxia include a prolonged vegetative state. This means the person may have basic life functions, such as breathing, blood pressure, sleep-wake cycle, and eye opening, but the person is not alert and does not respond to their surroundings. Such people usually die within a year, although some may survive longer.\nThe length of survival depends partly on how much care is taken to prevent other problems. Major complications may include:\nBed sores\nClots in the veins (\ndeep vein thrombosis\n)\nLung infections (pneumonia)\nMalnutrition\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCerebral hypoxia is a medical emergency."}
