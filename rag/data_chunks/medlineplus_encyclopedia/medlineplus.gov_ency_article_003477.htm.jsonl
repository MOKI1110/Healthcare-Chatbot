About one half of the calcium in the blood is attached to proteins, mainly albumin.\nA separate test that measures calcium that is not attached to proteins in your blood is sometimes performed. Such calcium is called free or\nionized calcium\n.\nCalcium can also be measured in the\nurine\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour health care provider may tell you to temporarily stop taking certain medicines that can affect the test."}

These medicines may include:\nCalcium salts (may be found in nutritional supplements or antacids)\nLithium\nThiazide diuretics (water pills)\nLevothyroxine\nVitamin D\nDrinking too much milk (2 or more quarts or 2 liters a day or a large amount of other dairy products) or taking too much vitamin D as a dietary supplement can also increase blood calcium levels.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nAll cells need calcium in order to work. Calcium helps build strong bones and teeth."}

Common causes include:\nBeing on bed rest for a long time.\nConsuming too much calcium or vitamin D.\nHyperparathyroidism\n(parathyroid glands make too much of their hormone; sometimes associated with a low vitamin D level).\nInfections that cause granulomas such as tuberculosis and certain fungal and mycobacterial infections.\nMultiple myeloma\n, T cell lymphoma and certain other cancers.\nMetastatic bone tumor\n(bone cancer that has spread).\nOveractive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or too much thyroid hormone replacement medicine.\nPaget disease\n.
