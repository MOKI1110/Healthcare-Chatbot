The cancer tends to spread and get worse if not treated.\nThis cancer affects some of the islet cells of the pancreas. As a result, the affected islet cells produce too much of the hormone glucagon.\nThe cause is unknown. Genetic factors play a role in some cases. A family history of the syndrome multiple endocrine neoplasia type I (\nMEN I\n) is a risk factor.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of glucagonoma may include any of the following:\nGlucose intolerance (body has problem breaking down sugars)\nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycemia)\nDiarrhea\nExcessive thirst (due to high blood sugar)\nFrequent urination (due to high blood sugar)\nIncreased appetite\nInflamed mouth and tongue\nNighttime (nocturnal) urination\nSkin rash on face, abdomen, buttocks, or feet that comes and goes, and moves around (necrolytic migratory erythema)\nWeight loss\nIn most cases, the cancer has already spread to the"}

Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nApproximately 60% of these tumors are cancerous. It is common for this cancer to spread to the liver. Only about 20% of people can be cured with surgery.\nIf the tumor is only in the pancreas and surgery to remove it is successful, people have a 5-year survival rate of 85%.\nPossible Complications\nThe cancer can spread to the liver."}
