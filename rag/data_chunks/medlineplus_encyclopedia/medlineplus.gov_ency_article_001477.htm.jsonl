However, it may be genetic. Health care providers think it is a type of delayed\nallergic reaction\n. It is common among young women who live in moderate (temperate) climates.\nSymptoms\nPolymorphous means taking on different forms, and eruption means rash. As the name suggests, symptoms of PMLE are rash-like and are different in different people.\nPMLE most often occurs in spring and early summer on areas of the body exposed to the sun.\nSymptoms usually appear within 1 to 4 days after exposure to sunlight. They include any of the following:\nSmall bumps (\npapules\nblisters\nRedness or scaling of the skin\nItching or burning of the affected skin\nSwelling, or even blisters (not often seen)\nExams and Tests\nYour provider will examine your skin."}

Usually, your provider can diagnose PMLE based on your description of the symptoms.\nTests that may be done include:\nPhototesting, during which your skin is exposed to special ultraviolet light to check if your skin develops a rash\nRemoving a small amount of skin for examination\nskin biopsy\nto rule out other diseases\nTreatment\nSteroid creams or ointments containing vitamin D may be prescribed by your provider. They are used 2 or 3 times a day at the start of the eruption. Steroid or other types of pills may be used for more severe cases.\nPhototherapy may also be prescribed. Phototherapy is a medical treatment in which your skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light."}

This may help your skin become used to (sensitized to) the sun.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMany people become less sensitive to sunlight  over time.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall for an appointment with your provider if PMLE symptoms do not respond to treatments.\nPrevention\nProtecting your skin from the sun\ncan help prevent PMLE symptoms:\nAvoid sun exposure during hours of peak sun ray intensity.\nUse sunscreen. Sun protection with broad spectrum sunblock that works against UVA rays is important.\nApply generous amounts of sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30. Pay special attention to your face, nose, ears, and shoulders.\nApply sunscreen 30 minutes before sun exposure so that it has time to penetrate the skin."}
