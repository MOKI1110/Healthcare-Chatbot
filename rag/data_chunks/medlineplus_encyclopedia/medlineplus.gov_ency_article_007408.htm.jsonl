The aortic valve separates the heart and aorta. The aortic valve opens so blood can flow out. It then closes to keep blood from returning to the heart.\nYou may need aortic valve surgery to replace the aortic valve in your heart if:\nYour aortic valve does not close all the way, so blood leaks back into the heart. This is called\naortic regurgitation\n.\nYour aortic valve does not open fully, so blood flow out of the heart is reduced. This is called\naortic stenosis\n.\nOpen aortic valve surgery replaces the valve through a large cut in your chest.\nThe aortic valve can also be replaced using minimally invasive aortic valve surgery. This is done using several small cuts.\nDescription\nBefore your surgery you will receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n."}

This is done using several small cuts.\nDescription\nBefore your surgery you will receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n. You will be asleep and pain free.\nYour surgeon will make a 10-inch-long (25 centimeters) cut in the middle of your chest.\nNext, your surgeon will divide your breastbone to be able to see your heart and aorta.\nYou may need to be connected to a heart-lung bypass machine or bypass pump. Your heart is stopped while you are connected to this machine. This machine does the work of your heart while your heart is stopped.\nIf your aortic valve is too damaged, you will need a new valve. This is called valve replacement surgery. Your surgeon will remove your aortic valve and sew a new one into place. There are two main types of new valves:\nMechanical, made of man-made materials, such as titanium or carbon. These valves last the longest. You may need to take blood-thinning medicine, such as warfarin (Coumadin) for the rest of your life if you have this type of valve.\nBiological, made of human or animal tissue."}

It will take about 6 to 12 weeks for the bone to heal. The wires will stay inside your body.\nThis surgery may take 3 to 5 hours.\nSometimes other procedures are done during open aortic surgery. These include:\nCoronary bypass surgery\nAortic root replacement (David procedure)\nRoss (or switch) procedure\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nYou may need surgery if your aortic valve does not work properly."}
