It is a congenital problem, which means it is present at birth.\nCauses\nVascular ring is rare. It accounts for less than 1% of all congenital heart problems. The condition occurs as often in males as females. Some infants with vascular ring also have another congenital heart problem.\nVascular ring occurs very early during the baby's development in the womb. Normally, the aorta develops from one of several curved pieces of tissue (arches). The body breaks down some of the remaining arches, while others form into arteries. Some arteries that should break down do not, which forms a vascular ring.\nWith vascular ring, some of the arches and vessels that should have changed into arteries or disappeared are still present when the baby is born. These arches form a ring of blood vessels, which encircles and presses down on the windpipe (trachea) and esophagus.\nSeveral different types of vascular ring exist."}

These arches form a ring of blood vessels, which encircles and presses down on the windpipe (trachea) and esophagus.\nSeveral different types of vascular ring exist. In some types, the vascular ring only partially encircles the trachea and esophagus, but it still can cause symptoms.\nSymptoms\nSome children with a vascular ring never develop symptoms. However, in most cases, symptoms are seen during infancy. Pressure on the windpipe (trachea) and esophagus can lead to breathing and digestive problems. The more the ring presses down, the more severe the symptoms will be.\nBreathing problems may include:\nHigh-pitched cough\nLoud breathing (stridor)\nRepeated pneumonias or respiratory infections\nRespiratory distress\nWheezing\nEating may make breathing symptoms worse.\nDigestive symptoms are rare, but may include:\nChoking\nDifficulty eating solid foods\nDifficulty swallowing (dysphagia)\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)\nSlow breast or bottle feeding\nVomiting\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will listen to the baby's breathing to rule out other breathing disorders such as asthma."}

Listening to the child's heart through a stethoscope can help identify murmurs and other heart problems.\nThe following tests can help diagnose vascular ring:\nChest x-ray\nComputed tomography (CT) scan of the heart and major blood vessels\nCamera down the throat to examine the airways (bronchoscopy)\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the heart and major blood vessels\nUltrasound examination (echocardiogram) of heart\nX-ray of blood vessels (angiography)\nX-ray of the esophagus using a special dye to better highlight the area (esophagram or barium swallow)\nTreatment\nSurgery is usually performed as soon as possible on children with symptoms. The goal of surgery is to split the vascular ring and relieve pressure on the surrounding structures. The procedure is usually done through a small surgical cut in the left side of the chest between the ribs.\nChanging the child's diet may help relieve the digestive symptoms of vascular ring."}

The provider will prescribe medicines (such as antibiotics) to treat any respiratory tract infections, if they occur.\nChildren who do not have symptoms may not need treatment but should be carefully monitored to make sure the condition does not become worse.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well the infant does depends on how much pressure the vascular ring is putting on the esophagus and trachea and how quickly the infant is diagnosed and treated.\nSurgery works well in most cases and often relieves symptoms right away. Severe breathing problems may take months to go away. Some children may continue to have loud breathing, especially when they are very active or have respiratory infections.\nPossible Complications\nDelaying surgery in serious cases can lead to serious complications, such as damage to the trachea and death.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your baby has symptoms of vascular ring."}
