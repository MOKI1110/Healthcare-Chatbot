The nervous system is made of two parts:\nThe central nervous system (CNS) consists of your brain and spinal cord.\nThe peripheral nervous system consists of all your nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord, including those in your head, arms, legs, and trunk of the body. Your peripheral nervous system is divided into two parts:\nAutonomic nervous system (ANS). This controls your internal body processes such as blood pressure, breathing, digestion, and so on.\nSomatic nervous system (SNS). This controls your muscles and sends signals from your ears, eyes, mouth, and skin to your CNS.\nTogether, your brain and spinal cord serve as the main \"processing center\" for the entire nervous system, and control all the functions of your body. Your brain defines who you are."}

Most medicines are taken by mouth, but some need to be infused (through a vein), or injected into the spinal fluid. Medicines can be used to:\nTreat pain\nImprove neurological function\nReduce degeneration\nPrevent autoimmune attack on the nervous system\nTreat infections of the nervous system\nNeuroradiology is a branch of neuroscience medicine.

This is a form of radiation therapy that focuses high-powered x-rays on a small area of the body. This helps to avoid damage to surrounding brain tissue.\nTreatment of nervous system-related diseases or disorders may also include:\nDeep brain stimulation\nSpinal cord stimulation\nRehabilitation/physical therapy after brain injury or stroke\nSpinal surgery\nWHO IS INVOLVED\nThe neurosciences medical team is often made up of health care providers from different specialties."}
