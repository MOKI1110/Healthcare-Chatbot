Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nDuplex ultrasound\nDuplex ultrasound\nA duplex\nultrasound\nis a test to see how blood moves through your arteries and veins.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA duplex ultrasound combines:\nTraditional ultrasound: This uses sound waves that bounce off blood vessels to create pictures.\nDoppler ultrasound: This records sound waves reflecting off moving objects, such as blood, to measure their speed and other aspects of how they flow.\nThere are different types of duplex ultrasound exams. Some include:\nArterial and venous duplex ultrasound of the abdomen. This test examines blood vessels and blood flow in the abdominal area.\nCarotid duplex ultrasound\nlooks at the carotid artery in the neck.\nDuplex ultrasound of the extremities\nlooks at the arms or legs.\nRenal duplex ultrasound examines the kidneys and their blood vessels.\nYou may need to wear a medical gown. You will lie down on a table, and the ultrasound technician will spread a gel over the area being tested."}

You will lie down on a table, and the ultrasound technician will spread a gel over the area being tested. The gel helps the sound waves get into your tissues.\nA wand, called a transducer, is moved over the area being tested. This wand sends out the sound waves. A computer measures how the sound waves reflect back, and changes the sound waves into pictures. The Doppler creates a \"swishing\" sound, which is the sound of your blood moving through the arteries and veins.\nYou need to stay still during the exam. You may be asked to lie in different body positions, or to take a deep breath and hold it.\nSometimes during a\nduplex ultrasound of the arteries of the legs\n, the health care provider may calculate an ankle-brachial index (ABI). You will need to wear blood pressure cuffs on your arms and legs for this test.\nThe ABI number is obtained by dividing the blood pressure in the ankle by the blood pressure in the arm."}

You will need to wear blood pressure cuffs on your arms and legs for this test.\nThe ABI number is obtained by dividing the blood pressure in the ankle by the blood pressure in the arm. A value of 0.9 or greater is normal.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nUsually, there is no preparation for this test.\nIf you are having an ultrasound of your stomach area, you may be asked not to eat or drink after midnight. Tell the person doing the ultrasound exam if you are taking any medicines, such as blood thinners. These might affect the results of the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel some pressure as the wand is moved over the body, but there is no discomfort most of the time.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA duplex ultrasound can show how blood flows to many parts of the body. It can also tell the width of a blood vessel and reveal any blockages."}

It can also tell the width of a blood vessel and reveal any blockages. This test is a less invasive option than arteriography and\nvenography\n.\nA duplex ultrasound can help diagnose the following conditions:\nAbdominal aneurysm\nArterial narrowing (stenosis) or blockage (occlusion)\nBlood clot\nCarotid occlusive disease (See:\nCarotid duplex\n)\nRenal vascular disease\nVaricose veins\nVenous insufficiency\nA renal duplex ultrasound can also be used after kidney transplant surgery. This shows how well a new kidney is working.\nNormal Results\nA normal result is normal blood flow through the veins and arteries. There is normal blood pressure and no sign of a narrowing or blockage of a blood vessel.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result depends on the specific area being examined. An abnormal result may be due to a blood clot or plaque buildup in a blood vessel.\nRisks\nThere are no risks.\nConsiderations\nSmoking may change the results of an ultrasound of the arms and legs."}
