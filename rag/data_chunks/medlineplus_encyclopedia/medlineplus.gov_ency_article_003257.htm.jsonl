You may not be able to remember new events, recall one or more memories of the past, or both.\nThe memory loss may be for a short time and then resolve (transient). Or, it may not go away, and, depending on the cause, it can get worse over time.\nIn severe cases, such memory impairment may interfere with daily living activities.\nCauses\nNormal aging can cause some forgetfulness. It is normal to have some trouble learning new material or needing more time to remember it. But normal aging does not lead to dramatic memory loss. Such memory loss is due to other diseases.\nMemory loss can be caused by many things. To determine a cause, your health care provider will ask if the problem came on suddenly or slowly.\nMany areas of the brain help you create and retrieve memories."}
