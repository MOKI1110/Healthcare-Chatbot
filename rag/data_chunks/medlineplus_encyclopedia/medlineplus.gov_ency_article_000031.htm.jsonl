They are medical emergencies if the snake is venomous.\nVenomous animals account for a large number of deaths and injuries worldwide. Snakes alone are estimated to inflict 2.5 million venomous bites each year, resulting in about 150,000 deaths. The actual number may be much larger. Southeast Asia, India, Brazil, and areas of Africa have the most deaths due to snakebite.\nConsiderations\nSnake bites can be deadly if not treated quickly. Because of their smaller body size, children are at higher risk for death or serious complications due to snake bites.\nThe right antivenom can save a person's life. Getting to an emergency room as quickly as possible is very important."}

Reassure them that bites can be effectively treated in an emergency room. Restrict movement, and keep the affected area at heart level if bitten by a pit viper (rattlesnake, copperhead, cottonmouth) in North America, or below heart level if bitten by a coral snake, cobra, or exotic snake, to reduce the flow of venom.\nRemove any rings or constricting items of clothing, because the affected area may swell. Create a loose splint to help restrict movement of the area. Loosely splint and/or sling the affected area. Do not use a tourniquet.\nIf the area of the bite begins to swell and change color, the snake was probably venomous.\nMonitor the person's\nvital signs\n-- temperature,\npulse\n, rate of breathing, and blood pressure -- if possible."}

This may help with treatment of the bite. Do not waste time hunting for the snake, and do not trap it or pick it up. If the snake is dead, be careful of the head -- a snake can actually bite (from a reflex) for several hours after it's dead.\nDO NOT\nFollow these precautions:\nDo not pick up the snake or try to trap it.\nDo not wait for symptoms to appear if bitten.
