Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCampylobacter serology test\nCampylobacter serology test\nCampylobacter serology test is a blood test to look for\nantibodies\nto bacteria called campylobacter.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nThe sample is sent to a lab. There, tests are done to look for antibodies to campylobacter bacteria. Antibody production increases during the infection. When the illness first starts, few antibodies are detected. For this reason, blood tests may need to be repeated 10 days to 2 weeks later to increase sensitivity.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no special preparation.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test detects the presence of antibodies to campylobacter in the blood.\nCampylobacter infection\ncan cause diarrheal illness. A blood test is rarely done to diagnose campylobacter diarrheal illness."}

A blood test is rarely done to diagnose campylobacter diarrheal illness. It is used if your health care provider thinks you are having complications from this infection, such as\nreactive arthritis\nor\nGuillain-BarrÃ© syndrome\n.\nNormal Results\nA normal test result means no antibodies to campylobacter are present. This is called a negative result.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal (positive) result means that antibodies against campylobacter have been detected. This means you have come in contact with the bacteria.\nTests are often repeated during the course of an illness to detect a rise in antibody levels. This rise helps to confirm an active infection. A low level may be a sign of a previous infection rather than current disease.\nRisks\nVeins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
