It likely includes both a direct poisoning of the nerve by the alcohol and the effect of poor nutrition associated with alcoholism. Up to half of long-term heavy alcohol users develop this condition.\nIn severe cases, nerves that regulate internal body functions (autonomic nerves) may be involved.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of this condition include any of the following:\nNumbness\nin the arms and legs\nAbnormal sensations\n, such as \"pins and needles\"\nPainful sensations in the arms and legs\nMuscle problems, including\nweakness\n,\ncramps\n,\naches\n, or spasms\nHeat intolerance\n, especially after exercise\nErection problems (\nimpotence\n)\nProblems urinating\n,\nincontinence\n(leaking urine), the feeling of incomplete bladder emptying,\ndifficulty beginning to urinate\nConstipation or diarrhea\nNausea, vomiting\nProblems swallowing or talking\nUnsteady gait (walking)\nChanges in muscle strength"}

Symptoms usually develop gradually and become worse over time.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about symptoms. An eye exam may show eye problems.\nExcessive alcohol use often makes the body unable to use or store certain vitamins and minerals. Blood tests may be ordered to check for a lack of:\nThiamine\n(vitamin B1)\nPyridoxine\n(vitamin B6)\nVitamin B12\nFolic acid\nOther tests may be ordered to check for other possible causes of neuropathy or damage to body systems due to neuropathy.\nTests may include:\nElectrolyte levels\n, including glucose to check for diabetes\nElectromyography\n(EMG) to check the health of the muscles and the nerves that control the muscles\nHemoglobin A1c\ntest to check for diabetes\nLiver and kidney function tests\nThyroid function tests\nLevels of vitamins and minerals in the body\nNerve conduction tests\nto check how fast elect"}

Once the alcohol problem has been addressed, treatment goals include:\nControlling symptoms\nMaximizing ability to function independently\nPreventing injury\nIt is important to supplement the diet with vitamins, including thiamine and folic acid.\nPhysical therapy and orthopedic appliances (such as splints) may be needed to maintain muscle function and limb position.\nMedicines may be needed to treat pain or uncomfortable sensations due to nerve damage. They will be prescribed the smallest dose of medicine needed to reduce symptoms. This may help prevent medicine dependence and other side effects of\nchronic\nuse.\nPositioning or the use of a bed frame that keeps the covers off the legs may help reduce pain.\nPeople with lightheadedness or dizziness when standing up (orthostatic hypotension) may need to try several different treatments before finding one that successfully reduces their symptoms."}

These symptoms often respond poorly to treatment in people with alcoholic neuropathy.\nIt is important to protect body parts with reduced sensation from injury. This may include:\nChecking the temperature of bath water to prevent burns\nChanging footwear\nFrequently inspecting the feet and shoes to reduce injury caused by pressure or objects in the shoes\nGuarding the extremities to prevent injury from pressure\nAlcohol use must be stopped\nto prevent the damage from getting worse."}

It is likely to get worse if the person continues to use alcohol or if nutritional problems are not corrected. Alcoholic neuropathy is usually not life threatening, but it can severely affect quality of life.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of alcoholic neuropathy.\nPrevention\nThe only way to prevent alcoholic neuropathy is not to drink excessive amounts of alcohol.\nAlternative Names\nNeuropathy - alcoholic; Alcoholic polyneuropathy\nImages\nAlcoholic neuropathy\nMotor nerves\nAutonomic Nerves\nCentral nervous system and peripheral nervous system\nReferences\nKatirji B.
