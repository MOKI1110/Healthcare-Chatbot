Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done routinely to confirm whether a positive screening test for syphilis (either\nVDRL\nor\nRPR\n) means you have a current syphilis infection.\nIt may also be done when other syphilis tests are negative, to check for a possible false-negative result.\nNormal Results\nA negative or nonreactive result means that you do not have a current or past infection with syphilis.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA positive FTA-ABS is often a sign of a syphilis infection (past or present). This test result will remain positive for life even if syphilis has been adequately treated. Therefore, it cannot be used to monitor the treatment of syphilis or determine that you have active syphilis.\nOther illnesses, such as\nyaws\nand pinta (two other kinds of skin diseases), may also result in positive FTA-ABS results. Sometimes, there can be a false-positive result, most often in women with\nlupus\n.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
