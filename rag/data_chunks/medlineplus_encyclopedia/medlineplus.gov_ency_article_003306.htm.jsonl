Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMicrognathia\nMicrognathia\nMicrognathia is a term for a lower jaw that is smaller than normal.\nConsiderations\nIn some cases, the jaw is small enough to interfere with the infant's feeding. Infants with this condition may need special nipples in order to feed properly.\nMicrognathia often corrects itself during growth. The jaw may grow a lot during puberty. The problem can be caused by certain inherited disorders and syndromes.\nMicrognathia can cause the teeth not to align properly. This can be seen in the way the teeth appear when the mouth closes. Often there will not be enough room for the teeth to grow.\nChildren with this problem should see an orthodontist when the adult teeth come in."}

Often there will not be enough room for the teeth to grow.\nChildren with this problem should see an orthodontist when the adult teeth come in. Because children may outgrow the condition, it often makes sense to delay treatment until a child is older.\nCauses\nMicrognathia may be part of other genetic syndromes, including:\nCri du chat syndrome\nHallermann-Streiff syndrome\nMarfan syndrome\nPierre Robin syndrome\nProgeria\nSilver-Russell syndrome\nSeckel syndrome\nSmith-Lemli-Opitz syndrome\nTreacher-Collins syndrome\nTrisomy 13\nTrisomy 18\nXO syndrome (\nTurner syndrome\n)\nHome Care\nYou may need to use special feeding methods for a child with this condition. Most hospitals have programs where you can learn about these methods.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if:\nYour child seems to have a very small jaw\nYour child has trouble feeding properly\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nThe provider will do a physical exam and may ask questions about the problem."}

The child may need surgery or devices to correct tooth position.\nImages\nThe face\nReferences\nCampbell KH, Han CS, Abdel-Razeq SS. Imaging of the fetal face and neck.
