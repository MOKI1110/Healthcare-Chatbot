Tuck pant cuffs into socks.\nWear light-colored clothing. Light colors are less attractive than dark colors to biting insects. It also makes it easier to spot ticks or insects that have landed.\nWear gloves, particularly while gardening.\nCheck clothes regularly for bugs.\nUse protective netting around sleeping and eating areas to keep bugs at bay.\nEven with proper clothing, when visiting an area with many insects, bug repellents such as those containing DEET or picaridin should be used.\nTo avoid skin irritation, apply insect repellent to clothing."}
