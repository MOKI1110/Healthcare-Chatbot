Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLamellar ichthyosis\nLamellar ichthyosis\nLamellar ichthyosis (LI) is a rare skin condition. It appears at birth and continues throughout life.\nCauses\nLI is an\nautosomal recessive disease\n. This means that the mother and father must both pass one variant copy of the disease gene to their child in order for the child to develop the disease.\nSymptoms\nMany babies with LI are born with a clear, shiny, waxy layer of skin called a collodion membrane. For this reason, these babies are known as collodion babies. The membrane sheds within the first 2 weeks of life. The skin underneath the membrane is red and scaly resembling the surface of a fish.\nWith LI, the outer layer of skin called the epidermis cannot protect the body like the healthy epidermis can."}

The skin underneath the membrane is red and scaly resembling the surface of a fish.\nWith LI, the outer layer of skin called the epidermis cannot protect the body like the healthy epidermis can. As a result, a baby with LI may have the following health problems:\nDifficulty in feeding\nLoss of fluid (\ndehydration\n)\nLoss of balance of minerals in the body (\nelectrolyte\nimbalance)\nBreathing problems\nBody temperature that is not stable\nSkin or body-wide infections\nOlder children and adults with LI may have these symptoms:\nGiant scales that cover most of the body\nDecreased ability to sweat, causing sensitivity to heat\nHair loss\nAbnormal finger and toenails\nSkin of the palms and soles  is thickened\nTreatment\nCollodion babies usually need to stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). They are placed in a high-humidity incubator. They will need extra feedings. Moisturizers need to be applied to the skin. After the collodion membrane is shed, babies can usually go home.\nLifelong care of the skin involves keeping the skin moist to minimize the thickness of the scales."}
