The surgery can include ptosis repair or blepharoplasty.\nSagging or drooping eyelids occur with increasing age. Some people are born with droopy eyelids or develop a disease that causes eyelid drooping.\nDescription\nEyelid surgery is done in a surgeon's office. Or, it is done as outpatient surgery in a surgery center.\nThe procedure is done as follows:\nYou are given medicine to help you relax.\nThe surgeon injects numbing medicine (anesthesia) around the eye so you do not feel pain during the surgery. You may be awake while the surgery is done.\nThe surgeon makes tiny cuts (incisions) into the natural creases or folds of the eyelids.\nLoose skin and extra fat tissue are removed. The eyelid tendon is then tightened if a ptosis repair is also performed.\nAt the end of surgery, the incisions are closed with stitches.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nAn eyelid lift is needed when eyelid drooping reduces your vision."}

Arrange ahead of time for an adult to drive you home.\nBefore you leave, your surgeon will cover your eyes and eyelids with ointment and a bandage. Your eyelids may feel tight and sore as the numbing medicine wears off. The discomfort is easily controlled often with over-the-counter pain medicine.\nKeep your head raised as much as possible for several days. Place cold packs over the area to reduce swelling and bruising. Wrap the cold pack in a towel before applying. This helps prevent cold injury to the eyes and skin.\nYour surgeon may recommend an antibiotic or lubricating eye drops to reduce burning or itching.\nYou should be able to see well after 2 to 3 days. Do not wear contact lenses for at least 2 weeks. Keep activities to a minimum for 3 to 5 days, and avoid strenuous activities that raise your blood pressure for about 3 weeks."}

This includes lifting, bending, and rigorous sports.\nYour surgeon will remove the stitches 5 to 7 days after surgery if they need to be removed. You will have some bruising, which may last 2 to 4 weeks. You may notice increased tears, more sensitivity to light and wind, and blurring or double vision for the first few weeks.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nScars may remain slightly pink for 6 months or more after surgery. They will fade to a thin, nearly invisible white line and are hidden within the natural eyelid fold. The more alert and youthful look usually lasts for years. These results are permanent for some people.\nAlternative Names\nBlepharoplasty; Ptosis repair - eyelid lift\nImages\nBlepharoplasty - series\nReferences\nFew J, Ellis M. Blepharoplasty.
