Examples of antigens include bacteria, viruses,\ntoxins\n,\ncancer\ncells, and foreign blood or tissues from another person or species.\nWatch this video about:\nImmune response\nWhen the immune system detects an antigen, it responds by activating cells known as T lymphocytes, which interact with cells known as B lymphocytes. The B cells lead to production of  proteins called\nantibodies\nthat destroy the harmful substances. The immune system response also involves a process called phagocytosis. During this process, certain white blood cells swallow and destroy bacteria and other foreign substances."}

Proteins called complement help with this process.\nWatch this video about:\nPhagocytosis\nImmunodeficiency disorders may affect any part of the immune system. Most often, these conditions occur when the T or B lymphocytes (or both) do not function normally or your body does not produce enough antibodies.\nInherited immunodeficiency disorders that affect B cells include:\nHypogammaglobulinemia, which usually leads to\nrespiratory\nand gastrointestinal infections\nAgammaglobulinemia\n, which results in severe infections early in life, and is often deadly\nInherited immunodeficiency disorders that affect T cells may cause repeated Candida (yeast) infections. Inherited combined immunodeficiency affects both T cells and B cells. It may be deadly within the first year of life if it isn't treated early.\nPeople are said to be immunosuppressed when they have an immunodeficiency disorder due to medicines that weaken the immune system."}

Many cancers may also cause immunodeficiency.\nPeople who have had their\nspleen removed\nhave an acquired immunodeficiency, and are at higher risk for infection by certain bacteria that the spleen would normally help fight. People with diabetes are also at higher risk for certain infections.\nAs you get older, the immune system becomes less effective."}
