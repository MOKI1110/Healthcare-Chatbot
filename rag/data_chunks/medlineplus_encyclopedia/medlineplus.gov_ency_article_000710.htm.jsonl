Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome\nLambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome\nLambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS) is a rare disorder in which faulty communication between nerves and muscles leads to\nmuscle weakness\n.\nCauses\nLEMS is an\nautoimmune disorder\n. This means your immune system mistakenly targets healthy cells and tissues in the body. With LEMS,\nantibodies\nproduced by the immune system attack nerve cells. This makes nerves cells unable to release enough of a chemical called acetylcholine. This chemical transmits impulses between nerves and muscles. The result is muscle weakness.\nLEMS may occur with cancers such as\nsmall cell lung cancer\nor autoimmune disorders such as\nvitiligo\n, which leads to a loss of skin pigment.\nLEMS affects men more often than women. The most common age of occurrence is around age 60 years."}

LEMS is rare in children.\nSymptoms\nWeakness\nor loss of movement that can be more or less severe, including:\nDifficulty climbing stairs, walking, or lifting things\nMuscle pain\nDrooping of the head\nThe need to use the hands to get up from a sitting or lying position\nProblems talking\nProblems chewing or swallowing, which may include gagging or\nchoking\nVision changes, such as\nblurry vision\n, double vision, and problem keeping a steady gaze\nWeakness is generally mild in LEMS. Leg muscles are mostly affected. Weakness may improve after exercise, but continuous exertion causes fatigue in some cases.\nSymptoms related to the other parts of the nervous system often occur, and may include:\nBlood pressure changes\nDizziness\nupon standing\nDry mouth\nErectile dysfunction\nDry eyes\nConstipation\nDecreased sweating\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms."}

The exam may show:\nDecreased reflexes\nPossible loss of muscle tissue\nWeakness or paralysis that gets slightly better with activity\nTests to help diagnose and confirm LEMS may include:\nBlood tests to look for the antibodies that attack the nerves\nElectromyography\n(EMG) to test the health of the muscle fibers\nNerve conduction velocity\n(NCV) to test the speed of electrical activity along nerves\nCT scan\nand an\nMRI\nof the chest and the abdomen, followed by bronchoscopy for smokers may be done to evaluate for cancer.\nPET scan\nmay also be done if a lung tumor is suspected. You may be referred to an oncologist (cancer specialist) to determine if other cancer testing is needed.\nTreatment\nThe main goals of treatment are to:\nIdentify and treat any underlying disorders, such as lung cancer\nGive treatment to help with the weakness\nPlasma exchange, or plasmapheresis, is a treatment that helps remove from the body any harmful proteins (antibodies) that are interfering with nerve function."}

This involves removing blood plasma that contains the antibodies. Other proteins (such as albumin) or donated plasma are then infused into the body.\nAnother procedure involves using intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) to infuse a large amount of helpful antibodies directly into the bloodstream.\nMedicines that may also be tried include:\nMedicines that suppress the\nimmune system's response\nAnticholinesterase medicines to improve muscle tone (although these are not very effective when given alone)\nMedicines that increase the release of acetylcholine from nerve cells\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSymptoms of LEMS may improve by treating the underlying disease, suppressing the immune system, or removing the antibodies. However, paraneoplastic LEMS may not respond as well to treatment. (Paraneoplastic LEMS symptoms are due to an altered immune system response to a tumor)."}
