Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPET scan for breast cancer\nPET scan for breast cancer\nA positron emission tomography\n(PET) scan\nis an imaging test that uses a radioactive substance (called a tracer) to look for potential spread of\nbreast cancer\n. This tracer can help identify areas of cancer that an\nMRI\nor\nCT\nscan may not show.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA PET scan requires a small amount of radioactive material (tracer). This tracer is given through a vein (\nIV\n), usually on the inside of your elbow, or in a small vein in your hand. The tracer travels through your blood, collects in organs and tissues and gives off a signal that helps the radiologist see certain areas or disease more clearly.\nYou will need to wait nearby as your body absorbs the tracer. This usually takes about 1 hour.\nThen, you will lie on a narrow table, which slides into a large tunnel-shaped scanner. The PET scanner detects signals that are given off from the tracer. A computer converts the results into 3D pictures."}

The PET scanner detects signals that are given off from the tracer. A computer converts the results into 3D pictures. The images are displayed on a monitor for your health care provider to interpret.\nYou must lie still during test. Too much movement can blur images and cause errors.\nThe test takes about 90 minutes.\nMost PET scans are performed along with a CT scan. This combination scan is called a PET/CT and allows a detailed exam of the whole body, looking for any sign of cancer cells.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked not to eat anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan. You will be able to drink water.\nTell your provider if:\nYou are afraid of closed spaces (have claustrophobia). You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious.\nYou are pregnant or think you might be pregnant.\nYou are breastfeeding.\nYou have any allergies to injected dye (contrast).\nYou take insulin for\ndiabetes\n. If so, you will need special preparation.\nAlways tell your provider about the medicines you're taking, including those bought without a prescription."}

If so, you will need special preparation.\nAlways tell your provider about the medicines you're taking, including those bought without a prescription. Sometimes, medicines can interfere with the test results.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel a sharp sting when the needle containing the tracer is placed into your vein.\nA PET scan causes no pain. The room and table may be cold, but you can request a blanket or pillow.\nAn intercom in the room allows you to speak to someone at any time.\nThere is no recovery time, unless you were given a medicine to relax.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA PET scan is most often used when other tests, such as MRI scan or CT scan, do not provide enough information or providers are looking for the potential spread of the breast cancer to lymph nodes or beyond.\nIf you have breast cancer, your provider may order this scan:\nSoon after your diagnosis to see if the cancer has spread and to help tailor your treatments\nAfter treatment if there is concern that the cancer has returned\nDuring treatment to see if the cancer is responding to treatment\nA PET scan is not used to screen for, or diagnose, breast cancer.\nNorma"}

This result most likely means the breast cancer has not spread to other parts of the body.\nVery small areas of breast cancer may not show up on a PET scan.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may mean that the breast cancer may have spread outside of the breast.\nBlood sugar or insulin level may affect the test results in people with diabetes.\nRisks\nThe amount of radiation used in a PET scan is low. It is about the same amount of radiation as in most CT scans. Also, the radiation does not last for very long in your body.\nWomen who are pregnant or breastfeeding should let their provider know before having this test. Infants and babies developing in the womb are more sensitive to the effects of radiation because their organs are still growing.\nIt is possible, although very unlikely, to have an allergic reaction to the radioactive substance."}

Your provider may recommend that you do not breastfeed for 24 hours after the scan.\nAlternative Names\nBreast positron emission tomography; PET - breast; PET - tumor imaging - breast\nImages\nFemale breast\nReferences\nAllweis TM, Grubstein A, Menes T.
