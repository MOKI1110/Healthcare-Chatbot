Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nGastroesophageal reflux disease\nGastroesophageal reflux disease\nGastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a condition in which the stomach contents leak backward from the stomach into the esophagus (food pipe). Food travels from your mouth to the stomach through your esophagus. GERD can irritate the food pipe and cause heartburn and other symptoms.\nCauses\nWhen you eat, food passes from the throat to the stomach through the esophagus. A ring of muscle fibers in the lower esophagus prevents swallowed food from moving back up. These muscle fibers are called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES).\nWhen this ring of muscle does not close all the way, stomach contents can leak back into the esophagus. This is called reflux or gastroesophageal reflux. Reflux may cause symptoms."}

Common side effects of antacids include diarrhea or constipation.\nOther over-the-counter and prescription medicines can treat GERD. They work more slowly than antacids, but give you longer relief. Your pharmacist, provider, or nurse can tell you how to take these medicines.\nProton pump inhibitors (PPIs) decrease the amount of acid produced in your stomach.\nH2 blockers also lower the amount of acid released in the stomach.\nPotassium competitive acid blockers (PCABs) are the newest medicines that decrease stomach acid.\nAnti-reflux surgery may be an option for people whose symptoms do not go away with lifestyle changes and medicines.
