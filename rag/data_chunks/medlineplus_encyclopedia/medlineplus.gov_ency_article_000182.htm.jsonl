It mostly affects men ages 20 to 50 years.\nPericarditis is often the result of an infection such as:\nViral infections that cause a chest cold or pneumonia\nInfections with bacteria (less common)\nSome fungal infections (rare)\nThe condition may be seen with diseases such as:\nCancer\n(including\nleukemia\n)\nDisorders in which the immune system attacks healthy body tissue by mistake\n(autoimmune diseases)\nHIV infection and AIDS\nUnderactive thyroid gland\nKidney failure\nRheumatic fever\nTuberculosis\n(TB)\nOther causes include:\nHeart attack\nHeart surgery or trauma to the chest, esophagus, or heart\nCertain medicines, such as procainamide, hydralazine, phenytoin, isoniazid, and some drugs used to treat cancer or suppress the immune system\nSwelling or inflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis)\nRadiation therapy to the chest\nSymptoms\nChest pain\nis almost always present."}

Other laboratory tests may include:\nAntinuclear antibody\n(ANA)\nBlood culture\nCBC\nC-reactive protein\n(CRP)\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (\nESR\n)\nHIV test\nRheumatoid factor\nTuberculin skin test\nTreatment\nThe cause of pericarditis should be identified, if possible.\nHigh doses of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen or indomethacin  are often given with a medicine called colchicine."}

You will be asked to take them for days to weeks or longer in some cases.\nIf the cause of pericarditis is an infection:\nAntibiotics will be used for bacterial infections\nAntifungal medicines will be used for fungal pericarditis\nOther medicines that may be used are:\nCorticosteroids such as prednisone (in some people)\n\"Water pills\" (diuretics) to remove excess fluid\nOther anti-inflammatory agents\nIf the buildup of fluid makes the heart function poorly, treatment may include:\nDraining the fluid from the sac. This procedure, called\npericardiocentesis\n, is done using a needle, which is guided by ultrasound (echocardiography) in most cases.\nCutting a small hole (window) in the pericardium (subxiphoid pericardiotomy) to allow the infected fluid to drain into the abdominal cavity."}

The operation involves cutting or removing part of the pericardium.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPericarditis can range from mild illness that gets better on its own, to a life-threatening condition. Fluid buildup around the heart and poor heart function can complicate the disorder.\nThe outcome is good if pericarditis is treated right away. Most people recover in 2 weeks to 3 months. However, pericarditis may come back. This is called recurrent, or chronic, if symptoms or episodes continue.\nScarring and thickening of the sac-like covering and the heart muscle may occur when the problem is severe. This is called\nconstrictive pericarditis\n."}
