One clear sign of aging occurs when your menstrual periods stop permanently. This is known as\nmenopause\n.\nThe time before menopause is called perimenopause. It may begin several years before your last menstrual period. Signs of perimenopause include:\nMore frequent periods at first, and then occasional missed periods\nPeriods that are longer or shorter\nChanges in the amount of menstrual flow\nEventually your periods will become much less frequent, until they stop completely.\nAlong with changes in your periods, physical changes in your reproductive tract occur as well.\nAGING CHANGES AND THEIR EFFECTS\nMenopause is a normal part of a woman's aging process. Most women experience menopause around age 50, though it can occur before that age."}

Most women experience menopause around age 50, though it can occur before that age. The usual age range is 45 to 55.\nWith menopause:\nThe ovaries stop making the hormones estrogen and progesterone.\nThe ovaries also stop releasing eggs (ova, oocytes). After menopause, you can no longer become pregnant.\nYour menstrual periods stop. You know you have gone through menopause after you have had no periods for 1 year. You should continue to use a birth control method until you have gone a whole year without a period. Any bleeding that occurs more than 1 year after your last period is not normal and should be checked by your health care provider.\nAs hormone levels fall, other changes occur in the reproductive system, including:\nVaginal walls become thinner, dryer, less elastic, and possibly irritated."}

Sometimes sex becomes painful due to these vaginal changes.\nYour risk for\nvaginal yeast infections\nincreases.\nThe external genital tissue decreases and thins, and can become irritated.\nOther common changes include:\nMenopause symptoms such as hot flashes, moodiness, headaches, and trouble sleeping, which can persist for years\nProblems with short-term memory\nDecrease in breast tissue\nLower sex drive (libido) and sexual response\nIncreased risk for bone loss (may lead to\nosteoporosis\n)\nUrinary system changes, such as frequency and urgency of urination and increased risk for urinary tract infection\nLoss of tone in the pubic muscles, resulting in the vagina,\nuterus\n, or urinary bladder falling out of position (prolapse)\nMANAGING CHANGES\nHormone therapy with estrogen or progesterone, alone or in combination, may help menopause symptoms such as hot flashes or vaginal dryness and pain with intercourse. Most women who have a uterus will require progesterone as well as estrogen."}

Most women who have a uterus will require progesterone as well as estrogen. Women without a uterus may take estrogen only. Hormone therapy has risks, so it is not for every woman. Discuss the risks and benefits of hormone therapy with your provider.\nTo help manage problems such as painful sexual intercourse, use a lubricant during sexual intercourse. Vaginal moisturizers are available without a prescription. These can help with vaginal and vulvar discomfort due to the drying and thinning of tissues. Applying topical estrogen inside the vagina may help thicken the vaginal tissues and increase moisture and sensitivity. Your provider can tell you if any of these measures is right for you.\nGetting regular exercise, eating healthy foods, and staying involved in activities with friends and loved ones can help the aging process go more smoothly.\nOTHER CHANGES\nOther aging changes to expect:\nHormone production\nOrgans, tissues, and cells\nBreasts\nKidneys\nImages\nMenopause\nReferences\nAleksic S, Bartke A, Lamberts SWJ, Milman S.
