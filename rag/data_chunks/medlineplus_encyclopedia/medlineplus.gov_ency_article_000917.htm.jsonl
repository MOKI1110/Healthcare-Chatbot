Worries often seem to float from one problem to another. Problems may involve family, other relationships, work, school, money, and health.\nEven when they are aware that worries or fears are stronger than appropriate for the situation, a person with GAD still has difficulty controlling them.\nOther symptoms of GAD include:\nProblems concentrating\nFatigue\nIrritability\nProblems falling or staying asleep, or sleep that is restless and unsatisfying\nRestlessness when awake\nThe person may also have other physical symptoms. These can include muscle tension, upset stomach, sweating, or difficulty breathing.\nExams and Tests\nThere is no test that can make a diagnosis of GAD.

You will also be asked about other aspects of your mental and physical health."}

Your health care provider will ask about these symptoms. You will also be asked about other aspects of your mental and physical health. A physical exam or lab tests may be done to check for other conditions that cause similar symptoms.\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to help you feel better and function well in daily life. Talk therapy or medicine alone can be helpful. Sometimes, a combination of these may work best.\nTALK THERAPY\nMany types of talk therapy may be helpful for GAD. One common and effective talk therapy is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can help you understand the relationship between your thoughts, behaviors, and symptoms. Often CBT involves a set number of visits. During CBT you can learn how to:\nUnderstand and gain control of distorted views of stressors, such as other people's behavior or life events.\nRecognize and replace panic-causing thoughts to help you feel more in control.\nManage stress and relax when symptoms occur.\nAvoid thinking that minor problems will develop into terrible ones.\nOther types of talk therapy may also be helpful in managing symptoms of an anxiety disorder."}

Your provider can discuss talk therapy options with you. Then you can decide together if it is right for you.\nMEDICINES\nCertain medicines, often also used to treat depression, may be very helpful for this disorder. They work by preventing your symptoms or making them less severe. You must take these medicines every day. DO NOT stop taking them without talking with your provider. They include:\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), which are most often the first choice of antidepressants\nSerotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), which are another choice\nOther medicines such as hydroxyzine or medicines used to treat seizures, like gabapentin, may also be tried. These medicines act more quickly and may be taken as needed rather than regularly.\nMedicines called sedatives or hypnotics may also be prescribed.\nThese medicines should only be taken under a provider's direction.\nYour provider will prescribe a limited amount of these medicines."}
