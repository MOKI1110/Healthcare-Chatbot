It is most common in the hip and shoulder but can affect other large joints such as the knee, elbow, wrist, and ankle.\nCauses\nOsteonecrosis occurs when part of the bone does not get blood flow and dies. After a while, the bone can collapse. If osteonecrosis is not treated, the joint deteriorates, leading to severe arthritis.\nOsteonecrosis can be caused by disease or by severe trauma, such as a\nfracture\nor\ndislocation\n, that affects the blood supply to the bone. Osteonecrosis can also occur without trauma or disease."}

For example, if a blood disorder is the cause, treatment will consist, in part, medicine to treat it.\nIf the condition is caught early, you will take pain relievers and limit use of the affected area. This may include using crutches if your hip, knee, or ankle is affected. You may need to do range-of-motion exercises."}

In some cases, you can reduce your risk by doing the following:\nAvoid drinking excessive amounts of alcohol.\nWhen possible, avoid high doses and long-term use of corticosteroids.\nFollow safety measures when diving to avoid decompression sickness.\nAlternative Names\nAvascular necrosis; Bone infarction; Ischemic bone necrosis; AVN; Aseptic necrosis\nImages\nAseptic necrosis\nReferences\nMcAlindon T,  Carrino JA.
