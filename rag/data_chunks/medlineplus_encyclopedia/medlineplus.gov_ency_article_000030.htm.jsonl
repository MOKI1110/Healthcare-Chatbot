Burns can lead to cell death, which can require hospitalization and can be fatal.\nConsiderations\nThere are three levels of burns:\nFirst-degree burns affect only the outer layer of the skin. They cause pain, redness, and swelling.\nSecond-degree burns affect both the outer and underlying layer of skin. They cause pain, redness, swelling, and blistering. They are also called partial thickness burns.\nThird-degree burns affect the deep layers of skin. They are also called full thickness burns. They cause white or blackened, burned skin."}

The most serious burns can be painless.\nPeeling skin.\nShock\n-- Watch for pale and clammy skin, weakness, blue lips and fingernails, and a decrease in alertness.\nSwelling.\nRed, white, or charred skin.\nYou may have an airway burn if you have:\nBurns on the head, face, neck, eyebrows, or nose hairs\nBurned lips and mouth\nCoughing\nDifficulty breathing\nDark, black-stained mucus\nVoice changes\nWheezing\nFirst Aid\nBefore giving first aid, it is important to determine what type of burn the person has. If you are not sure, treat it as a major burn. Serious burns need medical care right away. Call 911 or the local emergency number.\nMINOR BURNS\nIf the skin is unbroken:\nRun cool water over the area of the burn or soak it in a cool water bath (not ice water).

Do not give aspirin to children under 12.\nOnce the skin has cooled, moisturizing lotion containing aloe and an antibiotic also can help.\nMinor burns will often heal without further treatment.

Check and change batteries regularly.\nTeach children about fire safety and the danger of matches and fireworks.\nKeep children from climbing on top of a stove or grabbing hot items such as irons and oven doors.\nTurn pot handles toward the back of the stove so that children can't grab them and they cannot accidentally be knocked over.\nPlace fire extinguishers in key locations at home, work, and school.\nRemove electrical cords from floors and keep them out of reach.\nKnow about and practice fire escape routes at home, work, and school.\nSet the water heater temperature at 120 °F (48.8 °C) or less.\nA"}
