(It is sometimes called \"tying the tubes.\") The fallopian tubes connect the ovaries to the uterus. A woman who has this surgery can no longer get pregnant. This means she is \"sterile.\"\nDescription\nTubal ligation is done in a hospital or outpatient surgery facility.\nYou may receive general anesthesia. You will be asleep and unable to feel pain.\nOr, you will be awake and given spinal anesthesia. You may also receive medicine to make you sleepy.\nThe procedure takes about 30 minutes.\nYour surgeon will make 1 or 2 small surgical cuts in your belly. Most often, they are around the belly button. Gas may be pumped into your belly to expand it. This helps your surgeon see your uterus and fallopian tubes.\nA narrow tube with a tiny camera on the end (laparoscope) is inserted into your belly."}

Instruments to block off your tubes will be inserted through the laparoscope or through a separate small cut.\nThe tubes are either burned shut (cauterized), clamped off with a small clip or ring (band), or completely removed surgically.\nTubal ligation can also be done right after you have a baby through a small cut in the navel. It can also be done during a C-section.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nTubal ligation may be recommended for adult women who are sure they do not want to get pregnant in the future. The benefits of this method include a sure way to protect against pregnancy and the lowered risk for ovarian cancer.\nWomen who are in their 40s or who have a family history of ovarian cancer may want to have the whole tube removed in order to further decrease their risk of later developing ovarian cancer.\nHowever, some women who choose tubal ligation regret the decision later."}

The younger the woman is, the more likely she will regret having her tubes tied as she gets older.\nTubal ligation is considered a permanent form of birth control. It is NOT recommended as a short-term method or one that can be reversed. However, major surgery can sometimes restore your ability to have a baby. This is called a reversal. More than half of women who have their tubal ligation reversed are able to become pregnant. An alternative to tubal reversal surgery is to have IVF (in vitro fertilization).\nRisks\nRisks of tubal ligation are:\nIncomplete closing of the tubes, which could make pregnancy still possible."}
