The tests help diagnose and treat joint-related problems.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA sample of synovial fluid is needed for this test. Synovial fluid is normally a thick, straw-colored liquid found in small amounts in joints.\nAfter the skin around the joint is cleaned, the health care provider inserts a sterile needle through the skin and into the joint space. Fluid is then drawn through the needle into a sterile syringe.\nThe fluid sample is sent to the laboratory. The laboratory technician:\nChecks the sample's color and how clear it is\nPlaces the sample under a microscope, counts the number of red and white blood cells, and looks for crystals (in the case of gout) or bacteria\nMeasures glucose, protein, uric acid, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels\nCultures the fluid to see if any bacteria grow\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNormally, no special preparation is needed."}

Tell your provider if you are taking a blood thinner, such as aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin), or clopidogrel (Plavix). These medicines can affect test results or your ability to have this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nMost often, the provider will first inject numbing medicine into the skin with a small needle, which will sting. A larger needle is then used to draw out the synovial fluid.\nThis test may also cause some discomfort if the tip of the needle touches bone. The procedure usually lasts less than 1 to 2 minutes."}

It may be longer if there is a large amount of fluid that needs to be removed.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test can help diagnose the cause of pain, redness, or swelling in joints.\nSometimes, removing the fluid can also help relieve joint pain.\nThis test may be used when your provider suspects:\nBleeding in the joint after a joint injury\nGout\n, other types of crystal disease, and arthritis\nInfection in a joint\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal joint fluid may look cloudy or abnormally thick.\nThe following found in joint fluid can be a sign of a health problem:\nBlood -- injury in the joint or bleeding problem of the body\nPus -- infection in the joint\nToo much joint fluid --\nosteoarthritis\nor cartilage, ligament, or meniscus injury\nEvidence of gout or pseudogout -- inflammatory conditions that can be treated with medicines\nRisks\nRisks of this test include:\nInfection of the joint -- unusual, but more common with repeated aspirations\nBleeding into the joint space\nConsiderations\nIce or c"}
