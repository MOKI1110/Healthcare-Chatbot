Problems with the joints, (such as\narthritis\n), bones (such as deformities), circulation (such as peripheral vascular disease), or even pain can make it difficult to walk properly. Diseases or injuries to the nerves, muscles, brain, spinal cord, or inner ear can affect normal walking.\nConsiderations\nThe pattern of how a person walks is called the gait. Different types of walking problems occur without a person's control. Most, but not all, are due to a physical condition.\nSome walking abnormalities have been given names:\nPropulsive gait -- a stooped, stiff posture with the head and neck bent forward.\nSpastic gait -- a stiff, foot-dragging walk caused by a long muscle contraction on one side.\nScissoring gait -- legs flexed slightly at the hips and knees like crouching, with the knees and thighs hitting or crossing in a scissors-like movement."}

A scissoring gait is often a more severe form of a spastic gait.\nSteppage gait -- foot drop where the foot hangs with the toes pointing down, causing the toes to scrape the ground while walking, requiring someone to lift the leg higher than normal when walking.\nWaddling gait -- a duck-like walk that may appear in childhood or later in life.\nAtaxic, or broad-based, gait -- feet wide apart with irregular, jerky, and weaving or slapping when trying to walk.\nMagnetic gait -- shuffling with feet feeling as if they stick to the ground.\nAntalgic gait -- when pain prevents the normal motion of the feet or legs.\nShuffling gait -- when the feet don't lift normally and slide on the ground, often due to Parkinson disease.\nCauses\nAbnormal gait may be caused by diseases in different areas of the body.\nGeneral causes of abnormal gait may include:\nArthritis of the spine, hip, leg, or foot joints\nConversion disorder\n(a mental disorder)\nFoot problems (such as a callus, corn, ingrown toenail, wart, pain,"}

People with this problem are likely to fall because they have poor balance and are always trying to catch up.\nProvide walking assistance for safety reasons, especially on uneven ground.\nSee a physical therapist for exercise therapy and walking retraining.\nFor a scissoring or spastic gait:\nPeople with a scissoring gait often lose skin sensation.
