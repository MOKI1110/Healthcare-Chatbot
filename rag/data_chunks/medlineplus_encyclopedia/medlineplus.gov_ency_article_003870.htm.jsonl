Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSwan-Ganz - right heart catheterization\nSwan-Ganz - right heart catheterization\nSwan-Ganz catheterization (also called right heart catheterization or pulmonary artery catheterization) is the passing of a thin tube (catheter) into the right side of the heart and the arteries leading to the lungs. It is done to monitor the heart's function and blood flow and pressures in and around the heart.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test can be done while you are in bed in an intensive care unit (ICU) of a hospital. It can also be done in special procedure areas such as a\ncardiac catheterization\nlaboratory.\nBefore the test starts, you may be given medicine (sedative) to help you relax.\nYou will lie on a padded table. Your doctor (most often a heart specialist called a cardiologist) will make a puncture into a vein near the groin or in your arm, or neck. A flexible tube (catheter or sheath) is placed through the puncture. Sometimes, it will be placed in your leg or your arm. You will be awake during the procedure.\nA longer catheter is inserted."}

A flexible tube (catheter or sheath) is placed through the puncture. Sometimes, it will be placed in your leg or your arm. You will be awake during the procedure.\nA longer catheter is inserted. It is then carefully moved into the upper chamber of the right side of the heart. X-ray images may be used to help the health care provider see where the catheter should be placed.\nBlood may be removed from the catheter. This blood is tested to measure the amount of oxygen in the blood.\nDuring the procedure, your heart's rhythm will be constantly watched using an\nelectrocardiogram\n(ECG).\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou should not eat or drink anything for 8 hours before the test starts (your cardiologist may give you different directions).\nYou may need to stay in the hospital the night before the test. Otherwise, you will check in to the hospital the morning of the test. In some cases, this procedure may be done after you have already been admitted to the hospital, possibly on an emergency basis.\nYou will wear a hospital gown. You must sign a consent form before the test."}

You will be awake and able to follow instructions during the test.\nYou may feel some discomfort when the IV is placed into your arm. You may also feel some pressure at the site when the catheter is inserted. In people who are critically ill, the catheter may stay in place for several days.\nYou may feel discomfort when the area of the vein is numbed with anesthetic.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe procedure is done to evaluate how the blood moves (circulates) in people who have:\nAbnormal pressures in the heart arteries\nBurns\nCongenital heart disease\nHeart failure\nKidney disease\nLeaky heart valves\nLung problems\nShock\n(very low blood pressure)\nIt may also be done to monitor for complications of a\nheart attack\nor heart surgery."}
