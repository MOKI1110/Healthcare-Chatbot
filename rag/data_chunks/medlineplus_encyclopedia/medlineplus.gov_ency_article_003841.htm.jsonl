Afterward, the area may feel tender or be bruised for several days.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe procedure is done most often to test for\namyloidosis\n. Amyloidosis is a disorder in which abnormal proteins build up in tissues and organs, impairing their function. Clumps of the abnormal proteins are called amyloid deposits.\nDiagnosing the disease in this way may avoid the need for a biopsy of a nerve or an internal organ, which is a more difficult procedure.\nNormal Results\nThe fat pad tissues are normal.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIn the case of amyloidosis, abnormal results mean there are amyloid deposits.\nRisks\nThere is a slight risk for infection, bruising, or slight bleeding.\nAlternative Names\nAmyloidosis - abdominal wall fat pad biopsy; Abdominal wall biopsy; Biopsy - abdominal wall fat pad\nImages\nDigestive system\nFat tissue biopsy\nReferences\nGertz MA, Dispenzieri A.
