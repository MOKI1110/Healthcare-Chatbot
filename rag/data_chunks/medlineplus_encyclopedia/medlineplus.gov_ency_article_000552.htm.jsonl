Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura\nThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura\nThrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a blood disorder in which platelet clumps form in small blood vessels. This leads to a low platelet count (\nthrombocytopenia\n).\nCauses\nThis disease may be caused by problems with an enzyme (a type of protein) that is involved in blood clotting. This enzyme is called ADAMTS13. Absence of this enzyme results in platelet clumping. This is usually caused by an autoimmune disorder where antibodies attack the ADAMTS 13 enzyme. Platelets are particles in the blood that aid in blood clotting.\nAs the platelets clump together, fewer platelets are available in the blood in other parts of the body to help with clotting. This can lead to bleeding under the skin. The platelets that clump in blood vessels affects the blood supply to various organs such as the kidneys and the brain, which can damage these organs.\nIn some cases, the disorder is passed down through families (inherited) and is called congenital TTP."}

It removes the abnormal proteins in your plasma and replaces it with normal plasma from a healthy donor. Plasma is the liquid part of blood that contains blood cells and platelets. Plasma exchange also replaces the missing enzyme.\nThe procedure is done as follows:\nFirst, you have your blood drawn as if donating blood.\nAs the blood is passed through a machine that separates blood into its different parts, the abnormal plasma is removed and your blood cells are saved.\nYour blood cells are then combined with normal plasma from a donor, and then given back to you through an intravenous (IV) line.\nThis treatment is repeated daily until blood tests show improvement.\nTo treat congenital TTP, plasma infusion is used. For this, donor plasma is given through an IV line.\nPeople who do not respond to this treatment or whose condition often returns may need medicine, such as steroids or rituximab, which suppress the immune system.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people with TTP who undergo plasma exchange recover completely. But some people die of this disease, especially if it is not diagnosed right away."}
