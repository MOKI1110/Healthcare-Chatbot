Class 3 is considered \"severe obesity.\"\nBMI is not always the best way to decide whether you need to lose weight. If you have more or less muscle than is normal, your BMI may not be a perfect measure of how much body fat you have. For example:\nBody builders\n--\nBecause muscle weighs more than fat, people who are very muscular may have a high BMI.\nOlder people --\nHealthy weight ranges for older adults are different than for other age groups. The BMI only tells part of the story. Older adults with a normal BMI may have less muscle compared to others who are slightly overweight."}

Always talk to your provider before trying to lose or gain weight.\nChildren --\nWhile many children have obesity, Do not use this BMI calculator for evaluating a child. Talk to your child's provider about the right weight for your child's age.\nProviders use a few methods to decide whether you are overweight. Your provider may also take your waist circumference and waist-to-hip ratio into consideration.\nYour BMI alone can't predict your health risk, but most experts say that a BMI of 30 or greater (obesity) is unhealthy. No matter what your BMI is, exercise can help reduce your risk of developing heart disease and diabetes."}
