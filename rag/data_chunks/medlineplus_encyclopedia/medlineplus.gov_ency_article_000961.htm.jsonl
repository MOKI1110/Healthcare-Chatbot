Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEsophageal atresia\nEsophageal atresia\nEsophageal atresia is a birth defect in which the esophagus does not develop properly. The esophagus is the tube that normally carries food from the mouth to the stomach.\nCauses\nEsophageal atresia (EA) is a congenital defect. This means it occurs before birth. There are several types of EA. In most cases, the upper esophagus ends and does not connect with the lower esophagus and stomach.\nMost infants with EA have another defect called tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF). This is an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the windpipe (trachea).\nOften, infants with EA/TEF also have\ntracheomalacia\n."}

This is an abnormal connection between the esophagus and the windpipe (trachea).\nOften, infants with EA/TEF also have\ntracheomalacia\n. When this occurs, the walls of the trachea are weak and floppy, causing high-pitched or noisy breathing.\nAt least half of babies with EA/TEF have other defects as well, most often heart defects.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of EA may include:\nBluish coloration to the skin (\ncyanosis\n), often with attempted feeding\nCoughing, gagging, and choking with attempted feeding\nDrooling or vomiting\nPoor feeding\nExams and Tests\nBefore birth, a mother's ultrasound may show more amniotic fluid than usual. This can be a sign of EA or other blockage of the unborn baby's digestive tract. If EA is present, the baby's stomach may be hard to see on the ultrasound.\nEA is usually found shortly after birth when saliva and fluids collect in the esophagus. This causes your baby to cough, choke, and sometimes turn blue. Your baby's health care provider will try to pass a small feeding tube through your infant's mouth or nose into the stomach."}

If the feeding tube can't pass all the way to the stomach, your infant likely has EA.\nAn x-ray may also show:\nAn air-filled pouch in the esophagus\nAir in the stomach and intestine\nOnce EA is confirmed, other tests may include:\nAn ultrasound of the heart (\nechocardiogram\n) to look for any heart defects\nImaging to look for other defects that can occur in the spine, limbs, or kidney\nTreatment\nEA is an emergency.\nSurgery\nis done as soon as possible after birth.\nFirst, any connection between the esophagus and the airway must be blocked. This will prevent damage to the lungs.\nThe esophagus will be connected to the stomach. This may take time to complete, depending on the gap between the esophagus and the stomach.\nBefore the surgery, and for some time afterward, your baby is not fed by mouth."}
