The condition affects mostly boys.\nWhile in the womb (uterus), the developing baby's abdomen swells with fluid. Often, the cause is a problem in the urinary tract. The fluid disappears after birth, leading to a wrinkled abdomen that looks like a prune. This appearance is more noticeable due to the lack of abdominal muscles.\nSymptoms\nWeak abdominal muscles can cause:\nConstipation\nDelay in sitting and walking\nDifficulties coughing\nUrinary tract problems can cause difficulty urinating.\nExams and Tests\nA woman who is pregnant with a baby who has prune belly syndrome may not have enough amniotic fluid (the fluid that surrounds the fetus)."}
