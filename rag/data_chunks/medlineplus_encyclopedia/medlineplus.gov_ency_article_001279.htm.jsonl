The tube is called the epididymis.\nCauses\nEpididymitis is most common in men ages 19 to 35. It is most often caused by a bacterial infection. Infection often begins in the urethra, the prostate, or the bladder.\nGonorrhea\nand\nchlamydia\ninfections are most often the cause of the problem in young heterosexual men. In children and older men, it is more commonly caused by\nE coli\nand similar bacteria. This is also true in men who have sex with men.\nMycobacterium tuberculosis\n(TB) can cause epididymitis. Other bacteria (such as Ureaplasma) may also cause the condition.\nAmiodarone is a medicine which prevents abnormal heart rhythms."}

You may have tenderness in a small area of the testicle where the epididymis is attached. A large area of swelling may develop around the lump.\nThe lymph nodes in the groin area may be enlarged. There may also be discharge from the penis."}

There are no long-term sexual or reproductive problems in most cases. However, the condition may return.\nPossible Complications\nComplications include:\nAbscess\nin the scrotum\nLong-term (chronic) epididymitis\nOpening on the skin of the scrotum\nDeath of testicular tissue due to lack of blood (testicular infarction)\nInfertility\nSudden and severe pain in the scrotum is a medical emergency.
