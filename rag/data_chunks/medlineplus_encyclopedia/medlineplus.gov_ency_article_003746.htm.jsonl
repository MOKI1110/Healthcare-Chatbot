It is most often used to diagnose\nstrep throat\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will be asked to tilt your head back and open your mouth wide. Your health care provider will rub a sterile cotton swab along the back of your throat near your tonsils. You will need to resist gagging and closing your mouth while the swab touches this area.\nYour provider may need to scrape the back of your throat with the swab several times. This helps improve the chances of detecting bacteria.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nDO NOT use antiseptic mouthwash before this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYour throat may be sore when this test is done. You may feel like gagging when the back of your throat is touched with the swab, but the test only lasts a few seconds.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done when a throat infection is suspected, particularly strep throat."}
