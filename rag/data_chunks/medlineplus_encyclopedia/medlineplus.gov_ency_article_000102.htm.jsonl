Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBlastomycosis\nBlastomycosis\nBlastomycosis is an infection caused by breathing in the\nBlastomyces dermatitidis\nfungus. This fungus is found in decaying wood and soil.\nCauses\nYou can get blastomycosis by contact with moist soil, most commonly where there is rotting wood and leaves. The fungus enters the body through the lungs, where the infection starts. The fungus can then spread to other parts of the body. The disease may affect the skin, bones and joints, and other areas.\nBlastomycosis is rare. It occurs in the central and southeastern United States, and in Canada, India, Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Africa.\nThe key risk factor for the disease is contact with infected soil. It most often affects people with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or who have had an organ transplant, but it can also infect healthy people. Men are more likely to be affected than women.\nSymptoms\nLung infection may not cause any symptoms. Symptoms may be seen if the infection spreads."}

You'll be asked about your medical history and symptoms.\nIf the provider suspects you have a fungal infection, diagnosis can be confirmed by these tests:\nChest CT scan\nChest x-ray\nSkin\nbiopsy\nSputum culture\nand exam\nUrinary\nantigen\ndetection\nTissue biopsy and culture\nUrine culture\nTreatment\nYou may not need to take medicine for a mild blastomycosis infection that stays in the lungs."}
