In flash photographs the pupil may appear red. This is called the \"red reflex\" by health care providers and is normal.\nSometimes, the pupil of the eye may appear white, or the normal red reflex may appear to be white. This is not a normal condition, and you need to see an eye care provider right away.\nThere are many different causes of white pupil or white reflex. Other conditions also can mimic white pupil. If the cornea, which is normally clear, becomes cloudy, it may look similar to a white pupil."}

Although the causes of a cloudy or white cornea are different from those of a white pupil or white reflex, these problems also need medical attention right away.\nCataracts\nmay also cause the pupil to appear white.\nCauses\nCauses of this condition may include:\nCoats disease - exudative retinopathy\nColoboma\nCongenital cataract\n(may be hereditary or may result from other conditions, including\ncongenital rubella\n,\ngalactosemia\n,\nretrolental fibroplasia\n)\nPersistent primary hyperplastic vitreous\nRetinoblastoma\nToxocara canis (infection caused by a parasite)\nUveitis\nHome Care\nMost causes of white pupil will cause decreased vision. This may often occur before the pupil appears to be white.\nDetecting a white pupil is especially important in infants. Babies are unable to communicate to others that their vision is decreased. It is also harder to measure an infant's vision during an eye exam.\nIf you see a white pupil, call your provider right away."}

A child who develops a white pupil or cloudy cornea needs immediate attention, preferably from an eye specialist.\nIt is important to get diagnosed early if the problem is caused by retinoblastoma since this disease can be fatal.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you notice any color changes in the pupil or cornea of the eye.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nThe provider will do a physical exam and ask about your symptoms and medical history.\nThe physical exam will include a detailed eye examination.\nThe following tests may be performed:\nOphthalmoscopy\nSlit-lamp exam\nStandard eye exam\nVisual acuity\nOther tests may be done including a\nhead CT\nor\nMRI scan\n.\nAlternative Names\nLeukocoria\nImages\nEye\nWhite spots in the pupil\nReferences\nCioffi GA, Liebmann JM.
