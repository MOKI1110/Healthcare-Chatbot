These problems can cause the passage through the nose to be partially blocked.\nDescription\nMost people receive\ngeneral anesthesia\nfor septoplasty. You will be asleep and pain-free. Some people have the surgery under local anesthesia, which numbs the area to block pain. You will stay awake if you have local anesthesia. Surgery takes about 1 to  1 ½ hours. Most people go home the same day.\nTo do the procedure:\nThe surgeon makes a cut inside the wall on one side of your nose.\nThe\nmucous membrane\nthat covers the wall is elevated.\nCartilage or bone that is causing the blockage in the area is moved, repositioned or taken out.\nThe mucous membrane is put back in place."}

The membrane will be held in place by stitches, splints, or packing material.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThe main reasons for this surgery are:\nTo repair a crooked, bent, or deformed nasal septum that blocks the airway in the nose. People with this condition very often  breathe through their mouth and may be more likely to get nasal or sinus infections.\nTo treat\nnosebleeds\nthat cannot be controlled.\nTo help alleviate snoring resulting from a nasal blockage.\nRisks\nRisks for any surgery are:\nAllergic reactions to medicines\nBreathing problems\nHeart problems\nBleeding\nInfection\nRisks for this surgery are:\nReturn of the nasal blockage."}
