It is done to identify organisms that cause infection.\nPericardial fluid Gram stain\nis a related topic.\nHow the Test is Performed\nSome people may have a cardiac monitor placed before the test to check for heart rhythm disturbances. Patches called electrodes will be placed on the chest, similar to during an\nECG.\nchest x-ray\nor\nultrasound\nmay be done before the test.\nThe skin of the chest will be cleaned with antibacterial soap. A health care provider inserts a small needle into the chest between the ribs into the thin sac that surrounds the heart (the pericardium). A small amount of fluid is removed.\nYou may have an ECG and chest x-ray after the test. Sometimes the pericardial fluid is taken during open heart surgery.\nThe sample is sent to a lab. Samples of the fluid are placed on dishes of growth media to see if bacteria grow."}

It can take a few days to several (6 to 8) weeks to get the test results.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will be asked to not eat or drink anything for several hours before the test. You may have a chest x-ray or ultrasound before the test to identify the area of fluid collection.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will feel some pressure and discomfort when the needle is inserted into the chest and the fluid is removed. Your provider should be able to give you pain medicine so that the procedure does not hurt very much.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order this test if you have a heart infection (myocarditis), signs of a heart sac infection, or a pericardial effusion (fluid buildup in the pericardium) with an unknown cause.\nThe test may also be done if you have or are suspected to have\npericarditis\n.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means no bacteria or fungi are found in the fluid sample.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be due to an infection of the pericardium."}
