It is the most common type of birth defect. CHD causes more deaths in the first year of life than any other birth defects.\nCHD is often divided into two types:\ncyanotic\n(blue skin color caused by a lack of oxygen) and non-cyanotic. The following lists cover the most common CHDs:\nCyanotic:\nEbstein anomaly\nHypoplastic left heart\nPulmonary atresia\nTetralogy of Fallot\nTotal anomalous pulmonary venous return\nTransposition of the great vessels\nTricuspid atresia\nTruncus arteriosus\nNon-cyanotic:\nAortic stenosis\nBicuspid aortic valve\nAtrial septal defect\n(ASD)\nAtrioventricular canal (\nendocardial cushion defect\n)\nCoarctation of the aorta\nPatent ductus arteriosus\n(PDA)\nPulmonic stenosis\nVentricular septal defect\n(VSD)\nThese problems may occur alone or together. Most children with CHD do not have other types of birth defects."}

Most children with CHD do not have other types of birth defects. However, heart defects may be part of genetic and chromosomal syndromes. Some of these syndromes may be passed down through families.\nExamples include:\nDiGeorge syndrome\nDown syndrome\nMarfan syndrome\nNoonan syndrome\nEdwards syndrome\nTrisomy 13\nTurner syndrome\nOften, no cause for the heart disease can be found. CHDs continue to be investigated and researched. Drugs such as retinoic acid for acne, chemicals, alcohol, and infections (such as\nrubella\n) during pregnancy can contribute to some congenital heart problems.\nPoorly controlled blood sugar in women who have diabetes during pregnancy has also been linked to an increased rate of congenital heart defects.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms depend on the condition. Although CHD is present at birth, the symptoms may not appear right away.\nDefects such as\ncoarctation of the aorta\nmay not cause problems for years."}

Although CHD is present at birth, the symptoms may not appear right away.\nDefects such as\ncoarctation of the aorta\nmay not cause problems for years. Other problems, such as a small\nVSD\n, ASD, or PDA may never cause any problems.\nExams and Tests\nMost congenital heart defects are found during a\npregnancy ultrasound\n. When a defect is found this way, a pediatric heart doctor, surgeon, and other specialists can be there when the baby is delivered. Having medical care ready at the delivery can mean the difference between life and death for some babies.\nWhich tests are done on the baby depend on the defect and the symptoms.\nTreatment\nWhich treatment is used, and how well the baby responds to it, depends on the condition. Many defects need to be followed carefully. Some will heal over time, while others will need to be treated.\nSome CHDs can be treated with medicine alone. Others need to be treated with one or more heart procedures or surgeries.\nPrevention\nWomen who plan to become pregnant should be immunized against rubella if they are not already immune."}

Rubella infection in a pregnant woman can cause CHD.\nWomen who are pregnant should get good prenatal care:\nAvoid alcohol and illegal drugs during pregnancy.\nTell your health care provider that you are pregnant before taking any new medicines.\nHave a blood test early in your pregnancy to see if you are immune to rubella. If you are not immune, avoid any possible exposure to rubella and get vaccinated right after delivery.\nPregnant women who have diabetes should try to get good control over their blood sugar level.\nCertain genes may play a role in CHD. Many family members may be affected. Talk to your provider about genetic counseling and screening if you have a family history of CHD.\nImages\nHeart - section through the middle\nHeart - front view\nUltrasound, normal fetus - heartbeat\nUltrasound, ventricular septal defect - heartbeat\nPatent ductus arteriosis (PDA) - series\nReferences\nValente AM, Dorfman AL, Babu-Narayan SV, Kreiger EV.
