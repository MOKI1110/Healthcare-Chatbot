They may disappear with time or reappear in different areas of the lung.\nbronchoscopy\nwith washing usually shows a large number of eosinophils.\nA procedure that removes the stomach contents (\ngastric lavage\n) may show signs of the ascaris worm or another parasite.\nTreatment\nIf you are allergic to a medicine, your provider may tell you to stop taking it. Never stop taking a medicine without first talking with your provider.\nIf the condition is due to an infection, you may be treated with an antibiotic or antiparasitic medicine.\nSometimes, anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids are given, especially if you have aspergillosis.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe disease often goes away without treatment. If treatment is needed, the response is usually good."}

If treatment is needed, the response is usually good. But, the disease can come back, especially if the condition does not have a specific cause and needs to be treated with corticosteroids.\nPossible Complications\nA rare complication of simple pulmonary eosinophilia is a severe type of pneumonia called acute idiopathic eosinophilic pneumonia.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nSee your provider if you have symptoms that may be linked with this disorder.\nPrevention\nThis is a rare disorder. Many times, the cause cannot be found. Minimizing exposure to possible risk factors, such as certain medicines or parasites, may reduce the chance of developing this disorder.\nAlternative Names\nPulmonary infiltrates with eosinophilia; Loffler syndrome;  Eosinophilic pneumonia; Pneumonia - eosinophilic\nImages\nLungs\nRespiratory system\nReferences\nCottin V.
