A cut may be deep, smooth, or jagged. It may be near the surface of the skin, or deeper. A deep cut can affect tendons, muscles, ligaments, nerves, blood vessels, or bone.\nA puncture is a wound made by a pointed object such as a nail, knife, or sharp tooth. Puncture wounds often appear to be on the surface, but may extend into the deeper tissue layers.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nBleeding\nProblems with function (movement) or feeling (numbness, tingling) below the wound site\nPain\nInfection may occur with some cuts and puncture wounds. The following are more likely to become infected:\nBites\nPunctures\nCrush injuries\nDirty wounds\nWounds on the feet\nWounds that are not promptly treated\nFirst Aid\nIf the wound is bleeding severely, call 911 or the local emergency number.\nMinor cuts and puncture wounds can be treated at home."}
