It is an emergency life-saving procedure that is done when someone's breathing or heartbeat has stopped. This may happen after a medical emergency, such as an\nelectric shock\n, heart attack, or drowning.\nCPR combines rescue breathing and chest compressions.\nRescue breathing provides oxygen to the person's lungs.\nChest compressions keep oxygen-rich blood flowing until the heartbeat and breathing can be restored.\nPermanent brain damage or death can occur in as little as 4 minutes if blood flow stops. Therefore, it is very important that blood flow and breathing be continued until trained medical help arrives."}
