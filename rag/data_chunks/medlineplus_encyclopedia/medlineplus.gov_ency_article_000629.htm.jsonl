The disease affects the small intestine and lungs.\nCauses\nThe infection is caused by infestation with any of the following roundworms:\nNecator americanus\nAncylostoma duodenale\nAncylostoma ceylanicum\nAncylostoma braziliense\nThe first two roundworms affect humans only. The last two types also occur in animals.\nHookworm disease is common in the moist tropics and subtropics. In developing nations, the disease leads to the death of many children by weakening their immune system and increasing their risk for infections that their bodies would normally fight off.\nThere is very little risk of getting the disease in the United States because of advances in sanitation and waste control. The important factor in getting the disease is walking barefoot on ground where there are feces of people who are infected with hookworm.\nThe larvae (immature form of the worm) enter the skin. The larvae move to the lungs via the bloodstream and enter the airways."}

The larvae move to the lungs via the bloodstream and enter the airways. The worms are about one-half inch (1 centimeter) long.\nAfter traveling up the windpipe, the larvae are swallowed. After the larvae are swallowed, they infect the small intestine. They develop into adult worms and live there for 1 or more years. The worms attach to the intestinal wall and suck blood, which can result in iron deficiency anemia and protein loss. Adult worms and larvae are released in the feces.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nAbdominal discomfort\nCough\nDiarrhea\nFatigue\nFever\nGas\nItchy rash\nLoss of appetite\nNausea, vomiting\nPale skin\nMost people have no symptoms once the worms enter the intestines.\nExams and Tests\nTests that can help diagnose the infection include:\nComplete blood count\n(CBC) with\ndifferential\nStool ova and parasites exam\nTreatment\nThe goals of treatment are to:\nCure the infection\nTreat complications of anemia\nImprove nutrition\nParasite-killing drugs such as albendazole, mebendazole, or pyrantel pamoate are often prescribed.\nSymptoms and complications of ane"}
