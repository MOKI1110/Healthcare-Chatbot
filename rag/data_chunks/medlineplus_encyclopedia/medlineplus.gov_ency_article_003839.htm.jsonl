PPD stands for purified protein derivative.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will need two visits to your health care provider's office for this test.\nAt the first visit, the provider will clean an area of your skin, usually the inside of your forearm. You will get a small shot (injection) that contains PPD. The needle is gently placed under the top layer of skin, causing a bump (welt) to form. This bump usually goes away in a few hours as the material is absorbed.\nAfter 48 to 72 hours, you must return to your provider's office (in some cases, this can be done virtually). Your provider will check the area to see if you have had a strong reaction to the test.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no special preparation for this test.\nTell your provider if you have ever had a positive PPD skin test."}

If so, you should not have a repeat PPD test, except under unusual circumstances.\nTell your provider if you have a medical condition or if you take certain medicines, such as steroids, which can affect your immune system. These situations may lead to inaccurate test results.\nTell your provider if you have received the BCG vaccine and if so, when you received it. (This vaccine is only given outside of the United States).\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will feel a brief sting as the needle is inserted just below the skin surface.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to find out if you have ever come in contact with the bacteria that cause TB.\nTB is an easily spread (contagious) disease. It most often affects the lungs. The bacteria can remain inactive (dormant) in the lungs for many years."}

It most often affects the lungs. The bacteria can remain inactive (dormant) in the lungs for many years.

Interpreting the size of the swelling is different for children, people with HIV, and other high-risk groups.\nThe PPD skin test is not a perfect screening test. A few people infected with the bacteria that cause TB may not have a reaction."}

A few people infected with the bacteria that cause TB may not have a reaction. Also, diseases or medicines that weaken the immune system may cause a false-negative result.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal (positive) result means you have been infected with the bacteria that cause TB. You may need treatment to lower the risk of the disease coming back (reactivation of the disease). A positive skin test does not mean that a person has active TB. More tests must be done to check whether there is active disease.\nA small reaction (5 mm or more of firm swelling at the site) is considered to be positive in people:\nWho have HIV/AIDS\nWho have received an organ transplant\nWho have a suppressed immune system or are taking steroid therapy (about 15 mg of prednisone per day for 1 month)\nWho have been in close contact with a person who has active TB\nWho have changes on a\nchest x-ray\nthat look like past TB\nLarger reactions (10 mm or more) are considered positive in:\nPeople with a known negative test in the past 2 years\nPeople with\ndiabetes\n,\nkidney failure\n, or other cond"}
