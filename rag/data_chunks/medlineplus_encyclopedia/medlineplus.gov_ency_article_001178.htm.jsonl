Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSimple goiter\nSimple goiter\nA simple goiter is an enlargement of the thyroid gland. It is usually not a tumor or cancer.\nCauses\nThe thyroid gland is an important organ of the\nendocrine system\n. It is located at the front of the neck just above where your collarbones meet. The gland makes the hormones that control the way every cell in the body uses energy. This process is called\nmetabolism\n.\nIodine deficiency is the most common cause of goiter. The body needs iodine to produce thyroid hormone. If you do not have enough iodine in your diet, the thyroid gets larger to try and capture all the iodine it can, so it can make the right amount of thyroid hormone. So, a goiter can be a sign the thyroid is not able to make enough thyroid hormone."}

So, a goiter can be a sign the thyroid is not able to make enough thyroid hormone. The use of iodized salt in the United States prevents a lack of iodine in the diet for people who use it.\nOther causes of goiter include:\nThe body's immune system attacking the thyroid gland (\nautoimmune problem\n)\nCertain medicines (lithium, amiodarone)\nInfections (rare)\nCigarette smoking\nEating very large amounts of certain foods (soy, peanuts, or vegetables in the broccoli and cabbage family)\nToxic nodular goiter\n, an enlarged thyroid gland that has a small growth or many growths called nodules, which produce too much thyroid hormone\nSimple goiters are more common in:\nPeople over age 40\nPeople with a family history of goiter\nPeople who are born and raised in areas with iodine deficiency\nWomen\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom is an enlarged thyroid gland."}

The size may range from a single small\nnodule\nto a large mass at the front of the neck.\nSome people with a simple goiter may have symptoms of an\nunderactive thyroid\ngland.\nIn rare cases, an enlarged thyroid can put pressure on the windpipe (trachea) and food tube (esophagus). This can lead to:\nBreathing difficulties\n(with very large goiters), especially when lying flat on the back or when reaching up with your arms\nCough\nHoarseness\nSwallowing difficulties, especially with solid food\nPain in the area of the thyroid\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will do a physical exam. This involves feeling your neck as you swallow. Swelling in the area of the thyroid may be felt.\nIf you have a very large goiter, you may have pressure on your neck veins."}
