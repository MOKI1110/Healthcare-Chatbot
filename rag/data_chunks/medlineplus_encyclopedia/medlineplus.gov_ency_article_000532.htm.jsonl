These cells are found in the bone marrow and other parts of the body. Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells.\nCLL causes a slow increase in a certain type of white blood cells called B lymphocytes, or B cells. Cancer cells spread through the blood and bone marrow. CLL can also affect the lymph nodes or other organs such as the liver and spleen. CLL eventually can cause the bone marrow to lose its function.\nCauses\nThe cause of CLL is unknown. There is no link to radiation exposure. It is unclear if certain chemicals can cause CLL. Exposure to Agent Orange during the Vietnam War has been linked to a slight increased risk for developing CLL.\nCLL usually affects older adults, especially those over age 60. People under age 45 rarely develop CLL. CLL is more common in white people than in people of other races."}

People under age 45 rarely develop CLL. CLL is more common in white people than in people of other races. It is more common in men than in women. Some people with CLL have family members with the disease.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms usually develop slowly. CLL often does not cause symptoms at first. It may be found by blood tests done in people for other reasons.\nSymptoms of CLL may include:\nEnlarged lymph nodes\n, liver, or spleen\nExcessive sweating\n, night sweats\nFatigue\nFever\nInfections that keep coming back (recur), despite treatment\nLoss of appetite\nor becoming full too quickly (early satiety)\nWeight loss\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.\nTests to diagnose CLL may include:\nComplete blood count (CBC)\nwith\nblood cell differential\n.\nFlow cytometry test of the white blood cells.\nFluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) is used to look at and count genes or chromosomes."}

This test may help diagnose CLL or guide treatment.\nTesting for other gene changes may help predict how well the cancer will respond to treatment.\nPeople with CLL usually have a high\nwhite blood cell count\n.\nTests that look at changes in the DNA inside the cancer cells may also be done. Results from these tests and from staging tests help your provider determine your treatment.\nTreatment\nIf you have early stage CLL, your provider will just monitor you closely. Treatment is not generally given for early-stage CLL, unless you have:\nInfections that keep coming back\nLeukemia that is rapidly getting worse\nLow red blood cell or platelet counts\nFatigue, loss of appetite, weight loss, or night sweats\nSwollen lymph nodes\nTargeted therapy\nand sometimes\nchemotherapy\nare used to treat CLL."}

A transplant is the only therapy that offers a potential cure for CLL, but it also has risks. Your provider will discuss the risks and benefits with you.\nYou and your provider may need to manage other concerns during your leukemia treatment, including:\nManaging your pets\nduring chemotherapy\nBleeding problems\nDry mouth\nEating enough calories\nSafe eating\nduring cancer treatment\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\ncancer support group\n."}
