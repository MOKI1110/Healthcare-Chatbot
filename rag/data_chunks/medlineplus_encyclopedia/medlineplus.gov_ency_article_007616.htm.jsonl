The syndrome is present from birth (congenital). However, it often isn't diagnosed until about 6 to 12 months of age. This is when development problems are first noticed in most cases.\nCauses\nThis condition involves the gene\nUBE3A\n.\nMost genes come in pairs. Children receive one from each parent. In most cases, both genes are active. This means information from both genes is used by the cells. With the\nUBE3A\ngene, both parents pass it on, but only the gene passed on from the mother is active.\nAngelman syndrome most often occurs because the\nUBE3A\ngene passed on from the mother doesn't work the way it should. In some cases, AS is caused when two copies of the\nUBE3A\ngene come from the father, and none come from the mother."}

These tests look for:\nMissing pieces of chromosomes\nSpecific DNA to see if copies of the gene from both parents are in an inactive or active state\nA gene variant in the copy of the gene inherited from the mother\nOther tests may include:\nBrain MRI\nEEG\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for Angelman syndrome."}

If you have a child with AS or a family history of the condition, you may want to talk with your provider before becoming pregnant.\nReferences\nKumar V, Abbas AK, Aster JC, Deyrup AT, Das A.
