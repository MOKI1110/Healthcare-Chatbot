Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLimb plethysmography\nLimb plethysmography\nLimb plethysmography is a test that compares blood pressure in the legs and arms.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis test may be done in the health care provider's office or in a hospital. You will be asked to lie with the upper part of your body slightly raised.\nThree or four blood pressure cuffs are wrapped snugly around your arm and leg. The provider inflates the cuffs, and a machine called a plethysmograph measures the pulses from each cuff. The test records the maximum pressure produced when the heart contracts (systolic blood pressure).\nDifferences between the pulses are noted. If there is a decrease in the pulse between the arm and leg, it may indicate a blockage.\nWhen the test is complete, the blood pressure cuffs are removed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nDo not smoke for at least 30 minutes before the test. You will be asked to remove all clothing from the arm and leg being tested.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou should not have much discomfort with this test."}

You will be asked to remove all clothing from the arm and leg being tested.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou should not have much discomfort with this test. You should only feel the pressure of the blood pressure cuff. The test often takes less than 20 to 30 minutes to perform.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is most often done to check for narrowing or blockages of blood vessels (arteries) in the arms or legs.\nNormal Results\nThere should be less than a 20 to 30 mm Hg difference in the systolic blood pressure of the leg compared with that of the arm.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be due to:\nArterial occlusive disease\nBlood clots\nBlood vessel changes due to diabetes\nInjury to an artery\nOther blood vessel disease (vascular disease)\nOther conditions for which the test may be performed:\nDeep venous thrombosis\nIf you have an abnormal result, you may need to have more testing to find the exact site of the narrowing.\nRisks\nThere are no risks.\nConsiderations\nThis test is not as accurate as an\narteriography\n. Plethysmography may be done for very ill people who cannot travel to the arteriography lab."}

Plethysmography may be done for very ill people who cannot travel to the arteriography lab. This test can be used to check for vascular disease or to follow up earlier abnormal tests.\nThe test is noninvasive, and it does not use x-rays or injection of dye. It is also less expensive than an angiogram.\nAlternative Names\nPlethysmography - limb\nImages\nVenous blood clot\nReferences\nBonaca MP, Creager MA. Peripheral artery diseases.
