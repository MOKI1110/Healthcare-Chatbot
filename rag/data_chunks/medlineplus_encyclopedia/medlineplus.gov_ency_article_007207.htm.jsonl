The procedure can be done with a large (open) incision or with\nshoulder arthroscopy\n, which uses smaller incisions.\nDescription\nThe rotator cuff is a group of muscles and tendons that form a cuff over the shoulder joint. These muscles and tendons hold the arm in its joint and help the shoulder joint to move in a coordinated and pain free way. The tendons can be torn from overuse, injury, or wearing away over time.\nYou will likely receive\ngeneral anesthesia\nbefore this surgery. This means you will be asleep and unable to feel pain. Or, you will have regional anesthesia. Your arm and shoulder area will be numbed so that you do not feel any pain."}

This means you will be asleep and unable to feel pain. Or, you will have regional anesthesia. Your arm and shoulder area will be numbed so that you do not feel any pain. If you receive regional anesthesia, you will also be given medicine to make you very sleepy during the operation.\nThree common techniques are used to repair a rotator cuff tear:\nDuring open repair, a surgical incision is made and a large muscle (the deltoid) is gently moved out of the way to do the surgery. Open repair is done for large or more complex tears.\nDuring arthroscopy, the arthroscope is inserted through a small incision. The scope is connected to a video monitor. This allows the surgeon to view the inside of the shoulder. One to three additional small incisions are made to allow other instruments to be inserted.\nDuring mini-open repair, any damaged tissue or bone spurs are removed or repaired using an arthroscope."}

Then during the open part of the surgery, a 2- to 3-inch (5 to 7.5 centimeters) incision is made to repair the rotator cuff.\nTo repair the rotator cuff:\nThe tendons are re-attached to the bone.\nSmall rivets (called suture anchors) are often used to help attach the tendon to the bone. The suture anchors can be made of metal or material that dissolves over time, and do not need to be removed.\nSutures (stitches) are attached to the anchors, which tie the tendon back to the bone.\nAt the end of the surgery, the incisions are closed, and a dressing is applied."}

If arthroscopy was performed, most surgeons take pictures of the procedure from the video monitor to show you what they found and the repairs that were made.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nReasons rotator cuff repair may be done include:\nYou have shoulder pain when you rest or at night, and it has not improved with a specific exercise program (physical therapy) over 3 to 4 months.\nYou are active and use your shoulder for sports or work.\nYou have weakness and are unable to do everyday activities.\nSurgery is a good choice when:\nYou have a complete rotator cuff tear.\nA tear was caused by a recent injury.\nSeveral months of physical therapy hasn't improved your symptoms.\nThe tear is causing significant loss of function and symptoms.\nA partial tear may not require surgery. Instead, rest and exercise are used to heal the shoulder. This approach is often best for people who do not place a lot of demand on their shoulder. Pain can be expected to improve."}

This includes medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\nDuring the 2 weeks before your surgery:\nYou may be asked to temporarily stop taking blood thinners."}

Ask your provider for help. Smoking can slow wound and bone healing.\nTell your surgeon if you develop a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness before your surgery. The procedure may need to be postponed.\nOn the day of surgery:\nFollow instructions on when to stop eating and drinking before the surgery.\nTake the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\nFollow instructions on when to arrive at the hospital."}

Some people also wear a shoulder immobilizer. This keeps your shoulder from moving. How long you wear the sling or immobilizer will depend on the type of surgery you had.\nRecovery can take 4 to 6 months, depending on the size of the tear and other factors. You may have to wear a sling for 4 to 6 weeks after surgery. Pain is usually managed with medicines.\nPhysical therapy can help you regain the motion and strength of your shoulder. The length of therapy will depend on the repair that was done.
