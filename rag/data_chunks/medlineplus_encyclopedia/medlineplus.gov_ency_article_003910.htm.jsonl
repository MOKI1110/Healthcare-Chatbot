Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCone biopsy\nCone biopsy\nA cone biopsy (conization) is surgery to remove a sample of abnormal tissue from the cervix. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina. Abnormal changes in the cells on the surface of the cervix is called\ncervical dysplasia\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis procedure is done in the hospital or in a surgery center. During the procedure:\nYou will be given general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free), or medicines to help you relax and feel sleepy.\nYou will lie on a table and place your feet in stirrups to position your pelvis for exam. The health care provider will place an instrument (speculum) into your vagina to better see your cervix.\nA small cone-shaped sample of tissue is removed from your\ncervix\n. The procedure may be performed using a wire loop heated by electrical current (LEEP procedure), a scalpel (cold knife biopsy), or a laser beam.\nThe cervical canal above the cone biopsy may also be scraped to remove cells for evaluation."}

This is called an endocervical curettage (ECC).\nThe sample is examined under a microscope for signs of cancer. This biopsy may also be a treatment if the provider removes all of the diseased tissue.\nMost of the time, you will be able to go home the same day as the procedure.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked to not eat or drink for 6 to 8 hours before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nAfter the procedure, you may have some cramping or discomfort for about a week. For about 4 to 6 weeks avoid:\nDouching (douching should never be done)\nSexual intercourse\nUsing tampons\nFor 2 to 3 weeks after the procedure, you may have discharge that is:\nBloody\nHeavy\nYellow-colored\nWhy the Test is Performed\nCone biopsy is done to detect cervical cancer or early changes that lead to cancer."}

These changes are called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN)."}

These changes are called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). The changes are divided into 3 groups:\nCIN I -- mild dysplasia\nCIN II -- moderate to marked dysplasia\nCIN III -- severe dysplasia to carcinoma in situ\nAbnormal results may also be due to cervical cancer.\nRisks\nRisks of cone biopsy include:\nBleeding\nIncompetent cervix (which may lead to premature delivery)\nInfection\nScarring of the cervix (which may cause painful periods, premature delivery, and difficulty getting pregnant)\nDamage to the bladder or rectum\nCone biopsy may also make it hard for your provider to interpret abnormal Pap smear results in the future.\nAlternative Names\nBiopsy - cone; Cervical conization; CKC; Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia - cone biopsy; CIN - cone biopsy; Precancerous changes of the cervix - cone biopsy; Cervical cancer - cone biopsy; Squamous intraepithelial lesion - cone biopsy; LSIL - cone biopsy; HSIL - cone biopsy; Low-grade cone biopsy; High-grade cone biopsy; Carcinoma in situ-cone biopsy; CIS - cone biopsy; ASCUS - cone biopsy; Atypical glandular c"}
