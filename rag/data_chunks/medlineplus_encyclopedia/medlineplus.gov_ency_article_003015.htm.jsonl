Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEar tube insertion\nEar tube insertion\nEar tube insertion involves placing tubes through the eardrums. The eardrum is the thin layer of tissue that separates the outer and middle ear.\nNote: This article focuses on ear tube insertion in children. However, most of the information could also apply to adults with similar symptoms or problems.\nDescription\nWhile the child is asleep and pain-free (\ngeneral anesthesia\n), a small surgical cut is made in the eardrum. Any fluid that has collected behind the eardrum is removed with suction through this cut.\nThen, a small tube is placed through the cut in the eardrum. The tube allows air to flow in so that pressure is the same on both sides of the eardrum. Also, trapped fluid can flow out of the middle ear. This prevents hearing loss and reduces the risk of ear infections.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThe\nbuildup of fluid behind your child's eardrum\nmay cause some hearing loss."}

But most children do not have long-term damage to their hearing or speech, even when the fluid is there for many months.\nEar tube insertion may be done when fluid builds up behind your child's eardrum and:\nDoes not go away after 3 months and both ears are affected\nDoes not go away after 6 months and fluid is only in one ear\nEar infections\nthat do not go away with treatment or that keep coming back are also reasons for placing an ear tube."}

A hearing test is also recommended before the procedure is done.\nAlways tell your child's provider:\nWhat medicines your child is taking, including medicines, herbs, and vitamins you bought without a prescription.\nWhat allergies your child may have to any medicines, latex, tape, or skin cleaner.\nOn the day of the surgery:\nYour child may be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before the surgery.\nGive your child a small sip of water with any medicines you have been told to give your child.\nYour child's provider will tell you when to arrive at the hospital.\nThe provider will make sure your child is healthy enough for surgery."}

This means your child has no signs of illness or infection. If your child is ill, the surgery may be delayed.\nAfter the Procedure\nChildren most often stay in the recovery room for a short time and leave the hospital the same day as the ear tubes are inserted. Your child may be groggy and fussy for an hour or so while waking up from anesthesia. Your child's provider may prescribe ear drops or antibiotics for a few days after the surgery. Your child's provider may also ask that you keep the ears dry for a specific period of time.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAfter this procedure, most parents report that their children:\nHave fewer ear infections\nRecover more quickly from infections\nHave better hearing\nIf the tubes do not fall out on their own in a few years, an ear specialist may have to remove them."}
