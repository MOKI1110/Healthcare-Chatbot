It is very common, affecting about two thirds of the world's population.\nH pylori\ninfection is the most common cause of\npeptic ulcers\n. However, the infection does not cause problems for most people.\nCauses\nH pylori\nbacteria are most likely passed directly from person to person. This tends to happen during childhood. The infection remains throughout life if not treated.\nIt's not clear how the bacteria are passed from one person to another. The bacteria may spread from:\nMouth-to-mouth contact\nGI tract illness (particularly when vomiting occurs)\nContact with stool (fecal material)\nContaminated food and water\nThe bacteria may trigger ulcers in the following way:\nH pylori\nenters the mucus layer of the stomach and attaches to the stomach lining.\nH pylori\ncause the stomach to produce more stomach acid."}

This damages the stomach lining, leading to ulcers in some people.\nBesides ulcers,\nH pylori\nbacteria can also cause a\nchronic\ninflammation in the stomach (gastritis) or the upper part of the small intestine (duodenitis) and duodenal ulcers.\nH pylori\ncan also sometimes lead to stomach cancer or a rare type of stomach lymphoma.\nSymptoms\nAbout 10% to 15% of people infected with\nH pylori\ndevelop peptic ulcer disease. Small ulcers may not cause any symptoms. Some ulcers can cause serious bleeding.\nAn aching or burning pain in your abdomen is a common symptom. The pain may be worse with an empty stomach."}

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can also cause ulcers. If you have an ulcer or show symptoms of an\nH pylori\ninfection, your provider may perform the following tests for\nH pylori\nBreath test -- urea breath test (Carbon Isotope-urea Breath Test, or UBT).

This is detected and recorded in your exhaled breath after 10 minutes.\nBlood test\n-- measures antibodies to\nH pylori\nin your blood.\nStool test -- detects the presence of\nH pylori\nin your stool.\nBiopsy\n-- tests a tissue sample taken from the stomach lining using\nendoscopy\n. The sample is checked for\nH pylori\ninfection.\nTreatment\nIn order for your ulcer to heal and to reduce the chance it will come back, you will be given medicines to:\nKill the\nH pylori\nbacteria (if present)\nReduce acid levels in your stomach\nTake all of your medicines as you have been told. Other\nlifestyle changes\ncan also help.\nIf you have a peptic ulcer and an\nH pylori\ninfection, treatment is recommended."}

The standard treatment involves different combinations of the following medicines for 10 to 14 days:\nAntibiotics to kill\nH pylori\nProton pump inhibitors to help lower acid levels in the stomach\nBismuth (the main ingredient in Pepto-Bismol) may be added to help kill the bacteria\nTaking all of these medicines for up to 14 days is not easy. But doing so gives you the best chance for getting rid of the\nH pylori\nbacteria and preventing ulcers in the future.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf you take your medicines, there is a good chance that the\nH pylori\ninfection will be cured. You will be much less likely to get another ulcer.\nSometimes,\nH pylori\ncan be hard to fully cure. Repeated courses of different treatments may be needed. A stomach biopsy will sometimes be done to test the germ to see which antibiotic might work best. This can help guide future treatment."}
