Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nGilbert syndrome\nGilbert syndrome\nGilbert syndrome is a common disorder passed down through families. It affects the way bilirubin is processed by the liver, and may cause the skin to take on a yellow color (\njaundice\n) at times.\nCauses\nGilbert syndrome affects 1 in 10 people in some white groups. This condition occurs due to an abnormal gene, which is passed from parents to their children.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nFatigue\nYellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (mild jaundice)\nIn people with Gilbert syndrome, jaundice most often appears during times of exertion, stress, and infection, or when they do not eat.\nExams and Tests\nA blood test for bilirubin shows changes that occur with Gilbert syndrome. The total bilirubin level is mildly elevated, with most being unconjugated bilirubin."}

The total bilirubin level is mildly elevated, with most being unconjugated bilirubin. Most often the total level is less than 2 mg/dL, and the conjugated bilirubin level is normal.\nGilbert syndrome is due to a genetic change, but genetic testing is not needed.\nTreatment\nNo treatment is necessary for Gilbert syndrome.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nJaundice may come and go throughout life. It is more likely to appear during illnesses such as colds. It does not cause health problems. However, it can confuse the results of tests for jaundice.\nPossible Complications\nThere are no known complications.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have jaundice or pain in the abdomen that does not go away.\nPrevention\nThere is no proven prevention.\nAlternative Names\nIcterus intermittens juvenilis; Low-grade chronic hyperbilirubinemia; Familial non-hemolytic-non-obstructive jaundice; Constitutional liver dysfunction; Unconjugated benign bilirubinemia; Gilbert disease; Gilbert's syndrome\nImages\nDigestive system\nReferences\nKorenblat KM, Berk PD."}
