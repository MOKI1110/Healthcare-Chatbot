The sample is taken during a procedure called\nesophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)\n. The tissue is removed by using a tiny tool or a brush at the end of the scope.\nThe sample is sent to a lab. There, it is placed in a special dish (culture) and watched for the growth of bacteria, fungi, or viruses.\nOther tests may be done to determine what medicine can best treat the organism.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nFollow your health care provider's instructions on how to prepare for EGD.\nHow the Test will Feel\nDuring EGD, you will receive medicine to relax you. You may have some discomfort or feel like gagging as the endoscope is passed through your mouth and throat into the esophagus."}
