Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCulture - colonic tissue\nCulture - colonic tissue\nA colonic tissue culture is a lab test to check for the cause of disease. The sample of tissue for the test is taken from the large intestine during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe health care provider removes a piece of tissue from your large intestine. This is done during a sigmoidoscopy or\ncolonoscopy\n.\nThe sample is sent to a lab.\nIt is placed in a special dish that contains a gel. Bacteria and other organisms can grow in this gel. The dish is then stored at a certain temperature.\nThe lab team checks the sample daily. They check to see if bacteria, viruses, or fungi have grown.\nIf certain germs grow, more tests will be done to identify them. This helps decide the best treatment.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no specific preparation needed for a culture itself. However, you will have to prepare for the sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy if that is how your provider is getting the tissue sample."}

However, you will have to prepare for the sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy if that is how your provider is getting the tissue sample. Speak with your provider about how to prepare.\nHow the Test will Feel\nOnce the sample is taken, the culture does not involve you. Therefore, there is no pain.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider  may order this test if you have signs or symptoms of a large intestine infection. Colonic tissue culture is only done occasionally. More often, tests are done on stool to identify a large intestine infection. A colonic tissue culture is most often done only when other tests, such as a\nstool culture\n, could not identify the cause of infection.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means that no disease-causing organisms have grown in the lab dish.\nSome \"healthy\" bacteria, called bowel flora, are normally found in the gut. The growth of such bacteria during this test does not mean there is an infection.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}

These organisms may include:\nClostridioides difficile\nbacteria\nCytomegalovirus\nMycobacterium tuberculosis\nbacteria\nSalmonella bacteria\nShigella bacteria\nThese organisms may lead to colon infections or\ndiarrhea\n.\nRisks\nThere is very minimal risk associated with the procedure. In rare cases, excessive bleeding could occur when a tissue sample is taken.\nAlternative Names\nColonic tissue culture\nImages\nColonoscopy\nColon culture\nReferences\nFleckenstein JM.
