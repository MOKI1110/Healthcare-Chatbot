Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAortic angiography\nAortic angiography\nAortic angiography is a procedure that uses a special dye and x-rays to see how blood flows through the aorta. The aorta is the large artery that carries blood from your heart to your belly, pelvis, and legs.\nAngiography uses\nx-rays\nand a special dye to see the insides of the arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis test is done at a hospital or specialized procedure unit. Before the test starts, you will be given a mild sedative to help you relax.\nAn area of your body, most often in your arm or groin area, is cleaned and numbed with a local numbing medicine (anesthetic).\nA radiologist or cardiologist will place a needle into the groin blood vessel. A guidewire and a long tube (catheter) will be passed through this needle.\nThe catheter is moved into the aorta. The doctor can see live images of the aorta on a TV-like monitor. X-rays are used to guide the catheter to the correct position.\nOnce the catheter is in place, dye is injected into it."}

The doctor can see live images of the aorta on a TV-like monitor. X-rays are used to guide the catheter to the correct position.\nOnce the catheter is in place, dye is injected into it. X-ray images are taken to see how the dye moves through the aorta. The dye helps detect any blockages in blood flow.\nAfter the x-rays or treatments are finished, the catheter is removed. Pressure is applied to the puncture site for 20 to 45 minutes to stop the bleeding. After that time, the area is checked and a tight bandage is applied. The leg is most often kept straight for another 6 hours after the procedure. You should avoid strenuous activity, such as heavy lifting, for 24 to 48 hours.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 6 to 8 hours before the test.\nYou will wear a hospital gown and sign a consent form for the procedure."}
