One of these is the mitral valve. The mitral valve opens so blood can flow from the left atrium to the left ventricle. The valve then closes, keeping blood from flowing backward.\nYou may need surgery on your mitral valve if:\nThe mitral valve is hardened (calcified). This prevents blood from moving forward through the valve.\nThe mitral valve is too loose. Blood tends to flow backward when this occurs.\nIn this type of surgery, the surgeon makes a large cut in your breastbone to reach the heart. Other types of surgery use\nseveral smaller cuts.\nDescription\nBefore your surgery, you will receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n."}

You will be asleep and pain-free during the procedure.\nYour surgeon will make a 10-inch-long (25.4 centimeters) cut in the middle of your chest.\nNext, your surgeon will separate your breastbone in order to see your heart.\nMost people are connected to a heart-lung bypass machine or bypass pump. Your heart is stopped while you are connected to this machine. This machine does the work of your heart while your heart is stopped.\nA small cut is made in the left side of your heart so your surgeon can repair or replace the mitral valve.\nIf your surgeon can repair your mitral valve, you may have a:\nRing annuloplasty -- The surgeon repairs the ring-like part around the valve by sewing a ring of metal, cloth, or tissue around the valve.\nValve repair -- The surgeon trims, shapes, or rebuilds one or more of the two flaps (leaflets) of the valve.\nIf your mitral valve is too damaged to be repaired, you will need a new valve. This is called mitral valve replacement surgery."}

There are two types of mitral valves:\nMechanical, made of man-made (synthetic) materials, such as titanium. These valves last the longest. You will need to take blood-thinning medicine, such as warfarin (Coumadin), for the rest of your life.\nBiological, made of human or animal tissue. These valves last 10 to 12 years. You may not need to take blood thinners for life.\nOnce the new or repaired valve is working, your surgeon will:\nClose your heart and take you off the heart-lung machine.\nPlace catheters (tubes) around your heart to drain fluids that build up.\nClose your breastbone with stainless steel wires. It will take about 6 weeks for the bone to heal."}
