These are the tiny blood vessels inside the nephron where blood is filtered to make urine and waste is removed. The disease gets its name because this damage is not visible under a regular microscope. It can only be seen under a very powerful microscope called an electron microscope.\nMinimal change disease is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children."}

It rarely progresses to\nkidney failure\n.\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider may not be able to see any signs of the disease, other than swelling."}

Some children may need to stay on steroids to keep the disease from returning.\nSteroids are effective in adults, but less so in children. Adults may have more frequent relapses and become dependent on steroids.\nIf steroids are not effective, the provider will likely suggest other medicines.\nSwelling may be treated with:\nACE inhibitor medicines\nBlood pressure control\nDiuretics (water pills)\nYou may also be told to reduce the amount of salt in your diet.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nChildren usually respond better to corticosteroids than adults."}
