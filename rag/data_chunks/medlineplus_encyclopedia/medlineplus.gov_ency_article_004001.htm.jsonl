Condoms do not cost very much.\nHOW DOES A CONDOM WORK TO PREVENT PREGNANCY?\nIf the sperm contained in a male's semen reach a woman's vagina, pregnancy may occur. Condoms work by preventing sperm from coming in contact with the inside of the vagina.\nIf condoms are used correctly every time intercourse occurs, the risk of pregnancy is around 3 out of every 100 times. However, there is a higher chance of pregnancy if a condom:\nIs not used correctly during sexual contact\nBreaks or tears during use\nCondoms do not work as well at preventing pregnancy as some other forms of birth control. However, using a condom is much better than not using birth control at all.\nSome condoms contain substances that kill sperm, called a spermicide."}

Otherwise, the semen may push up the sides of the condom and come out at the bottom before the penis and condom are pulled out.\nBe sure there is not any air between the penis and the condom. This can cause the condom to break.\nSome people find it helpful to unroll the condom a little before putting it on the penis. This leaves plenty of room for semen to collect."}

It also prevents the condom from being stretched too tightly over the penis.\nAfter semen is released during climax, remove the condom from the vagina. The best way is to grasp the condom at the base of the penis and hold it as the penis is pulled out. Avoid having any semen spill into the vagina.\nIMPORTANT TIPS\nMake sure you have condoms around when you need them. If no condoms are handy, you may be tempted to have intercourse without one. Use each condom only once.\nStore condoms in a cool, dry place away from sunlight and heat.\nDo not carry condoms in your wallet for long periods of time. Replace them every once in a while. Wear and tear can create tiny holes in the condom. But, it is still better to use a condom that has been in your wallet for a long time than to not use one at all.\nDo not use a condom that is brittle, sticky, or discolored. These are signs of age, and old condoms are more likely to break.\nDo not use a condom if the package is damaged."}
