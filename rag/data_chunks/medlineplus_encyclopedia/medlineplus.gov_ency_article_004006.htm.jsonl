However, many other changes that are common with aging are due to or worsened by modifiable factors. If not treated, these can lead to heart disease.\nBACKGROUND\nThe heart has two sides. The right side pumps blood to the lungs to receive oxygen and get rid of carbon dioxide. The left side pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body.\nBlood flows out of the heart, first through the aorta, and then through arteries, which branch out and get smaller and smaller as they go into the tissues. In the tissues, they become tiny capillaries.\nCapillaries are where the blood gives up (releases) oxygen and nutrients to the tissues, and receives carbon dioxide and wastes back from the tissues."}

In the tissues, they become tiny capillaries.\nCapillaries are where the blood gives up (releases) oxygen and nutrients to the tissues, and receives carbon dioxide and wastes back from the tissues. Then, the vessels begin to collect together into larger and larger veins, which return blood to the heart.\nWatch this video about:\nBlood flow\nAGING CHANGES\nHeart:\nThe heart has a natural pacemaker system that controls the heartbeat. Some of the pathways of this system may develop fibrous tissue and fat deposits. The natural pacemaker (the sinoatrial or SA node) loses some of its cells. These changes may result in a slightly slower\nheart rate\n.\nA slight increase in the size of the heart, especially the left ventricle occurs in some people. The heart wall thickens, so the amount of blood that the chamber can hold may actually decrease despite the increased overall heart size. The heart may fill more slowly.\nHeart changes often cause the electrocardiogram (\nECG\n) of a normal, healthy older person to be slightly different than the ECG of a healthy younger adult. Abnormal rhythms (\narrhythmias\n), such as\natrial fibrillation\n, are more common in older people."}

Abnormal rhythms (\narrhythmias\n), such as\natrial fibrillation\n, are more common in older people. They may be caused by several types of heart disease.\nNormal changes in the heart include deposits of the \"aging pigment,\"\nlipofuscin\n. The heart muscle cells degenerate slightly. The valves inside the heart, which control the direction of blood flow, thicken and become stiffer. A heart murmur caused by valve stiffness is fairly common in older people.\nBlood vessels:\nReceptors called baroreceptors monitor the blood pressure and make changes to help maintain a fairly constant blood pressure when a person changes positions or is doing other activities. The baroreceptors become less sensitive with aging. This may explain why many older people have orthostatic hypotension, a condition in which the blood pressure falls when a person goes from lying or sitting to standing. This causes dizziness because there is less blood flow to the brain.\nThe capillary walls thicken slightly."}

This causes dizziness because there is less blood flow to the brain.\nThe capillary walls thicken slightly. This may cause a slightly slower rate of exchange of nutrients and wastes.\nThe main artery from the heart (aorta) becomes thicker, stiffer, and less flexible. This is probably related to changes in the connective tissue of the blood vessel wall. This makes the blood pressure higher and makes the heart work harder, which may lead to thickening of the heart muscle (hypertrophy). The other arteries also thicken and stiffen. In general, most older people have a moderate increase in blood pressure.\nBlood:\nThe blood itself changes slightly with age. Normal aging causes a reduction in total body water. As part of this, there is less fluid in the bloodstream, so blood volume decreases.\nThe speed with which red blood cells are produced in response to stress or illness is reduced."}

This creates a slower response to blood loss and anemia.\nMost of the white blood cells stay at the same levels, although certain white blood cells important to immunity (\nneutrophils\n) decrease in their number and ability to fight off bacteria. This reduces the ability to resist infection.\nEFFECT OF CHANGES\nNormally, the heart continues to pump enough blood to supply all parts of the body. However, an older heart may not be able to pump blood as well when you make it work harder.\nSome of the things that make your heart work harder are:\nCertain medicines\nEmotional stress\nPhysical exertion\nIllness\nInfections\nInjuries\nCaffeine and other stimulants in the diet\nCOMMON PROBLEMS\nAngina\n(chest pain caused by temporarily reduced blood flow to the heart muscle), shortness of breath with exertion, and\nheart attack\ncan result from coronary artery disease.\nAbnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias) of various types can occur.\nAnemia\nmay occur, possibly related to malnutrition, chronic infections, blood l"}

Fatty plaque deposits inside the blood vessels cause them to narrow and may totally block blood vessels.\nCongestive\nheart failure\nis also very common in older people. In people older than 75, congestive heart failure occurs 10 times more often than in younger adults.\nCoronary artery disease\nis fairly common. It is usually a result of atherosclerosis.\nHigh blood pressure and orthostatic hypotension are more common with older age.

They also tend to have fewer blood pressure problems and less heart disease.\nHave regular check-ups for your heart:\nHave your blood pressure checked every year. If you have diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other conditions, your blood pressure may need to be monitored more closely.\nIf your cholesterol level is normal, have it rechecked every 5 years.
