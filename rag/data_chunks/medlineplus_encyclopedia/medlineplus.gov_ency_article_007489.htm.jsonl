Most people use them for much shorter periods of time, days to weeks.\nNAMES OF COMMON NARCOTICS\nCodeine\nFentanyl -- available as a patch, lozenge, or lollipop\nHydrocodone\nHydromorphone\nMeperidine\nMorphine\nOxycodone\nTramadol\nTAKING NARCOTICS\nNarcotic pain medicines may be prescribed to treat:\nAcute pain, such as from injuries, surgery or other procedures, and other short-term medical problems.\nChronic pain, present for 3 months or more."}
