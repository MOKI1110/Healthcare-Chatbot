Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMovement - unpredictable or jerky\nMovement - unpredictable or jerky\nJerky body movement is a condition in which a person makes fast movements that they cannot control and that have no purpose. These movements interrupt the person's normal movement or posture.\nWhen abnormal movements are excessive, they are called hyperkinetic movements and include myoclonus (jerking and twitching), ballismus (violent flinging of extremities), chorea (slow, twisting, or continued movements), among others.\nConsiderations\nThis condition can affect one or both sides of the body. Typical movements of chorea include:\nBending and straightening the fingers and toes\nGrimacing in the face\nRaising and lowering the shoulders\nThey can look like they are being done on purpose. But the movements are not under the person's control."}

A person with chorea may look jittery or restless.\nChorea can be a painful condition, making it hard to do daily living activities.\nCauses\nThere are many possible causes of unpredictable, jerky movements, including:\nAntiphospholipid syndrome\n(disorder that involves abnormal blood clotting)\nBenign hereditary chorea (a rare inherited condition)\nDisorders of calcium, glucose, or sodium metabolism\nDegenerative diseases (disorders that involve breakdown of nerve cells in the brain), such as\nAlzheimer disease\nand\nHuntington disease\nMedicines (such as levodopa, antidepressants, anticonvulsants)\nPolycythemia rubra vera\n(bone marrow disease)\nSydenham chorea\n(movement disorder that occurs most often in children after infection with bacteria called group A streptococcus)\nWilson disease\n(disorder that involves too much copper in the body)\nPregnancy (chorea gravidarum)\nStroke\nor lack of oxygen to the brain (hypoxic brain injury)\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\n(disease in which the body's immune syste"}

Rest helps improve chorea. Try to reduce emotional stress.\nSafety measures should also be taken to prevent injury from the involuntary movements.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have unexplained body motions that are unpredictable and do not go away.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nYour provider will perform a physical exam."}
