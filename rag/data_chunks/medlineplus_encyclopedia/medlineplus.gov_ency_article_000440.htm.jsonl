It may also cause inflammation of the eyes, skin and urinary and genital systems.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of reactive arthritis is unknown. However, it most often follows an infection, but the joint itself is not infected. Reactive arthritis most often occurs in men between the ages of 20 and 40, although it does sometimes affect women. It may follow an infection in the urethra after unprotected sex. The most common bacteria that cause such infections is called\nChlamydia trachomatis.\nReactive arthritis can also follow a gastrointestinal infection (such as food poisoning). In up to one half of people thought to have reactive arthritis, there may be no infection. It is possible that such cases are a form of\nspondyloarthritis\n.\nCertain genes may make you more likely to get this condition.\nThe disorder is rare in young children, but it may occur in teenagers."}

Reactive arthritis may occur in children ages 6 to 14 after\nClostridium difficile\ngastrointestinal infections.\nSymptoms\nUrinary symptoms will appear within days or weeks of an infection. These symptoms may include:\nBurning when urinating\nFluid leaking from the urethra (discharge)\nProblems starting or continuing a urine stream\nNeeding to urinate more often than normal\nA low fever along with eye discharge, burning, or redness (\nconjunctivitis\nor \"pink eye\") can develop over the next several weeks.\nInfections in the intestine may cause diarrhea and abdominal pain. The diarrhea may be watery or bloody.\nJoint pain and stiffness also begin during this time period. The arthritis may be mild or severe. Arthritis symptoms may include:\nHeel pain\nor pain in the Achilles tendon\nPain in the hip, knee, ankle, and low back\nPain and swelling that affects one or more joints\nSymptoms may include\nskin sores\non the palms and soles that look like\npsoriasis\n."}

A physical exam may show signs of conjunctivitis or skin sores. All symptoms may not appear at the same time, so there may be a delay in getting a diagnosis.\nYou may have the following tests:\nHLA-B27 antigen\nJoint x-rays\nBlood tests to rule out other types of arthritis such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout, or systemic lupus erythematosus\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (\nESR\n)\nUrinalysis\nCulture of stool if you have diarrhea\nUrine tests for bacterial DNA such as\nChlamydia trachomatis\nAspiration of a swollen joint\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and treat the infection that is causing this condition.\nEye problems and skin sores do not need to be treated most of the time.

They will go away on their own.  If eye problems persist, you should be evaluated by a specialist in eye disease (ophthalmologist).\nYour provider will prescribe antibiotics if you have an infection. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and\npain relievers\nmay help with joint pain. If a joint is very swollen for a long period of time, you may have corticosteroid medicine injected into the joint.\nIf arthritis continues in spite of NSAIDs, sulfasalazine or methotrexate may be helpful. Finally, people who do not respond to these medicines may need anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) biologic agents such as etanercept (Enbrel) or adalimumab (Humira) to suppress the immune system.\nPhysical therapy can help ease the pain. It can also help you move better and maintain muscle strength.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nReactive arthritis may go away in a few weeks, but it can last for a few months  and require medicines during that time."}
