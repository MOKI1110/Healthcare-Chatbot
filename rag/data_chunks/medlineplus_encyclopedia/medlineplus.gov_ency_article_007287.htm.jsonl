Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nOverdose\nOverdose\nAn overdose is when you take more than the recommended amount of something, often a medicine or drug. An overdose may result in serious, harmful symptoms or death.\nIf you take too much of something on purpose, it is called an intentional or deliberate overdose.\nIf the overdose happens by mistake, it is called an accidental overdose. For example, a young child may accidentally take an adult's medicine.\nYour health care provider may refer to an overdose as an ingestion. Ingestion means you swallowed something.\nAn overdose is not the same as a poisoning, although the effects can be the same. Poisoning occurs when someone or something (such as the environment) exposes you to dangerous chemicals, plants, or other harmful substances without your knowledge.\nInformation\nAn overdose may be mild, moderate, or serious. Symptoms, treatment, and recovery depend on the specific drug involved.\nIn the United States, call 1-800-222-1222 to speak with a\nlocal poison control center\n. This hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning."}
