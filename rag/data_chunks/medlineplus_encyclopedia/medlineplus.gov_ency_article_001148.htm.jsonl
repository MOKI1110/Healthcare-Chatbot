It occurs most often in premature or sick babies.\nCauses\nNEC occurs when the lining of the intestinal wall dies. This problem nearly always develops in an infant who is ill or premature. It is likely to occur while the infant is still in the hospital.\nThe exact cause of this disorder is unknown. A drop in blood flow to the bowel can damage the tissue. Bacteria in the intestine may also add to the problem. Also, premature infants have an undeveloped immune response to factors such as bacteria or low blood flow. An imbalance in immune regulation appears to be involved in NEC.\nBabies at higher risk for the condition include:\nPremature infants\nInfants who are fed formula rather than human milk."}

Up to 40% of infants with NEC die from it. Early, aggressive treatment can help improve the outcome.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nPeritonitis\nSepsis\nIntestinal perforation\nIntestinal stricture\nLiver problems from prolonged inability to tolerate enteral feeds and need for parenteral (IV) nutrition\nShort bowel syndrome if a large amount of intestine is lost\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nGet emergency medical care if any symptoms of necrotizing enterocolitis develop.
