Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nParathyroid hyperplasia\nParathyroid hyperplasia\nParathyroid hyperplasia is the enlargement of all 4 parathyroid glands. The parathyroid glands are located in the neck, near or attached to the back side of the thyroid gland.\nCauses\nThe parathyroid glands help regulate calcium absorption, use, and removal by the body. They do this by producing parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH helps regulate calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the blood and bone. It is important for healthy bones.\nParathyroid hyperplasia may occur in people without a family history of the disease, or as part of 3 inherited syndromes:\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia I (MEN I)\nMEN IIA\nIsolated familial\nhyperparathyroidism\nIn people with an inherited syndrome, a changed (variant) gene is passed down through the family."}

You only need to get the gene from one parent to develop the condition.\nIn MEN I, problems in the parathyroid glands occur, as well as tumors in the pituitary gland and pancreas.\nIn MEN IIA, overactivity of the parathyroid glands occurs, along with tumors in the adrenal or thyroid gland.\nParathyroid hyperplasia that isn't part of an inherited syndrome is much more common. It occurs due to other medical conditions. The most common conditions that can cause parathyroid hyperplasia are chronic kidney disease and chronic vitamin D deficiency."}

Usually 3 1/2 glands are removed. The remaining tissue may be implanted in the forearm or neck muscle. This allows easy access to the tissue if symptoms come back. This tissue is implanted to prevent the body from having too little PTH, which can result in low calcium levels (from\nhypoparathyroidism\n).\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAfter surgery, a high blood calcium level may persist or return. Surgery can sometimes cause hypoparathyroidism, which makes blood calcium level too low.\nPossible Complications\nParathyroid hyperplasia can cause\nhyperparathyroidism\n, which leads to an increase in blood calcium level.\nComplications include\nincreased calcium in the kidneys\n, which can cause\nkidney stones\n,  and\nosteitis fibrosa cystica\n(a softened, weak area in the bones).\nSurgery can sometimes damage the nerves that control the vocal cords."}
