These practices prevent contamination and\nfoodborne\nillnesses.\nFunction\nFood can be contaminated in many different ways. Some food products may already contain bacteria or parasites. These germs can be spread during the packaging process if the food products are not handled properly. Improperly cooking, preparing, or storing food can also cause contamination.\nProperly handling, storing, and preparing food greatly reduces the risk for getting foodborne illnesses.\nFood Sources\nAll foods can become contaminated. Higher risk foods include red meats, poultry, eggs, cheese, dairy products, raw sprouts, and raw fish or shellfish.\nSide Effects\nPoor food safety practices can lead to foodborne illness. Symptoms of foodborne illnesses vary. They usually include stomach problems or stomach upset, including nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. Foodborne illnesses may be severe and fatal."}

Symptoms of foodborne illnesses vary. They usually include stomach problems or stomach upset, including nausea, vomiting, and/or diarrhea. Foodborne illnesses may be severe and fatal. Young children, older adults, pregnant women, and people who have a weakened immune system are especially at risk.\nRecommendations\nIf your hands have any cuts or sores, wear gloves suitable for handling food or avoid preparing food. To reduce your risk for foodborne illness, you should wash your hands thoroughly:\nBefore and after handling any food\nAfter using the toilet or changing diapers\nAfter touching animals\nTo avoid cross-contaminating food items you should:\nWash all cutting boards and utensils with hot water and soap after preparing each food item.\nSeparate meat, poultry, and seafood from other foods during preparation.\nTo reduce chances of food poisoning, you should:\nCook food to the correct temperature. Check the temperature with an internal thermometer at the thickest point, never on the surface. Poultry, all ground meats, and all stuffed meats should be cooked to an internal temperature of 165 °F (74 °C)."}

Seafood and steaks or chops or roasts of red meat should be cooked to an internal temperature of 145 °F (63 °C). Reheat leftovers to an internal temperature of least 165 °F (74 °C). Cook eggs until the white and yolk are firm. Fish should have an opaque appearance and flake easily.\nRefrigerate or freeze food promptly. Store food at the right temperature as quickly as possible after it is purchased. Buy your groceries at the end of running your errands rather than the beginning. Leftovers should be refrigerated within 2 hours of serving. Move hot foods into wide, flat containers so that they can cool down more quickly. Keep frozen foods in the freezer until they are ready to be thawed and cooked."}

Thaw foods in the refrigerator or under cool running water (or in the microwave if the food is going to be cooked immediately after thawing); never thaw foods on the counter at room temperature.\nLabel leftovers clearly with the date they were prepared and stored.\nNever cut mold off of any food and attempt to eat the parts that look \"safe\". The mold can extend farther into the food than you can see.\nFood can also be contaminated before it is purchased. Watch for and DO NOT buy or use outdated food, packaged food with a broken seal, or cans that have a bulge or dent. DO NOT use foods that have an unusual odor or appearance, or a spoiled taste.\nPrepare home-canned foods in clean conditions. Be very careful during the canning process.
