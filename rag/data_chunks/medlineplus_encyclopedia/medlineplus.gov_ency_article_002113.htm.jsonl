They are often seen on a\nmammogram\n.\nInformation\nThe calcium you eat or take in as medicine does not cause calcifications in your breasts.\nMost calcifications are not a sign of\ncancer\n. Causes may include:\nCalcium deposits in the arteries inside your breasts\nHistory of\nbreast infection\nNoncancerous (benign) breast lumps or cysts\nFat necrosis (breast tissue damage, usually from injury or trauma)\nLarge, rounded calcifications (macrocalcifications) are common in women over age 50. They look like small white dots on the mammogram. They are most likely not related to cancer. You will rarely need more testing.\nMicrocalcifications are tiny calcium specks seen on a mammogram. Most of the time, they are not cancer."}

However, these areas may need to be checked more closely if they have a certain appearance on the mammogram.\nWHEN IS FURTHER TESTING NEEDED?\nWhen microcalcifications are present on a mammogram, the doctor (a radiologist) may ask for a larger view so the areas can be examined more closely.\nCalcifications that do not appear to be a problem are called benign. No specific follow-up is needed. But, your health care provider may recommend that you get a mammogram each year.\nIn some cases, calcifications that are slightly abnormal but do not look like a problem (such as cancer) may be benign. A follow-up mammogram in 6 months will be recommended.\nCalcifications that are irregular in size or shape or are tightly clustered together, are called suspicious calcifications. Your provider will recommend a\nstereotactic core biopsy\n. This is a needle biopsy that uses a type of mammogram machine to help find the calcifications."}
