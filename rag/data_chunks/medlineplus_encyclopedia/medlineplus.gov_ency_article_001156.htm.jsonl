Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMesenteric artery ischemia\nMesenteric artery ischemia\nMesenteric artery ischemia occurs when there is a narrowing or blockage of one or more of the three major arteries that supply the small and large intestines. These are called the mesenteric arteries.\nCauses\nThe arteries that supply blood to the intestines run directly from the aorta. The aorta is the main artery from the heart.\nHardening of the arteries\noccurs when fat, cholesterol, and other substances build up in the walls of arteries. This is more common in smokers and in people with high blood pressure or high blood cholesterol.\nThis narrows the blood vessels and reduces blood flow to the intestines. Like every other part of the body, blood brings oxygen to the intestines. When the oxygen supply is reduced, symptoms may occur.\nThe blood supply to the intestines may be suddenly blocked by a blood clot (\nembolus\n). The clots most often come from the heart or aorta."}

These clots are more commonly seen in people with abnormal heart rhythm.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms caused by gradual hardening of the mesenteric arteries include:\nAbdominal pain after eating\nDiarrhea\nSymptoms of sudden (acute) mesenteric artery ischemia due to a traveling blood clot include:\nSudden severe abdominal pain or bloating\nDiarrhea\nVomiting\nFever\nNausea\nExams and Tests\nWhen symptoms begin suddenly or become severe, blood tests may show increased\nwhite blood cell\ncount and changes in the blood acid level. There may be blood in the stool. Typically pain starts first and is followed by rectal bleeding.\nA Doppler ultrasound or\nCT angiogram scan\nmay show problems with the blood vessels and the intestine.\nmesenteric angiogram\nis a test that involves injecting a special dye into your bloodstream to highlight the arteries of the intestine.

Then x-rays are taken of the area. This can show the location of the blockage in the artery.\nTreatment\nWhen the blood supply is blocked to a part of the heart muscle, the muscle will die. This is called a heart attack. A similar type of injury can occur to any part of the intestines.\nWhen the blood supply is suddenly cut off by a blood clot, it is an emergency. Treatment can include medicines to dissolve the blood clots and open up the arteries.\nIf you have symptoms due to hardening of the mesenteric arteries, there are things you can do to control the problem:\nStop smoking. Smoking narrows the arteries."}

This decreases the ability of the blood to carry oxygen and increases the risk of forming clots (thrombi and emboli).\nMake sure your blood pressure is under control.\nIf you are overweight, reduce your weight.\nIf your cholesterol is high, eat a low-cholesterol and low-fat diet.\nMonitor your blood sugar level if you have diabetes, and keep it under control.\nSurgery may be done if the problem is severe.\nThe blockage is removed and the arteries are reconnected to the aorta. A bypass around the blockage is another procedure. It is usually done with a plastic tube graft.\nInsertion of a stent. A stent may be used as an alternative to surgery to enlarge the blockage in the artery or to deliver medicine directly to the affected area.\nAt times, a portion of your intestine will need to be removed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook for chronic mesenteric ischemia is good after a successful surgery."}

However, it is important to make lifestyle changes to prevent hardening of the arteries from getting worse.\nPeople with hardening of the arteries that supply the intestines often have the same problems in blood vessels that supply the heart, brain, kidneys, or legs.\nPeople with acute mesenteric ischemia often do poorly because parts of the intestine may die before surgery can be done. This can be fatal. However, with prompt diagnosis and treatment, acute mesenteric ischemia can be treated successfully.\nPossible Complications\nTissue death from lack of blood flow (infarction) in the intestines is the most serious complication of mesenteric artery ischemia."}
