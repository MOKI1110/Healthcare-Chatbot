It can also develop in a baby after birth. The condition can be mild or severe.\nPectus excavatum is due to too much growth of the connective tissue that joins the ribs to the breastbone (sternum). This causes the sternum to grow inward. As a result, there is a depression in the chest over the sternum, which may appear quite deep.\nIf the condition is severe, the heart and lungs can be affected. Also, the way the chest looks may cause emotional stress for the child.\nCauses\nThe exact cause is unknown. Pectus excavatum may occur by itself. Or there may be a family history of the condition."}
