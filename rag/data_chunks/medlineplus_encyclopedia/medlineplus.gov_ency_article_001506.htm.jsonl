Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRetroversion of the uterus\nRetroversion of the uterus\nRetroversion of the uterus occurs when a woman's uterus (womb) tilts backward rather than forward. It is commonly called a \"tipped uterus.\"\nCauses\nRetroversion of the uterus is common. Approximately 1 in 5 women has this condition. The condition may also occur due to weakening of the pelvic ligaments at the time of\nmenopause\n.\nScar tissue or adhesions in the pelvis can also hold the uterus in a retroverted position. Scarring may come from:\nEndometriosis\nInfection in the uterus or fallopian tubes\nPelvic surgery\nSymptoms\nRetroversion of the uterus almost never causes any symptoms.\nRarely, it may cause pain or discomfort.\nExams and Tests\nA pelvic exam will show the position of the uterus. However, a tipped uterus can sometimes be mistaken for a pelvic mass or a growing\nfibroid\n. A rectovaginal exam may be used to distinguish between a mass and a retroverted uterus.\nAn\nultrasound\nexam can accurately determine the exact position of the uterus.\nTreatment\nTreatment is not needed most of the time."}

Underlying disorders, such as endometriosis or adhesions, should be treated as needed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn most cases, the condition does not cause problems.\nPossible Complications\nIn most cases, a retroverted uterus is a normal finding. However, in some cases it may be caused by endometriosis, salpingitis, or pressure from a growing tumor.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have ongoing pelvic pain or discomfort.\nPrevention\nThere is no way to prevent this condition. Early treatment of uterine infections or endometriosis may reduce the chances of a change in the position of the uterus.\nAlternative Names\nUterus retroversion; Malposition of the uterus; Tipped uterus; Tilted uterus\nImages\nFemale reproductive anatomy\nUterus\nReferences\nAdvincula A, Truong M, Lobo RA.
