The disease is also called hymenolepiasis.\nCauses\nHymenolepis worms live in warm climates and are common in the southern United States. Insects eat the eggs of these worms.\nHumans and other animals become infected when they eat material contaminated by insects (including fleas associated with rats). In an infected person, it is possible for the worm's entire life cycle to be completed in the bowel, so infection can last for years.\nHymenolepis nana\ninfections are much more common than\nHymenolepis diminuta\ninfections in humans. These infections used to be common in the southeastern United States, in crowded environments, and in people who were confined to institutions. However, the disease occurs throughout the world.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms occur only with heavy infections."}
