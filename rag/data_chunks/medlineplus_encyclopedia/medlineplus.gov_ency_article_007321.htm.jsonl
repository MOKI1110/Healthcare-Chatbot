The tricuspid valve separates the right lower heart chamber (right ventricle) from the right upper heart chamber (right atrium). In people with Ebstein anomaly, the positioning of the tricuspid valve and how it functions to separate the two chambers is abnormal.\nThe condition is congenital, which means it is present at birth.\nCauses\nThe tricuspid valve is normally made of three parts, called leaflets or flaps. The leaflets open to allow blood to move from the right atrium (top chamber) to the right ventricle (bottom chamber) while the heart relaxes. They close to prevent blood from moving from the right ventricle to the right atrium while the heart pumps.\nIn people with Ebstein anomaly, the leaflets are placed deeper into the right ventricle instead of the normal position. The leaflets are often larger than normal. The defect most often causes the valve to work poorly, and blood may go the wrong way."}

The leaflets are often larger than normal. The defect most often causes the valve to work poorly, and blood may go the wrong way. Instead of flowing out to the lungs, the blood flows back into the right atrium. The backup of blood flow can lead to heart enlargement and fluid buildup in the body. There may also be narrowing of the valve that leads to the lungs (pulmonary valve).\nIn many cases, people also have a hole in the wall separating the heart's two upper chambers (\natrial septal defect\n) and blood flow across this hole may cause oxygen-poor blood to go to the body. This can cause cyanosis, a blue tint to the skin caused by oxygen-poor blood.\nEbstein anomaly occurs as a baby develops in the womb. The exact cause is unknown. The use of certain drugs (such as lithium or benzodiazepines) during pregnancy may play a role. The condition is rare. It is more common in white people.\nSymptoms\nThe abnormality can be slight or very severe. Therefore, the symptoms can also range from mild to very severe. Symptoms can develop soon after birth, and can include bluish-colored lips and nails due to low blood oxygen levels."}

Therefore, the symptoms can also range from mild to very severe. Symptoms can develop soon after birth, and can include bluish-colored lips and nails due to low blood oxygen levels. In severe cases, the baby appears very sick and has trouble breathing. In mild cases, the affected person may be asymptomatic for many years, sometimes even permanently.\nSymptoms in older children may include:\nCough\nFailure to grow\nFatigue\nRapid breathing\nShortness of breath\nVery fast heartbeat\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider may hear abnormal heart sounds, such as a murmur, when listening to the chest with a stethoscope.\nTests that can help diagnose this condition include:\nChest x-ray\nMagnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) of the heart\nMeasurement of the electrical activity of the heart (\nelectrocardiogram\nor ECG)\nUltrasound of the heart (\nechocardiogram\n)\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the severity of the defect and the specific symptoms. Medical care may include:\nMedicines to help with heart failure, such as diuretics.\nOxygen and other breathing support.\nSurgery to correct the valve.\nReplacement of the tricuspid valve."}

Others may worsen over time, developing blue coloring (cyanosis), heart failure, heart block, or dangerous heart rhythms.\nPossible Complications\nA severe leakage can lead to swelling of the heart and liver, and\ncongestive heart failure\n.\nOther complications may include:\nAbnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmias), including abnormally fast rhythms (tachyarrhythmias) and abnormally slow rhythms (bradyarrhythmias and heart block)\nBlood clots from the heart to other parts of the body\nBrain abscess\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your child develops symptoms of this condition."}

Get medical attention right away if breathing problems occur.\nPrevention\nThere is no known prevention, other than talking with your provider before a pregnancy if you are taking medicines that are thought to be related to developing this disease. You may be able to prevent some of the complications of the disease. For example, taking antibiotics before dental surgery may help prevent endocarditis.\nAlternative Names\nEbstein's anomaly; Ebstein's malformation; Congenital heart defect - Ebstein; Birth defect heart - Ebstein; Cyanotic heart disease - Ebstein\nImages\nEbstein's anomaly\nReferences\nBernstein D.
