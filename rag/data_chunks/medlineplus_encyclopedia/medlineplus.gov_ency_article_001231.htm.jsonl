Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBunions\nBunions\nA bunion forms when your big toe points outward toward your second toe. This causes a bump to appear on the inside edge of your toe.\nCauses\nBunions are more common in women than men. The problem can run in families. People born with abnormal alignment of the bones in their feet are more likely to form a bunion.\nWearing narrow-toed, high-heeled shoes may lead to the development of a bunion.\nThe condition may become painful as the bump gets worse. Extra bone and a fluid-filled sac can grow at the base of the big toe.\nWatch this video about:\nBunion\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nRed, thickened skin along the inside edge at the base of the big toe.\nA bony bump at the first toe joint, with decreased movement in the toe.\nPain over the joint, which pressure from shoes makes worse.\nBig toe turned outward toward the other toes and may cross over the second toe."}

As a result, corns and calluses often develop where the first and second toes overlap.\nDifficulty wearing regular shoes.\nYou may have problems finding shoes that fit or shoes that do not cause pain.\nExams and Tests\nA health care provider can very often diagnose a bunion by looking at it. A foot\nx-ray\ncan show an abnormal angle between the big toe and the foot. In some cases, arthritis may also be seen.\nTreatment\nWhen a bunion first begins to develop, you can do the following to care for your feet.\nWear wide-toed shoes. This can often solve the problem and prevent you from needing more treatment.\nWear felt or foam pads on your foot to protect the bunion, or devices called spacers to separate the first and second toes."}

These are available at drugstores.\nTry cutting a hole in a pair of old, comfortable shoes to wear around the house.\nTalk to your provider about whether you need inserts to correct flat feet.\nStretch the calf muscle of your leg to have better alignment of your feet.\nIf the bunion gets worse and more painful, surgery may help. The surgery called\nbunionectomy\nrealigns the toe and removes the bony bump. There are more than 100 different surgeries to treat this condition. Please discuss with your surgeon which type can help you and why.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nYou can keep a bunion from worsening by taking care of it. Try to wear different shoes when it first starts to develop.\nTeenagers may have more trouble treating a bunion than adults. This may be the result of an underlying bone problem or growth changes.\nSurgery reduces the pain in many, but not all people with bunions."}
