Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour health care provider may order this test if you have signs of an aspergillosis infection.\nNormal Results\nA normal test result means you do not have aspergillus antibodies.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA positive result means antibodies to the fungus have been detected. This result means you have been exposed to the fungus at some point, but it does not necessarily mean you have an active infection.\nFalse-negative results are possible. For example, invasive aspergillosis often does not produce a positive result, even though aspergillus is present.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
