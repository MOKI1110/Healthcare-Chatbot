The condition can include:\nBlockage of the small airways (bronchiolitis obliterans)\nFluid in the chest (\npleural effusions\n)\nHigh blood pressure in the lungs (\npulmonary hypertension\n)\nLumps in the lungs (nodules)\nScarring (\npulmonary fibrosis\n)\nCauses\nLung problems are common in RA. They often cause no symptoms, but for some people they are the main symptom of their RA.\nThe cause of lung disease associated with RA is unknown."}

Sometimes, the medicines used to treat RA, especially methotrexate, may result in lung disease.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nChest pain\nCough\nFever\nShortness of breath\nJoint pain, stiffness, and swelling\nSkin nodules\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about your symptoms.\nSymptoms depend on the type of lung disease RA is causing in the lungs.\nWhen listening to the lungs with a stethoscope, your provider may hear normal breath sounds or:\nCrackles (rales)\nDecreased breath sounds\nWheezing\nA rubbing sound\nWhen listening to the heart, there may be abnormal heart sounds.\nThe following tests may show signs of rheumatoid lung disease:\nChest x-ray\nCT scan of the chest\nEchocardiogram\n(may show pulmonary hypertension)\nLung biopsy (bronchoscopic, video-assisted, or\nopen\n)\nLung function tests\nNeedle inserted into the fluid around the lung (\nthoracentesis\n)\nBlood tests for rheumatoid arthritis\nTreatment\nMany people with this c"}

Treatment is aimed at the health problems causing the lung problem and the complications caused by the disorder. Corticosteroids or other medicines that suppress the immune system are sometimes useful.\nThere is emerging evidence that pirfenidone and nintedanib may work for people with fibrosis due to rheumatoid lung disease.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nOutcome is related to the underlying disorder and the type and severity of lung disease. In severe cases, lung transplantation can be considered."}
