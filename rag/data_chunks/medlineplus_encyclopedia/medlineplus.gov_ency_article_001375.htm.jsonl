Humans become infected when they eat raw or undercooked freshwater fish that contain fish tapeworm cysts.\nThe infection is seen in many areas where humans eat uncooked or undercooked freshwater fish from rivers or lakes, including:\nAfrica\nEastern Europe\nNorth and South America\nScandinavia\nSome Asian countries\nAfter a person has eaten infected fish, the worm larva begins to grow in the intestine. Larvae are fully grown in 3 to 6 weeks. The adult worm, which is segmented, attaches to the wall of the intestine. The tapeworm may reach a length of 30 feet (9 meters). Eggs are formed in each segment of the worm and are passed in the stool. Sometimes, parts of the worm may also be passed in the stool.\nThe tapeworm absorbs the nutrition from food that the infected person eats."}
