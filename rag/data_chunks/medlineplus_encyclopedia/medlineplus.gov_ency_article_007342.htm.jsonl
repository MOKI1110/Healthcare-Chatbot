Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLung PET scan\nLung PET scan\nA lung positron emission tomography (\nPET\n) scan is an imaging test. It uses a radioactive substance (called a tracer) to look for disease in the lungs such as\nlung cancer\n.\nUnlike magnetic resonance imaging (\nMRI\n) and computed tomography (\nCT\n) scans, which reveal the structure of the lungs, a PET scan shows the activity of the cells within the lungs.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA PET scan requires a small amount of tracer. The tracer is given through a vein (IV), usually on the inside of your elbow. It travels through your blood and collects in organs and tissues. The tracer helps the doctor (radiologist) see certain areas or diseases more clearly.\nYou will need to wait nearby as the tracer is absorbed by your body. This usually takes about 1 hour.\nThen, you will lie on a narrow table, which slides into a large tunnel-shaped scanner. The PET scanner detects signals from the tracer. A computer changes the results into 3-D pictures. The images are displayed on a monitor for your doctor to read.\nYou must lie still during test."}

The PET scanner detects signals from the tracer. A computer changes the results into 3-D pictures. The images are displayed on a monitor for your doctor to read.\nYou must lie still during test. Too much movement can blur images and cause errors.\nThe test takes about 90 minutes.\nPET scans are performed along with a CT scan. This is because the combined information from each scan provides a more complete understanding of the health problem. This combination scan is called a PET/CT.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked not to eat anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan. You will be able to drink water.\nTell your health care provider if:\nYou are afraid of tight spaces (have claustrophobia). You may be given a medicine to help you relax and feel less anxious.\nYou are pregnant or think you might be pregnant.\nYou have any allergies to injected dye (contrast).\nYou take insulin for diabetes. You will need special preparation for the test.\nTell your provider about the medicines you are taking. These include ones bought without a prescription."}

Some medicines can interfere with the test results.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel a sharp sting when the needle containing the tracer is placed into your vein.\nA PET scan causes no pain. The table may be hard or cold, but you can request a blanket or pillow.\nAn intercom in the room allows you to speak to someone at any time.\nThere is no recovery time, unless you were given a medicine to relax.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test may be done to:\nHelp look for lung cancer, when other imaging tests do not give a clear picture\nSee if lung cancer has spread to other areas of the lungs or body, when deciding on the best treatment\nHelp determine if a growth in the lungs (seen on a CT scan) is cancerous or not\nDetermine how well cancer treatment is working\nNormal Results\nA normal result means the scan did not show any problems in the size, shape, or function of the lungs.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be due to:\nLung cancer or cancer of another area of the body that has"}

However, it is more than twice as much as most CT scans. Also, the radiation does not last for very long in your body.\nWomen who are pregnant or are breastfeeding should let their provider know before having this test. Infants and babies developing in the womb are more sensitive to the effects of radiation because their organs are still growing.\nIt is possible, although very unlikely, to have an allergic reaction to the radioactive substance. Some people have pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site. This soon goes away.\nAlternative Names\nChest PET scan; Lung positron emission tomography; PET - chest; PET - lung; PET - tumor imaging; PET/CT - lung; Solitary pulmonary nodule - PET\nImages\nLungs\nReferences\nDeroose CM, Dooms C.
