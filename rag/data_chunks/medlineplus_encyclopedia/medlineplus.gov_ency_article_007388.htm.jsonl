The surgeon places a band around the upper part of your stomach to create a small pouch to hold food. The band limits the amount of food you can eat by making you feel full after eating small amounts of food.\nAfter surgery, your surgeon can adjust the band to make food pass more slowly or quickly through your stomach.\nGastric bypass surgery\nis a related topic.\nDescription\nYou will receive\ngeneral anesthesia\nbefore this surgery. You will be asleep and unable to feel pain.\nThe surgery is done using a tiny camera that is placed in your belly. This type of surgery is called laparoscopy. The camera is called a laparoscope. It allows your surgeon to see inside your belly. In this surgery:\nYour surgeon will make 1 to 5 small surgical cuts in your abdomen."}

Through these small cuts, the surgeon will place a camera and the instruments needed to perform the surgery.\nYour surgeon will place a band around the upper part of your stomach to separate it from the lower part. This creates a small pouch that has a narrow opening that goes into the larger, lower part of your stomach.\nThe surgery does not involve any stapling inside your belly.\nAn access port will be placed under the skin on your abdomen.\nYour surgery may take only 30 to 60 minutes if your surgeon has done a lot of these procedures.\nWhen you eat after having this surgery, the small pouch will fill up quickly. You will feel full after eating just a small amount of food."}

It will greatly change your lifestyle. You must diet and exercise after this surgery."}

This allows the band to be adjusted. You and your surgeon can decide to loosen or tighten it in the future so you can eat more or less food.\nThe band is connected to an access port that is under the skin on your belly. The band can be tightened by placing a needle into the port and filling the balloon (band) with water.\nYour surgeon can make the band tighter or looser any time after you have this surgery.
