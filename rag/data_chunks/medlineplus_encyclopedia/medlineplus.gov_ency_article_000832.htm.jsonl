They are most common along the edges of the fingers, toes, palms, and soles. These blisters can be very itchy. They also cause scaly patches of skin that flake or get red, cracked, and painful.\nScratching leads to skin changes and skin thickening. Large blisters may cause pain or can get infected.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider may be able to diagnose this condition by looking at your skin.\nskin biopsy\nmay be needed to check for other causes, such as a fungal infection or psoriasis.\nIf your provider thinks the condition may be due to an allergic reaction, allergy testing (patch testing) may be done.\nTreatment\nPompholyx may go away on its own. Treatment is aimed at controlling the symptoms, such as itching and preventing blisters. Your provider will likely recommend self-care measures.\nSKIN CARE AT HOME\nKeep your skin moist by lubricating or moisturizing the skin. Use ointments (such as petroleum jelly), creams, or lotions.\nMoisturizers:\nShould be free of alcohol, scents, dyes, fragrances, or other chemicals.\nWork best when they're applied to skin that is wet or damp."}

For the most part, you can apply these substances as often as you need to keep your skin soft.\nMEDICINES\nMedicines that help relieve itching can be bought without a prescription.\nTake an anti-itch medicine before bed if you scratch in your sleep.\nSome antihistamines cause little or no sleepiness, but aren't so effective for itching. These include fexofenadine (Allegra), loratadine (Claritin, Alavert), cetirizine (Zyrtec).\nOthers can make you sleepy, including diphenhydramine (Benadryl).\nYour provider may prescribe topical medicines. These are ointments or creams that are applied to the skin. Types include:\nCorticosteroids, which calm swollen or inflamed skin\nImmunomodulators, applied to the skin, which help keep the immune system from reacting too strongly\nPrescription anti-itch medicines\nFollow instructions on how to apply these medicines."}

Severe scratching may lead to thick, irritated skin. This is called lichenified skin. This makes the problem harder to treat.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have:\nSigns of infection such as tenderness, redness, warmth, or fever\nA rash that does not go away with simple home treatments\nAlternative Names\nCheiropompholyx; Pedopompholyx; Dyshidrosis; Dyshidrotic eczema; Acral vesicular dermatitis; Chronic hand dermatitis\nImages\nAtopic dermatitis\nReferences\nFrey S, Snyder ML, Guttman-Yassky E, Wollenberg A.
