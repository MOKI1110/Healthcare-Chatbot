The ovaries are the female reproductive organs that produce eggs.\nCauses\nOvarian cancer is the fifth most common cancer among women. It causes more deaths than any other type of female reproductive organ cancer.\nThe cause of ovarian cancer is unknown.\nRisks of developing ovarian cancer include any of the following:\nThe fewer children a woman has and the later in life she gives birth, the higher her risk for ovarian cancer.\nWomen who have had breast cancer or have a family history of breast or ovarian cancer have an increased risk for ovarian cancer (due to variants in genes such as BRCA1 or BRCA2).\nWomen who take estrogen replacement only (not with progesterone) for 5 years or more may have a higher risk for ovarian cancer."}

Birth control pills, though, decrease the risk for ovarian cancer.\nFertility treatment with medicines probably does not increase the risk for ovarian cancer.\nIn vitro fertilization (IVF) may increase the risk of borderline or low malignant potential ovarian tumors.\nOlder women are at the highest risk of developing ovarian cancer. Most deaths from ovarian cancer occur in women age 65 to 74.\nSymptoms\nOvarian cancer symptoms are often vague. Women and their health care providers often blame the symptoms on other, more common conditions."}

Women and their health care providers often blame the symptoms on other, more common conditions. Sometimes, by the time the cancer is diagnosed, the tumor has spread beyond the ovaries.\nSee your provider if you have the following symptoms on a daily basis for more than a few weeks:\nBloating\nor swelling in the belly area\nDifficulty eating or\nfeeling full quickly\n(early satiety)\nPelvic or lower abdominal pain (area may feel heavy)\nBack pain\nSwollen lymph nodes in groin\nOther symptoms that can occur:\nExcessive hair growth\nthat is coarse and dark\nSudden urge to urinate\nNeeding to urinate more often than usual (\nurinary frequency or urgency\n)\nConstipation\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam may often be normal. With advanced ovarian cancer, your provider may find a swollen abdomen often due to accumulation of fluid (\nascites\n).\nA pelvic exam may reveal an ovarian or\nabdominal mass\n.\nCA-125 blood test\nis not considered a good screening test for ovarian cancer."}

A\nbiopsy\nwill be done to help make the diagnosis.\nNo lab or imaging test has ever been shown to be able to successfully screen for or diagnose ovarian cancer in its early stages, so no standard screening tests are recommended at this time.\nTreatment\nSurgery is used to treat virtually all stages of ovarian cancer. For early stages, surgery may be the only treatment needed. Surgery may involve removing both ovaries and fallopian tubes, the uterus, or other structures in the belly or pelvis."}

The goals of surgery for ovarian cancer are:\nSample normal appearing areas to see if the cancer has spread (\nstaging\n)\nRemove any areas of tumor spread (debulking)\nChemotherapy\nis used after surgery to treat any cancer that remains. Chemotherapy can also be used if the cancer comes back (relapses). Chemotherapy is typically given\nintravenously\n(through an IV). It can also be injected directly into the abdominal cavity (intraperitoneal, or IP).\nRadiation therapy\nis rarely used to treat ovarian cancer.\nAfter surgery and chemotherapy, follow instructions about how often you should see your oncologist and the tests you should have.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\ncancer support group\n.

Experts differ on the effectiveness of routine pelvic exams for finding early stage ovarian cancer.\nPrevention\nThere are no standard recommendations for screening women without symptoms (asymptomatic) for ovarian cancer. Pelvic ultrasound or a blood test, such as CA-125, have not been found to be effective and are not recommended.\nGenetic testing for the BRCA1 or BRCA2\n, or other cancer-related genes, may be recommended for women at high risk for ovarian cancer."}
