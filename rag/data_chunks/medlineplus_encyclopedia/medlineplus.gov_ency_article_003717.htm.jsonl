Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nDHEA-sulfate test\nDHEA-sulfate test\nDHEA stands for dehydroepiandrosterone. It is a hormone produced by the adrenal glands in both men and women. It can be converted to other hormones that have weak male (androgenic) effects. The DHEA-sulfate test measures the amount of DHEA-sulfate in the blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary. However, tell your health care provider if you are taking any vitamins or supplements that contain DHEA or DHEA-sulfate.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or sting. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to check the function of the two\nadrenal glands\n. One of these glands sits above each kidney."}

They are one of the major sources of androgens in women.\nAlthough DHEA-sulfate is the most abundant hormone in the body, its exact function is still not known.\nIn men, the male hormone effect may not be important if testosterone level is normal.\nIn women, DHEA contributes to normal libido and sexual satisfaction.\nDHEA may also have effects on the immune system.\nThe DHEA-sulfate test is often done in women who show signs of having excess male hormones."}

Some labs use different measurements or test different specimens. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn increase in DHEA-sulfate may be due to:\nA common genetic disorder called\ncongenital adrenal hyperplasia\n.\nA tumor of the adrenal gland, which can be benign or be a cancer.\nA common problem in women younger than 50, called\npolycystic ovary syndrome\n.\nBody changes of a girl with puberty happening earlier than normal.\nA decrease in DHEA sulfate may be due to:\nAdrenal gland\ndisorders that produce lower than normal amounts of adrenal hormones, including adrenal insufficiency and\nAddison disease\nThe pituitary gland not producing normal amounts of its hormones (\nhypopituitarism\n)\nTa"}

Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma\n(blood buildup under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nSerum DHEA-sulfate; Dehydroepiandrosterone-sulfate test; DHEA-sulfate - serum\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nChen Zi-Chiang, Legro RS, Ehrmann DA, Wei D.
