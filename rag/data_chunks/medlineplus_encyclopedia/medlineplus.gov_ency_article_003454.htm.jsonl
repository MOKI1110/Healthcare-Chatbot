Most of the time, this means you do not have infectious mononucleosis.\nSometimes, the test may be negative because it was done too soon (within 1 to 2 weeks) after the illness started. Your health care provider may repeat the test at a later date to make sure you do not have mono.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA positive test means heterophile antibodies are present. These are most often a sign of mononucleosis. Your provider will also consider other blood test results and your symptoms. A small number of people with mononucleosis may never have a positive test.\nThe highest number of antibodies occurs 2 to 5 weeks after mono begins. They may be present for up to 1 year.\nIn rare cases, the test is positive even though you do not have mono."}
