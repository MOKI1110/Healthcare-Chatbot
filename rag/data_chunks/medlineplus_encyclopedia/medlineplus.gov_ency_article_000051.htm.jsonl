Without oxygen, brain damage can occur in as little as 4 minutes. Rapid first aid for choking can save a person's life.\nThis article discusses choking in adults or children over age 1 year who have lost alertness (are unconscious).\nCauses\nChoking may be caused by:\nEating too fast, not chewing food well, or eating with dentures that do not fit well\nFoods such as food chunks, hot dogs, popcorn, peanut butter, sticky or gooey food (marshmallows, gummy bears, dough)\nDrinking alcohol (even a small amount of alcohol affects awareness)\nBeing unconscious and breathing in vomit\nBreathing in or swallowing small objects (young children)\nInjury to the head and face (for example, swelling, bleeding, or a deformity can"}

Look, listen, and feel for breathing for 5 seconds\nIf the person is breathing, give\nfirst aid for unconsciousness\n.\nIf the person is not breathing, begin rescue breathing. Maintain the head position, close the person's nostrils by pinching them with your thumb and index finger, and cover the person's mouth tightly with your mouth. Give two slow, full breaths with a pause in between.\nIf the person's chest does not rise, reposition the head and give two more breaths.\nIf the chest still does not rise, the airway is likely blocked, and you need to start\nCPR with chest compressions\n.

If the person's chest still does not rise, keep going with cycles of chest compressions, checking for an object, and rescue breaths until medical help arrives or the person starts breathing on their own.\nIf the person starts having\nseizures\n(convulsions), give first aid for this problem.\nAfter removing the object that caused the choking, keep the person still and get medical help. Anyone who is choking should have a medical examination. This is because the person can have complications not only from the choking, but also from the first aid measures that were taken.\nDO NOT\nDo not try to grasp an object that is lodged in the person's throat. This may push it farther down the airway."}
