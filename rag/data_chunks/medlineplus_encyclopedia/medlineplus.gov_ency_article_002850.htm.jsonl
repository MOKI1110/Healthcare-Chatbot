If symptoms rapidly become worse within the first 2 to 4 hours after the sting, a poor outcome is more likely. Symptoms may last several days or longer. Some deaths have occurred as late as weeks after the sting if complications develop.\nScorpions are nocturnal predatory animals that usually spend the day under rocks, logs, or floors and in crevices.
