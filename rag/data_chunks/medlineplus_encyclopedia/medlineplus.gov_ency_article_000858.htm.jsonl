It is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, a member of the herpes family of viruses. This is the virus that also causes\nchickenpox\n.\nCauses\nAfter you get chickenpox, your body does not get rid of the virus. Instead, the virus remains in the body but is inactive (becomes dormant) in certain nerves in the body. Shingles occur after the virus becomes active again in these nerves, often after many years. Many people had such a mild case of chickenpox that they do not realize they have had the infection.\nThe reason the virus suddenly becomes active again is not clear. Often only one attack occurs.\nShingles can develop in any age group."}

Often only one attack occurs.\nShingles can develop in any age group. You are more likely to develop the condition if:\nYou are older than age 60 years\nYou had chickenpox before age 1\nYour immune system is weakened by medicines or diseases\nIf an adult or child has direct contact with the shingles rash and did not have chickenpox as a child or get the\nchickenpox vaccine\n, they can develop chickenpox, not shingles.\nSymptoms\nThe first symptom is usually pain, tingling, or burning that occurs on one side of the body. The pain and burning may be severe and are usually present before any rash appears.\nRed patches on the skin, followed by small blisters, form in most people:\nThe blisters break, forming small sores that begin to dry and form crusts. The crusts fall off in 2 to 3 weeks."}

The symptoms may include:\nDifficulty moving some of the muscles in the face\nDrooping eyelid\n(ptosis)\nHearing loss\nLoss of eye motion\nTaste problems\nVision problems\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can make the diagnosis by looking at your skin and asking about your medical history.\nTests are rarely needed, but may include taking a skin sample to see if the skin is infected with the virus.\nBlood tests may show an increase in\nwhite blood cells\nand antibodies to the chickenpox virus."}

But blood tests cannot confirm that the rash is due to shingles.\nTreatment\nYour provider may prescribe a medicine that fights the virus, called an antiviral medicine. This medicine helps reduce pain, prevent complications, and shorten the course of the disease.\nThe medicines are most effective when started within 72 hours of when you first feel pain or burning. It is best to start taking them before the blisters appear. The medicines are usually given in pill form. Some people may need to receive the medicine through a vein (by\nIV\n).\nStrong anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids, such as prednisone, may be used to reduce swelling and pain."}

If the virus affects the nerves that control movement (the motor nerves), you may have temporary or permanent weakness or paralysis.\nSometimes the pain in the area where the shingles occurred may last from months to years."}
