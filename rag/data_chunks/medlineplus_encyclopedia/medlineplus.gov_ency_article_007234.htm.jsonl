This system provides heart-lung bypass support outside of the baby's body. It may help support a child who is awaiting a heart or lung transplant.\nWHY IS ECMO USED?\nECMO is used in infants who are sick due to breathing or heart problems."}

It may help support a child who is awaiting a heart or lung transplant.\nWHY IS ECMO USED?\nECMO is used in infants who are sick due to breathing or heart problems. The purpose of ECMO is to provide enough oxygen to the baby while allowing time for the lungs and heart to rest or heal.\nThe most common conditions that may require ECMO are:\nCongenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH)\nBirth defects of the heart\nMeconium aspiration syndrome (\nMAS\n)\nSevere\npneumonia\nSevere air leak problems\nSevere high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs (PPHN)\nIt may also be used during the recovery period after heart surgery.\nHOW IS A BABY PLACED ON ECMO?\nStarting ECMO requires a large team of caregivers to stabilize the baby, as well as the careful set-up and priming of the ECMO pump with fluid and blood. Surgery is performed to attach the ECMO pump to the baby through catheters that are placed into large blood vessels in the baby's neck or groin.\nWHAT ARE THE RISKS OF ECMO?\nBecause babies who are considered for ECMO are already very sick, they are at high risk for long-term problems, including death."}

Once the baby is placed on ECMO, additional risks include:\nBleeding\nBlood clot formation\nInfection\nTransfusion problems\nRarely, the pump can have mechanical problems (tube breaks, pump stops), which can harm the baby.\nHowever, most babies who need ECMO would probably die if it were not used.\nAlternative Names\nECMO; Heart-lung bypass - infants; Bypass - infants; Neonatal hypoxia - ECMO; PPHN - ECMO; Meconium aspiration - ECMO; MAS - ECMO\nImages\nECMO\nReferences\nAhlfeld SK.
