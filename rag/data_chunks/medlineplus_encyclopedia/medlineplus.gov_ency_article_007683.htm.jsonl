Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBrief resolved unexplained event - BRUE\nBrief resolved unexplained event - BRUE\nA brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE) is when an infant younger than one year stops breathing, has a change in muscle tone, turns pale or\nblue in color\n, or is unresponsive. The event occurs suddenly, lasts less than 30 to 60 seconds, and is frightening to the person caring for the infant.\nBRUE is present only when there is no explanation for the event after a thorough history and exam. An older name used for these types of events is an apparent life-threatening event (ALTE).\nCauses\nIt is unclear how often these events occur.\nBRUE is not the same as\nsudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS). It is also not the same as older terms such as near-miss SIDS or aborted crib deaths, which are no longer used.\nEvents that involve a change in an infant's breathing, color, muscle tone, or behavior may be caused by an underlying medical problem. But these events would then not be considered a BRUE."}
