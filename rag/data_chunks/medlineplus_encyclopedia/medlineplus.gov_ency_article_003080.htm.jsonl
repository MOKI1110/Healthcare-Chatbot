For example, does it happen when you are nervous or after you have been consuming certain foods or drinks?\nWhat other symptoms do you have?\nYou may need more tests based on what the provider finds during your exam and your other symptoms.\nAlternative Names\nBurping; Eructation; Gas - belching\nImages\nDigestive system\nReferences\nMcQuaid KR.
