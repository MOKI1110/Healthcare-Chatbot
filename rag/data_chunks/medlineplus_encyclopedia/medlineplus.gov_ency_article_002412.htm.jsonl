Nerve cells, body tissues, blood, and other body fluids contain the rest of the calcium.\nFunction\nCalcium is one of the most important minerals for the human body. It helps form and maintain healthy teeth and bones. A proper level of calcium in the body over a lifetime can help prevent\nosteoporosis\n.\nCalcium helps your body with:\nBuilding strong bones and teeth\nClotting blood\nSending and receiving nerve signals\nSqueezing and relaxing muscles\nReleasing hormones and other chemicals\nKeeping a normal heartbeat\nFood Sources\nCALCIUM AND DAIRY PRODUCTS\nMany foods contain calcium, but dairy products are the best source. Milk and dairy products such as yogurt, cheeses, and buttermilk contain a form of calcium that your body can easily absorb.\nWhole milk (4% fat) is recommended for children ages 1 to 2. Most adults and children over age 2 should drink low-fat (2% or 1%) milk or skim milk and other dairy products."}

Most adults and children over age 2 should drink low-fat (2% or 1%) milk or skim milk and other dairy products. Removing the fat will not lower the amount of calcium in a dairy product.\nYogurt, most cheeses, and buttermilk are excellent sources of calcium and come in low-fat or fat-free versions.\nMilk is also a good source of phosphorus and magnesium, which help the body absorb and use calcium.\nVitamin D\nis needed to help  your body use calcium. Milk is fortified with vitamin D for this reason.\nOTHER SOURCES OF CALCIUM\nOther sources of calcium that can help meet your body's calcium needs include:\nGreen leafy vegetables such as broccoli, collards, kale, mustard greens, turnip greens, and bok choy or Chinese cabbage\nSalmon and sardines canned with their soft bones\nAlmonds, Brazil nuts, sunflower seeds, tahini, and dried beans\nBlackstrap molasses\nCalcium is often added to food products. These include foods such as  orange juice, soy milk, tofu, ready-to-eat cereals, and breads."}

These include foods such as  orange juice, soy milk, tofu, ready-to-eat cereals, and breads. These are a very good source of calcium for people who do not eat a lot of dairy products.\nWays to make sure you get enough calcium in your diet:\nCook foods in a small amount of water for the shortest possible time to keep more calcium in the foods you eat. (This means steaming or sautÃ©ing to cook instead of  boiling foods.)\nBe careful about  the other foods you eat with calcium-rich foods. Certain fibers, such as wheat bran, and foods with oxalic acid (spinach and rhubarb) can bind with calcium and prevent it from being absorbed. This is why leafy greens are not considered an adequate  source of calcium by themselves, because your body is unable to utilize much of the calcium they contain. People on a vegan diet need to be sure to also include soy products and fortified products in order to get enough calcium.\nDIETARY SUPPLEMENTS\nCalcium is also found in many multivitamin-mineral supplements. The amount varies, depending on the supplement."}

The amount varies, depending on the supplement. Dietary supplements may contain only calcium, or calcium with other nutrients such as vitamin D. Check the label on the Supplement Facts panel of the package to determine the amount of calcium in the supplement. Calcium absorption is best when taken in amounts of no more than 500 mg at a time.\nTwo commonly available forms of calcium dietary supplements include calcium citrate and calcium carbonate.\nCalcium citrate is the more expensive form of the supplement. It is taken up well by the body on a full or empty stomach.\nCalcium carbonate is less expensive. It is absorbed better by the body if taken with food. Calcium carbonate is found in over-the-counter antacid products such as Rolaids or Tums. Each chew or pill usually provides 200 to 400 mg of calcium."}

Check the label for the exact amount.\nOther types of calcium in supplements and foods include calcium lactate, calcium gluconate, and calcium phosphate.\nSide Effects\nIncreased calcium for a limited period of time does not normally cause side effects. However, receiving higher amounts of calcium over a long period of time raises the risk for\nkidney stones\nin some people.\nThose who do not receive enough calcium over a long period of time can develop osteoporosis (thinning of bone tissue and loss of bone density over time). Other disorders are also possible.\nPeople with\nlactose intolerance\nhave trouble digesting lactose, the sugar in milk. For this reason, they are often at risk for calcium deficiency. However, over-the-counter products are available that make it easier to digest lactose. You can also buy lactose-free milk at most grocery stores."}

Most people who do not suffer from severe lactose-intolerance are still able to digest hard cheeses and yogurt.\nTell your health care provider about any dietary supplements and medicines you take. Your provider can tell you if those dietary supplements might interact or interfere with your prescription or over-the-counter medicines. In addition, some medicines might interfere with how your body absorbs calcium.\nRecommendations\nThe preferred source of calcium is calcium-rich foods such as dairy products. Some people will need to take a calcium supplement. How much calcium you need depends on your age and sex. Other factors, such as pregnancy and illnesses, are also important.\nRecommendations for calcium, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine."}
