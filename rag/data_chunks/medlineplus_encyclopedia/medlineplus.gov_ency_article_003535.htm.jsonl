Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAntinuclear antibody panel\nAntinuclear antibody panel\nThe antinuclear antibody panel is a blood test that looks at antinuclear\nantibodies\n(ANA).\nANA are antibodies produced by the immune system that bind to the body's own tissues.\nThe antinuclear antibody test looks for antibodies that bind to a part of the cell called the nucleus.\nIf the test is positive, a panel of tests may be done to identify specific antibodies. This is the ANA antibody panel.\nHow the Test is Performed\nBlood is drawn from a vein. Most often, a vein on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand is used. The site is cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic). The health care provider wraps an elastic band around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area and make the vein swell with blood.\nNext, the provider gently inserts a needle into the vein. The blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle."}

The blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm.\nOnce the blood has been collected, the needle is removed, and the puncture site is covered to stop any bleeding.\nIn infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin and make it bleed. The blood collects into a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip. A bandage may be placed over the area if there is any bleeding.\nDepending on the laboratory, the test may be processed in different ways. One method requires a technician to examine a blood sample under a microscope using ultraviolet light. The other uses an automated instrument to record the results.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed. However, certain drugs, including birth control pills, procainamide, and thiazide diuretics, affect the accuracy of this test."}

Make sure your provider knows about all the medicines you take.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others  may feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou may need this test if you have signs of an\nautoimmune disorder\n, such as unexplained symptoms including\narthritis\n, rashes, fevers or chest pain. Suspected\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\n(SLE) may be the most common reason why the test is done.\nNormal Results\nANA test results are most often reported in 2 parts: the level or titer and the pattern.\nTitres are reported in ratios, most often 1:40, 1:80, 1:160, 1:320, and 1:640. Some, but not all labs will report a titre at or above 1:160 as positive.\nPatterns that are reported include, homogeneous, speckled, centromere, and others.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}

Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.\nFurther tests can be run on blood with a positive ANA test to get more information.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA positive ANA is not enough to make a diagnosis. To diagnose any disease related to a positive ANA, it is important to have:\nA full assessment by a doctor who specializes in any of the illnesses listed below\nFurther antibody testing, for certain illnesses\nTo make the diagnosis of SLE, the following must be present\nCertain clinical features\nPositive ANA results (a lack of ANA makes the diagnosis much less likely)\nCertain specific ANA antibodies, which help to confirm the diagnosis\nOther disorders besides SLE where positive ANA results strongly suggest a diagnosis include:\nSystemic sclerosis (scleroderma)\nSjÃ¶gren syndrome (primary)\nDrug-induced lupus eryt"}
