Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPelvic laparoscopy\nPelvic laparoscopy\nPelvic laparoscopy is surgery to examine the pelvic organs. It uses a viewing tool called a laparoscope. The surgery is also used to treat certain diseases of the pelvic organs.\nDescription\nWhile you are deep asleep and pain-free under general anesthesia, the doctor makes a half-inch (1.25 centimeters) surgical cut in the skin below the belly button. Carbon dioxide gas is pumped into the abdomen to help the surgeon see the organs more easily.\nThe laparoscope, an instrument that looks like a small telescope with a light and a video camera, is inserted so the surgeon can view the area.\nOther instruments may be inserted through other small cuts in the lower abdomen."}

While watching a video monitor, the surgeon is able to:\nTake tissue samples (\nbiopsy\n)\nLook for the cause of any symptoms\nRemove scar tissue or other abnormal tissue, such as from\nendometriosis\nRepair or remove part or all of the ovaries or uterine tubes\nRepair or remove parts of the uterus\nDo other surgical procedures (such as\nappendectomy\n, removing lymph nodes)\nAfter the laparoscopy, the carbon dioxide gas is released, and the cuts are closed.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nLaparoscopy uses a smaller surgical cut than open surgery. Most people who have this procedure are able to return home the same day. The smaller incision also means that the recovery is faster. There is less blood loss with laparoscopic surgery and less pain after surgery.\nPelvic laparoscopy is used both for diagnosis and treatment."}

Sometimes, you may need to stay overnight, depending on what surgery was done using the laparoscope.\nThe gas pumped into the abdomen may cause abdominal discomfort for 1 to 2 days after the procedure. Some people feel neck and shoulder pain for several days after a laparoscopy because the carbon dioxide gas irritates the diaphragm. As the gas is absorbed, this pain will go away. Lying down can help decrease the pain.\nYou will get a prescription for pain medicine or be told what over-the-counter pain medicines you can take.\nYou may go back to your normal activities within 1 to 2 days. However, DO NOT lift anything over 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) for 3 weeks after surgery to decrease your risk of getting a\nhernia\nin your incisions.\nDepending on what procedure is done, you can usually begin sexual activities again as soon as any bleeding has stopped. If you have had a hysterectomy, you need to wait a longer period before having sexual intercourse again."}
