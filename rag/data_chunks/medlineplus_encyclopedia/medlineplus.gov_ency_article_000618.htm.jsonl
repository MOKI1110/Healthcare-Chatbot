If the infection is severe, antibiotics may need to be given through an\nintravenous\n(IV) line.\nPeople who have repeated episodes of erysipelas may benefit from long-term antibiotics.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWith treatment, the outcome is good. It may take a few weeks for the skin to return to normal. Peeling is common as the skin heals.\nPossible Complications\nSometimes the bacteria that cause erysipelas may travel to the blood. This results in a condition called bacteremia. When this happens, the infection may spread to the heart valves, joints, and bones.\nOther complications include:\nReturn of infection\nSeptic shock\n(a dangerous body-wide infection)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have a skin sore or other symptoms of erysipelas.\nPrevention\nKeep your skin healthy by avoiding dry skin and preventing cuts and scrapes."}
