The disease is passed down through families.\nCauses\nHD is caused by a genetic variant on chromosome 4. The variant causes a part of your DNA to occur many more times than it is supposed to. This variant is called a CAG repeat. Normally, this section of DNA is repeated 10 to 28 times. But in people with HD, it is repeated 36 to 120 times.\nAs the gene is passed down through families, the number of repeats tends to get larger. The larger the number of repeats, the higher a person's chance of developing symptoms at an earlier age. Therefore, as the disease is passed along in families, symptoms develop at younger and younger ages.\nThere are two forms of HD:\nAdult-onset is the most common."}

Therefore, as the disease is passed along in families, symptoms develop at younger and younger ages.\nThere are two forms of HD:\nAdult-onset is the most common. Persons with this form usually develop symptoms in their mid-30s or 40s.\nEarly-onset affects a small number of people and begins in childhood or the teens.\nIf one of your parents has HD, you have a 50% chance of getting the gene. If you get the gene from one of your parents, you can pass it on to your children, who will also have a 50% chance of getting the gene. If you do not get the gene from your parents, you cannot pass the gene on to your children.\nSymptoms\nAbnormal behaviors may occur before movement problems develop, and can include:\nBehavioral disturbances\nHallucinations\nIrritability\nMoodiness\nRestlessness or fidgeting\nParanoia\nPsychosis\nAbnormal and unusual movements include:\nFacial movements, including grimaces\nHead turning to shift eye position\nQuick, sudden, sometimes wild jerking movements of the arms, legs, face, and other body parts\nSlow, uncontrolled movements\nUnsteady gait, including \"prancing\" and  a wide walk (also called a wide-based gait)\nAbnormal movements can lea"}

You can also call 1-800-273-8255 (1-800-273-TALK). The 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline provides free and confidential support 24/7, anytime day or night.\nYou can also call 911 or the local emergency number or go to the hospital emergency room. DO NOT delay.\nIf someone you know has attempted suicide, call 911 or the local emergency number right away. DO NOT leave the person alone, even after you have called for help.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling is advised if there is a family history of HD."}
