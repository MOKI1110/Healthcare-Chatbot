Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nParathyroid hormone (PTH) blood test\nParathyroid hormone (PTH) blood test\nThe PTH test measures the level of parathyroid hormone in the blood.\nPTH stands for parathyroid hormone. It is a protein hormone released by the parathyroid gland.\nA laboratory test can be done to measure the amount of PTH in your blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nAsk your health care provider if you should stop eating or drinking for some period of time before the test. Most often, you will not need to fast or stop drinking.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nPTH is released by the parathyroid glands. The 4 small parathyroid glands are located in the neck, near or attached to the back side of the thyroid gland."}

The 4 small parathyroid glands are located in the neck, near or attached to the back side of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is located in the neck, just above where your collarbones meet in the middle.\nPTH controls calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the blood. It is important for regulating bone growth. Your provider may order this test if:\nYou have a\nhigh calcium level\nor\nlow phosphorus\nlevel in your blood.\nYou have severe\nosteoporosis\nthat cannot be explained or does not respond to treatment.\nYou have kidney disease.\nTo help understand whether your PTH is normal, your provider will measure your\nblood calcium\nat the same time.\nNormal Results\nNormal values are 10 to 55 picograms per milliliter (pg/mL).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results."}

Some labs use different measurements or test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. Try to go back to the same lab each time you need to have your PTH level tested so your provider can reliably compare your results over time.\nA PTH value in the normal range can still be inappropriate when serum calcium levels are high. Talk to your provider about what your result means.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA higher-than-normal level may occur with:\nDisorders that increase phosphate or phosphorous levels in the blood, such as\nlong-term (chronic) kidney disease\nFailure of the body to respond to PTH (pseudohypoparathyroidism)\nLack of calcium, which may be due to not eating enough calcium, not absorbing calcium in the gut, or losing too much calcium in your urine\nPregnancy or breastfeeding (uncommon)\nSwelling or tumors (adenomas) in the parathyroid glands, called primary\nhyperparathyroidism\nVitamin D disorders, including not enough sunlight in older adults and problems absorbing, breaking down, and using vitamin D in the body\nA lower-than-normal level may occur with:\nAccidental rem"}
