Keep fingernails short to avoid damaging the skin from scratching. Family members or friends may be able to help by calling attention to your scratching.\nWear cool, light, loose bedclothes. Avoid wearing rough clothing, such as wool, over an itchy area.\nTake lukewarm baths using little soap and rinse thoroughly. Try a skin-soothing oatmeal or cornstarch bath.\nApply a soothing lotion after bathing to soften and cool the skin.\nUse moisturizer on the skin, especially in the dry winter months. Dry skin is a common cause of itching.\nApply cold compresses to an itchy area.\nAvoid prolonged exposure to excessive heat and humidity.\nDo activities that distract you from the itching during the day and make you tired enough to sleep at night.\nTry over-the-counter oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl)."}

Look for a cause of itching at home.\nIt is sometimes easy for a parent to find the cause of a child's itching. Looking closely at the skin will help you identify any bites, stings, rashes, dry skin, or irritation.\nHave the itching checked out as soon as possible if it keeps returning and does not have a clear cause, you have itching all over your body, or you have hives that keep returning. Unexplained itching may be a symptom of a disease that could be serious.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nYour provider will examine you. You'll also be asked about the itching."}
