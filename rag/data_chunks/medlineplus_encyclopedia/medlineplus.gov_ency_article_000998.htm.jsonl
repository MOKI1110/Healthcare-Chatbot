It can take 1 to 3 weeks for a canker sore to completely heal. Large ulcers can take longer to heal.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can often make the diagnosis by looking at the sore.\nIf canker sores persist or continue to return, tests should be done to look for other causes, such as\nerythema multiforme\n,\nmedicine allergies\n, herpes infection, and bullous\nlichen planus\n.\nYou may need further testing or a\nbiopsy\nto look for other causes of mouth ulcers. Canker sores are not cancer and do not cause cancer. There are types of cancer, however, that may first appear as a mouth ulcer that does not heal.\nTreatment\nIn most cases, the canker sores go away without treatment.\nTry not to eat hot or spicy foods, which can cause pain.\nUse over-the-counter medicines that ease pain in the area.\nRinse your mouth with salt water or mild, over-the-counter mouthwashes. (DO NOT use mouthwashes that contain alcohol which can irritate the area more.)\nApply a mixture of half hydrogen peroxide and half water directly to the sore using a cotton swab."}
