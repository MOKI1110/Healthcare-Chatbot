Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPlacenta previa\nPlacenta previa\nPlacenta previa is a problem of pregnancy in which the placenta grows in the lowest part of the womb (uterus) and covers all or part of the opening to the\ncervix\n.\nThe placenta grows during pregnancy and feeds the developing baby. The cervix is the opening to the birth canal.\nCauses\nDuring pregnancy, the placenta moves as the womb stretches and grows. It is very common for the placenta to be low in the womb in early pregnancy. But as the pregnancy continues, the placenta moves to the top of the womb. By the third trimester, the placenta should be near the top of the womb, so the cervix is open for delivery.\nSometimes, the placenta partly or completely covers the cervix. This is called a placenta previa.\nThere are different forms of placenta previa:\nMarginal: The placenta is next to the cervix but does not cover the opening.\nPartial: The placenta covers part of the cervical opening.\nComplete: The placenta covers all of the cervical opening.\nPlacenta previa occurs in 1 out of 200 pregnancies."}

It is more common in women who have:\nAn abnormally shaped uterus\nHad many pregnancies in the past\nHad multiple pregnancies, such as twins or triplets\nScarring on the lining of the uterus due to a history of surgery, C-section, or abortion\nIn vitro fertilization\nA history of placenta previa in a previous pregnancy\nWomen who smoke, use cocaine, or have their children at an older age may also have an increased risk.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom of placenta previa is\nsudden bleeding from the vagina\n. Some women also have cramps. The bleeding often starts near the end of the second trimester or beginning of the third trimester.\nBleeding may be severe and life threatening. It may stop on its own but can start again days or weeks later.\nLabor sometimes starts within several days of the heavy bleeding."}

Sometimes, bleeding may not occur until after labor starts.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can diagnose this condition with a pregnancy ultrasound.\nTreatment\nYour provider will carefully consider the risk of bleeding against early delivery of your baby. After 36 weeks, delivery of the baby may be the best treatment.\nNearly all women with placenta previa will need a\nC-section\n. If the placenta covers all or part of the cervix, a vaginal delivery can cause severe bleeding."}

If you have severe bleeding, your baby may need to be delivered early, before major organs, such as the lungs, have developed.\nFor most women who receive regular prenatal care, this condition is diagnosed before symptoms appear. This helps the provider and mother take steps to minimize risks from this condition.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have vaginal bleeding during pregnancy.
