Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRiboflavin\nRiboflavin\nRiboflavin is a type of B vitamin. It is water soluble, which means it is not stored in the body. Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water. Leftover amounts of the vitamin leave the body through the urine. The body keeps a small reserve of these vitamins. They have to be taken on a regular basis to maintain the reserve.\nFunction\nRiboflavin (vitamin B2) works with the other B vitamins. It is important for body growth. It helps in red blood cell production. It also aids in the release of energy from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.\nFood Sources\nThe following foods provide riboflavin in the diet:\nDairy products\nEggs\nGreen leafy vegetables\nLean meats\nOrgan meats, such as liver and kidneys\nLegumes\nMilk\nNuts\nBreads and cereals are often fortified with riboflavin. Fortified means the vitamin has been added to the food.\nRiboflavin is destroyed by exposure to light."}

Fortified means the vitamin has been added to the food.\nRiboflavin is destroyed by exposure to light. Foods with riboflavin should not be stored in clear containers that are exposed to light.\nSide Effects\nLack of riboflavin is not common in the United States because this vitamin is plentiful in the food supply. Symptoms of a severe deficiency include:\nAnemia\nMouth or lip sores\nSkin complaints\nSore throat\nSwelling of mucous membranes\nBecause riboflavin is a water-soluble vitamin, leftover amounts leave the body through the urine. There is no known poisoning from riboflavin.\nRecommendations\nRecommendations for riboflavin, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people."}

DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA):\nThe average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people. An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence.\nAdequate Intake (AI):\nThis level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA. It is set at a level that is thought to ensure enough nutrition.\nDietary Reference Intakes  for riboflavin:\nInfants\n0 to 6 months: 0.3* milligrams per day (mg/day)\n7 to 12 months: 0.4* mg/day\n*Adequate Intake (AI)\nChildren\n1 to 3 years: 0.5 mg/day\n4 to 8 years: 0.6 mg/day\n9 to 13 years: 0.9 mg/day\nAdolescents and adults\nMales age 14 and older: 1.3 mg/day\nFemales age 14 to 18 years: 1.0 mg/day\nFemales age 19 and older: 1.1 mg/day\nPregnancy: 1.4 mg/day\nLactation: 1.6 mg/day\nThe best way to get the daily requirement of essential vitamins is to eat a balanced diet that contains a variety of foods.\nAlterna"}
