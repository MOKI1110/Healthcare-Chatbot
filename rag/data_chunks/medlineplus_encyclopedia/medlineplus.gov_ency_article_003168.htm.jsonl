Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nClaw foot\nClaw foot\nClaw foot is a deformity of the foot. The joint of the toe that is closest to the ankle is bent upward, and the other joints are bent downward. The toe looks like a claw.\nConsiderations\nClaw toes may be present at birth (congenital). The condition can also develop later in life because of other disorders (acquired). Claw toes may be caused by a nerve problem in the legs or a spinal cord problem or signs of arthritis. The cause is unknown in many cases.\nMost of the time, claw toes are not harmful by themselves. Rarely, they may be the first sign of a more serious disease of the nervous system.\nClaw toes may cause pain and lead to calluses on the top of the toe over the first joint, but may also be painless."}
