Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPseudohypoparathyroidism\nPseudohypoparathyroidism\nPseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP)  is a genetic disorder in which the body fails to respond to parathyroid hormone.\nA related condition is\nhypoparathyroidism\n,  in which the body does not make enough parathyroid hormone.\nCauses\nThe parathyroid glands produce parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH helps regulate calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the blood and is important for bone health.\nIf you have PHP, your body produces the right amount of PTH, but is resistant to its effect. This causes low blood calcium levels and high blood phosphate levels.\nPHP is caused by abnormal genes. There are different types of PHP. All forms are rare and are usually diagnosed in childhood.\nType 1a is inherited in an\nautosomal dominant manner\n. That means only one parent needs to pass you the variant gene for you to have the condition. It is also called Albright hereditary osteodystrophy. The condition causes short stature, round face, obesity, developmental delay, and short hand bones."}

It is also called Albright hereditary osteodystrophy. The condition causes short stature, round face, obesity, developmental delay, and short hand bones. Symptoms depend on whether you inherit the gene from your mother or father.\nType 1b involves resistance to PTH only in the kidneys. Less is known about type 1b than type 1a. Calcium in the blood is low, but there are none of the other characteristic features of Albright hereditary osteodystrophy.\nType 2 also involves low blood calcium and high blood phosphate levels. People with this form do not have the physical traits common to people with Type 1a. The genetic abnormality that causes it is not known."}

It is different from Type 1b in how the kidney responds to high PTH levels.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms are related to a  low level of calcium and include:\nCataracts\nDental problems\nNumbness\nSeizures\nTetany (a collection of symptoms including muscle twitches and hand and foot cramps and muscle spasms)\nPeople with Albright hereditary osteodystrophy may have the following symptoms:\nCalcium deposits under the skin\nDimples that can replace knuckles on affected fingers\nRound face and short neck\nShort hand bones, especially the bone below the 4th finger\nShort height\nExams and Tests\nBlood tests will be done to check\ncalcium\n,\nphosphorus\n, and\nPTH\nlevels. You may also need urine tests.\nOther tests may include:\nGenetic testing\nHead MRI\nor\nCT scan of the brain\nTreatment\nYour health care provider will recommend calcium and vitamin D supplements to maintain a proper blood calcium level."}

If the blood phosphate level is high, you may need to follow a low-phosphorus diet or take medicines called phosphate binders (such as calcium carbonate or calcium acetate). Treatment is usually life-long.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nLow blood calcium in PHP is usually milder than in other forms of hypoparathyroidism, but the severity of symptoms can be different between different people.\nPossible Complications\nPeople with type 1a PHP  are more likely to have other endocrine system problems (such as\nhypothyroidism\nand\nhypogonadism\n).\nPHP may be connected to other hormone problems, resulting in:\nLow sex drive\nSlow sexual development\nLow energy levels\nWeight gain\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you or your child have any symptoms of a low calcium level or pseudohypoparathyroidism.\nAlternative Names\nAlbright hereditary osteodystrophy; Types 1A and 1B pseudohypoparathyroidism; PHP\nImages\nEndocrine glands\nParathyroid glands\nReferences\nBastepe M, Juppner H."}
