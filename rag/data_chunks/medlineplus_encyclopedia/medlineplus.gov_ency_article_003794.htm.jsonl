It does not use radiation (\nx-rays\n).\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is done in the following way:\nYou may be asked to wear a hospital gown or clothing without metal fasteners (such as sweatpants and a t-shirt). Certain types of metal can cause blurry images or be dangerous to have on in the scanner room.\nYou'll lie on a narrow table, which slides into the large tunnel-shaped scanner.\nYou must be still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods.\nSome exams require a special dye called contrast. The dye is usually given before the test through a vein (\nIV\n) in your hand or forearm. The dye helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly. A blood test to measure your kidney function may be done before the test."}

The dye helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly. A blood test to measure your kidney function may be done before the test. This is to make sure your kidneys are healthy enough to filter the contrast.\nDuring the MRI, the person who operates the machine will watch you from another room. The test most often lasts 30 to 60 minutes, but it may take longer.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan.\nTell your health care provider if you are claustrophobic (afraid of closed spaces). You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious."}

You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious. Your provider may suggest an open MRI, in which the machine is not as close to your body.\nBefore the test, tell your provider if you have:\nBrain aneurysm\nclips\nArtificial heart valves\nHeart defibrillator or\npacemaker\nInner ear (cochlear) implants\nKidney disease or are on dialysis (you may not be able to receive contrast)\nRecently placed artificial joints\nVascular\nstents\nWorked with sheet metal in the past (you may need tests to check for metal pieces in your eyes)\nThe MRI contains strong magnets, so metal objects are not allowed into the room with the MRI scanner. This is because there is a risk that they will be drawn from your body toward the scanner."}

Examples of metal objects you will need to remove are:\nPens, pocket knives, and eyeglasses\nItems such as jewelry, watches, credit cards, and hearing aids\nPins, hairpins, and metal zippers\nRemovable dental work\nSome of the newer medical devices described above are MRI compatible, so the radiologist needs to check the device manufacturer to determine if an MRI is possible.\nHow the Test will Feel\nAn MRI exam causes no pain. If you have trouble lying still or are very nervous, you may be given medicine to relax. Too much movement can blur MRI images and cause errors when the radiologist or provider looks at the images.\nThe table may be hard or cold, but you can ask for a blanket or pillow. The machine produces loud thumping and humming noises when turned on. You can wear ear plugs to help reduce the noise.\nAn intercom in the room allows you to speak to someone at any time."}

Some MRIs have televisions and special headphones that you can use to help the time pass.\nThere is no recovery time, unless you were given a medicine to relax. After an MRI scan, you can resume your normal diet, activity, and medicines.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA chest MRI provides detailed pictures of tissues within the chest area. In general, it is not as good at looking at the lungs as a\nCT chest scan\n, but it can be better for other tissues.\nA chest MRI may be done to:\nProvide an alternative to\nangiography\n, or avoid repeated exposure to radiation\nClarify findings from earlier\nx-rays\nor CT scans\nDiagnose abnormal growths in the chest\nEvaluate blood flow\nShow lymph nodes and blood vessels\nShow the structures of the chest from many angles\nSee if cancer in the chest has spread to other areas of the body (this is called\nstaging\n-- it helps guide future treatment and follow-up, and gives you an idea of what to expect in the future)\nDetect\ntumors\n, especially in the middle part of the c"}

To date, no side effects from the magnetic fields and radio waves have been reported.\nThe most common type of contrast (dye) used is gadolinium. It is very safe. Allergic reactions to the substance rarely occur. However, gadolinium can be harmful to people with kidney problems who need dialysis. If you have kidney problems, tell your provider before the test.\nThe strong magnetic fields created during an MRI can cause heart pacemakers and other implants not to work as well. It can also cause a piece of metal inside your body to move or shift.\nConsiderations\nCurrently, MRI is not considered a valuable tool for spotting or monitoring slight changes in lung tissue. The lungs contain mostly air and are hard to image."}
