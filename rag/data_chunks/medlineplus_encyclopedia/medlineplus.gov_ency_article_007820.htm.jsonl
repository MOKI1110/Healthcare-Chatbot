When used to treat pain, RFA is used to target and kill nerve tissue. This blocks the nerve from sending pain signals to the brain.\nRFA can also be used to shrink tumors and other growths, and treat venous insufficiency, heart rhythm problems, and other conditions.\nThis article is about using radiofrequency ablation to help treat long-lasting (chronic) pain.\nDescription\nThe procedure will be performed with x-ray or ultrasound guidance, using a needle, a microelectrode, and radiofrequency current. It takes about 1 to 2 hours for the procedure."}

It takes about 1 to 2 hours for the procedure. The procedure can be performed at your health care provider's office or a clinic.\nYour provider will give you a medicine (sedative) through your vein (IV) to relax you.\nYou will be lying on your stomach, back, or your side for the procedure.\nA local anesthetic will be used to numb the area being treated.\nWhile using a machine that generates a radiofrequency current, a hollow needle will be inserted through the skin and guided with an x-ray or ultrasound to the correct site.\nA microelectrode is passed through the needle. You will feel a tingling sensation. This helps ensure the needle is placed correctly.\nOnce the needle and electrode are placed correctly, you'll be given additional numbing medicine.\nThe radiofrequency current runs through the electrode, heating and destroying the nerve tissue. You will feel mild discomfort during this process.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nRFA is used to treat pain that doesn't improve with medicines or physical therapy."}

These may include:\nLeg numbness (only for a few hours after the procedure)\nTemporary mild increase of your normal discomfort (2 to 3 days)\nRisks of ablation procedures may include:\nInfection\nBleeding\nNerve injury\nA temporary increase in pain\nBefore the Procedure\nAlways tell your provider what medicines you are taking. This includes any medicines, supplements, or herbal supplements you bought without a prescription. You may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting.
