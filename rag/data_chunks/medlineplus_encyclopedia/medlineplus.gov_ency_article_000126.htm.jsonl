It can sometimes be accompanied by air in the pleural cavity that may let the lung partially collapse (pneumothorax). Hemothorax can also occur in people who have:\nA blood clotting defect\nChest (thoracic) or heart surgery\nDeath of lung tissue (pulmonary infarction)\nLung or pleural\ncancer\n-- primary or secondary (metastatic, or from another site)\nA tear in a blood vessel when placing a central venous catheter or when associated with severe high blood pressure\nTuberculosis\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nShortness of breath\nRapid, shallow breathing\nChest pain\nLow blood pressure\n(shock)\nPale, cool and clammy skin\nRapid heart rate\nRestlessness\nAnxiety\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider may note decreased or absent breath sounds on the affected side."}

Signs or findings of hemothorax may be seen on the following tests:\nChest x-ray\nCT scan\nThoracentesis\n(drainage of pleural fluid through a needle or catheter)\nThoracostomy (drainage of pleural fluid through a chest tube)\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to get the person stable, stop the bleeding, and remove the blood and air in the pleural space.\nA chest tube is inserted through the chest wall between the ribs to drain the blood and air.\nIt is left in place and attached to suction for several days to re-expand the lung.\nIf a chest tube alone does not control the bleeding, surgery (\nthoracotomy\n) may be needed to stop the bleeding.\nThe cause of the hemothorax will be also treated. The underlying lung may have collapsed. This can lead to breathing difficulty. In people who have had an injury, chest tube drainage may be all that is needed."}

Symptoms will be treated as needed. The person may receive:\nBreathing support -- This may include oxygen, non-invasive airway pressure support such as BIPAP, or endotracheal intubation (placement of a breathing tube through the mouth or nose into the airway) and placement on a ventilator (life support breathing machine)\nBlood tests and possible blood transfusion\nChest tube (tube through the skin and muscles between the ribs into the space around the lungs) if there is lung collapse\nCT scan\nAnalysis of the pleural fluid\nElectrocardiogram (ECG)\nFluids given through the vein (IV)\nMedicines to treat symptoms\nX-rays of chest and abdomen or other parts of the body if there are additional injuries\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome depends on the cause of the hemothorax, the amount of blood"}
