MRSA is a staph germ (bacteria) that does not get better with the type of antibiotics that usually cure staph infections.\nWhen this occurs, the germ is said to be resistant to certain antibiotics.\nCauses\nMost staph germs are spread by skin-to-skin contact (touching). A doctor, nurse, other health care provider, or visitors to a hospital may have staph germs on their body that can spread to a patient.\nOnce the staph germ enters the body, it can spread to bones, joints, the blood, or any organ, such as the lungs, heart, or brain.\nSerious staph infections are more common in people with chronic (long-term) medical problems."}

These include those who:\nAre in\nhospitals and long-term care facilities\nfor a long time\nAre on kidney dialysis (\nhemodialysis\n)\nReceive\ncancer\ntreatment or medicines that weaken their immune system\nMRSA infections can also occur in healthy people who have not recently been in the hospital. Most of these MRSA infections are on the skin, or less commonly, in the lung. People who may be at risk are:\nAthletes and others who share items such as towels or razors\nPeople who inject illegal drugs\nPeople who had surgery in the past year\nChildren in day care\nMembers of the military\nPeople who have gotten tattoos\nRecent influenza infection\nSymptoms\nIt is normal for healthy people to have staph on their skin. Many of us do. Most of the time, it does not cause an infection or any symptoms. This is called colonization or being colonized. Someone who is colonized with MRSA can spread it to other people.\nA sign of a staph skin infection is a red, swollen, and painful area on the skin."}

This is called colonization or being colonized. Someone who is colonized with MRSA can spread it to other people.\nA sign of a staph skin infection is a red, swollen, and painful area on the skin. Pus or other fluids may drain from this area. It may look like a boil. These symptoms are more likely to occur if the skin has been cut or rubbed, because this gives the MRSA germ a way to enter your body. Symptoms are also more likely in areas where there is more body hair, because the germ can get into hair follicles.\nMRSA infection in people who are in health care facilities tends to be severe. These infections may be in the bloodstream, heart, lungs or other organs, urine, or in the area of a recent surgery. Some symptoms of these severe infections may include:\nChest pain\nCough or\nshortness of breath\nFatigue\nFever and\nchills\nGeneral ill feeling\nHeadache\nRash\nWounds that do not heal\nExams and Tests\nThe only way to know for sure if you have a MRSA or staph infection is to see your provider and be tested.\nIndividuals who are colonized without active infection rarely require treatment.\nA cotton swab is used to collect a sample from an open skin rash or skin sore."}

If staph is found, it will be tested to see which antibiotics are and are not effective against it. This process helps tell if MRSA is present and which antibiotics can be used to treat the infection.\nTreatment\nDraining the infection may be the only treatment needed for a skin MRSA infection that has not spread. A provider should do this procedure. Do not try to pop open or drain the infection yourself. Keep any sore or wound covered with a clean bandage.\nSevere MRSA infections are becoming harder to treat. Your lab test results will tell your provider which antibiotic will treat your infection.
