Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNeurogenic bladder\nNeurogenic bladder\nNeurogenic bladder is a problem in which a person lacks bladder control due to a brain, spinal cord, or nerve condition.\nCauses\nSeveral muscles and nerves must work together for the bladder to hold urine until you are ready to empty it. Nerve messages go back and forth between the brain and the muscles that control bladder emptying. If these nerves are damaged by illness or injury, the muscles may not be able to tighten or relax at the right time.\nDisorders of the central nervous system commonly cause neurogenic bladder. These can include:\nAlzheimer disease\nBirth defects of the spinal cord, such as spina bifida\nBrain or spinal cord tumors\nCerebral palsy\nEncephalitis\nLearning disabilities such as\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder\n(ADHD)\nMultiple sclerosis\n(MS)\nParkinson disease\nSpinal cord injury\nStroke\nDamage or disorders of the nerves that supply the bladder can also cause this condition."}

They often include symptoms of\nurinary incontinence\n.\nSymptoms of overactive bladder may include:\nHaving to urinate too often but in small amounts\nProblems emptying all the urine from the bladder\nLoss of bladder control\nSymptoms of underactive bladder may include:\nFull bladder and possibly urine leakage\nInability to tell when the bladder is full\nProblems starting to urinate or emptying all the urine from the bladder (urinary retention)\nTreatment\nMedicines may help manage your symptoms."}

This may help you learn when you should empty your bladder and when it may be best to be near a bathroom.\nLearn to recognize the symptoms of\nurinary tract infections\n(UTIs), such as burning when you urinate, fever, low back pain on one side, and a more frequent need to urinate. Cranberry tablets may help prevent UTIs.\nSome people may need to use a\nurinary catheter\n. This is a thin tube that is inserted into your bladder."}

Surgeries for neurogenic bladder include:\nArtificial sphincter\nElectrical device implanted near the bladder nerves to stimulate the bladder muscles\nSling surgery\nCreation of an opening (stoma) in which urine flows into a special pouch (this is called urinary diversion)\nElectrical stimulation of the tibial nerve in the leg may be recommended. This involves placing a needle into the tibial nerve. The needle is connected to an electrical device that sends signals to the tibial nerve."}
