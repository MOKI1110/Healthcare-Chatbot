Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a rare disorder of blood platelets. Platelets are particles in the blood that aid in blood clotting.\nCauses\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is caused by the lack of a protein that is normally on the surface of platelets. This substance is needed for platelets to clump together to plug up bleeding spots and begin forming a clot.\nThe condition is congenital, which means it is present from birth. There are several genetic abnormalities that can cause the condition.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nHeavy bleeding during and after surgery\nBleeding gums\nBruising easily or pinpoint red spots on the skin\nHeavy menstrual bleeding\nNosebleeds that do not stop easily\nProlonged bleeding with minor injuries\nExams and Tests\nThe following tests may be used to diagnose this condition:\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nPlatelet aggregation test\nPlatelet function analysis (PFA)\nProthrombin time\n(PT) and\npartial thromboplastin time\n(PTT)\nOther tests may be needed."}

Family members may also need to be tested.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for this disorder. Platelet transfusions may be given to people who are having severe bleeding.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with Glanzmann thrombasthenia and their families can be found at:\nGenetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) --\nrarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/2478/glanzmann-thrombasthenia\nNational Organization for Rare Disorders (NORD) --\nrarediseases.org/rare-diseases/glanzmann-thrombasthenia/\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia is a lifelong condition, and there is no cure. You should take special steps to try to avoid bleeding if you have this condition.\nAnyone with a bleeding disorder should avoid taking aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen and naproxen."}
