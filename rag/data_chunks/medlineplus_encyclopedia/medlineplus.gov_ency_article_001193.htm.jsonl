Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNeonatal hypothyroidism\nNeonatal hypothyroidism\nNeonatal hypothyroidism is decreased thyroid hormone production in a newborn. In very rare cases, no thyroid hormone is produced.  The condition is also called congenital hypothyroidism. Congenital means present from birth.\nCauses\nThe thyroid gland is an important organ of the\nendocrine system\n. It is located at the front of the neck, just above where the collarbones meet. The thyroid makes hormones that control the way every cell in the body uses energy. This process is called\nmetabolism\n.\nHypothyroidism in the newborn may be caused by:\nA missing or poorly developed thyroid gland\nA pituitary gland that does not stimulate the thyroid gland\nThyroid hormones that are poorly formed or do not work\nMedicines the mother took during pregnancy\nLack of iodine in the mother's diet during pregnancy\nAntibodies\nmade by the mother's body that block the baby's thyroid function\nA thyroid gland that is not fully developed is the most common defect."}

Girls are affected twice as often as boys.\nSymptoms\nMost affected infants have few or no symptoms. This is because their thyroid hormone level is only slightly low. Infants with severe hypothyroidism often have a unique appearance, including:\nDull look\nPuffy face\nThick tongue that sticks out\nThis appearance often develops as the disease gets worse.\nThe child may also have:\nPoor feeding, choking episodes\nConstipation\nDry, brittle hair\nHoarse cry\nJaundice\n(skin and whites of the eyes look yellow)\nLack of muscle tone (\nfloppy\ninfant)\nLow hairline\nShort height\nSleepiness\nSluggishness\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam of the infant may show:\nDecreased muscle tone\nSlow growth\nHoarse-sounding cry or voice\nShort arms and legs\nVery large soft spots on the skull (fontanelles)\nWide hands with short fingers\nWidely separated skull bones\nBlood tests are done to check thyroid function. Other tests may include:\nThyroid ultrasound scan\nX-ray of the\nlong bones\nTreatment\nEarly diagnosis is very important."}

For this reason, most US states require that all newborns be screened for hypothyroidism.\nThyroxine is usually given to treat hypothyroidism. Once the child starts taking this medicine, blood tests are regularly done to make sure thyroid hormone levels are in a normal range.\nReferral to a pediatric endocrinologist is recommended for care.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nGetting diagnosed early usually leads to a good outcome. Newborns diagnosed and treated in the first month or so usually have normal intelligence.\nUntreated mild hypothyroidism can lead to severe\nintellectual disability\nand growth problems. The nervous system goes through important development during the first few months after birth."}

Infants whose mothers have taken such medicines should be observed carefully after birth for signs of hypothyroidism.  Also, pregnant women should not avoid iodine-supplemented salt.\nMost states require a routine\nscreening test\nto check all newborns for hypothyroidism.  If your state does not have this requirement, ask your provider if your newborn should be screened.\nAlternative Names\nCretinism; Congenital hypothyroidism\nReferences\nChuang J, Gutmark-Little I.
