Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nElectromyography\nElectromyography\nElectromyography (EMG) is a test that checks the health of the muscles and the nerves that control the muscles.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYour health care provider inserts a very thin needle electrode through your skin into one of your muscles. The electrode on the needle picks up the electrical activity given off by your muscles. This activity appears on a nearby monitor and may be heard through a speaker.\nAfter placement of the electrodes, you may be asked to contract the muscle. For example, by bending your arm. The electrical activity seen on the monitor provides information about your muscle's ability to respond when the nerves to your muscles are stimulated.\nnerve conduction velocity\ntest is almost always performed during the same visit as an EMG. The velocity test is done to see how fast and strong electrical signals move through a nerve.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is usually necessary."}

Avoid using any creams or lotions on the day of the test.\nBody temperature can affect the results of this test. If it is extremely cold outside, you may be told to wait in a warm room for a while before the test is performed.\nIf you are taking blood thinners or anticoagulants, inform the provider performing the test before it is done.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel some pain or discomfort when the needles are inserted. But most people are able to complete the test without problems.\nAfterward, the muscle may feel tender or bruised for a few days.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nEMG is most often used when a person has symptoms of weakness, pain, or abnormal sensation. It can help tell the difference between muscle weakness caused by the injury of a nerve attached to a muscle, and weakness due to a muscle or other nervous system disease.\nNormal Results\nThere is normally very little electrical activity in a muscle while at rest."}

Inserting the needles can cause some electrical activity, but once the muscles quiet down, there should be little electrical activity detected.\nWhen you flex a muscle, activity begins to appear. As you contract your muscle more, the electrical activity increases and a pattern can be seen. This pattern helps your provider determine if the muscle is responding as it should.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn EMG can detect problems with your muscles during rest or activity."}
