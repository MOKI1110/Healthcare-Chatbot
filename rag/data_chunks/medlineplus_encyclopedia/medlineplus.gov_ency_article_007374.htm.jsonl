Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nUrinary incontinence - retropubic suspension\nUrinary incontinence - retropubic suspension\nRetropubic suspension is surgery to help control\nstress incontinence\n. This is urine leakage that happens when you laugh, cough, sneeze, lift things, or exercise. The surgery helps close your urethra and bladder neck. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside. The bladder neck is the part of the bladder that connects to the urethra.\nDescription\nYou receive either\ngeneral anesthesia\nor spinal anesthesia before the surgery starts.\nWith general anesthesia, you are asleep and feel no pain.\nWith\nspinal anesthesia\n, you are awake but numb from the waist down and feel no pain.\nA catheter (tube) is placed in your bladder to drain urine from your bladder.\nThere are 2 ways to do retropubic suspension: open surgery or laparoscopic surgery. Either way, surgery may take up to 2 hours.\nDuring open surgery:\nA surgical cut (incision) is made on the lower part of your belly.\nThrough this cut the bladder is located."}

Either way, surgery may take up to 2 hours.\nDuring open surgery:\nA surgical cut (incision) is made on the lower part of your belly.\nThrough this cut the bladder is located. The surgeon sews (sutures) the bladder neck, part of the wall of the vagina, and the urethra to the bones and ligaments in your pelvis.\nThis lifts the bladder and urethra so they can close better.\nDuring laparoscopic surgery, the surgeon makes a smaller cut in your belly. A tube-like device that allows the doctor to see your organs (laparoscope) is put into your belly through this cut. The surgeon sutures the bladder neck, part of the wall of the vagina, and the urethra to the bones and ligaments in the pelvis.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThis procedure is done to treat stress incontinence.\nBefore discussing surgery, your surgeon will have you try bladder retraining, Kegel exercises, medicines, or other options."}
