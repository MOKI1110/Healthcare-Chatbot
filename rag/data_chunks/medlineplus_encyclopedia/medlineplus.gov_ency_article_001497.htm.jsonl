They occur while the baby is growing in the mother's womb.\nFemale reproductive organs include the\nvagina\n, ovaries, uterus, and\ncervix\n.\nCauses\nA baby starts to develop its reproductive organs between weeks 4 and 5 of pregnancy. This continues until the 20th week of pregnancy.\nThis development is a complex process. Many things can affect this process. The severity of the differences depends on when the interruption occurred. In general, if the problems occur earlier in the womb, the effect will be more widespread. Problems in the development of female reproductive organs may be caused by:\nMissing or damaged genes (genetic variance)\nExposure to certain medicines during pregnancy\nSome babies may have a variant in their genes that prevents their body from producing an\nenzyme\ncalled 21-hydroxylase."}

The\nadrenal gland\nneeds this enzyme to make hormones such as cortisol and aldosterone. This condition is called\ncongenital adrenal hyperplasia\n. If a developing female infant lacks this enzyme, the infant will be born with a uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes. However, the external genitals will have a more male-like appearance. Some babies with this syndrome have difficulties with the concentration of salts in their urine. It is very important that this issue be diagnosed early.\nCertain medicines that the mother takes can pass into the bloodstream of the baby and interfere with organ development. One medicine known to do this is diethylstilbestrol (DES). Health care providers once prescribed this medicine to pregnant women to prevent miscarriage and early labor. However, scientists learned that female infants born to women who took this medicine had an abnormally shaped uterus."}

However, scientists learned that female infants born to women who took this medicine had an abnormally shaped uterus. The medicine also increased the daughters' chances of developing a rare form of vaginal cancer.\nIn some cases, a developmental disorder can be seen as soon as the baby is born. It may cause life-threatening conditions in the newborn. Other times, the condition is not diagnosed until the person is older.\nThe reproductive tract develops close to the urinary tract and kidneys. It also develops at the same time as several other organs. As a result, developmental problems in the female reproductive tract sometimes occur with problems in other areas. These areas may include the urinary tract, kidneys, intestine, and lower spine.\nDevelopmental differences of the female reproductive tract include:\nDifferences of sex development\n(DSD)\nAmbiguous genitalia\nOther developmental differences of the female reproductive tract include:\nCloacal abnormalities\n-  The cloaca is a tube-like structure in an unborn baby."}

In the early stages of development, the urinary tract, rectum, and vagina all empty into this single tube. Later, the 3 areas separate and have their own openings. If the cloaca persists as a female infant grows in the womb, all the openings do not form and separate. For example, a baby may be born with only one opening on the bottom of the body near the rectal area. Urine and feces may have difficulty leaving the body. This can cause stomach swelling. Some cloacal abnormalities may cause a female infant to look like they have a penis. These birth defects are rare.\nProblems with external genitals\n-\n\nDevelopmental problems may lead to a swollen clitoris or fused labia. Fused labia is a condition where the folds of tissue around the opening of the vagina are joined together. Most other problems of the outer genitals are related to DSD and ambiguous genitalia.\nImperforate hymen\n-  The hymen is a thin tissue that partly covers the opening to the vagina."}

Most other problems of the outer genitals are related to DSD and ambiguous genitalia.\nImperforate hymen\n-  The hymen is a thin tissue that partly covers the opening to the vagina. An imperforate hymen completely blocks the vaginal opening. This often leads to painful swelling of the vagina. Sometimes, the hymen has only a very small opening or tiny, small holes. This problem may not be discovered until puberty. Some female infants are born without a hymen. This is considered to be a normal variation in development.\nOvarian problems\n-\n\nA female infant may have an extra ovary, extra tissue attached to an ovary, or structures called ovotestes that have both male and female tissue.\nUterus and cervix problems\n-\n\nA female infant may be born with an extra cervix and uterus, a half-formed uterus, or a blockage of the uterus. Usually, females born with a half-formed uterus and vagina are missing the kidney on the same side of the body. More commonly, the uterus can form with a central \"wall\" or septum in the upper portion of the uterus. A variant of this defect occurs when the infant is born with a single cervix but two uteri."}

The upper uteri sometimes do not communicate with the cervix. This leads to swelling and pain. All uterine abnormalities can lead to fertility issues.\nVaginal problems\n-\n\nA female infant may be born without a vagina or have the vaginal opening blocked by a layer of cells that are higher up in the vagina than where the hymen is. A missing vagina is most often due to Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome. In this syndrome, the infant is missing part or all of the internal reproductive organs (uterus, cervix, and fallopian tubes). Other abnormalities include having 2 vaginas or a vagina that opens into the urinary tract. Some females may have a heart-shaped uterus or a uterus with a wall in the middle of the cavity.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms vary according to the specific problem."}

For example, a blocked vagina can most often be corrected with surgery.\nIf the female is missing a vagina, the provider may prescribe a dilator when the person reaches young adulthood. A dilator is a device that helps stretch or widen the area where the vagina is supposed to be. This process takes 4 to 6 months. Surgery may also be done to create a new vagina."}

Surgery should be done when the person is able to use a dilator to keep the new vagina open.\nGood results have been reported with both surgical and nonsurgical methods.\nTreatment of cloacal abnormalities usually involves multiple complex surgeries. These surgeries fix problems with the rectum, vagina, and urinary tract.\nIf the birth defect could cause fatal complications, the first surgery is done shortly after birth. Surgeries for other developmental reproductive differences may also be done while the baby is an infant. Some surgeries may be delayed until the child is much older.\nDepending on the cause, surgery, hormone replacement, or other treatments are used to treat conditions that can cause ambiguous genitalia.\nThere have been significant changes in treating ambiguous genitalia. In the past, it was thought that it was best to assign a sex as quickly as possible. This was often based on the external genitals rather than the chromosomes."}

Working with your child's health care team can help you make the best choices for your child. In addition, a support group can help provide families with the latest research and offer a community of other families, children, and adult individuals who are dealing with the same issues.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with  developmental disorders of the female genital tract and their families can be found at:\nDES Action USA --\nwww.desaction.org\nInterAct --\ninteractadvocates.org\nPossible Complications\nCloacal abnormalities can cause fatal complications at birth.\nPotential complications may develop if the diagnosis is made late or is wrong."}
