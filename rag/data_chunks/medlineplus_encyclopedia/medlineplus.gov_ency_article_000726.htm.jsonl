A stroke is sometimes called a \"brain attack.\"\nIf blood flow is cut off for longer than a few seconds, the brain cannot get nutrients and oxygen. Brain cells can die, causing lasting damage.\nA stroke can also occur if a blood vessel inside the brain bursts, leading to bleeding inside the head.\nCauses\nThere are two major types of stroke:\nIschemic stroke\nHemorrhagic stroke\nIschemic stroke occurs when a blood vessel that supplies blood to the brain is blocked by a blood clot. This may happen in two ways:\nA clot may form in an artery that is already very narrow. This is called a thrombotic stroke\n.\nA clot may break off from another place in the blood vessels of the brain, or from some other part of the body, and travel up to the brain."}

This is called a thrombotic stroke\n.\nA clot may break off from another place in the blood vessels of the brain, or from some other part of the body, and travel up to the brain. This is called cerebral embolism, or an embolic stroke.\nIschemic strokes may also be caused by a sticky substance called plaque that can clog arteries.\nWatch this video about:\nStroke\nA hemorrhagic stroke occurs when a blood vessel in part of the brain becomes weak and bursts open. This causes blood to leak into the brain. Some people have defects in the blood vessels of the brain that make this more likely. These defects may include:\nAneurysm\n(weak area in the wall of a blood vessel that causes the blood vessel to bulge or balloon out)\nArteriovenous malformation\n(AVM; abnormal connection between the arteries and veins)\nCerebral amyloid angiopathy\n(CAA; condition in which proteins called amyloid build up on the walls of the arteries in the brain)\nHemorrhagic strokes may also occur when someone is taking blood thinners, such as dabigatran, rivaroxaban, apixaban, edoxaban and warfarin or has a bleeding disorder."}

In some cases, a person may not know that a stroke has occurred.\nMost of the time, symptoms develop suddenly and without warning. But symptoms may occur on and off for the first day or two. Symptoms are usually most severe when the stroke first happens, but they may slowly get worse.\nA headache may occur if the stroke is caused by bleeding in the brain. The headache:\nStarts suddenly and may be severe\nMay be worse when you are lying flat\nMay wake you up from sleep\nMay get worse when you change positions or when you bend, strain, or cough\nOther symptoms depend on how severe the stroke is, and what part of the brain is affected."}

However, the sooner this treatment is started, the better the chance of a good outcome.\nEndovascular thrombectomy may be needed. This is when a catheter is inserted into your arteries.

The risk begins to decrease after this period.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nStroke is a medical emergency that needs to be treated right away. The acronym F.A.S.T. is an easy way to remember signs of stroke and what to do if you think a stroke has occurred. The most important action to take is to call 911 or the local emergency number right away for emergency assistance.\nF.A.S.T. stands for:\nFACE. Ask the person to smile. Check if one side of the face droops.\nARMS. Ask the person to raise both arms. See if one arm drifts downward.\nSPEECH."}
