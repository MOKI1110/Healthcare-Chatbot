Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nCalcitonin is a hormone produced in C cells of the thyroid gland. The thyroid gland is located inside the front of your lower neck above the collar bones. Calcitonin helps control the breakdown and rebuilding of bone.\nA common reason to have the test is if you have had surgery to remove a thyroid tumor called medullary thyroid cancer."}

The test allows your health care provider to evaluate if the tumor has spread (metastasized) or has come back (tumor recurrence).\nYour provider may also order a calcitonin test when you have symptoms of\nmedullary cancer of the thyroid\n, or\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN)\nsyndrome, or a family history of these conditions. Calcitonin may also be higher in other tumors, such as:\nInsulinoma\n(tumor in the pancreas that produces too much insulin)\nLung cancer\nVIPoma\n(cancer that usually grows from islet cells in the pancreas)\nNormal Results\nA normal value is less than 25 pg/mL (25 picograms per milliliter) for males and less than 20 pg/mL for females.\nWomen and men can have different normal values, with men having higher values.\nSometimes, calcitonin in the blood is checked several times after you are given a shot (injection) of a special medicine that stimulates calcitonin production.\nYou will need this extra test if your baseline calcitonin is normal, but your provider suspects you have"}
