Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nUmbilical hernia repair\nUmbilical hernia repair\nUmbilical hernia repair is surgery to repair an\numbilical hernia\n. An umbilical hernia is a sac (pouch) formed from the inner lining of your belly (abdominal cavity) that pushes through a hole in the abdominal wall at the belly button.\nDescription\nYou will probably receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n(asleep and pain-free) for this surgery. If your hernia is small, you may receive\nspinal, epidural block\n, or local anesthesia and medicine to relax you. If general anesthesia is not used, you will be awake but pain-free.\nYour surgeon will most often make a curved surgical cut following the natural skin lines under your belly button.\nYour surgeon will find your hernia and separate it from the tissues around it."}

Then your surgeon will gently push the contents of the hernia (either fat or intestine) back into the abdomen.\nStrong stitches will be used to repair the hole associated with the umbilical hernia.\nYour surgeon may also place a piece of mesh over the weak area (usually not in children) to make it stronger and less likely to come back.\nAn umbilical hernia can also be repaired using a laparoscope. This is a thin, lighted tube that lets the surgeon see inside your belly. The scope will be inserted through one of several small cuts. The instruments will be inserted through the other cuts.\nIf your child is having this surgery, your surgeon will discuss the type of anesthesia your child will receive. Your surgeon will also describe how the surgery will be done.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nCHILDREN\nUmbilical hernias are fairly common in children. A hernia at birth pushes the belly button out."}

Your surgeon will also describe how the surgery will be done.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nCHILDREN\nUmbilical hernias are fairly common in children. A hernia at birth pushes the belly button out. It shows more when a baby cries because the pressure from crying makes the hernia bulge out more.\nIn infants, the problem is not usually treated with surgery. Many times, the umbilical hernia shrinks and closes on its own by the time a child is 3 or 4 years old.\nUmbilical hernia repair may be needed in children because:\nThe hernia is painful and stuck in the bulging position.\nThe blood supply to the intestine is restricted.\nThe hernia has not closed by age 3 or 4.\nThe hernia is very large or unacceptable to parents because of how it makes their child look. Even in these cases, the surgeon will probably suggest waiting until your child is 3 or 4 to see if the hernia closes on its own since an early umbilical hernia repair is more likely to recur and exposes children to anesthesia earlier in life.\nADULTS\nUmbilical hernias also occur in adults. They are seen more in overweight people and in women, especially after pregnancy."}

They are seen more in overweight people and in women, especially after pregnancy. They tend to get bigger over time.\nSmaller hernias with no symptoms sometimes can be watched. Surgery may pose greater risks than the hernia.\nWithout surgery, there is a risk that some fat or part of the intestine will get stuck (incarcerated) in the hernia and become impossible to push back in. This is usually painful. If the blood supply to this area is cut off (strangulation), urgent surgery is needed. You may experience nausea or vomiting, and the bulging area may turn blue or a darker color.\nTo avoid this problem, surgeons often recommend repairing umbilical hernias in adults. Surgery is also used for hernias that are getting larger or are painful."}
