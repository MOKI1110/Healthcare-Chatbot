This is a natural way to deal with infectious diseases.\nFive types of vaccines are currently available:\nLive virus vaccines\nuse a weakened (attenuated) form of the virus. The measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine and the varicella (chickenpox) vaccine are examples.\nKilled (inactivated) vaccines\nare made from a protein or other small pieces taken from a virus or bacteria."}

The whooping cough (pertussis) vaccine is an example.\nToxoid vaccines\ncontain a toxin or chemical made by the bacteria or virus. They make you immune to the harmful effects of the infection, instead of to the infection itself. Examples are the diphtheria and tetanus vaccines.\nBiosynthetic vaccines\ncontain manmade substances that are very similar to pieces of the virus or bacteria. The Hepatitis B vaccine is an example.\nmRNA\nvaccines contain the genetic code of the virus the body can use to create antibodies to fight the virus. Some SARS-CoV2 vaccines use this technology to create a vaccine against COVID-19.\nWHY WE NEED VACCINES\nFor a few weeks after birth, babies have some protection from germs that cause diseases. This protection is passed from their mother through the placenta before birth. After a short period, this natural protection goes away.\nVaccines help protect against many diseases that used to be much more common."}

After a short period, this natural protection goes away.\nVaccines help protect against many diseases that used to be much more common. Examples include tetanus, diphtheria, mumps, measles, pertussis (whooping cough), meningitis, and polio. Many of these infections can cause serious or life-threatening illnesses and may lead to life-long health problems. Because of vaccines, many of these illnesses are now rare.\nSAFETY OF VACCINES\nSome people worry that vaccines are not safe and may be harmful, especially for children. They may ask their health care provider to wait or even choose not to have a vaccine. But the benefits of vaccines far outweigh their risks.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National Academy of Medicine have all concluded that the benefits of vaccines outweigh their risks.\nVaccines, such as the measles, mumps, rubella, chickenpox, and nasal spray flu vaccines contain live, but weakened viruses:\nUnless a person's immune system is weakened, it is unlikely that a vaccine will give the person the illness caused by the infection."}

People with weakened immune systems should not receive these live virus vaccines.\nThese live virus vaccines may be dangerous to the fetus of a pregnant woman. To avoid harm to the baby, pregnant women should not receive any of these vaccines. Your provider can tell you the right time to get these vaccines.\nThimerosal is a preservative that was found in most vaccines in the past. But now:\nThere are infant and child flu vaccines that have no thimerosal.\nNo other vaccines commonly used for children or adults contain thimerosal.\nResearch done over many years has not shown any link between thimerosal and autism or other medical problems.\nAllergic reactions are rare and are usually to some part (component) of the vaccine.\nVACCINE SCHEDULE\nThe recommended vaccination (immunization) schedule is updated at least every 12 months by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Talk to your provider about specific immunizations for you or your child."}

Many immunizations should be received at least 1 month before travel.\nBring your immunization record with you when you travel to other countries."}
