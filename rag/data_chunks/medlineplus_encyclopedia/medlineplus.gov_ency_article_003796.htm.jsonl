The waves create pictures of the inside of the belly area. This test does not use radiation (x-rays).\nSingle magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images are called slices. The images can be stored on a computer, viewed on a monitor, printed on film or scanned to a disk. One exam produces dozens or sometimes hundreds of images.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou may be asked to wear a hospital gown or clothing without metal zippers or snaps (such as sweatpants and a t-shirt). Certain types of metal can cause blurry images.\nYou will lie on a narrow table. The table slides into a large tunnel-shaped scanner.\nSome exams require a special dye (contrast). Most of the time, the dye is given during the test through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. The dye helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly.\nDuring the MRI, the person who operates the machine will watch you from another room."}

The test lasts about 30 to 60 minutes, but it may take longer.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan.\nTell your health care provider if you are afraid of close spaces (have claustrophobia). You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious. Your provider may also suggest an open MRI, in which the machine is not as close to your body.\nBefore the test, tell your provider if you have:\nArtificial heart valves\nBrain aneurysm clips\nHeart defibrillator or pacemaker\nInner ear (cochlear) implants\nKidney disease or dialysis (you may not be able to receive contrast)\nRecently placed artificial joints\nCertain types of vascular\nstents\nWorked with sheet metal in the past (you may need tests to check for metal pieces in your eyes)\nBecause the MRI contains strong magnets, metal objects are not allowed into the room with the MRI scanner."}

Avoid carrying items such as:\nPocketknives, pens, and eyeglasses\nWatches, credit cards, jewelry, and hearing aids\nHairpins, metal zippers, pins, and similar items\nRemovable dental implants\nHow the Test will Feel\nAn MRI exam causes no pain. You may get medicine to relax you if you have a problem lying still or are very nervous. Moving too much can blur MRI images and cause errors.\nThe table may be hard or cold, but you can ask for a blanket or pillow. The machine makes loud thumping and humming noises when turned on. You can wear ear plugs to help reduce the noise.\nAn intercom in the room allows you to speak to someone at any time. Some MRI facilities have televisions and special headphones to help you pass time.\nThere is no recovery time, unless you were given a medicine to help you relax. After an MRI scan, you can go back to your normal diet, activity, and medicines.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nAn abdominal MRI provides detailed pictures of the belly area from many views."}

If you have a history of severe allergic reactions to other medicines you should notify your doctor. In addition, gadolinium can be harmful to people with kidney problems who need dialysis. Tell your provider before the test if you have kidney problems.\nThe strong magnetic fields created during an MRI can cause heart pacemakers and other implants not to work as well. The magnets can also cause a piece of metal inside your body to move or shift.\nAlternative Names\nNuclear magnetic resonance - abdomen; NMR - abdomen; Magnetic resonance imaging - abdomen; MRI of the abdomen; Liver MRI - abdomen; Pancreas MRI - abdomen; Kidney MRI - abdomen\nPatient Instructions\nAortic aneurysm repair - endovascular - discharge\nImages\nDigestive system\nMRI scans\nReferences\nAl Sarraf AA, McLaughlin PD, Maher MM.
