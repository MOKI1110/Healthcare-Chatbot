Most often, people with this condition are born with a hole between the two larger pumping chambers -- the left and right ventricles -- of the heart (\nventricular septal defect\n). The hole allows blood that has already picked up oxygen from the lungs to flow back into the lungs, instead of going out to the rest of the body.\nOther heart defects that can lead to Eisenmenger syndrome include:\nAtrioventricular canal defect\nAtrial septal defect\nCyanotic heart disease\nPatent ductus arteriosus\nTruncus arteriosus\nOver many years, increased blood flow can damage the small blood vessels in the lungs. This causes high blood pressure in the lungs. As a result, the blood flow goes backward through the hole between the two pumping chambers."}

This allows oxygen-poor blood to travel to the rest of the body.\nEisenmenger syndrome may begin to develop before a child reaches puberty. However, it also can develop in young adulthood, and may progress throughout young adulthood.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nBluish lips, fingers, toes, and skin (cyanosis)\nRounded fingernails and toenails (clubbing)\nNumbness and tingling of fingers and toes\nChest pain\nCoughing up blood\nDizziness\nFainting\nFeeling tired\nShortness of breath\nSkipped heartbeats (palpitations)\nStroke\nSwelling in the joints caused by too much uric acid (gout)\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will examine the child. During the exam, the provider may find:\nAbnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia)\nEnlarged ends of the fingers or toes (clubbing)\nHeart murmur (an extra sound when listening to the heart)\nThe provider will diagnose Eisenmenger syndrome by looking at the person's history of heart problems."}

Tests may include:\nComplete blood count (CBC)\nChest x-ray\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) to check the electrical activity in the heart\nMRI scan of the heart\nPutting a thin tube in an artery to view the heart and blood vessels and measure pressures (cardiac catheterization)\nUltrasound of the heart (echocardiogram)\nThe number of cases of this condition in the United States has dropped because providers are now able to diagnose and correct the defect sooner. Therefore, the problem can be corrected before irreversible damage occurs to the small lung arteries.\nTreatment\nAffected people may receive oxygen, although it is unclear if it helps to prevent the disease from getting worse. In addition, medicines that work to relax and open the blood vessels may be given."}

In addition, medicines that work to relax and open the blood vessels may be given. People with very severe symptoms may eventually need a heart-lung transplant.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well the affected person does depends on whether another medical condition is present, and the age at which high blood pressure develops in the lungs. People with this condition can live 20 to 50 years.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nBleeding (hemorrhage) in the brain\nCongestive heart failure\nGout\nHeart attack\nHyperviscosity\n(sludging of the blood because it is too thick with blood cells)\nInfection (abscess) in the brain\nKidney failure\nPoor blood flow to the brain\nStroke\nSudden death\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you or your child develops symptoms of Eisenmenger syndrome.\nPrevention\nSurgery as early as possible to correct the heart defect can prevent Eisenmenger syndrome.\nAlternative Names\nEisenmenger complex; Eisenmenger disease; Eisenmenger reaction; Eisenmenger physiology; Congenital heart defect - Eisenmenger; Cyanotic heart dis"}
