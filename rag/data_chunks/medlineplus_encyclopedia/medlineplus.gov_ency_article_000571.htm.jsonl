Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues.\nNormally, red blood cells last for about 120 days in the body. In people with hemolytic anemia, red blood cells in the blood are destroyed earlier than normal.\nCauses\nThe bone marrow is mostly responsible for making new red cells. Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells.\nHemolytic anemia occurs when the bone marrow isn't making enough red cells to replace the ones that are being destroyed.\nThere are several possible causes of hemolytic anemia."}
