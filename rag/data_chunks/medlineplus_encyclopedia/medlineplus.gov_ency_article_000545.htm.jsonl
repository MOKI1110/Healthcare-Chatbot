Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFactor XII (Hageman factor) deficiency\nFactor XII (Hageman factor) deficiency\nFactor XII (twelve) deficiency is an inherited disorder that affects a protein (factor XII) involved in blood clotting.\nCauses\nWhen you bleed, a series of reactions take place in the body that helps blood clots form. This process is called the coagulation cascade. It involves special proteins called coagulation or clotting factors. You may have a higher chance of excess bleeding if one or more of these factors are missing or are not functioning  as they should.\nFactor XII is one such factor. A lack of this factor does not cause you to bleed abnormally. But, the blood takes longer than normal to clot in a test tube.\nFactor XII deficiency is a rare inherited disorder.\nSymptoms\nThere are usually no symptoms.\nExams and Tests\nFactor XII deficiency is most often found when clotting tests are done for routine screening."}
