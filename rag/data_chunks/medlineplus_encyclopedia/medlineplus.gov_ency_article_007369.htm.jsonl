Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHeart pacemaker\nHeart pacemaker\nA pacemaker is a small, battery-operated device. This device senses when your heart is beating\ntoo slowly\n. It sends a signal to your heart that makes your heart beat at the correct pace.\nDescription\nNewer pacemakers weigh as little as 1 ounce (28 grams). Most pacemakers have 2 parts:\nThe generator contains the battery and the information to control the heartbeat.\nThe leads which are wires that connect the heart to the generator and carry the electrical messages to the heart.\nA pacemaker is implanted under the skin. This procedure takes about 1 hour in most cases. You will be given a sedative to help you relax. You will be awake during the procedure.\nA small incision (cut) is made. Most often, the cut is on the left side (if you are right handed) of the chest below your collarbone. The pacemaker generator is then placed under the skin at this location. The generator may also be placed in the abdomen, but this is less common."}

The pacemaker generator is then placed under the skin at this location. The generator may also be placed in the abdomen, but this is less common. A new \"leadless\" pacemaker is a self-contained unit that is implanted in the right ventricle of the heart.\nUsing live x-rays to see the area, the doctor (most often a heart specialist called a cardiologist) puts the leads through the cut, into a vein, and then into the heart. The leads are connected to the generator. The skin is closed with stitches. Most people go home within 1 day of the procedure.\nThere are 2 kinds of pacemakers used only in medical emergencies. They are:\nTranscutaneous pacemakers\nTransvenous pacemakers\nThey are not permanent pacemakers.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nPacemakers may be used for people who have heart problems that cause their heart to beat too slowly. A slow heartbeat is called\nbradycardia\n. Two common problems that cause a slow heartbeat are\nsinus node disease\nand heart block.\nWhen your heart beats too slowly, your body and brain may not get enough oxygen."}

Symptoms may be\nLightheadedness\nTiredness\nFainting spells\nShortness of breath\nSome pacemakers can be used to stop a heart rate that is too fast (\ntachycardia\n) or that is irregular.\nOther types of pacemakers can be used in severe\nheart failure\n. These are called biventricular pacemakers. They help coordinate the beating of the heart chambers.\nMost biventricular pacemakers implanted today can also work as\nimplantable cardioverter defibrillators\n(ICD). ICD restore a normal heartbeat by delivering a larger shock when a potentially deadly fast heart rhythm occurs.\nWatch this video about:\nHeartbeat\nRisks\nPossible complications of pacemaker surgery are:\nAbnormal heart rhythms\nBleeding\nPunctured lung. This is rare.\nInfection\nPuncture of the heart, which can lead to bleeding around the heart. This is rare.\nA pacemaker senses if the heartbeat is above a certain rate. When it is above that rate, the pacemaker will stop sending signals to the heart."}

It will automatically start pacing the heart again.\nBefore the Procedure\nAlways tell your health care provider about all the medicines you are taking, even medicines or herbs you bought without a prescription.\nThe day before your surgery:\nShower and shampoo well.\nYou may be asked to wash your whole body below your neck with a special soap.\nOn the day of the surgery:\nYou may be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before your procedure. This includes chewing gum and breath mints. Rinse your mouth with water if it feels dry, but be careful not to swallow.\nTake the medicines you have been told to take with a small sip of water.\nYour cardiologist will tell you when to arrive at the hospital.\nAfter the Procedure\nYou will probably be able to go home after 1 day or even the same day in some cases."}

You may be advised not to:\nLift anything heavier than 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 6.75 kilograms)\nPush, pull, and twist your arm for 2 to 3 weeks.\nRaise your arm above your shoulder for several weeks.\nWhen you leave the hospital, you will be given a card to keep in your wallet. This card lists the details of your pacemaker and has contact information for emergencies. You should always carry this wallet card with you.  You should try to remember the name of the pacemaker manufacturer if you can in case you lose your card.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPacemakers can help keep your heart rhythm and heart rate at a safe level for you. The pacemaker battery lasts about 6 to 15 years."}
