It is commonly called golfer's elbow.\nCauses\nThe part of the muscle that attaches to a bone is called a tendon. Some of the muscles in your forearm attach to the bone on the inside of your elbow.\nWhen you use these muscles over and over again, small tears may develop in the tendons. Over time, this leads to irritation and pain where the tendon is attached to the bone.\nThe injury can occur from using poor form or overdoing certain sports, such as:\nGolf\nBaseball and other throwing sports, such as football and javelin\nRacquet sports, such as tennis\nWeight training\nRepeated twisting of the wrist (such as when using a screwdriver) can lead to golfer's elbow."}

It gets worse when you grasp things or flex your wrist.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you and have you move your fingers, hand, and wrist. The exam may show:\nPain or tenderness when the tendon is gently pressed where it attaches to the upper arm bone, over the inside of the elbow.\nPain near the elbow when the wrist is bent downward against resistance.\nYou may have x-rays and an MRI to rule out other possible causes.\nTreatment\nYour provider may suggest that you first rest your arm. This means avoiding the activity that causes your symptoms for at least 2 to 3 weeks or longer until the pain goes away. You may also want to:\nPut ice on the inside of your elbow 3 to 4 times a day for 15 to 20 minutes. Wrap the ice in a cloth. Do not put ice directly on the skin.\nTake a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). These include ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or aspirin.\nDo stretching and strengthening exercises."}

Your provider may suggest certain exercises, or you may have physical or occupational therapy.\nGradually return to activity.\nIf your golfer's elbow is due to a sports activity, you may want to:\nAsk about any changes you can make in your technique. If you play golf, have an instructor check your form.\nCheck any sports equipment you are using to see if any changes may help. For example, using lighter golf clubs may help. Also check if the grip of your equipment is causing the elbow pain.\nThink about how often you have been playing your sport and if you should cut down on the amount of time you play.\nIf you work on a computer, ask your manager about making changes to your work station. Have someone look at how your chair, desk, and computer are set up.\nYou can buy a special brace for golfer's elbow at most drug stores."}

It wraps around the upper part of your forearm and takes some of the pressure off your muscles.\nYour provider may inject cortisone and a numbing medicine around the area where the tendon attaches to the bone. This may help decrease the swelling and pain.\nIf the pain continues after 6 to 12 months of rest and treatment, surgery may be recommended. Talk with your provider about the risks, and ask if surgery might help.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nElbow pain usually gets better without surgery. However, most people who have surgery have full use of their forearm and elbow afterward.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider for an appointment if:\nThis is the first time you have had these symptoms.\nHome treatment does not relieve the symptoms.\nSymptoms worsen or are accompanied by numbness and tingling that goes down your forearm.\nAlternative Names\nBaseball elbow; Suitcase elbow\nReferences\nAdams JE, Steinmann SP.
