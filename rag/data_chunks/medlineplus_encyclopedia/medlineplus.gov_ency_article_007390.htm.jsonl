You may have a narrowing of the nerve opening (foraminal stenosis).\nDescription\nForaminotomy takes pressure off the nerve coming out of your spinal column. This reduces any pain you were having. Foraminotomy can be performed on any level of the spine.\nYou will be asleep and feel no pain (\ngeneral anesthesia\n).\nDuring surgery:\nYou usually lie on your belly or sit up on the operating table. A cut (incision) is made in the middle of the back of your spine. The length of the incision depends on how much of your spinal column will be operated on.\nSkin, muscles, and ligaments are moved to the side. Your surgeon may use a surgical microscope to see inside your back.\nSome bone is cut or shaved away to widen the nerve root opening (foramen)."}

Your surgeon may use a surgical microscope to see inside your back.\nSome bone is cut or shaved away to widen the nerve root opening (foramen). Any disk fragments are removed.\nOther bone may also be removed at the back of the vertebrae to make more room (\nlaminotomy\nor\nlaminectomy\n).\nThe surgeon may do a\nspinal fusion\nto make sure your spinal column is stable after surgery.\nThe muscles and other tissues are put back in place. The skin is sewn together.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nA bundle of nerves (nerve root) leaves your spinal cord through openings in your spinal column. These openings are called the neural foramens. When the openings for the nerve root become narrow, it can put pressure on your nerve. This condition is called foraminal\nspinal stenosis\n.\nThis surgery may be considered if you have severe symptoms that interfere with your daily life. Symptoms include:\nPain that may be felt in your thigh, calf, lower back,\nshoulder\n, arms or hands."}

These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\nLet your surgeon know about any illness you may have before your surgery. This includes\nCOVID-19\n, a\ncold\n,\nflu\n, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness. If you do get sick, your surgery may need to be postponed.\nOn the day of surgery:\nFollow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.\nTake the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\nFollow instructions on when to arrive at the hospital. Be sure to arrive on time.\nAfter the Procedure\nYou will likely wear a soft neck collar afterward if the surgery was on your neck.

If you had foraminotomy and spinal fusion, the spinal column above and below the fusion could have problems in the future.\nYou may have more of a chance of future problems if you needed more than one kind of procedure in addition to the foraminotomy (laminotomy, laminectomy, or spinal fusion).\nAlternative Names\nIntervertebral foramina; Spine surgery - foraminotomy; Back pain - foraminotomy; Stenosis - foraminotomy\nPatient Instructions\nSpine surgery - discharge\nReferences\nCasper DS, Maslak JP, Pelle D."}
