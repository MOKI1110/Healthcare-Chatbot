Most often, the first medicines used are called mood stabilizers. They help you avoid mood swings and extreme changes in activity and energy levels.\nWith medicines, you may begin to feel better. However, for some people, symptoms of mania may feel good. Some people have side effects from the medicines. As a result, you may be tempted to stop taking your medicines or change the way you are taking them. But stopping your medicines or taking them in the wrong way can cause symptoms to come back or become much worse. Do not stop taking or change the dosages of your medicines. Talk with your provider if you have questions about your medicines.\nAsk family members or friends to help you take medicines the right way. This means taking the right dose at the right time. They can also help make sure that episodes of mania and depression are treated as soon as possible.\nIf mood stabilizers do not help, your provider may suggest other medicines, such as antipsychotics or antidepressants.\nYou will need regular visits with your provider (often a psychiatrist or psychiatric nurse practitioner) to talk about your medicines and their possible side effects."}
