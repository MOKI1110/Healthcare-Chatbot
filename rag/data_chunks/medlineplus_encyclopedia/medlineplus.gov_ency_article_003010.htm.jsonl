The donor lungs must be disease-free and matched as closely as possible to your tissue type. This reduces the chance that the body will reject the\ntransplant\n.\nLungs can also be given by living donors. Two or more people are needed. Each person donates a segment (lobe) of their lung. This forms an entire lung for the person who is receiving it.\nDuring lung transplant surgery, you are asleep and pain-free (under\ngeneral anesthesia\n). A surgical cut is made in the chest. Lung transplant surgery is often done with the use of a heart-lung machine. This device does the work of your heart and lungs while your heart and lungs are stopped for the surgery.\nFor single lung transplants, the cut is made on the side of your chest where the lung will be transplanted. The operation takes 4 to 8 hours."}

The operation takes 4 to 8 hours. In most cases, the lung with the worst function is removed.\nFor double lung transplants, the cut is made below the breast and reaches to both sides of the chest. Surgery takes 6 to 12 hours.\nAfter the cut is made, the major steps during lung transplant surgery include:\nYou are placed on the heart-lung machine.\nOne or both of your lungs are removed. For people who are having a double lung transplant, most or all of the steps from the first side are completed before the second side is done.\nThe main blood vessels and airway of the new lung are sewn to your blood vessels and airway. The donor lobe or lung is stitched (sutured) into place."}

Chest tubes are inserted to drain air, fluid, and blood out of the chest for several days to allow the lungs to fully re-expand.\nYou are taken off the heart-lung machine once the lungs are sewn in and working.\nSometimes, heart and lung transplants are done at the same time (heart-lung transplant) if the heart is also diseased.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nIn most cases, a lung transplant is done only after all other treatments for lung failure are unsuccessful. Lung transplants may be recommended for people under age 65 who have severe lung disease."}

About two out of five transplant recipients are alive at 5 years. The highest risk of death is during the first year, mainly from problems such as rejection.\nFighting rejection is an ongoing process. The body's immune system considers the transplanted organ as an invader and may attack it.\nTo prevent rejection, organ transplant patients must take anti-rejection (immunosuppression) medicines. These medicines suppress the body's\nimmune response\nand reduce the chance of rejection. As a result, however, these medicines also reduce the body's natural ability to fight off infections.\nBy 5 years after a lung transplant, at least one in five people develop cancers or have problems with the heart. For most people, the quality of life is improved after a lung transplant. They have better exercise endurance and are able to do more on a daily basis.\nAlternative Names\nSolid organ transplant - lung\nImages\nLung transplant - series\nReferences\nBlatter JA, Noyes B, Sweet SC.
