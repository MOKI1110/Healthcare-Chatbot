It is slightly more common in older children and adults. It is often worse in newborns and young infants than in children over age 2.\nMost cases in children are caused by a virus that reaches the heart. These can include:\nInfluenza (flu)\nvirus\nCoxsackie virus\nParovirus\nAdenovirus\nSARS-CoV-2 virus (the virus that causes\nCOVID-19)\nIt may also be caused by bacterial infections such as\nLyme disease\n.\nOther causes of pediatric myocarditis include:\nAllergic reactions to certain medicines\nExposure to chemicals in the environment\nInfections due to fungus or parasites\nRadiation\nSome diseases (autoimmune disorders) that cause inflammation throughout the body\nSome drugs\nMyocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination has been reported, but is very rare.\nThe heart muscle may be directly damaged by the virus or the bacteria that infect it."}

The body's immune response can also damage the heart muscle (called the myocardium) in the process of fighting the infection. This can lead to symptoms of heart failure.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may be mild at first and hard to detect. Sometimes in newborns and infants, symptoms may appear suddenly.\nSymptoms may include:\nAnxiety\nFailure to thrive\nor poor weight gain\nFeeding difficulties\nFever and other symptoms of infection\nListlessness\nLow urine output (a sign of decreasing kidney function)\nPale, cool hands and feet (a sign of poor circulation)\nRapid breathing\nRapid heart rate\nSymptoms in children over age 2 may also include:\nBelly area pain and nausea\nChest pain\nCough\nFatigue\nShortness of breath\nSwelling (edema) in the legs, feet, and face\nExams and Tests\nPediatric myocarditis can be hard to diagnose because the signs and symptoms often mimic those of other heart and lung diseases, or a bad case of the flu.\nThe health care provider may hear a rapid heartbeat or abnormal heart sounds while l"}

If the provider suspects myocarditis based on the exam and chest x-ray, an electrocardiogram may also be done to help make the diagnosis.\nOther tests that may be needed include:\nBlood cultures to check for infection\nBlood tests to look for antibodies against viruses or the heart muscle itself\nBlood tests to check liver and kidney function\nComplete blood count\nHeart biopsy (the most accurate way to confirm the diagnosis, but not always needed)\nSpecial tests to check for the presence of viruses in the blood (viral PCR)\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for myocarditis.

Many children with this condition are admitted to a hospital. Activity often needs to be limited while the heart is inflamed because it can strain the heart.\nTreatment may include:\nAntibiotics to fight bacterial infection\nAnti-inflammatory medicines called steroids to control inflammation\nIntravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a medicine made of substances (called antibodies) that the body produces to fight infection, to control the inflammatory process\nMechanical support using a machine to help the heart function (in extreme cases)\nMedicines to treat symptoms of heart failure\nMedicines to treat abnormal heart rhythms\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nRecovery from myocarditis depends on the cause of the problem and the child's overall health. Most children recover completely with proper treatment.
