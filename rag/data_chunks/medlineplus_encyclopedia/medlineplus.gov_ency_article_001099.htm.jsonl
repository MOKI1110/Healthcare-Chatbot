Ventricular septal defect is one of the most common congenital (present from birth) heart defects. It occurs in nearly half of all children with congenital heart disease. It may occur by itself or with other congenital diseases.\nCauses\nBefore a baby is born, the right and left ventricles of the heart are not separate. As the fetus grows, a septum (wall) forms to separate these 2 ventricles. If the wall does not completely form, a hole remains. This hole is known as a ventricular septal defect, or a VSD. The hole can occur in different locations along the septal wall. There can be a single hole or multiple holes.\nVentricular septal defect is a common congenital heart defect. The baby may have no symptoms and the hole can close over time as the wall continues to grow after birth. If the hole is large, too much blood will be pumped to the lungs. This can lead to heart failure."}

If the hole is large, too much blood will be pumped to the lungs. This can lead to heart failure. If the hole is small, it may not be detected for years and only discovered in adulthood.\nThe cause of VSD is not yet known. This defect often occurs along with other congenital heart defects.\nIn adults, VSDs can be rare, but serious, complication of heart attacks. These holes do not result from a birth defect.\nSymptoms\nPeople with VSDs may not have symptoms. However, if the hole is large, the baby often has symptoms related to heart failure.\nThe most common symptoms include:\nShortness of breath\nFast breathing\nHard breathing\nPaleness\nFailure to gain weight\nFast heart rate\nSweating while feeding\nFrequent respiratory infections\nExams and Tests\nListening with a stethoscope most often reveals a heart murmur."}

The loudness of the murmur is related to the size of the defect and amount of blood crossing the defect.\nTests may include:\nCardiac catheterization\n(rarely needed, unless there are concerns of high blood pressure in the lungs)\nChest x-ray\n-- looks to see if there is a large heart with fluid in the lungs\nECG\n-- shows signs of an enlarged left ventricle\nEchocardiogram\n-- used to make a definite diagnosis\nMRI or CT scan of the heart -- used to see the defect and find out how much blood is getting to the lungs\nTreatment\nIf the defect is small, no treatment may be needed. But the baby should be closely monitored by a health care provider. This is to make sure that the hole eventually closes properly, and signs of heart failure do not occur.\nBabies with a large VSD who have symptoms related to heart failure may need medicine to control the symptoms and surgery to close the hole."}

Diuretic medicines are often used to relieve symptoms of congestive heart failure.;\nIf symptoms continue, even with medicine, surgery to close the defect with a patch is needed. Some VSDs can be closed with a special device during a cardiac\ncatheterization\n, which avoids the need for surgery. This is called transcatheter closure. However, only certain types of defects can successfully be treated this way.\nHaving surgery for a VSD with no symptoms is controversial, especially when there is no evidence of heart damage. Discuss this carefully with your provider.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMany small defects will close on their own. Surgery can repair defects that do not close. In most cases, a person will not have any ongoing medical issues related to the defect if it is closed with surgery or closes on its own."}

Other than avoiding these things during pregnancy, there is no known way to prevent a VSD.\nWomen who plan to become pregnant should be immunized against rubella if they are not already immune. Rubella infection in a pregnant woman can cause congenital heart disease.\nWomen who are pregnant should get good prenatal care:\nAvoid alcohol and illegal drugs during pregnancy.\nTell your provider that you are pregnant before taking any new medicines.\nHave a blood test early in your pregnancy to see if you are immune to rubella."}
