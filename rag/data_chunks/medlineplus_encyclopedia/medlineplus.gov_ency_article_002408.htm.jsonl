Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFolic acid in diet\nFolic acid in diet\nFolic acid and folate are both terms for a type of B vitamin (vitamin B9). The terms folic acid and folate are often used interchangeably.\nFolate is a B vitamin that occurs naturally in foods such as green leafy vegetables, citrus fruit, and beans.\nFolic acid is man-made (synthetic) folate. It is found in supplements and added to fortified foods.\nFolic acid is water-soluble. Leftover amounts of the vitamin leave the body through the urine. That means your body does not store folic acid."}

Leftover amounts of the vitamin leave the body through the urine. That means your body does not store folic acid. You need to get a regular supply of the vitamin through the foods you eat or through supplements.\nFunction\nFolate has many functions in the body:\nHelps tissues grow and cells work\nWorks with\nvitamin B12\nand\nvitamin C\nto help the body break down, use, and create new\nproteins\nHelps form red blood cells (helps prevent anemia)\nHelps produce DNA, the building block of the human body, which carries genetic information\nFolate deficiency may cause:\nDiarrhea\nGray hair\nMouth ulcers\nPeptic ulcer\nPoor growth\nSwollen tongue (\nglossitis\n)\nIt may also lead to certain types of\nanemia\n.\nBecause it may be hard to get enough folate through foods, women thinking about becoming pregnant should take folic acid supplements. Taking the right amount of folic acid before and during pregnancy helps prevent a type of birth defect called neural tube defects, including spina bifida."}

Taking the right amount of folic acid before and during pregnancy helps prevent a type of birth defect called neural tube defects, including spina bifida. Taking higher doses of folic acid before you get pregnant and during the first trimester may lower your chances of miscarriage.\nFood Sources\nFolate occurs naturally in the following foods:\nDark green leafy vegetables\nDried beans and peas (legumes)\nCitrus fruits and juices\nFortified means that vitamins have been added to the food. Many foods are now fortified with folic acid. Some of these are:\nEnriched breads\nCereals\nFlours\nCornmeals\nPastas\nRice\nOther grain products\nThere are also many pregnancy-specific products on the market that have been fortified with folic acid. Some of these provide folic acid at levels that meet or exceed the doses recommended below. Taking more is not needed and does not provide any added benefit. The recommended doses are based on folic acid that comes from supplements and fortified foods. It does not refer to the folate found naturally in foods.\nSide Effects\nFolic acid does not cause harm when used at recommended levels. Folic acid dissolves in water."}

This means that it is regularly removed from the body through urine, so excess amounts do not build up in the body.\nExcept for women with a history of pregnancy affected by a neural tube defect who are planning to become pregnant, you should avoid taking more than 1,000 mcg per day of folic acid. Although the risk is low, using higher levels of folic acid can mask vitamin B12 deficiency. Check with your health care provider for the best dose for you.\nRecommendations\nThe best way to get the daily requirement of essential vitamins is to eat a wide variety of foods."}
