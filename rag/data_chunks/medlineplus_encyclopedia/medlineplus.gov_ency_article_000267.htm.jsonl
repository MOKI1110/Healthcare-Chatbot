Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAchalasia\nAchalasia\nThe tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach is the esophagus or food pipe. Achalasia makes it harder for the esophagus to move food into the stomach.\nCauses\nThere is a muscular ring at the point where the esophagus and stomach meet. It is called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). Normally, this muscle relaxes when you swallow to allow food to pass into the stomach. In people with achalasia, it does not relax as it should. In addition, the normal muscle activity of the esophagus (peristalsis) is reduced or absent.\nThis problem is caused by damage to the nerves of the esophagus.\nOther problems can cause similar symptoms, such as cancer of the esophagus or upper stomach, and a parasite infection that causes\nChagas disease\n, which is more common in Mexico and Central and South America.\nAchalasia is rare. It may occur at any age, but is most common in people ages 25 to 60."}

It may occur at any age, but is most common in people ages 25 to 60. In some people, the problem may be inherited.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nBackflow (regurgitation) of food\nChest pain\n, which may increase after eating, or may be felt as pain in the back, neck, and arms\nCough\nDifficulty swallowing liquids and solids\nHeartburn\nUnintentional weight loss\nExams and Tests\nPhysical exam may show signs of\nanemia\nor\nmalnutrition\n.\nTests include:\nEsophageal manometry\n, a test to measure if your esophagus is working properly.\nFunctional luminal imaging probe (FLIP). Creates a high resolution 3D image of your esophagus and its movements.\nEGD\nor upper endoscopy, a test to examine the lining of the stomach and esophagus. It uses a flexible tube and camera.\nUpper GI x-ray\n.\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce the pressure at the sphincter muscle and allow food and liquids to pass easily into the stomach. Therapy may involve:\nInjection with botulinum toxin (Botox) -- This may help relax the sphincter muscles."}

Therapy may involve:\nInjection with botulinum toxin (Botox) -- This may help relax the sphincter muscles. However, the benefit wears off within a few weeks or months.\nMedicines, such as long-acting nitrates or calcium channel blockers -- These medicines can be used to relax the lower esophagus sphincter. But there is rarely a long-term solution with medicines to treat achalasia.\nSurgery (called a myotomy) -- In this procedure, the lower sphincter muscle is cut. This procedure is usually performed using a laparoscope. It can now sometimes be performed during EGD instead of traditional surgery.\nWidening (dilation) of the esophagus -- This is done during EGD by stretching the LES with a balloon dilator.\nYour health care provider can help you decide which treatment is best for you.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcomes of surgery and non-surgical treatments are similar. However, depending on the type of achalasia you have, your provider may recommend a particular procedure."}
