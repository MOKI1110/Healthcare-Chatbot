Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive:\nBlood and urine tests\nBreathing support, including oxygen through a tube into the lungs, and a breathing machine (ventilator)\nBronchoscopy\n-- camera down the throat to look for burns in the airways and lungs (if the poison was aspirated)\nChest x-ray\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG)\nEndoscopy\n-- camera down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and the stomach\nFluids through a vein (by IV)\nMedicine (antidote) to reverse the effect of the poison and treat symptoms\nSurgical removal of burned skin (skin debridement)\nTube through the mouth into the stomach to aspirate (suck out) the stomach."}

This is done only when the person gets medical care within 30 to 45 minutes of the poisoning, and a very large amount of the substance has been swallowed\nWashing of the skin (irrigation) -- perhaps every few hours for several days\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\nSwallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue death. This may result in infection, shock, and death, even several months after substance was swallowed. Scar tissue in the affected areas can lead to long-term problems with breathing, swallowing, and digestion.\nAlternative Names\nPaint remover poisoning\nReferences\nHamm LL, DuBose TD.
