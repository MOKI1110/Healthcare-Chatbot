These layers are called the stratum corneum.\nCauses\nScales may be caused by dry skin, certain inflammatory skin conditions, or infections.\nExamples of disorders that can cause scales include:\nEczema\nFungal infections such as\nringworm\nor\ntinea versicolor\nPsoriasis\nSeborrheic dermatitis\nPityriasis rosea\nDiscoid lupus erythematosus, an\nautoimmune disorder\nGenetic skin disorders called ichthyoses\nHome Care\nIf your health care provider diagnoses you with dry skin, you'll likely be recommended the following\nself-care measures\n:\nMoisturize your skin with an ointment, cream, or lotion 2 to 3 times a day, or as often as needed.\nMoisturizers help lock in moisture, so they work best on damp skin. After you bathe, pat your skin dry then apply your moisturizer.\nBathe only once a day. Take short, warm baths or showers. Limit your time to 5 to 10 minutes."}

This may include using a medicine on your skin. You may also need to take a medicine by mouth.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall your provider if your skin symptoms continue and self-care measures aren't helping.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nYour provider will perform a physical exam to look closely at your skin. You may be asked questions such as when the scaling began, what other symptoms you have, and any self-care you've done at home.\nYou may need blood tests to check for other conditions.\nTreatment depends on the cause of your skin problem."}
