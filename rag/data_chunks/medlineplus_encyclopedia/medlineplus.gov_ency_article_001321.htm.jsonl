This parasite swims freely in open bodies of fresh water.\nWhen the parasite comes into contact with humans, it burrows into the skin and matures into another stage. Then, it travels to the lungs and liver, where it grows into the adult form of the worm.\nThe adult worm then travels to its preferred body part, depending on its species. These areas include the:\nBladder\nRectum\nIntestines\nLiver\nVeins that carry blood from the intestines to the liver\nSpleen\nLungs\nSchistosomiasis is not usually seen in the United States except for returning travelers or people from other countries who have the infection and are now living in the United States."}

It is common in many tropical and subtropical areas worldwide.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms vary with the species of worm and the phase of infection.\nThe parasites may cause fever, chills, swollen lymph nodes, and swollen liver and spleen.\nWhen the worm first gets into the skin, it may cause itching and a rash (swimmer's itch). In this condition, the schistosome is destroyed within the skin.\nIntestinal symptoms include abdominal pain and diarrhea (which may be bloody).\nUrinary symptoms may include frequent urination, painful urination, and blood in the urine.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you."}
