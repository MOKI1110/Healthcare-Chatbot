Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPrimary and secondary hyperaldosteronism\nPrimary and secondary hyperaldosteronism\nHyperaldosteronism is a disorder in which the adrenal gland releases too much of the hormone\naldosterone\ninto the blood.\nHyperaldosteronism can be primary or secondary.\nCauses\nHyperaldosteronism occurs when the adrenal glands release too much aldosterone.\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism is due to a problem of the adrenal glands themselves. Most cases are caused by a noncancerous (benign) tumor of the adrenal gland.\nSecondary hyperaldosteronism is due to a problem elsewhere in the body that causes the adrenal glands to release too much aldosterone."}

These problems can be with:\nGenes\nDiet\nMedical disorders such as with the heart, liver, kidneys, or high blood pressure\nThe condition mostly affects people 30 to 50 years old and is a common cause of high blood pressure in middle age.\nSymptoms\nPrimary and secondary hyperaldosteronism have common symptoms, including:\nHigh blood pressure\nLow level of potassium in the blood\nFeeling tired all the time\nHeadache\nMuscle weakness\nNumbness\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.\nTests that may be ordered to diagnose hyperaldosteronism include:\nAbdominal CT scan\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG)\nBlood aldosterone\nlevel\nBlood renin activity\nBlood potassium\nlevel\nUrinary aldosterone\nKidney ultrasound\nSometimes blood and urine tests may be done after eating a high salt diet or after receiving saline through a vein (intravenous).

You may need to stop taking some medicines before the tests. Your provider will tell you what to do before the procedure.\nAnother procedure involves inserting a catheter into the veins of the adrenal glands. This helps check which of the two adrenal glands is making too much aldosterone. This test is important because many people have small benign tumors in the adrenal glands that do not secrete any hormones. Relying only on a CT scan may result in the wrong adrenal gland being removed.\nTreatment\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism caused by an adrenal gland\ntumor\nis often treated with surgery. It can sometimes be treated with medicines.\nRemoving the adrenal tumor may control the symptoms. Even after surgery, some people still have high blood pressure and need to take medicine. But often, the number of medicines or doses can be lowered.\nLimiting salt intake and taking medicine may control the symptoms without surgery."}

Medicines to treat hyperaldosteronism include:\nMedicines that block the action of aldosterone\nWater pills (diuretics), which help manage fluid buildup in the body\nSecondary hyperaldosteronism is treated with medicines (as described above) and limiting salt intake. Surgery is usually not used.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook for primary hyperaldosteronism is good with early diagnosis and treatment.\nThe outlook for secondary hyperaldosteronism depends on the cause of the condition.\nPossible Complications\nPrimary hyperaldosteronism can cause very high blood pressure, which can damage many organs, including the eyes, kidneys, heart, and brain.\nErection problems and enlarged breast tissue in men (\ngynecomastia\n) may occur with long-term use of medicines to block the effect of hyperaldosteronism.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider for an appointment if you develop symptoms of hyperaldosteronism.\nAlternative Names\nConn syndrome; Mineralocorticoid excess\nImages\nEndocr"}
