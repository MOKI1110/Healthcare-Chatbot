The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery. Swallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body.\nPure menthol is not easy to get. The menthol found in many over-the-counter products is usually watered down and mixed with other ingredients. Therefore, how well a person does also depends on the other ingredients in the product.\nReferences\nAronson JK. Menthol. In: Aronson JK, ed.\nMeyler's Side Effects of Drugs.\n16th ed.
