Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nReplantation of digits\nReplantation of digits\nReplantation of digits is surgery to reattach fingers or toes that have been cut off (\namputated\n).\nDescription\nSurgery is done the following way:\nGeneral anesthesia\nwill be given. This means the person will be asleep and unable to feel pain. Or regional anesthesia (\nspinal and epidural\n) will be given to numb the arm or leg.\nThe surgeon removes damaged tissue.\nThe wound is cleaned extensively to avoid infection.\nThe ends of the bones are trimmed.\nThe surgeon places the finger or toe (called the digit) in place. The bones are rejoined with wires or a plate and screws.\nTendons are repaired, followed by nerves and blood vessels. Nerve and blood vessel repair is the most important step to the success of the procedure."}

Nerve and blood vessel repair is the most important step to the success of the procedure. If needed, tissue with nerves and blood vessels from another part of the body is used.\nThe wound is closed with stitches and bandaged.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThis surgery is done when fingers or toes have been amputated and are still in a condition that would allow replantation.\nRisks\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general include:\nBreathing problems\nReactions to medicines\nBleeding, blood clots, infection\nRisks of this surgery include:\nDeath of the replanted tissue\nDecreased nerve function or movement in the replanted digit\nLoss of sensation in the replanted tissue\nStiffness of the digits\nPain that continues after surgery\nMore surgeries are required for the replanted digit\nInfection of the replanted tissue\nAfter the Procedure\nSpecial care will be taken while you are in the hospital to make sure blood flows properly to the reattached part. The arm or leg will be kept raised. The room may be kept warm to ensure proper blood flow."}

The arm or leg will be kept raised. The room may be kept warm to ensure proper blood flow. The reattached part will be checked often to make sure there is good blood flow.\nAfter you are released from the hospital, you may need to wear a cast to protect the finger or toe. The surgeon may prescribe blood-thinning medicines to prevent blood clots.\nProper care of the amputated part or parts is very important to successful replantation. Under the right conditions, there is a good chance that the surgery can restore the use of the finger or toe. You will need follow-up visits with your surgeon, who will continue checking blood flow in the surgery area.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nChildren are better candidates for replantation surgery because of their greater ability to heal and regrow tissue.\nReplantation of an amputated part is  best done within 6 hours after the injury.  But replantation can still be successful if the amputated part has been cooled for up to 24 hours after the injury.\nYou will not have the same flexibility in the finger or toe after surgery."}
