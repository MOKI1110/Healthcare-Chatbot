Bleeding during pregnancy has different causes. If you have any bleeding when you are pregnant, be sure to contact your health care provider.\nCauses\nEvery woman's menstrual cycle is different.\nOn average, a woman's period (menstrual flow) occurs every 28 days, although cycles may vary from 24 to 34 days.\nMenstruation flow normally last about 4 to 7 days.\nYoung girls may get their periods anywhere from 21 to 45 days or more apart.\nWomen in their 40s may start to have their period less often or have the interval between their periods decrease.\nFor most women, female hormone levels change every month. The hormones estrogen and progesterone are released as part of the process of ovulation. When a woman ovulates, an egg is released.\nAUB can occur when the ovaries do not release an egg. Changes in hormone levels cause your period to be later or earlier. Your period may sometimes be heavier than normal.\nAUB is more common in teenagers or in premenopausal women."}
