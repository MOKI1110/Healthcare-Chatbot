The skin test can rarely make histoplasmosis antibody tests turn positive.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA reaction means you have been exposed to\nHistoplasma capsulatum\n. It does not mean you have an active infection.\nRisks\nThere is a slight risk of\nanaphylactic shock\n(a severe reaction).\nConsiderations\nThis test is rarely used today. It has been replaced by a variety of\nblood\nand urine tests.\nAlternative Names\nHistoplasmosis skin test\nReferences\nDeepe GS.\nHistoplasma capsulatum\n(histoplasmosis).
