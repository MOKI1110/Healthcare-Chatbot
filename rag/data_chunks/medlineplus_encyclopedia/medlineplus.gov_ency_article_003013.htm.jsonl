The tonsils are often removed along with the adenoid glands. The latter surgery is called\nadenoidectomy\nand is most often done in children.\nDescription\nThe surgery is done while your child is under general anesthesia. Your child will be asleep and pain-free.\nThe surgeon will place a small tool into your child's mouth to hold it open.\nThe surgeon then cuts, burns, or shaves away the tonsils. The wounds heal naturally without stitches.\nAfter surgery, your child will stay in the recovery room until he or she is awake and can breathe easily, cough, and swallow. Most children go home several hours after this surgery.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThe tonsils help protect against infections. But children with large tonsils may have problems breathing at night. The tonsils may also trap excess bacteria which can lead to frequent or very painful sore throats."}

Your child will go home the same day as the surgery. Children rarely need to stay overnight in the hospital for observation.\nComplete recovery takes about 1 to 2 weeks.
