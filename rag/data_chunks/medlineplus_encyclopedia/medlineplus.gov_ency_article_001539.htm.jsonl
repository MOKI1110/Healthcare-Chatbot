It occurs in infants and is rare in children and teenagers. The cause is often unknown. Certain problems, such as lack of stimulation of the infant, neglect, and high-stress family situations have been linked with the disorder.\nRumination disorder may also occur in adults.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nRepeatedly bringing up (regurgitating) food. This is effortless and is different from vomiting.\nThe food that comes up is usually undigested.\nRepeatedly rechewing food\nSymptoms must go on for at least 1 month to fit the definition of rumination disorder.\nPeople do not appear to be upset, retching, or disgusted when they bring up food."}

It may appear to cause pleasure.\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider must first check for physical causes, such as\nhiatal hernia\n,\npyloric stenosis\n, and gastrointestinal system abnormalities that are present from birth (congenital). These conditions can be mistaken for rumination disorder. This may require certain tests.\nRumination disorder can be diagnosed with a test called high resolution manometry with impedance testing. This test is sometimes needed.\nRumination disorder can rarely cause\nmalnutrition\n. The following lab tests can measure how severe the malnutrition is and determine what nutrients need to be increased:\nBlood test for\nanemia\nEndocrine hormone functions\nSerum\nelectrolytes\nSerum protein levels\nSerum vitamin levels\nTreatment\nRumination disorder is treated with behavioral techniques."}

One treatment associates bad consequences with rumination and good consequences with more appropriate behavior (mild aversive training).\nOther techniques include improving the environment (if there is abuse or neglect) and counseling the parents.\nDiaphragmatic breathing exercises can help rumination.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn some cases, rumination disorder will disappear on its own, and the child will go back to eating normally without treatment. In other cases, treatment is needed.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nFailure to thrive\nLowered resistance to disease\nMalnutrition\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your baby appears to be repeatedly spitting up,\nvomiting\n, or rechewing food.\nPrevention\nThere is no known prevention. However, normal stimulation and healthy parent-child relationships may help reduce the odds of rumination disorder.\nReferences\nKatzman DK, Norris ML. Feeding and eating disorders."}
