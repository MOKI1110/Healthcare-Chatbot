Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPectus excavatum repair\nPectus excavatum repair\nPectus excavatum repair is surgery to correct\npectus excavatum\n. This is a congenital (present at birth) deformity of the front of the chest wall that causes a sunken breastbone (sternum) and ribs.\nPectus excavatum is also called funnel or sunken chest. It may worsen during the teen years.\nDescription\nThere are two types of surgery to repair this condition -- open surgery and closed (minimally invasive) surgery. Either surgery is done while the child is in a deep sleep and pain-free from\ngeneral anesthesia\n.\nOpen surgery is more traditional. The surgery is done the following way:\nThe surgeon makes a cut (incision) across the front part of the chest.\nThe deformed cartilage is removed and the rib lining is left in place. This will allow the cartilage to grow back correctly.\nA cut is then made in the breastbone, which is moved to the correct location. The surgeon may use a metal strut (support piece) to hold the breastbone in this normal position until it heals."}

The surgeon may use a metal strut (support piece) to hold the breastbone in this normal position until it heals. Healing takes 3 to 12 months.\nThe surgeon may place a tube to drain fluids that build up in the area of the repair.\nAt the end of surgery, the incision is closed.\nThe metal struts are removed in 6 to 12 months through a small cut in the skin under the arm. This procedure is usually done on an outpatient basis.\nThe second type of surgery is a closed method. It is used mostly for children. No cartilage or bone is removed. The surgery is done the following way:\nThe surgeon makes two small incisions, one on each side of the chest.\nA small video camera called a thoracoscope is placed through one of the incisions. This allows the surgeon to view inside the chest.\nA curved steel bar that has been shaped to fit the child is inserted through the incisions and placed under the breastbone. The purpose of the bar is to lift the breastbone. The bar is left in place for at least 2 years."}

This helps the breastbone grow properly.\nAt the end of surgery, the scope is removed and the incisions closed.\nSurgery may take 1 to 4 hours, depending on the procedure.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThe most common reason for pectus excavatum repair is to improve the appearance of the chest wall.\nSometimes the deformity is so severe that it causes chest pain and limits breathing, largely in adults.\nSurgery is mostly done on children who are 12 to 16 years old, but not before age 6. It can also be done on adults in their early 20s.\nRisks\nRisks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:\nReactions to medicines\nBreathing problems\nBleeding\n,\nblood clots\n, or infection\nRisks for this surgery are:\nInjury to the heart\nLung collapse\nPain\nReturn of the deformity\nBefore the Procedure\nA complete medical exam and medical tests are needed before the surgery."}

Include medicines, herbs, vitamins, or any other supplements you bought without a prescription.\nAllergies your child may have to medicine, latex, tape, or skin cleanser.\nDuring the days before the surgery:\nAbout 7 days before surgery, your child may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other blood thinning medicines.\nAsk the surgeon or nurse which medicines your child should still take on the day of surgery.\nOn the day of surgery:\nYour child will likely be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before surgery.\nGive your child any medicines the surgeon told you to give with a small sip of water.\nArrive at t"}

If your child is ill, the surgery may be postponed.\nAfter the Procedure\nIt is common for children to stay in the hospital for 3 to 7 days. How long your child stays depends on how well the recovery is going.\nPain is common after the surgery. For the first few days, your child may receive strong pain medicine in the vein (through an IV) or through a catheter placed in the spine (an epidural). After that, pain is usually managed with medicines taken by mouth.\nYour child may have tubes in the chest around the surgical cuts. These tubes drain extra fluid that collects from the procedure. The tubes will remain in place until they stop draining, usually after a few days. The tubes are then removed.\nThe day after surgery, your child will be encouraged to sit up, take deep breaths, and get out of bed and walk."}

Before leaving the hospital, you will receive a prescription for pain medicine for your child.\nAt home, follow any\ninstructions\nfor caring for your child.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe surgery usually leads to improvements in appearance, breathing, and ability to exercise.\nAlternative Names\nFunnel chest repair; Chest deformity repair; Sunken chest repair; Cobbler's chest repair; Nuss repair; Ravitch repair\nPatient Instructions\nPectus excavatum - discharge\nSurgical wound care - open\nImages\nPectus excavatum\nPectus excavatum repair  - series\nReferences\nDemehri FR, Shamberger RC.
