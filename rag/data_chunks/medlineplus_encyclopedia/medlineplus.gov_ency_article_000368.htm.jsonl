Harmful deposits most often form in the heart, kidneys, and nervous system. These\nprotein\ndeposits damage the tissues and interfere with how organs work.\nCauses\nHereditary amyloidosis is passed down from parents to their children (inherited). Genes may also play a role in\nprimary amyloidosis\n.\nOther types of amyloidosis are not inherited. They include:\nSenile systemic: seen in people older than 70\nSpontaneous: occurs without a known cause\nSecondary: results from diseases such as cancer of certain blood cells (myeloma)\nSpecific conditions include:\nCardiac amyloidosis\nCerebral amyloidosis\nSecondary systemic amyloidosis\nTreatment\nTreatment to improve the function of damaged organs will help relieve some symptoms of hereditary amyloidosis. A liver transplant may be helpful to reduce the creation of harmful amyloid proteins."}
