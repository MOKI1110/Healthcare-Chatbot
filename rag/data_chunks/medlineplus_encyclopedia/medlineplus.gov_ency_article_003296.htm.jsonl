Some are common and normal. Others are signs of a nervous system disorder.\nCauses\nCauses may include:\nAutoimmune disorders\n, such as Isaac syndrome.\nDrug overdose (caffeine, amphetamines, or other stimulants).\nLack of sleep.\nMedicine side effect (such as from diuretics, corticosteroids, or estrogens).\nExercise (twitching is seen after exercise).\nLack of nutrients in the diet (deficiency).\nStress.\nMedical conditions that cause metabolic disorders, including low potassium, kidney disease, and uremia.\nTwitches not caused by disease or disorders (benign twitches), often affecting the eyelids, calf, or thumb. These twitches are normal and quite common, and are often triggered by stress or\nanxiety\n."}
