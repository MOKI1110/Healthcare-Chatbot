Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMucopolysaccharidosis type IV\nMucopolysaccharidosis type IV\nMucopolysaccharidosis type IV (MPS IV) is a rare disease in which the body is missing or does not have enough of an\nenzyme\nneeded to break down long chains of sugar molecules. These chains of molecules are called glycosaminoglycans (formerly called mucopolysaccharides). As a result, the molecules build up in different parts of the body and cause various health problems.\nThe condition belongs to a group of diseases called\nmucopolysaccharidoses\n(MPSs). MPS IV is also known as Morquio syndrome.\nThere are several other types of MPSs, including:\nMPS I\n(Hurler syndrome; Hurler-Scheie syndrome; Scheie syndrome)\nMPS II\n(Hunter syndrome)\nMPS III\n(Sanfilippo syndrome)\nCauses\nMPS IV is an inherited disorder. This means it is typically passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of a gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease."}

If both parents carry a nonworking copy of a gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease. This is called an\nautosomal recessive\ntrait.\nThere are two forms of MPS IV: type A and type B.\nType A is caused by a defect in the\nGALNS\ngene. People with type A do not have an enzyme called\nN\n-acetylgalactosamine-6-sulfatase.\nType B is caused by a defect in the\nGLB1\ngene. People with type B do not produce enough of an enzyme called beta-galactosidase.\nThe body needs these enzymes to break down long strands of sugar molecules called keratan sulfate. In both types, abnormally large amounts of glycosaminoglycans build up in the body. This can damage bodily organs.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms usually start between ages 1 and 3 years."}
