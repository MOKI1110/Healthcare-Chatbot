Electrodes are placed on your scalp and on each earlobe. A  brief click or tone will be transmitted through earphones you are wearing during the test. The electrodes pick up the brain's responses to these sounds and record them."}

There may be slight risks from having sedation depending on your age, medical conditions, and type of sedation medicine uses. Your provider will talk to you about any risk you may have.\nAlternative Names\nEvoked auditory potentials; Brainstem auditory evoked potentials; Evoked response audiometry; Auditory brainstem response; ABR; BAEP\nImages\nBrain\nBrain wave monitor\nReferences\nHahn CD, Emerson RG.
