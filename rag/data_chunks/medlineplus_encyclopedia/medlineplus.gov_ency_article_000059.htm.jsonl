You should suspect chemical exposure if an otherwise healthy person becomes ill for no apparent reason, particularly if an empty chemical container is found nearby.\nExposure to chemicals at work over a long period of time can cause changing symptoms as the chemical builds up in the person's body.\nIf the person has a chemical in their eyes, see first aid for\neye emergencies\n.\nIf the person has swallowed or inhaled a dangerous chemical, call a local\npoison control center\nat 1-800-222-1222.\nSymptoms\nDepending on the type of exposure, the symptoms may include:\nAbdominal pain\nBreathing difficulty\nBright red or\nbluish skin\nand lips\nConvulsions (\nseizures\n)\nDizziness\nEye pain, burning or watering\nHeadache\nHives\n,\nitching\n,\nswelling\n, or\nweakness\nresulting from an\nallergic reaction\nIrritability\nNausea\nand\nvomiting\nPain where the skin has come in contact with th"}

Remove any clothing and jewelry.\nFlush the chemicals off the skin surface using cool running water for 15 minutes or more unless the chemical exposure is to dry lime (calcium oxide, also called 'quick lime') or to elemental metals such as sodium, potassium, magnesium, phosphorous, and lithium.\nTreat the person for\nshock\nif they appear faint, pale, or if there is shallow, rapid breathing.\nApply cool, wet compresses to relieve pain.\nWrap the burned area with a dry sterile dressing (if possible) or clean cloth. Protect the burned area from pressure and friction.\nMinor chemical burns will most often heal without further treatment. However, if there is a second or\nthird degree burn\nor if there is an overall body reaction, get medical help right away. In severe cases, don't leave the person alone and watch carefully for reactions affecting the entire body.\nNote: If a chemical gets into the eyes, flush them with water right away."}

Get medical help right away.\nDO NOT\nDo not apply any household remedy such as ointment or salve to a chemical burn.\nDo not become contaminated by the chemical as you give first aid.\nDo not disturb a blister or remove dead skin from a chemical burn.\nDo not try to neutralize any chemical without consulting the poison control center or a health care provider.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall for medical help right away if the person is having difficulty breathing, is having seizures, or is unconscious.\nPrevention\nAll chemicals should be stored out of the reach of young children -- preferably in a locked cabinet.\nAvoid mixing different products that contain toxic chemicals such as\nammonia\nand bleach."}
