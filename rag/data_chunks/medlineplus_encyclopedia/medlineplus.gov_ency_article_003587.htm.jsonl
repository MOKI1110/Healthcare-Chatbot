Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nUrine specific gravity test\nUrine specific gravity test\nUrine specific gravity is a laboratory test that shows the total concentration of all chemical particles in the urine.\nHow the Test is Performed\nAfter you provide a urine sample, it is tested right away. The health care provider uses a dipstick made with a color-sensitive pad. The color the dipstick changes to will tell the provider the specific gravity of your urine. The dipstick test gives only a rough result. For a more accurate result, your provider may send your urine sample to a lab.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider may tell you that you need to limit your fluid intake 12 to 14 hours before the test.\nYour provider will ask you to temporarily stop taking any medicines that may affect the test results. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take, including dextran and sucrose. DO NOT stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.\nOther things can also affect the test results."}

Tell your provider if you recently:\nHad any type of anesthesia for an operation\nReceived intravenous dye (contrast medium) for an imaging test, such as a CT or MRI scan\nUsed herbs or natural remedies, especially Chinese herbs\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test helps evaluate your body's water balance and urine concentration.\nNormal Results\nUrine\nosmolality\nis a more specific and precise test for urine concentration. The urine specific gravity test is easier and more convenient, and is usually part of a routine\nurinalysis\n. The urine osmolality test may not be needed.\nThe normal range for urine specific gravity is 1.005 to 1.030. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIncreased urine specific gravity may be due to conditions such as:\nAdrenal glands do not produce enough hormones (such as Addison disease)\nGlucose in the urine\nHeart failure\nHigh sodium level in the blood\nLoss of body fluids (\ndehydration\n)\nNarrowing of the kidney artery (renal artery stenosis)\nShock\nSyndrome of inappropriate ADH secretion (\nSIADH\n)\nDecreased urine specific gravity may be due to:\nDamage to kidney tubule cells (\nrenal tubular necrosis\n)\nDiabetes insipidus\nDrinking too much fluid\nKidney failure\nLow sodium level in the blood\nSevere kidney infection (pyelonephritis)\nRisks\nThere are no risks with this test.\nAlternative Names\nUrine density\nImages\nFemale urinary tract\nMale urinary tract\nReferences\nKrishnan A, Levin A.
