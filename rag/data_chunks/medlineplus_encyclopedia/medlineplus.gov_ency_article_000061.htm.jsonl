Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNose fracture\nNose fracture\nA nose fracture is a break in the bone or cartilage over the bridge, or in the sidewall or septum (structure that divides the nostrils) of the nose.\nConsiderations\nA fractured nose is the most common\nfracture\nof the face. It most often occurs after an injury and often occurs with other fractures of the face.\nNose injuries and neck injuries are often seen together. A blow that is forceful enough to injure the nose may be hard enough to injure the neck.\nSerious nose injuries cause problems that need a health care provider's attention right away. For example, damage to the cartilage can cause a collection of blood to form inside the nose. If this blood is not drained right away, it can cause an\nabscess\nor a permanent deformity that blocks the nose."}

If this blood is not drained right away, it can cause an\nabscess\nor a permanent deformity that blocks the nose. It may lead to tissue death and cause the nose to collapse.\nFor minor nose injuries, the provider may want to see the person within the first week after the injury to see if the nose has moved out of its normal shape.\nSometimes, surgery may be needed to correct a nose or septum that has been bent out of shape by an injury.  A doctor may be able to return nasal bones that have moved out of place back to their normal position within the first 2 weeks after the break.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nBlood coming from the nose\nBruising\naround the eyes\nDifficulty breathing through the nose\nMisshapen appearance (may not be apparent until the swelling goes down)\nPain\nSwelling\nThe bruised appearance most often disappears after 2 weeks.\nFirst Aid\nIf a nose injury happens:\nTry to stay calm.\nBreathe through your mouth and lean forward in a sitting position to keep blood from going down the back of your throat.\nSqueeze the nostrils closed and hold pressure to stop the bleeding.\nApply cold compresse"}
