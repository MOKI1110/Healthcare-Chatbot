Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results can be due to a variety of different medical conditions. These may include kidney disease, liver disease, breathing problems, and diabetes or diabetes complications.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.
