Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMetastatic pleural tumor\nMetastatic pleural tumor\nMetastatic pleural tumor is a type of\ncancer\nthat has spread from another organ to the thin membrane (pleura) surrounding the lungs and lining the inside of the chest cavity.\nCauses\nThe blood and lymph systems can carry cancer cells to other organs in the body. There, they can produce new growths or tumors.\nAlmost any type of cancer can spread to the lungs and involve the pleura.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nChest pain\n, especially when taking a deep breath\nCough\nWheezing\nCoughing up blood (hemoptysis)\nGeneral discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (\nmalaise\n)\nShortness of breath\nWeight loss\nLoss of appetite\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you and ask about your medical history and symptoms."}

Tests that may be done include:\nChest x-ray\nCT\nor\nMRI scan of the chest\nProcedure to remove and examine part of the pleura (\nopen pleural biopsy\n)\nTest that examines a sample of fluid that has collected in the pleural space (\npleural fluid analysis\n)\nProcedure that uses a needle to remove a sample of the pleura (\npleural needle biopsy\n)\nRemoval of fluid from around the lungs (\nthoracentesis\n)\nTreatment\nPleural tumors usually can't be removed with surgery. The original (primary) cancer should be treated.\nChemotherapy\nand\nradiation therapy\nmay be used, depending on the type of primary cancer.\nYour provider may recommend thoracentesis if you have a lot of fluid collecting around your lungs and you have shortness of breath or low blood oxygen levels.  After the fluid is removed, your lungs will be able to expand more. This allows you to breathe easier.\nTo prevent the fluid from collecting again, medicine may be placed directly into your chest space through a tube, called a catheter."}

Or, your surgeon may spray a medicine or talc on the lung surface during the procedure. This helps seal the space around your lungs to prevent the fluid from returning.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\nsupport group\nwhere members share common experiences and problems.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe survival time varies greatly from several months to several years. The outlook depends on:\nThe location of pleural tumors\nThe cell type of pleural tumors\nThe stage of the tumor\nThe person's age and general health\nWhether surgery is an option\nThe person's response to treatment\nYou and your family may want to start thinking about end-of-life planning, such as:\nPalliative care\nHospice care\nAdvance care directives\nHealth care agents\nThe 5-year survival rate (number of people who live for more than 5 years after diagnosis) is less than 25% for people with pleural tumors that have spread from other parts of the body.\nPossible Complications\nHealth problems that may result inc"}
