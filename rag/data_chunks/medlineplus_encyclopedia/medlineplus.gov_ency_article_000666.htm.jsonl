Instead, chemicals the body releases cause the response.\nA bacterial infection anywhere in the body may set off the response that leads to sepsis. Common places where an infection might start include the:\nBloodstream\nBones (common in children)\nBowel (usually seen with\nperitonitis\n)\nKidneys (upper\nurinary tract infection\n, pyelonephritis or urosepsis)\nLining of the brain (\nmeningitis\n)\nLiver or gallbladder\nLungs (\nbacterial pneumonia\n)\nSkin (\ncellulitis\n)\nFor people in or recently discharged from the hospital, common sites of infection include\nintravenous\nlines, surgical wounds, surgical drains, and sites of skin breakdown, known as bedsores or\npressure ulcers\n.\nSepsis most commonly affects infants or older adults.\nSymptoms\nIn a person with sepsis, the blood pressure drops, resulting in\nshock\n(the inability to provide necessary blood perfusion to all of the organs in the body)."}

There may be long-term problems with these organs.\nPrevention\nThe risk of sepsis can be reduced by getting all recommended vaccines.\nIn the hospital, careful hand washing can help prevent hospital-acquired infections that lead to sepsis."}
