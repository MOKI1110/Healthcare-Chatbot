Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEsophagectomy - minimally invasive\nEsophagectomy - minimally invasive\nMinimally invasive esophagectomy is surgery to remove part or all of the esophagus. This is the tube that moves food from your throat to your stomach. After it is removed, the esophagus is rebuilt from part of your stomach or part of your large intestine.\nMost of the time, esophagectomy is done to treat\ncancer of the esophagus\n. The surgery may also be done to treat the esophagus if it is no longer working to move food into the stomach.\nDescription\nDuring minimally invasive esophagectomy, small surgical cuts (incisions) are made in your upper belly, chest, or neck. A viewing scope (laparoscope) and surgical tools are inserted through the incisions to perform the surgery. (Removal of the esophagus can also be done using the\nopen method\n. Surgery is done through larger incisions.)\nLaparoscopic surgery is generally done in the following way:\nYou'll receive general anesthesia at the time of your surgery."}

Surgery is done through larger incisions.)\nLaparoscopic surgery is generally done in the following way:\nYou'll receive general anesthesia at the time of your surgery. This will keep you asleep and pain-free.\nThe surgeon makes 3 to 4 small cuts in your upper belly, chest, or lower neck. These cuts are about 1-inch (2.5 centimeters) long.\nThe laparoscope is inserted through one of the cuts into your upper belly. The scope has a light and camera on the end. Video from the camera appears on a monitor in the operating room. This allows the surgeon to view the area being operated on. Other surgical tools are inserted through the other cuts.\nThe surgeon frees the esophagus from nearby tissues. Depending on how much of your esophagus is diseased, part or most of it is removed.\nIf part of your esophagus is removed, the remaining ends are joined together using staples or stitches. If most of your esophagus is removed, the surgeon reshapes your stomach into a tube to make a new esophagus."}

In this type of surgery, a small scope and other instruments are inserted through the small cuts in the skin.
