Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPartial breast brachytherapy\nPartial breast brachytherapy\nBrachytherapy for breast cancer involves placing radioactive material directly in the area where\nbreast cancer\nhas been removed from the breast to reduce the risk of the cancer returning.\nCancer cells multiply faster than normal cells in the body. Because radiation is most harmful to quickly growing cells, radiation therapy damages cancer cells more easily than normal cells. This prevents the cancer cells from growing and dividing, and it leads to cell death.\nDescription\nBrachytherapy delivers radiation therapy directly to where cancer cells inside the breast are located. It may involve placing a radioactive source into the surgical site after the surgeon removes a breast lump. The radiation only reaches a small area around the surgical site. It does not treat the entire breast, which is why it is called partial breast radiation therapy or partial breast brachytherapy."}

The radiation only reaches a small area around the surgical site. It does not treat the entire breast, which is why it is called partial breast radiation therapy or partial breast brachytherapy. The goal is to limit side effects of radiation to a smaller volume of normal tissue.\nThere are different types of brachytherapy. There are at least two ways to deliver radiation from inside the breast.\nINTERSTITIAL BRACHYTHERAPY (IMB)\nSeveral small needles with tubes called catheters are placed through the skin into the tissues of the breast around the\nlumpectomy\nsite. This is most often done 1 to 2 weeks after surgery.\nMammography\n,\nultrasound\n, or\nCT scans\nare used to place the radioactive material where it will work best to kill the cancer.\nThe radioactive material is placed in the catheters and remains for 1 week.\nSometimes the radiation can be delivered twice a day for 5 days by a remote-controlled machine.\nINTRACAVITARY BRACHYTHERAPY (IBB)\nAfter breast lump removal, there is a cavity where the cancer was removed. A device that contains a silicone balloon and tube that has channels running through it can be inserted into this cavity."}

A device that contains a silicone balloon and tube that has channels running through it can be inserted into this cavity. A few days after placement, radiation in the form of tiny radioactive pellets can go into the channels, delivering radiation from inside the balloon. This is often done two times a day for five days. Sometimes the catheter is placed during the first surgery while you are asleep.\nUltrasound or CT scans are used to guide the exact placement of the radioactive material where it will work best to kill the cancer while protecting adjacent tissues.\nThe catheter (balloon) remains in place for around 1 to 2 weeks and is removed at your health care provider's office. Stitches may be needed to close the hole from where the catheter is removed.\nBrachytherapy may be given as low dose or high dose.\nThose receiving low-dose treatment are kept in the hospital in a private room. Radiation is slowly delivered over hours to days.\nHigh-dose rate therapy (HDR brachytherapy) is provided as an outpatient using the remote machine, again usually over 5 or so days."}

Sometimes the treatment is delivered two times in a single day, separated by 4 to 6 hours between sessions. Each treatment takes about 15 to 20 minutes.\nOther techniques include:\nPermanent breast seed implant (PBSI), in which radioactive seeds are individually inserted through a needle into the breast cavity several weeks after lumpectomy.\nIntraoperative radiation therapy is delivered in the operating room while you are asleep after breast tissue is removed. The treatment is completed in less than an hour. This uses a large x-ray machine inside the operating room.  This is performed at the same time as the lumpectomy. Using this type of treatment, which is best for certain sizes and stages of cancer, the surgery and radiation delivery are completed in one day.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nTraditionally, the entire breast was irradiated to kill cancer cells that may be hiding in other areas of the breast."}

Experts learned that certain cancers are most likely to return near the location of the original cancer. Therefore, in some cases, the whole breast may not need to receive radiation. Partial breast irradiation only treats some but not all of the breast, focusing on the area where the cancer is most likely to return, usually around the surgical cavity.\nBreast brachytherapy helps prevent breast cancer from returning. The radiation therapy is given after lumpectomy (also called a\npartial mastectomy\n)."}

The radiation therapy is given after lumpectomy (also called a\npartial mastectomy\n). This approach is called adjuvant (additional) radiation therapy because it is adding a treatment beyond surgery.\nBecause these techniques are not as well studied as whole-breast radiation therapy, there is not full agreement about who is most likely to benefit.\nTypes of breast cancer that may be treated with partial breast radiation include:\nDuctal carcinoma in situ (DCIS)\nInvasive breast cancer\nOther factors that may lead to the use of brachytherapy include:\nTumor size less than 2 to 3 centimeters (about an inch)\nNo evidence of tumor along the margins of tumor specimen removed\nLymph nodes have no tumor cells, or only one node has microscopic amounts\nBefore the Procedure\nTell your provider what medicines you are taking.\nWear loose-fitting clothes to the treatments.\nAfter the Procedure\nRadiation therapy can also damage or kill healthy cells.
