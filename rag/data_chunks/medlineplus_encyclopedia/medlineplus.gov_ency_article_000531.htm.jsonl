Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMyelofibrosis\nMyelofibrosis\nMyelofibrosis is a disorder of the bone marrow in which the marrow is replaced by fibrous scar tissue.\nCauses\nBone marrow is the soft, fatty tissue inside your bones. Stem cells are immature cells in the bone marrow that develop into all of your blood cells. Your blood is made of:\nRed blood cells (which carry oxygen to your tissues)\nWhite blood cells (which fight infection)\nPlatelets (which help your blood clot)\nWhen the bone marrow is scarred, it cannot make enough blood cells.\nAnemia\n, bleeding problems, and a higher risk for infections may occur.\nAs a result, the liver and spleen try to make some of these blood cells. This causes these organs to swell.\nThe cause of myelofibrosis is often unknown. There are no known risk factors. When it occurs, it often develops slowly in people over age 50. Women and men are equally affected. There is an increased occurrence of this condition in Ashkenazi Jews.\nBlood and bone marrow cancers, such as\nmyelodysplastic syndrome\n,\nleukemia\n, and lymphoma, may also cause bone marrow scarring."}

There is an increased occurrence of this condition in Ashkenazi Jews.\nBlood and bone marrow cancers, such as\nmyelodysplastic syndrome\n,\nleukemia\n, and lymphoma, may also cause bone marrow scarring. This is called secondary myelofibrosis.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nAbdominal fullness\n, pain, or feeling full before finishing a meal (because of  an enlarged spleen)\nBone pain\nEasy bleeding,\nbruising\nFatigue\nIncreased likelihood of getting an infection\nPale skin\nShortness of breath\nwith exercise\nWeight loss\nNight sweats\nLow grade fever\nEnlarged liver\nDry cough\nItchy skin\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.\nTests that may be done include:\nComplete blood count\n(CBC) with blood smear to check different types of blood cells\nMeasuring tissue damage (\nLDH enzyme level\n)\nMolecular testing\nBone marrow biopsy\nto diagnose the condition and to check for bone marrow cancers\nTreatment\nBone marrow or stem cell transplant\nmay improve symptoms, and may cure the disease."}

This treatment is usually considered for younger people.\nOther treatment may involve:\nBlood transfusions\nand medicines to correct anemia\nRadiation\nand\nchemotherapy\nTargeted medicines\nRemoval of the spleen (\nsplenectomy\n) if swelling causes symptoms, or to help with anemia\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAs the disease worsens, the bone marrow slowly stops working. Low platelet count leads to easy bleeding. Spleen swelling may get worse along with anemia.\nThe average survival of people with primary myelofibrosis is about 5 years. But some people survive for decades.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nDevelopment of\nacute myelogenous leukemia\nInfections\nBleeding\nBlood clots\nLiver failure\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nMake an appointment with your provider if you have symptoms of this disorder."}
