Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBlood sugar test\nBlood sugar test\nA blood sugar test measures the amount of sugar (glucose) in a sample of your blood.\nGlucose is a major source of energy for most cells of the body, including brain cells. Glucose is a building block for carbohydrates. Carbohydrates are found in fruit, cereal, bread, pasta, and rice. Carbohydrates are quickly turned into glucose in your body. This can raise your blood glucose level.\nThe hormone insulin made in the body helps control the blood glucose level.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThe test may be done in the following ways:\nAfter you have not eaten anything for at least 8 hours (fasting)\nAt any time of the day (random)\nTwo hours after you drink a fluid with a certain amount of glucose (2 hour post-prandial glucose test or\noral glucose tolerance test\n)\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising."}

This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour health care provider may order this test if you have signs of\ndiabetes\n. More than likely, your provider will order a fasting blood sugar test.\nThe blood glucose test is also used to monitor people who already have diabetes.\nThe test may also be done if you have:\nAn increase in how often you need to urinate\nRecently gained a lot of weight\nBlurred vision\nConfusion or a change in the way you normally talk or behave\nFainting spells\nSeizures\n(for the first time)\nUnconsciousness or\ncoma\nSCREENING FOR DIABETES\nThis test may also be used to screen for diabetes.\nHigh blood sugar and diabetes may not cause symptoms in the early stages. A fasting blood sugar test is the most common test done to screen for diabetes, usually starting at age 35."}

A fasting blood sugar test is the most common test done to screen for diabetes, usually starting at age 35. If you have no other diabetes risk factors, you should be tested every 3 years (in some cases, more often if your weight is rising).\nIf you're overweight and have any of the other risk factors below, ask your provider about getting tested at an earlier age or more often:\nHigh blood sugar level on a previous test\nBlood pressure of 140/90 mm Hg or higher, or unhealthy cholesterol levels\nHistory of heart disease\nMember of a high-risk ethnic group (African American, Latino, Native American, Asian American, or Pacific Islander)\nWoman who has been previously diagnosed with gestational diabetes\nPolycystic ovary disease (a condition in which a woman has an imbalance of female sex hormones which may cause cysts in the ovaries)\nClose relative with diabetes (such as a parent, brother, or sister)\nNot physically active\nChildren age 10 and older who are overweight and have at least two of the risk factors listed above should be tested for type 2 diabetes every 3 years, even if they have no symptoms."}

Some experts do advocate such screening for overweight children. Ask your child's provider what is best for them.\nNormal Results\nIf you had a fasting blood glucose test, a level of 70 to 99 mg/dL (3.9 and 5.5 mmol/L) is considered normal.\nIf you had a random blood glucose test, a normal result depends on when you last ate. Most of the time, the blood glucose level will be 125 mg/dL (6.9 mmol/L) or lower.\nThe examples above show the common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens."}
