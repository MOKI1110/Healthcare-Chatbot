If you are on steroid medicine, ask your provider if you need to stop the medicine before the test, because steroids can decrease ACE levels. Do not stop any medicine before talking to your provider.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising.

People with sarcoidosis may have their ACE level tested regularly to check how severe the disease is and how well treatment is working.\nThis test may also help confirm a diagnosis of\nGaucher disease\n.\nNormal Results\nNormal values vary based on your age and the test method used. Adults have an ACE level less than 40 micrograms per liter.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nHigher than normal ACE level may be a sign of sarcoidosis."}
