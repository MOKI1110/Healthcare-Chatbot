Dementia may also be referred to as major\nneurocognitive disorder\n.\nDementia due to metabolic causes is a loss of brain function that can occur with abnormal chemical processes in the body. With some of these disorders, if treated early, brain dysfunction can be reversed. Left untreated, permanent brain damage, such as dementia, can occur.\nCauses\nPossible metabolic causes of dementia include:\nHormonal disorders, such as\nAddison disease\n,\nCushing disease\nHeavy metal exposure, such as to lead, arsenic, mercury, or manganese\nRepeat episodes of low blood sugar (\nhypoglycemia\n), most often seen in people with diabetes who use insulin\nHigh level of calcium in the blood, such as due to\nhyperparathyroidism\nLow level of thyroid hormone (\nhypothyroidism\n) or high level of thyroid hormone (\nthyrotoxicosis\n) in the body\nLiver cirrhosis\nKidney failure\nNutritional disorders, such as vitamin B1 deficiency,\nvitamin B12\ndefic"}
