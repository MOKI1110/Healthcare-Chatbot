However, sometimes the number of candida organisms increase. This leads to a yeast infection.\nYeast infections often cause genital itching, a thick white vaginal discharge, rash, and other symptoms.\nThe vagina normally contains both healthy bacteria and unhealthy bacteria.\nBacterial vaginosis\n(BV) occurs when more unhealthy bacteria than healthy bacteria grow. BV may cause a thin, gray vaginal discharge, pelvic pain, and a fishy odor.\nA less common type of vaginitis is spread by sexual contact. It is called trichomoniasis."}

Symptoms in women include genital itching, vaginal odor, and a heavy vaginal discharge that may be yellow-gray or green in color. Women may also experience vaginal spotting after intercourse.\nOTHER CAUSES\nChemicals can cause itchy rashes in the genital area.\nSpermicides and\nvaginal sponges\n, which are over-the-counter birth control methods\nFeminine sprays and perfumes\nBubble baths and soaps\nBody lotions\nLow estrogen levels in women after menopause can cause\nvaginal dryness and thinning\nof the skin of the vagina and vulva. These factors may lead to or worsen genital itching and burning. This condition is called genitourinary syndrome of menopause (GSM), formerly known as atrophic vaginitis.\nOther causes include:\nTight-fitting or nonabsorbent clothing, which leads to heat rashes.\nSkin conditions.\nObjects such as a lost tampon in your vagina can also cause irritation, itching, and strong-smelling discharge.\nSometimes, the exact cause cannot be found."}

This is called nonspecific vulvovaginitis.\nIt occurs in all age groups. However, it is most common in young girls before puberty, particularly girls with poor genital hygiene.\nIt causes a foul-smelling, brownish-green discharge and irritation of the labia and vaginal opening.\nThis condition is often linked with excess growth of bacteria that are typically found in the stool. These bacteria are sometimes spread from the rectum to the vaginal area by wiping from back to front after using the toilet.\nIrritated tissue is more likely to become infected than healthy tissue. Many germs that cause infection thrive in a warm, damp, and dark environment."}

Many women feel cleaner when they douche, but it may actually make symptoms worse because it removes healthy bacteria that line the vagina. These bacteria help protect against infection.\nOther tips are:\nAvoid using hygiene sprays, fragrances, or powders in the genital area.\nUse pads instead of tampons while you have an infection.\nIf you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar level in good control.\nAllow more air to reach your genital area. You can do this by:\nWearing loose-fitting clothes and not wearing panty hose.\nWearing cotton underwear (instead of synthetic fabrics) or underwear that has a cotton lining in the crotch. Cotton allows normal evaporation of moisture so that moisture buildup is reduced.\nNot wearing underwear at night when you sleep.\nGirls and women should also:\nKnow how to properly clean their genital area while bathing or showering.\nWipe properly after using the toilet."}
