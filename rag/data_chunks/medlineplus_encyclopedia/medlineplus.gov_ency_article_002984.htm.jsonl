You will be asleep and pain-free.\nIf you receive local anesthesia, you will be awake and will receive medicine to numb your breast area to block pain.\nThere are different ways to place breast implants:\nIn the most common technique, the surgeon makes a cut (incision) on the underside of your breast, in the natural skin fold. The surgeon places the implant through this opening. Your scar may be a little more visible if you are younger, thin, have very small breasts, or have not had children.\nThe implant may be placed through a cut under your arm."}

Your scar may be a little more visible if you are younger, thin, have very small breasts, or have not had children.\nThe implant may be placed through a cut under your arm. The surgeon may perform this surgery using an endoscope. This is a tool with a camera and surgical instruments at the end. The endoscope is inserted through the cut. There will be no scar around your breast. But, you may have a visible scar on the underside of your arm.\nThe surgeon may make a cut around the edge of your areola. This is the darkened area around your nipple. The implant is placed through this opening. You may have more problems with breastfeeding and loss of sensation around the nipple with this method. There may be a higher risk of capsular contracture with this incision. Capsular contracture is when scar tissue causes the breast to become hard or misshapen.\nA saline implant may be placed through a cut near your belly button. An endoscope is used to move the implant up to the breast area."}

It is called breast implant-associated lymphoma. Symptoms include a mass or swelling around the implant and breast pain. It can be treated with removal of the implant and the area around the implant. Ongoing research in this area may discover other uncommon links between breast implants with other types of\ncancer\n.\nSome people have experienced systemic symptoms after receiving implants.

Or, you might wear a surgical bra. Drainage tubes may be attached to your breasts. These will be removed within 3 days. Your surgeon will give you instructions about when you may bathe or shower.\nYour surgeon may also recommend massaging the breasts starting 5 days after surgery. Massaging helps reduce hardening of the capsule that surrounds the implant.
