Tooth decay is often caused by poor\ndental hygiene\n. It may also be partly inherited. In some cases, toothache may be caused due to grinding teeth or other dental trauma.\nSometimes, pain that is felt in the tooth is actually due to pain in other parts of the body. This is called referred pain. For example, an earache may sometimes cause tooth pain.\nCauses\nA toothache may occur because of:\nAbscessed tooth\nEarache\nInjury to the jaw or mouth\nHeart attack\n(can include jaw pain,\nneck pain\n, or toothache)\nSinus infection\nTooth decay\nTooth trauma such as wear, injury, or fracture\nHome Care\nYou can use over-the-counter\npain medicine\nif you can't see your dentist or primary health care provider right away.\nYour dentist will first diagnose the source of the pain and recommend treatment."}

You may be prescribed antibiotics, pain medicines, or other medicines.\nUse good oral hygiene to prevent tooth decay. A low-sugar diet is recommended along with regular flossing, brushing with fluoride toothpaste, and regular professional cleaning. Sealants and fluoride applications by the dentist are important for preventing tooth decay. Also, tell your dentist if you think you might grind your teeth.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nSeek medical care if:\nYou have a severe toothache\nYou have a toothache that lasts longer than a day or two\nYou have\nfever\n, earache, or pain when opening your mouth wide\nNote: The dentist is an appropriate person to see for most causes of toothaches. However, if the problem is referred pain from another location, you may need to see your primary provider.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nYour dentist will examine your mouth, teeth, gums, tongue, throat, ears, nose, and neck.

Your dentist may recommend other tests, depending on the suspected cause.\nYour dentist will ask questions about your medical history and symptoms, including:\nWhen did the pain start?\nWhere is the pain located, and how bad is it?\nDoes the pain wake you up at night?\nAre there things that make the pain worse or better?\nWhat medicines are you taking?\nDo you have any other symptoms, such as fever?\nHave you had any injuries?\nWhen was your last dental checkup?\nTreatment will depend on the source of the pain. They may include removing and filling cavities, root canal therapy, or extraction of the tooth. If the toothache is related to trauma, such as grinding, your dentist may recommend a special appliance to protect the teeth from wear.\nAlternative Names\nPain - tooth or teeth\nImages\nTooth anatomy\nFractured tooth\nReferences\nBenko KR.
