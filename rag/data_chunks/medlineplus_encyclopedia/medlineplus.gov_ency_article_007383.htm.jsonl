The goal is to safely straighten your child's spine and align your child's shoulders and hips to correct your child's back problem.\nDescription\nBefore surgery, your child will receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n. These are medicines that put your child into a deep sleep and make them unable to feel pain during the operation.\nDuring surgery, your child's surgeon will use implants, such as steel rods, cords, hooks, screws, or other metal devices to straighten your child's spine and support the bones of the spine.\nBone grafts\nare placed to hold the spine in the correct position and keep it from curving again.\nThe surgeon will make at least one surgical cut (incision) to get to your child's spine. This cut may be in your child's back, chest, or both places. The surgeon may also do the procedure using a special video camera.\nA surgical cut in the back is called the posterior approach."}

This cut may be in your child's back, chest, or both places. The surgeon may also do the procedure using a special video camera.\nA surgical cut in the back is called the posterior approach. This surgery often takes several hours.\nA cut through the chest wall is called a thoracotomy. The surgeon makes a cut in your child's chest, deflates a lung, and often removes a rib. Recovery after this surgery is often faster.\nSome surgeons do both of these approaches together. This is a much longer and more difficult operation.\nVideo-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) is another technique. It is used for certain kinds of spinal curves. It takes a lot of skill, and not all surgeons are trained to do it."}

Your child must wear a brace for around 3 months after this procedure.\nDuring the surgery:\nThe surgeon will move muscles aside after making the cut.\nThe joints between the different vertebrae (the bones of the spine) will be taken out.\nBone grafts will often be put in to replace them.\nMetal instruments, such as rods, cages, screws, hooks, or wires will also be placed to help hold the spine together until the bone grafts attach and heal.\nThe surgeon may get bone for the grafts in these ways:\nThe surgeon may take bone from another part of your child's body. This is called an autograft. Bone taken from a person's own body is often the best.\nBone can also be taken from a bone bank, much like a blood bank. This is called an allograft. These grafts are not always as successful as autografts.\nManmade (synthetic) bone substitute may also be used.\nDifferent surgeries use different types of metal instruments."}

These are usually left in the body after the bone fuses together.\nNewer types of surgery for scoliosis do not require fusion. Instead, the surgeries use implants to regulate the growth of the spine.\nDuring scoliosis surgery, the surgeon will sometimes use special equipment to monitor the nerves that come from the spine to make sure they are not damaged.\nScoliosis surgery often takes 4 to 6 hours. It can also be much longer if the involved area is larger.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nBraces are often tried first to keep the curve from getting worse. But, when they no longer work, your child's health care provider will recommend surgery.\nThere are several reasons to treat scoliosis:\nAppearance is a major concern.\nScoliosis often causes back pain.\nIf the curve is severe enough, scoliosis may restrict your child's breathing.\nThe choice of when to have surgery will vary.\nAfter the bones of the skeleton stop growing, the curve should not get much worse."}

Because of this, the surgeon may wait until your child's bones stop growing.\nYour child may need surgery before this if the curve in the spine is severe or is getting worse quickly.\nSurgery is often recommended for the following children and adolescents with scoliosis of unknown cause (idiopathic scoliosis):\nAll young people whose skeletons have matured, and who have a curve greater than 45 degrees.\nGrowing children whose curve has gone beyond 40 degrees or is rapidly progressing."}

(Not all surgeons agree on whether all children with curves of 40 degrees should have surgery.)\nRisks\nThere may be complications with any of the procedures for scoliosis repair.\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:\nReactions to medicines\nor\nbreathing problems\nBleeding\n,\nblood clots\n, or infection\nRisks of scoliosis surgery are:\nBlood loss that requires a\ntransfusion\n.\nGallstones\nor pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas)\nIntestinal obstruction\n(blockage).\nNerve injury causing muscle weakness or paralysis (very rare)\nLung problems up to 1 week after surgery. Breathing may not return to normal until 1 to 2 months after surgery.\nProblems that may develop in the future include:\nThe bone fusion does not heal. This can lead to a painful condition in which a false joint grows at the site. This is called pseudarthrosis.\nThe parts of the spine that are fused can no longer move. This puts stress on other parts of the back."}

The extra stress can cause back pain and make the disks break down (disk degeneration).\nA metal hook placed in the spine may move a little. Or, a metal rod may rub on a sensitive spot. Both of these can cause some pain.\nNew spine problems may develop, largely in children who have surgery before their spine has stopped growing.\nBefore the Procedure\nTell your child's provider what medicines your child is taking. This includes medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\nBefore the operation:\nYour child will have a complete physical exam by the surgeon.\nYou and your child will learn about the surgery and what to expect.\nYour child will learn how to do special breathing exercises to help the lungs recover after surgery.\nYour child will be taught special ways to do everyday things after surgery to protect the spine. This includes learning how to move properly, changing from one position to another, and sitting, standing, and walking."}

This includes learning how to move properly, changing from one position to another, and sitting, standing, and walking. Your child will be told to use a log-rolling technique when getting out of bed. This means moving the entire body at once to avoid twisting the spine.\nYour child's provider will talk with you about having your child store some of their blood about a month before the surgery. This is so that your child's own blood can be used if a transfusion is needed during surgery.\nDuring the 2 weeks before the surgery:\nIf your child smokes, they\nneed to stop\n. People who have spine fusion and keep smoking do not heal as well. Ask your child's provider for help.\nTwo weeks before surgery, the surgeon may ask you to stop giving your child medicines that make it harder for the blood to clot. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E."}

At first, the medicine may be delivered through a special catheter inserted into your child's back. After that, a pump may be used to regulate how much pain medicine your child gets. Your child may also get shots or take pain pills.\nYour child may have to wear a body cast or a body brace.\nFollow any instructions you are given on how to care for your child at home.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nYour child's spine should look much straighter after surgery. There will still be some curve. It takes at least 3 months for the spinal bones to fuse together well. It will take 1 to 2 years for them to fuse completely.\nFusion stops growth in the spine."}

This is not often a concern because most growth occurs in the long bones of the body, such as the leg bones. Children who have this surgery will probably gain height from both growth in the legs and from having a straighter spine.\nAlternative Names\nSpinal curvature surgery - child; Kyphoscoliosis surgery - child; Video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery - child; VATS - child\nReferences\nNegrini S, Felice FD, Donzelli S, Zaina F.
