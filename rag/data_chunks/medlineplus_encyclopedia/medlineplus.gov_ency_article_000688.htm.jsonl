The cause is unknown in most other cases.\nIn ALS, motor nerve cells (neurons) waste away or die, and can no longer send messages to muscles. This eventually leads to muscle weakening, twitching, and an inability to move the arms, legs, and body. The condition continues to get worse. When the muscles in the chest area stop working, it becomes hard or impossible to breathe.\nALS affects approximately 7 out of every 100,000 people worldwide.\nHaving a family member who has a hereditary form of the disease is a risk factor for ALS. Other risks include military service."}

Other risks include military service. The reasons for this are unclear, but it may have to do with environmental exposure to toxins.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms usually do not develop until after age 50, but they can start in younger people. People with ALS have a loss of muscle strength and coordination that eventually gets worse and makes it impossible for them to do routine tasks such as going up steps, getting out of a chair, or swallowing.\nWeakness can first affect the arms or legs, or the ability to breathe or swallow. As the disease gets worse, more muscle groups develop problems.\nALS does not affect the senses (sight, smell, taste, hearing, touch)."}

Ongoing oversight by a physical medicine provider is helpful, given continuously changing symptoms.\nPeople with ALS tend to lose weight. The illness itself increases the need for food and calories. At the same time, problems with choking and swallowing make it hard to eat enough. To help with feeding, a tube may be placed into the stomach."}

A dietitian who specializes in ALS can give advice on healthy eating.\nBreathing devices include machines that are considered non-invasive (such as CPAP or BiPAP). Others require tube in the trachea (invasive ventilation).\nMedicine for depression may be needed if a person with ALS is diagnosed with depression. They also should discuss their wishes regarding artificial ventilation with their families and providers.\nSupport Groups\nEmotional support is vital in coping with the disorder, because mental functioning is not affected.\nGroups\nsuch as the ALS Association may be available to help people who are coping with the disorder.\nSupport for people who are caring for someone with ALS is also available, and may be very helpful.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nOver time, people with ALS lose the ability to function and care for themselves. Death often occurs within 3 to 5 years of diagnosis. About 1 in 4 people survive for more than 5 years after diagnosis."}
