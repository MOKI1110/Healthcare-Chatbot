Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPosterior fossa tumor\nPosterior fossa tumor\nPosterior fossa tumor is a type of brain tumor located in or near the bottom of the skull.\nCauses\nThe posterior fossa is a small space in the skull, found near the brainstem and cerebellum. The cerebellum is the part of the brain responsible for balance and coordinated movements. The brainstem is responsible for controlling vital body functions, such as breathing.\nIf a tumor grows in the area of the posterior fossa, it can block the flow of spinal fluid and cause increased pressure on the brain and spinal cord.\nMost tumors of the posterior fossa are primary brain cancers. They start in the brain, rather than spreading from somewhere else in the body.\nPosterior fossa tumors have no known causes or risk factors.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms occur very early with posterior fossa tumors and may include:\nDrowsiness\nHeadache\nImbalance\nNausea\nUncoordinated walk (\nataxia\n)\nVomiting\nSymptoms from posterior fossa tumors also occur when the tumor damages local structures, such as the cranial nerves."}

Symptoms of cranial nerve damage include:\nDilated pupils\nEye problems\nFace muscle weakness\nHearing loss\nLoss of feeling in part of the face\nTaste problems\nUnsteadiness when walking\nVision problems\nExams and Tests\nThe diagnosis is based on a thorough medical history and physical exam, followed by imaging tests and a biopsy. The best way to look at the posterior fossa is with an\nMRI scan\n.\nCT scans\nare not helpful to see that area of the brain in most cases.\nThe following procedures may be used to remove a piece of tissue from the tumor to help with diagnosis:\nOpen brain surgery, called a posterior\ncraniotomy\nStereotactic biopsy\nTreatment\nMost tumors of the posterior fossa are removed with surgery, even if they are not cancerous."}

There is limited space in the posterior fossa, and the tumor can easily press on critical structures if it grows.\nDepending on the type and size of the tumor, radiation treatment may also be used after surgery.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\nsupport group\nwhose members share common experiences and problems.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nA good outlook depends on finding the cancer early. A total blockage in the flow of spinal fluid can be life threatening. If tumors are found early, surgery can lead to long-term survival.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nCranial nerve palsies\nBrain herniation\nHydrocephalus\nIncreased intracranial pressure\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have regular headaches that occur with nausea, vomiting, or vision changes.\nAlternative Names\nInfratentorial brain tumors; Brainstem glioma; Cerebellar tumor\nReferences\nArriaga MA, Brackmann DE.
