It may get better when the disease that is causing it is treated.\nMore severe anemia, such as that caused by cancer or HIV/AIDS may require:\nBlood transfusion\nErythropoietin, a hormone produced by the kidneys, given as a shot\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe anemia will improve when the disease that is causing it is treated.\nPossible Complications\nDiscomfort from symptoms is the main complication in most cases. Anemia may lead to a higher risk for death in people with heart failure.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have a long-term (chronic) disorder and you develop symptoms of anemia.\nAlternative Names\nAnemia of inflammation; Inflammatory anemia; AOCD; ACD; Anemia of chronic inflammation\nImages\nBlood cells\nReferences\nElghetany MT, Banki K.
