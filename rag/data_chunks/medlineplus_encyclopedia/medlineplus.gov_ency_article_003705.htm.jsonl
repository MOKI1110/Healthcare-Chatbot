Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise.

This can occur when the stomach makes less of the substance (called intrinsic factor) the body needs to efficiently absorb vitamin B12.\nYour provider may also recommend a vitamin B12 test if you have certain nervous system symptoms. A low level of B12 can cause numbness or tingling in the arms and legs, weakness, and loss of balance.\nOther conditions for which the test may be done include:\nSudden severe confusion (\ndelirium\n)\nLoss of brain function (\ndementia\n)\nDementia due to metabolic causes\nNerve abnormalities, such as\nperipheral neuropathy\nNormal Results\nNormal values are 160 to 950 picograms per milliliter (pg/mL), or 118 to 701 picomoles per liter (pmol/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your provider about what your specific test results mean.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nValues of less than 160 pg/mL (118 pmol/L) are a possible sign of a vitamin B12 deficiency."}

Talk to your provider about what your specific test results mean.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nValues of less than 160 pg/mL (118 pmol/L) are a possible sign of a vitamin B12 deficiency. People with this degree of deficiency are likely to have or develop symptoms.\nDeficiency should be confirmed by checking the level of a substance in the blood called methylmalonic acid. A high level indicates a true B12 deficiency.\nCauses of vitamin B12 deficiency include:\nNot enough vitamin B12 in diet (rare, except with a strict vegetarian diet)\nDiseases that cause\nmalabsorption\n(for example,\nceliac disease\nand\nCrohn disease\n)\nLack of\nintrinsic factor\n, a protein that helps the intestine absorb vitamin B12 efficiently\nAbove normal body heat production (for example, with\nhyperthyroidism\n)\nPregnancy\nAn increased vitamin B12 level is uncommon. Usually, excess vitamin B12 is removed in the urine.\nConditions that can increase B12 level include:\nLiver disease (such as\ncirrhosis\nor\nhepatitis\n)\nMyeloproliferative disorders (for example,\npolycythemia vera\nand\nchronic myelogenous leukemia\n)\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken."}
