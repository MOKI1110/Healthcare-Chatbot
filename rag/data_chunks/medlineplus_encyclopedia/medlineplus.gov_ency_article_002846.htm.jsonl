Certain types of millipedes release a harmful substance (toxin) all over their body if they are threatened or if you handle them roughly. Unlike centipedes, millipedes do not bite or sting.\nThe toxin that millipedes release keeps away most predators. Some large millipede species can spray these toxins as far as 32 inches (80 centimeters). Contact with these secretions may cause allergic reactions in some people.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual toxin exposure."}

Symptoms will be treated.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost symptoms often go away within 24 hours after exposure. A brownish discoloration of the skin may persist for months. Severe reactions are mainly seen from contact with tropical species of millipedes. The outlook may be more serious if the toxin gets in the eyes. Open blisters may become infected and require antibiotics.\nReferences\nErickson TB, Marquez A. Arthropod envenomation and parasitism.
