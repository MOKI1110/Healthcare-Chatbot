It was more common in the past. The illness is rare today because of the\nchickenpox vaccine\n.\nCauses\nChickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. It is a member of the herpesvirus family. The same virus also causes\nshingles\nin adults.\nChickenpox can be spread very easily to others from 1 to 2 days before blisters appear until all the blisters have crusted over. You may get chickenpox:\nFrom touching the fluids from a chickenpox blister\nIf someone with the disease coughs or sneezes near you\nMost cases of chickenpox occur in children younger than age 10. The disease is most often mild, although serious complications may occur. Adults and older children get sicker than younger children in most cases.\nChildren whose mothers have had chickenpox or have received the chickenpox vaccine are not very likely to catch it before they are 1 year old. If they do catch chickenpox, they often have mild cases."}

If they do catch chickenpox, they often have mild cases. This is because antibodies from their mothers' blood help protect them. Children under 1 year old whose mothers have not had chickenpox or the vaccine can get severe chickenpox.\nSevere chickenpox symptoms are more common in children whose immune system does not work well.\nSymptoms\nMost children with chickenpox have the following symptoms before the rash appears:\nFever\nHeadache\nStomach ache\nThe chickenpox rash occurs about 10 to 21 days after coming into contact with someone who had the disease. In most cases, a child will develop 250 to 500 small, itchy, fluid-filled blisters over red spots on the skin.\nThe blisters are most often first seen on the face, middle of the body, or scalp.\nAfter a day or two, the blisters become cloudy and then scab. Meanwhile, new blisters form in groups."}

Meanwhile, new blisters form in groups. They often appear in the mouth, in the vagina, and on the eyelids.\nChildren with skin problems, such as eczema, may get thousands of blisters.\nMost pox will not leave scars unless they become infected with bacteria that is made more likely by scratching.\nSome children who have had the vaccine will still develop a mild case of chickenpox. In most cases, they recover much more quickly and have only a few poxes (fewer than 30). These cases are often harder to diagnose. However, these children can still spread chickenpox to others.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can most often diagnose chickenpox by looking at the rash and asking questions about the person's medical history. Small blisters on the scalp confirm the diagnosis in most cases.\nLab tests can help confirm the diagnosis, if needed.\nTreatment\nTreatment involves keeping the person as comfortable as possible. Here are things to try:\nAvoid scratching or rubbing the itchy areas."}

Here are things to try:\nAvoid scratching or rubbing the itchy areas. Keep fingernails short to avoid damaging the skin from scratching.\nWear cool, light, loose bedclothes. Avoid wearing rough clothing, particularly wool, over an itchy area.\nTake lukewarm baths using little soap and rinse thoroughly. Try a skin-soothing oatmeal or cornstarch bath.\nApply a soothing moisturizer after bathing to soften and cool the skin.\nAvoid prolonged exposure to excessive heat and humidity.\nTry over-the-counter oral antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), but be aware of possible side effects, such as drowsiness.\nTry over-the-counter hydrocortisone cream on itchy areas.\nMedicines that fight the chickenpox virus are available, but not given to everyone. To work well, the medicine should be started within the first 24 hours of the rash.\nAntiviral medicines are not very often prescribed to otherwise healthy children who do not have severe symptoms."}

Adults and teens, who are at risk for more severe symptoms, may benefit from antiviral medicine if it is given early.\nAntiviral medicine may be very important for those who have skin conditions (such as eczema or recent sunburn), lung conditions (such as asthma), or who have recently taken steroids.\nSome providers also give antiviral medicines to people in the same household who also develop chickenpox, because they will most often develop more severe symptoms.\nDO NOT give aspirin or ibuprofen to someone who may have chickenpox. Use of aspirin has been associated with a serious condition called\nReye syndrome\n. Ibuprofen has been associated with more severe secondary infections. Acetaminophen (Tylenol) may be used.\nA child with chickenpox should not return to school or play with other children until all chickenpox sores have crusted over or dried out."}

About 1 in 10 adults will have shingles when the virus re-emerges during a period of stress.\nPossible Complications\nRarely, infection of the brain has occurred. Other problems may include:\nReye syndrome\nInfection of the heart muscle\nPneumonia\nJoint pain or swelling\nCerebellar ataxia\nmay appear during the recovery phase or later. This involves a very unsteady walk.\nWomen who get chickenpox during pregnancy can pass the infection to the developing baby."}

Taking preventive steps right away may be important."}
