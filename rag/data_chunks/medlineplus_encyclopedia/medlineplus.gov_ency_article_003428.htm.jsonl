Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) collection is a test to look at the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.\nCSF acts as a cushion, protecting the brain and spine from injury. The fluid is normally clear. It has the same consistency as water. The test is also used to measure pressure in the spinal fluid.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThere are different ways to get a sample of CSF. Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is the most common method.\nTo have the test:\nYou will lie on your side with your knees pulled up toward the chest, and chin tucked downward. Sometimes the test is done sitting up, but bent forward.\nAfter the back is cleaned, your health care provider will inject a local numbing medicine (anesthetic) into the lower spine.\nA spinal needle will be inserted.\nAn opening pressure is sometimes taken."}

An abnormal pressure may indicate an infection or other problem.\nOnce the needle is in position, and after the CSF pressure is measured, a sample of 1 to 10 milliliters (mL) of CSF is collected in 4 or more vials.\nThe needle is removed, the area is cleaned, and a bandage is placed over the needle site. You may be asked to remain lying down for a short time after the test.\nIn some cases, special x-rays are used to help guide the needle into position. This is called fluoroscopy. In other cases, ultrasound can help direct the position of the needle.\nLumbar puncture with fluid collection may also be part of other procedures such as an\nx-ray\nor\nCT scan\nafter dye has been inserted into the CSF.\nRarely, other methods of CSF collection may be used.\nCisternal puncture uses a needle placed below the occipital bone (back of the skull). It can be dangerous because it is so close to the brain stem."}

It can be dangerous because it is so close to the brain stem. It is always done with fluoroscopy or other imaging guidance.\nVentricular puncture may be recommended in people with possible brain herniation. It is most often done in the operating room. A hole is drilled in the skull, and a needle is inserted directly into one of the brain's ventricles.\nCSF may also be collected from a tube that is already placed in the fluid, such as a shunt or a ventricular drain.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will need to give your health care team your consent before the test. Tell your provider if you are on any aspirin or any other blood-thinning medicines.\nAfter the procedure, you should plan to rest for several hours, even if you feel fine. This is to prevent fluid from leaking around the site of the puncture. You will not need to lie flat on your back the entire time. If you develop a headache, it may be helpful to drink caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea or soda.\nHow the Test will Feel\nIt may be uncomfortable to stay in position for the test."}

If you develop a headache, it may be helpful to drink caffeinated beverages such as coffee, tea or soda.\nHow the Test will Feel\nIt may be uncomfortable to stay in position for the test. Staying still is important because movement may lead to injury of the spinal cord.\nYou may be told to straighten your position slightly after the needle is in place. This is to help measure the CSF pressure.\nThe anesthetic will sting or burn when first injected. There will be a hard pressure sensation when the needle is inserted. Often, there is some brief discomfort when the needle goes through the tissue surrounding the spinal cord. This pain should stop in a few seconds.\nIn most cases, the procedure takes about 30 minutes. The actual pressure measurements and CSF collection only take a few minutes.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to measure pressures within the CSF and to collect a sample of the fluid for further testing.\nCSF analysis can be used to diagnose certain neurologic disorders. These may include infections (such as\nmeningitis\n) and brain or spinal cord damage."}
