The ability to perform complex tasks may be adversely affected. Many users report excessive appetite after marijuana use.\nMost states in the United States permit marijuana to be used legally to treat\ncertain medical problems\n. Many states have also decriminalized or legalized its general use.\nSymptoms\nThe intoxicating effects of marijuana include relaxation, sleepiness, and mild euphoria (getting high).\nSmoking marijuana leads to fast and predictable signs and symptoms. Eating marijuana can cause slower, and sometimes less predictable, effects.\nMarijuana can cause undesirable side effects, which increase with higher doses."}

Eating marijuana can cause slower, and sometimes less predictable, effects.\nMarijuana can cause undesirable side effects, which increase with higher doses. These side effects include:\nDecreased short-term memory\nDry mouth\nImpaired perception and motor skills\nRed eyes\nMore serious side effects include panic, paranoia, or acute\npsychosis\n, which may be more common with new users or in those who already have a psychiatric disease.\nThe degree of these side effects varies from person to person, as well as with the amount and strength of marijuana used.\nMarijuana may be contaminated with more dangerous drugs that have more serious side effects than marijuana, but confirmed cases are exceedingly rare, and most reports in the United States have turned out to be false.\nLike other agricultural products, Marijuana may also be contaminated with pesticides, microbes, or heavy metals. These contaminants can have serious side effects.\nTreatment\nTreatment and care involves:\nPreventing injury\nReassuring those who have panic reactions due to the drug\nSedatives, called benzodiazepines, such as diazepam (Valium) or lorazepam (Ativan), may be given."}
