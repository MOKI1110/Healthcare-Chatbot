It occurs due to infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV).\nOther common hepatitis virus infections include\nhepatitis A\nand\nhepatitis B\n.\nCauses\nA child may get HCV from an HCV-infected mother, at the time of birth.\nAlmost 6 out of every 100 infants born to mothers with an HCV infection have hepatitis C. There is no treatment to prevent hepatitis C at birth.\nAdolescents and teens can also get an HCV infection. There are many causes of hepatitis C in teens, including:\nBeing stuck with a needle after use by an HCV-infected person\nComing in contact with the blood of an infected person\nUsing street drugs\nHaving unprotected sexual contact with a person with HCV\nGetting tattoos or acupuncture therapy with infected needles\nHepatitis C does not spread from breastfeeding, hugging, kissing, coughing, or sneezing.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms develop in children about 4 to 12 weeks after infection."}

If the body is able to fight HCV, the symptoms end within a few weeks to 6 months. This condition is called acute hepatitis C infection.\nHowever, some children never get rid of HCV. This condition is called chronic hepatitis C infection.\nMost children with hepatitis C (acute or chronic) do not show any symptoms until more advanced\nliver damage\nis present. If symptoms do occur, they may include:\nPain in the right upper abdomen\nClay-colored or pale stools\nDark urine\nTiredness\nFever\nYellow skin and eyes (\njaundice\n)\nLoss of appetite\nNausea and vomiting\nExams and Tests\nYour child's health care provider will perform blood tests to detect HCV in blood. Two most common blood tests are:\nEnzyme immunoassay (EIA) to find the hepatitis C antibody\nHepatitis C RNA assays to measure virus levels (viral load)\nInfants born to hepatitis C-positive mothers should undergo testing at 18 months of age. This is the time when antibodies from the mother will have decreased."}

This is the time when antibodies from the mother will have decreased. At that time, the test will more truly reflect the baby's antibody status.\nThe following tests detect liver damage from hepatitis C:\nAlbumin level\nLiver function tests\nProthrombin time\nLiver biopsy\nAbdominal ultrasound\nThese tests show how well your child's treatment is working.\nTreatment\nThe main aim of treatment in children is to relieve the symptoms and stop the disease from spreading. If your child has symptoms, make sure that your child:\nGets plenty of rest\nDrinks lots of fluids\nEats healthy food\nAcute hepatitis C does not need any special treatment. However, your child can pass the virus to others. You should take steps to help prevent the disease from spreading.\nChronic hepatitis C needs treatment. The goal of treatment is to prevent complications.\nIf there is no sign of the HCV infection after 6 months, then your child has fully recovered."}

The goal of treatment is to prevent complications.\nIf there is no sign of the HCV infection after 6 months, then your child has fully recovered. However, if your child develops chronic hepatitis C, it can cause liver disease later in life.\nYour child's provider may recommend antiviral medicines for chronic HCV. These medicines:\nHave fewer side effects\nAre easier to take\nAre taken by mouth\nIn 2021, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved sofosbuvir/velpatasvir for the treatment of hepatitis C in children 3 years and older. Children with hepatitis C are not treated with this medicine until they reach age 3 due to concerns of possible toxicity and the low percentage that a child younger than 3 will have significant liver damage from HCV.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nChildren younger than 3 years old may not need any treatment."}

You should also contact your provider if you have hepatitis C and become pregnant.\nPrevention\nThere are no vaccinations for hepatitis C. Therefore, prevention plays an important role in managing the disease.\nIn a household where someone with hepatitis C is living, take these steps to help\nprevent the spread of the disease\n:\nAvoid contact with blood."}
