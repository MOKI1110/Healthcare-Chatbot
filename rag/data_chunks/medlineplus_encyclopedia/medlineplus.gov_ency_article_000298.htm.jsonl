It is caused by the microscopic parasite\nEntamoeba histolytica\n.\nCauses\nE histolytica\ncan live in the large intestine (colon) without causing damage to the intestine. In some cases, it invades the colon wall, causing\ncolitis\n, acute dysentery, or long-term (\nchronic\n) diarrhea. The infection can also spread through the bloodstream to the liver. In rare cases, it can spread to the lungs, brain, or other organs.\nThis condition occurs worldwide. It is most common in tropical areas that have crowded living conditions and poor sanitation."}

Usually, antibiotics are prescribed.\nIf you are vomiting, you may be given medicines through a vein (\nintravenously\n) until you can take them by mouth.
