This is called\nphantom pain\nor phantom limb pain.\nThe joint closest to the part that is amputated loses its range of motion, making it hard to move. This is called joint contracture.\nInfection of the skin or bone.\nThe amputation wound does not heal properly.\nBefore the Procedure\nWhen your amputation is planned, you will be asked to do certain things to prepare for it. Tell your health care provider and surgeon:\nWhat medicines you are taking, even medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\nHow much much tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drugs you have been using\nDuring the days before your surgery, you may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (such as Advil or Motrin), warfarin (Coumadin), and any other medicines that make it hard for your blood to clot.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery."}

For example, remove tripping hazards such as throw rugs.\nEnsure that you will be able to get in and out of your home safely.\nAfter the Procedure\nThe end of your leg (residual limb) will have a dressing and bandage that will remain on for 3 or more days. You may have pain for the first few days. You will be able to take pain medicine as you need them.\nYou may have a tube that drains fluid from the wound. This will be taken out after a few days.\nBefore leaving the hospital, you will begin learning how to:\nUse a wheelchair or a walker.\nStretch your muscles to maintain or improve joint mobility.\nStrengthen your arms and legs.\nBegin walking with a walking aid and parallel bars.\nStart moving around the bed and into the chair in your hospital room.\nSit or lie in different positions to keep your joints from becoming stiff.\nControl swelling in the area around your amputation.\nProperly put weight on your residual limb.

You may not be allowed to put weight on your residual limb until it is fully healed.\nFitting for a prosthesis, a manmade part to replace your limb, may occur when your wound is mostly healed and the surrounding area is no longer tender to the touch.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nYour recovery and ability to function after the amputation depend on many things. Some of these are the reason for the amputation, whether you have diabetes or poor blood flow, and your age. Most people can still be active following amputation. You may feel sad or depressed about the surgery."}
