Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMalignant hyperthermia\nMalignant hyperthermia\nMalignant hyperthermia (MH) is a disease that causes a fast rise in body temperature and severe muscle contractions when someone receives\ngeneral anesthesia\nwith one or more of the following drugs: halothane, isoflurane, sevoflurane, desflurane or succinylcholine. MH is a genetic disorder passed down through families.\nHyperthermia means high body temperature. Malignant hyperthermia is not the same as hyperthermia from other medical emergencies such as\nheat stroke\nor infection.\nCauses\nMH is inherited."}

Malignant hyperthermia is not the same as hyperthermia from other medical emergencies such as\nheat stroke\nor infection.\nCauses\nMH is inherited. Only one parent has to carry the gene for the disease for a child to inherit the condition.\nIt may occur with some other inherited muscle diseases, such as multiminicore myopathy and central core disease.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of MH include:\nBleeding\nDark brown urine (due to a muscle protein called myoglobin in the urine)\nMuscle ache without an obvious cause, such as exercise or injury\nMuscle rigidity\nand stiffness\nRise in body temperature to 105 °F (40.6 °C) or higher\nExams and Tests\nMH is often discovered after a person is given anesthesia during surgery.\nThere may be a family history of MH or unexplained death during anesthesia.\nThe person may have a fast and often\nirregular heart rate\n.\nTests for MH may include:\nBlood clotting studies (\nPT, or prothrombin time\n;\nPTT, or partial thromboplastin time\n)\nBlood chemistry panel, including CK (creatinine kinase, which is higher in the blood when muscle is destroyed during a bout of the illness)\nGenetic testing to look for defects in the genes"}

Wrapping the person in a cooling blanket can help reduce fever and the risk for serious complications.\nTo preserve kidney function during an episode, the person may receive fluids through a vein.\nSupport Groups\nThese resources can provide more information about MH:\nMalignant Hyperthermia Association of the United States --\nwww.mhaus.org\nNational Organization for Rare Disorders --\nrarediseases.org/rare-diseases/malignant-hyperthermia\nUS National Library of Medicine - MedlinePlus website --\nmedlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/malignant-hyperthermia/\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nRepeated or untreated episodes can cause kidney failure."}
