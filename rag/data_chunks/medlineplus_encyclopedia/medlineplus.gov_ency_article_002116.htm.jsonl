Anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or acetaminophen (Tylenol) also help reduce pain and swelling. As the pain decreases, you can use heat on the muscle. Stretching and light exercises to bring blood to the injured area can also be useful. In general, stretching and warm compresses are helpful before exercises. Cooling down and icing the area after exercise can help.\nGet medical help right away if:\nYou have a lot of swelling with the muscle strain.\nYou can't move your arms, legs, or joints.\nYou have swelling that is getting worse as time passes.\nAlternative Names\nTreatment - muscle strain\nImages\nTreatment for leg strain\nReferences\nBiundo JJ.
