Extensive damage to the mouth, throat, eyes, lungs, esophagus, nose, and stomach is possible. The ultimate outcome depends on how much damage there is.\nDamage continues to occur to the esophagus and stomach for several weeks after the poison is swallowed, which can lead to serious infection and failure of multiple organs. Treatment may require the removal of part of the esophagus and stomach.\nIf the poison enters the lungs, serious damage may occur, both immediately and long-term.\nSwallowing the poison may cause death. It may occur as long as a month after the poisoning.\nAlternative Names\nBattery acid poisoning; Hydrogen sulfate poisoning; Oil of vitriol poisoning; Matting acid poisoning; Vitriol brown oil poisoning\nReferences\nClawson A, Quang L."}
