Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBirth control - slow release methods\nBirth control - slow release methods\nCertain birth control methods contain man-made forms of hormones. The natural forms of these hormones are normally made in a woman's ovaries. These hormones are called estrogen and progestin.\nBoth of these hormones prevent a woman's ovaries from releasing an egg. The release of an egg during the menstrual cycle is called ovulation. They do this by changing the levels of the natural hormones the body makes.\nProgestin also helps prevent sperm from entering the uterus by making the mucous around a woman's cervix thick and sticky.\nBirth control pills\nare one way of receiving these hormones. They are only effective if taken daily, preferably at about the same time.\nThere are other methods to prevent pregnancy. The same hormones may be used but they are released slowly over time.\nInformation\nPROGESTIN IMPLANTS\nA progestin implant is a small rod that is implanted under the skin, most often on the inside of the arm."}

The rod releases a small amount of the progestin daily into the bloodstream.\nIt takes about a minute to insert the rod. The procedure is done using a local anesthetic in a health care provider's office. The rod can stay in place for 3 years. However, it can be removed at any time. Removal usually takes only a few minutes.\nAfter the implant has been inserted:\nYou may have some bruising around the site for a week or more.\nYou should be protected from getting pregnant within 1 week.\nYou can use these implants while breastfeeding.\nProgestin implants work better than birth control pills to prevent pregnancy. Very few women who use these implants are likely to get pregnant.\nYour regular menstrual cycles should return within 3 to 4 weeks after these implants are removed.\nPROGESTIN INJECTIONS\nInjections or shots that contain the hormone progestin also work to prevent pregnancy. A single shot works for up to 90 days."}

A single shot works for up to 90 days. These injections are given into the muscles of the upper arm or buttocks.\nSide effects that may occur include:\nChanges in menstrual cycles or extra bleeding or spotting. Around one half of women who use these injections have no menstrual cycles.\nBreast tenderness, weight gain, headaches, or\ndepression\n.\nProgestin injections work better than birth control pills to prevent pregnancy. Very few women who use progestin injections are likely to get pregnant.\nSometimes the effects of these hormone shots last longer than 90 days. If you are planning to become pregnant in the near future, you might want to consider a different birth control method.\nSKIN PATCH\nThe skin patch is placed on your shoulder, buttocks, or another area of your body. A new patch is applied once a week for 3 weeks. Then you go 1 week without a patch.\nEstrogen levels are higher with the patch than with birth control pills or the vaginal ring."}

Smoking increases these risks even more.\nVAGINAL RING\nThe vaginal ring is a flexible device. This ring is about 2 inches (5 cm) wide and is placed into the vagina. It releases the hormones progestin and estrogen.\nYour provider will prescribe this method, but you will insert the ring yourself.\nIt will stay in your vagina for 3 weeks."}

It is inserted into the uterus. IUDs prevent sperm from fertilizing an egg.\nA newer type of IUD releases a low dose of a hormone into the uterus each day for a period of 3 to 8 years. This increases the effectiveness of the device as a birth control method. It also has the added benefits of reducing or stopping menstrual flow. It may help protect against cancer (endometrial cancer) in women who are at risk of developing the disease. There are several different IUDs of this type. Some are specially shaped for women who have never been pregnant.\nYou have choices for what type of IUD to have.
