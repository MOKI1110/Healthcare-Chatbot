The health care provider sits directly in front of you. You will cover one eye, and stare straight ahead, usually at the provider's eye, with the other. You will be asked to tell when you can see the examiner's hand.\nTangent screen or Goldmann field exam.\nYou will sit about 3 feet (90 centimeters) away from a flat, black fabric screen with a target in the center. You will be asked to stare at the center target and let the examiner know when you can see an object that moves into your side vision. The object is usually a pin or bead on the end of a black stick that is moved by the examiner. This exam creates a map of your central 30 degrees of vision."}

This exam is usually used to detect brain or nerve (neurologic) problems.\nGoldmann perimetry and Automated perimetry.\nFor either test, you sit in front of a concave dome and stare at a target in the middle. You press a button when you see small flashes of light in your peripheral vision. With Goldmann testing, the flashes are controlled and mapped out by the examiner. With automated testing, a computer controls the flashes and mapping. Your responses help determine if you have a defect in your visual field. Both tests are often used to track conditions that may worsen over time, such as glaucoma.\nYour provider will discuss with you the type of visual field testing to be done.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThere is no discomfort with visual field testing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis eye exam will show whether you have a loss of vision anywhere in your visual field."}
