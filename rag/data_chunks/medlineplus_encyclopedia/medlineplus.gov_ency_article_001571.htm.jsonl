Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHydrocephalus\nHydrocephalus\nHydrocephalus is a buildup of fluid inside the skull that leads to the brain pushing against the skull.\nHydrocephalus means \"water on the brain.\"\nCauses\nHydrocephalus is due to a problem with the flow of the fluid that surrounds the brain. This fluid is called the cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF. The fluid surrounds the brain and spinal cord and helps cushion the brain.\nCSF normally moves through the brain and around the spinal cord, and then is absorbed into the bloodstream. CSF levels in the brain can rise if:\nThe flow of CSF is blocked.\nThe fluid does not get properly absorbed into the blood.\nThe brain makes too much of the fluid.\nToo much CSF puts pressure on the brain. This pushes the brain up against the skull and damages brain tissue.\nHydrocephalus may begin while the baby is growing in the womb."}

It is common in babies who have a\nmyelomeningocele\n, a birth defect in which the spinal column does not close properly.\nHydrocephalus may also be due to:\nGenetic defects\nCertain infections during pregnancy\nIn young children, hydrocephalus may be due to:\nInfections that affect the central nervous system (such as meningitis or encephalitis), especially in infants.\nBleeding in the brain during or soon after delivery (especially in premature babies).\nInjury before, during, or after childbirth, including subarachnoid hemorrhage.\nTumors of the central nervous system, including the brain or spinal cord.\nInjury or trauma.\nHydrocephalus most often occurs in children. Another type, called\nnormal pressure hydrocephalus\n, may occur in adults and older people.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of hydrocephalus depend on:\nAge\nAmount of brain damage\nWhat is causing the buildup of CSF fluid\nIn infants, hydrocephalus causes the\nfontanelle\n(soft spot) to bulge and the head to be larger than expected."}

Other tests that may be done include:\nArteriography\nBrain scan using radioisotopes\nCranial ultrasound (an ultrasound of the brain)\nLumbar puncture\nand examination of the cerebrospinal fluid (rarely done)\nSkull x-rays\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to reduce or prevent brain damage by improving the flow of CSF.\nSurgery may be done to remove a blockage, if possible.\nIf not, a flexible tube called a shunt may be placed in the brain to reroute the flow of CSF. The shunt sends CSF to another part of the body, such as the belly area, where it can be absorbed.\nOther treatments may include:\nAntibiotics if there are signs of infection. Severe infections may require the shunt to be removed.\nA procedure called endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV), which relieves pressure without replacing the shunt.\nRemoving or burning away (\ncauterizing\n) the parts of the brain that produce CSF.\nThe child will need regular check-ups to make sure there are no further problems."}

Those who survive will have different amounts of intellectual, physical, and neurological disabilities.\nThe outlook depends on the cause. Hydrocephalus that is not due to an infection has the best outlook. People with hydrocephalus caused by tumors will often do very poorly.\nMost children with hydrocephalus who survive for 1 year will have a fairly normal lifespan.\nPossible Complications\nThe shunt may become blocked. Symptoms of such a blockage include headache and vomiting."}
