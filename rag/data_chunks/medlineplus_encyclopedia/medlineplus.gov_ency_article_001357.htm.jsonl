It is caused by the bacterium\nMycobacterium marinum\n(\nM marinum\n).\nCauses\nM marinum\nbacteria can live in fresh and salt water, unchlorinated swimming pools, and aquarium tanks. The bacteria can enter the body through a break in the skin, such as a cut, when you come into contact with water that contains this bacteria.\nSigns of a skin infection usually appear about 2 to 3 weeks after exposure, but symptoms may appear later, up to a month or more.\nRisks include exposure of skin cuts or scrapes to swimming pools, aquariums, or fish or amphibians that are infected with the bacteria. As a result, people who fish or maintain aquariums and fish tanks are at higher risk.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom is a reddish to purple bump (\npapule\n) that slowly grows into a purplish and painful\nnodule\n.\nThe elbows, fingers, and back of the hands are the most commonly affected body parts."}

The knees and legs are other areas affected.\nThe nodules may break down, ulcerate, and leave an open sore. Sometimes, they spread up through the lymph nodes of the limb, creating additional bumps in a line, but more often remain as a solitary nodule.\nSince the bacteria cannot survive at the warmer temperature of the internal organs, they usually stay in the skin, causing the nodules.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms. You may also be asked if you recently swam in a pool or handled fish or amphibians.\nTests to diagnose swimming pool granuloma include:\nSkin test\nor blood test to check for tuberculosis infection, which may look similar\nSkin punch biopsy\nand culture\nX-ray or other imaging tests for infection that has spread to the joint or bone\nTreatment\nAntibiotics are used to treat this infection."}

They are chosen based on the results of the culture and skin biopsy.\nYou may need several months of treatment with more than one antibiotic. Surgery may also be needed to remove dead tissue if the lesions do not clear with antibiotics. This helps the wound heal.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSwimming pool granulomas can be cured with antibiotics, or they may heal on their own. They often leave a scar.\nPossible Complications\nTendon, joint, or bone infections sometimes occur. The disease may be harder to treat in people whose immune system is not working well.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop reddish bumps on your skin that do not clear with home treatment.\nPrevention\nWash hands and arms thoroughly after cleaning aquariums. Or, wear rubber gloves when cleaning.\nAlternative Names\nAquarium granuloma; Fish tank granuloma; Mycobacterium marinum infection\nReferences\nBrown-Elliott BA, Wallace RJ."}
