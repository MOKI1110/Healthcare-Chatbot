Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBiliary atresia\nBiliary atresia\nBiliary atresia is a blockage in the tubes (ducts) that carry a liquid called bile from the liver to the gallbladder.\nCauses\nBiliary atresia occurs when the bile ducts inside or outside the liver are abnormally narrow, blocked, or absent. The bile ducts carry a digestive fluid from liver to small bowel to break down fats and filter out waste from the body.\nThe cause of the disease is not clear. It may be due to:\nViral infection after birth\nExposure to toxic substances\nMultiple genetic factors\nPerinatal injury\nSome medicines such as carbamazepine\nIt more commonly affects people of East Asian and African-American descent.\nThe bile ducts help remove waste from the liver and carry salts that help the small intestine break down (digest) fat.\nIn babies with biliary atresia, bile flow from the liver to the gallbladder is blocked. This can lead to liver damage and cirrhosis of the liver, which can be deadly.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms usually start to occur between 2 to 8 weeks."}

This can lead to liver damage and cirrhosis of the liver, which can be deadly.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms usually start to occur between 2 to 8 weeks. Jaundice (a yellow color to the skin and mucus membranes) develops slowly 2 to 3 weeks after birth. The infant may gain weight normally for the first month. After that point, the baby will lose weight and become irritable, and will have worsening jaundice.\nOther symptoms may include:\nDark urine\nSwollen belly\nFoul-smelling\nand\nfloating stools\nPale or clay-colored stools\nSlow growth\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will take medical history of your child and do a physical exam to check for enlarged liver.\nTests to diagnose biliary atresia include:\nAbdominal x-ray\nto check for enlarged liver and spleen\nAbdominal ultrasound\nto check internal organs\nBlood tests to check total and direct bilirubin levels\nHepatobiliary scintigraphy or HIDA scan to check whether the bile ducts and gallbladder are working properly\nLiver biopsy\nto check the severity of cirrhosis or to rule out other causes of jaundice\nX-ray of the bile ducts (cholangiogram) to check if the bile ducts are opened or close"}

The abnormal ducts are bypassed. The surgery is more successful if done before the baby is 8 weeks old.\nLiver transplant may still be needed before 20 years of age in most of the cases.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nEarly surgery will improve the survival of more than one third of babies with this condition."}
