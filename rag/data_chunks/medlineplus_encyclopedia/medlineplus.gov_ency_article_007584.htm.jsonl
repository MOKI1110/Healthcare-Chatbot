The camera is called an arthroscope. The procedure allows your surgeon to detect problems and make repairs to your ankle without making larger cuts in the skin and tissue. This means that you may have less pain and recover more quickly than open surgery.\nDescription\nYou may receive general anesthesia before this surgery. This means you will be asleep and unable to feel pain. Or, you may have regional anesthesia. This means your leg and ankle area will be numbed so that you do not feel any pain. If you receive regional anesthesia, you will also be given medicine to make you very sleepy during the operation.\nDuring the procedure, the surgeon does the following:\nInserts the arthroscope into your ankle through a small incision. The scope is connected to a video monitor in the operating room. This allows the surgeon to view the inside of your ankle.\nInspects all the tissues of your ankle."}

The scope is connected to a video monitor in the operating room. This allows the surgeon to view the inside of your ankle.\nInspects all the tissues of your ankle. These tissues include cartilage, bones, tendons, and ligaments.\nRepairs any damaged tissues. To do this, your surgeon makes 1 to 3 more small incisions and inserts other instruments through them. A tear in a muscle, tendon, or cartilage is fixed. Any damaged tissue is removed.\nAt the end of the surgery, the incisions will be closed with stitches and covered with a dressing (bandage). Most surgeons take pictures from the video monitor during the procedure to show you what they found and what repairs they made.\nYour surgeon may need to do open surgery if there is a lot of damage. Open surgery means you will have a large incision so that the surgeon can get directly to your bones and tissues.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nArthroscopy may be recommended for these ankle problems:\nAnkle pain --\nArthroscopy allows the surgeon to explore what is causing your ankle pain.\nLigament tears --\nA ligament is a band of tissue that connects bone to bone."}

Several ligaments in the ankle help keep it stable and allow it to move. Torn ligaments can be repaired or cleaned up with this type of surgery.\nAnkle impingement --\nTissues in your ankle can become swollen and sore from overuse. This makes it hard to move the joint. Arthroscopy can remove the tissue so you can move your joint.\nScar tissue --\nThis can form after an injury to the ankle. This surgery can remove scar tissue.\nArthritis\n--\nArthroscopy can be used to help reduce pain and improve movement.\nCartilage injuries --\nThis surgery can be used to diagnose or repair cartilage and bone injuries.\nLoose fragments --\nThese are pieces of bone or cartilage inside the ankle that can cause the joint to lock up."}

This includes medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\nDuring the 2 weeks before your surgery:\nYou may be asked to temporarily stop taking blood thinners."}

Ask your provider or nurse for help. Smoking can slow wound and bone healing.\nTell your surgeon if you develop a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness before your surgery. If you do get sick, the procedure may need to be postponed.\nOn the day of surgery:\nFollow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking before the procedure.\nTake any medicines you're asked to take with a small sip of water.\nFollow instructions on when to arrive at the hospital."}

These may include:\nKeep your ankle elevated above your heart for 2 to 3 days to help reduce swelling and pain. You can also apply a cold pack to reduce swelling.\nKeep your bandage clean and dry. Follow instructions for how to change the dressing.\nYou can take pain relievers, if needed, as long as your provider says it is safe to do so.\nYou will need to use a walker or crutches and keep weight off your foot unless your provider says it is OK to put weight on your foot.\nYou may need to wear a splint or boot for a few weeks or longer to keep the ankle stable as it heals.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nArthroscopy uses small cuts in the skin."}

But, if a lot of tissue in your ankle had to be repaired, it may take several weeks to heal. How quickly you heal depends on how complicated the surgery was.\nYou may be shown how to do gentle exercises as you heal. Or, your surgeon may recommend that you see a physical therapist to help you regain the full use of your ankle.\nAlternative Names\nAnkle surgery; Arthroscopy - ankle; Surgery - ankle - arthroscopy; Surgery - ankle - arthroscopic\nReferences\nMurphy GA.
