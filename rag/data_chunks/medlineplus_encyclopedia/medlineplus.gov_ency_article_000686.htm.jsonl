It is caused by injury to or pressure on the sciatic nerve. Sciatica is a symptom of a medical problem. It is not a medical condition by itself.\nCauses\nSciatica occurs when there is pressure on or damage to the sciatic nerve. This nerve starts in the lower back and runs down the back of each leg. This nerve regulates the muscles of the back of the knee and lower leg. It also provides sensation to the back of the thigh, the outer and back part of the lower leg, and the sole of the foot.\nCommon causes of sciatica include:\nSlipped or herniated disk\nSpinal stenosis\nPiriformis syndrome\n(a pain disorder involving the narrow muscle in the buttocks)\nPelvic injury or fracture\nTumors\nSpondylolisthesis\nMen age 30 and 50 years are more likely to have sciatica.\nSymptoms\nSciatica pain can vary widely. It may feel like a mild tingling, dull ache, or burning sensation. In some cases, the pain is severe enough to make a person unable to move.\nThe pain most often occurs on one side of the body."}

It may feel like a mild tingling, dull ache, or burning sensation. In some cases, the pain is severe enough to make a person unable to move.\nThe pain most often occurs on one side of the body. Some people have sharp pain in one part of the leg or hip and numbness in other parts. The pain or numbness may also be felt on the back of the calf or on the sole of the foot. The affected leg may feel weak. Sometimes, your foot gets caught on the ground when walking.\nThe pain may start slowly. It may get worse:\nAfter standing or sitting\nDuring certain times of the day, such as at night\nWhen sneezing, coughing, or laughing,  especially if caused by a herniated disk\nWhen bending backward or walking more than a few yards or meters, especially if caused by spinal stenosis\nWhen straining or holding your breath, such as during a bowel movement\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

If tests are ordered, they may include:\nX-ray\n,\nMRI\n, or other imaging tests of the spine\nBlood tests\nTreatment\nAs sciatica is a symptom of a more specific medical condition, the underlying cause should be identified and treated.\nIn most cases, no surgical treatment is required and recovery occurs with conservative treatment.\nConservative (non-surgical) treatment is best in many cases. Your provider may recommend the following steps to reduce your symptoms:\nTake over-the-counter pain relievers such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB) or acetaminophen (Tylenol).\nApply heat or ice to the painful area."}

Include exercises to strengthen your abdominal (core) muscles and improve the flexibility of your spine.\nReduce your activity for the first couple of days. Then, slowly start your usual activities.\nDo not do heavy lifting or twisting of your back for the first 6 weeks after the pain begins.\nYour provider may also suggest physical therapy  to help you learn an exercise program. Additional treatments depend on the condition that is causing the sciatica.\nIf these measures do not help, your provider may recommend\ninjections\nof certain medicines to reduce swelling around the nerve. Other medicines may be prescribed to help reduce the stabbing pains due to nerve irritation.\nNerve pain may be very difficult to treat."}
