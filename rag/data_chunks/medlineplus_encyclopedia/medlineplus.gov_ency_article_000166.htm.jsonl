It can occur in the days or weeks following a\nheart attack\n.\nCauses\nTwo types of\npericarditis\ncan occur after a heart attack.\nEarly pericarditis:\nThis form most often occurs within 1 to 3 days after a heart attack. Inflammation and swelling develop as the body tries to clean up the damaged heart tissue.\nLate pericarditis:\nThis is also called Dressler syndrome. It is also called post-cardiac injury syndrome or postcardiotomy pericarditis. It most often develops several weeks or months after a heart attack, heart surgery, or other trauma to the heart. It can also happen about a week after a heart injury."}

It most often develops several weeks or months after a heart attack, heart surgery, or other trauma to the heart. It can also happen about a week after a heart injury. Dressler syndrome is thought to occur when the immune system attacks healthy heart tissue by mistake.\nThings that put you at higher risk for pericarditis include:\nA previous heart attack\nOpen heart surgery\nChest trauma\nA heart attack that has affected the full thickness of your heart muscle\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nAnxiety\nChest pain\nfrom the swollen pericardium rubbing on the heart. The pain may be sharp, tight or crushing and may move to the neck, shoulder, or abdomen. The pain may also be worse when you breathe and go away when you lean forward, stand, or sit up.\nTrouble breathing\nDry\ncough\nFast heart rate\n(tachycardia)\nFatigue\nFever\n(common with the second type of pericarditis)\nMalaise\n(general ill feeling)\nSplinting of ribs (bending over or holding the chest) with deep breathing\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will listen to your heart and lungs with a stethoscope."}

There may be a rubbing sound (called a pericardial friction rub, not to be confused with a heart murmur).\nHeart sounds\nin general may be weak or sound far away.\nA buildup of fluid in the covering of the heart or space around the lungs (pericardial effusion) is not common after a heart attack. But, it often does occur in some people with Dressler syndrome.\nTests may include:\nCardiac injury markers (CK-MB and\ntroponin\nmay help tell\npericarditis\nfrom a heart attack)\nChest CT scan\nChest MRI\nChest x-ray\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG)\nEchocardiogram\nESR\n(sedimentation rate) or\nC-reactive protein\n(measures of inflammation)\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to make the heart work better and reduce pain and other symptoms.\nAspirin may be used to treat inflammation of the pericardium. A drug called colchicine is often used as well.\nIn some cases, excess fluid surrounding the heart (pericardial effusion) may need to be removed."}
