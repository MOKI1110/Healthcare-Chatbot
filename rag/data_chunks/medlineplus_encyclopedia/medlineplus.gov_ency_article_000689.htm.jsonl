It occurs when there is damage to the axillary nerve. This is the nerve that helps control the deltoid muscles of the shoulder and the skin around it. A problem with just one nerve, such as the axillary nerve, is called\nmononeuropathy\n.\nThe usual causes are:\nDirect injury\nLong-term pressure on the nerve\nPressure on the nerve from nearby body structures (entrapment)\nShoulder injury\nEntrapment creates pressure on the nerve where it passes through a narrow structure.\nThe damage can destroy the myelin sheath that covers the nerve or part of the nerve cell (the axon)."}

The problem may get better on its own. The rate of recovery is different for everyone. It can take many months to recover.\nAnti-inflammatory medicines may be given if you have any of the following:\nSudden symptoms\nSmall changes in sensation or movement\nNo history of injury to the area\nNo signs of nerve damage\nThese medicines reduce swelling and pressure on the nerve."}

Make sure casts, splints, and other appliances fit properly."}
