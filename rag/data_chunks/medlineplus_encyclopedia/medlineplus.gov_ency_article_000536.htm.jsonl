Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPolycythemia - newborn\nPolycythemia - newborn\nPolycythemia can occur when there are too many red blood cells (RBCs) in an infant's blood.\nCauses\nThe percentage of RBCs in the infant's blood is called the \"hematocrit.\" When this is greater than 65%, polycythemia is present.\nPolycythemia can result from conditions that develop before birth. These may include:\nDelay in clamping the umbilical cord\nDiabetes in the baby's birth mother\nInherited diseases and genetic problems\nToo little oxygen reaching body tissues (hypoxia), such as from congenital heart or vascular abnormalities\nTwin-twin transfusion syndrome\n(occurs when blood moves from one twin to the other)\nThe extra RBCs can slow or block the flow of blood in the smallest blood vessels. This is called hyperviscosity. This may lead to tissue death from lack of oxygen."}

This is called hyperviscosity. This may lead to tissue death from lack of oxygen. This blocked blood flow can affect all organs, including the kidneys, lungs, and brain.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nExtreme sleepiness\nFeeding problems\nSeizures\nExams and Tests\nThere may be signs of breathing problems, kidney failure, low blood sugar, or\nnewborn jaundice\n.\nIf the baby has symptoms of hyperviscosity, a blood test to count the number of RBCs will be done. This test is called a\nhematocrit\n.\nOther tests may include:\nBlood gases to check oxygen level in the blood\nBlood sugar (glucose) to check for low blood sugar\nBlood urea nitrogen (BUN), a substance that forms when protein breaks down\nCreatinine\nUrinalysis\nBilirubin\nTreatment\nThe baby will be monitored for complications of hyperviscosity. Fluids may be given through the vein. A partial volume exchange transfusion is sometimes still done in some cases. However, there is little evidence that this is effective."}

It is most important to treat the underlying cause of the polycythemia.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook is good for infants with mild hyperviscosity. Good results are also possible in infants who receive treatment for severe hyperviscosity. The outlook will depend largely on the reason for the condition.\nSome children may have mild developmental changes. Parents should contact their health care provider if they think their child shows signs of delayed development.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nDeath of intestinal tissue (necrotizing enterocolitis)\nDecreased fine motor control\nKidney failure\nSeizures\nStrokes\nAlternative Names\nNeonatal polycythemia; Hyperviscosity - newborn\nImages\nBlood cells\nReferences\nKliegman RM, St. Geme JW, Blum NJ, Shah SS, Tasker RC, Wilson KM.
