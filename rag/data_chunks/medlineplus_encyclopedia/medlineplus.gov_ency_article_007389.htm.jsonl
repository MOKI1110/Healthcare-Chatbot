Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLaminectomy\nLaminectomy\nLaminectomy is surgery to remove the lamina. This is part of the bone that makes up a vertebra in the spine. Laminectomy may also be done to remove bone spurs or a\nherniated (slipped) disk\nin your spine. The procedure can take pressure off your spinal nerves or spinal cord.\nDescription\nLaminectomy opens up your spinal canal so your spinal nerves have more room. It may be done along with a\ndiskectomy\n,\nforaminotomy\n, or\nspinal fusion\n. You will be asleep and feel no pain (\ngeneral anesthesia\n).\nDuring surgery:\nYou usually lie on your belly on the operating table. The surgeon makes an incision (cut) in the middle of your back or neck.\nThe skin, muscles, and ligaments are moved to the side."}

Your surgeon may use a surgical microscope to see inside your back.\nPart or all of the lamina bones may be removed on both sides of your spine, along with the spinous process, the sharp part of your spine that you can feel.\nYour surgeon may remove any small disk fragments, bone spurs, or other soft tissue.\nYour surgeon may also do a foraminotomy at this time to widen the opening where nerve roots travel out of the spine.\nYour surgeon may do a spinal fusion to make sure your spinal column is stable after surgery.\nThe muscles and other tissues are put back in place. The skin is sewn together.\nThe surgery takes 1 to 3 hours.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nLaminectomy is often done to treat\nspinal stenosis\n(narrowing of the spinal column)."}
