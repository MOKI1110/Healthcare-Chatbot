These changes may include limiting fluids, eating a low-protein diet, limiting salt, potassium, phosphorous, and other\nelectrolytes\n, and getting enough calories if you are losing weight.\nYou may need to alter your diet more if your kidney disease gets worse, or if you need\ndialysis\n.\nFunction\nThe purpose of this diet is to keep the levels of electrolytes, minerals, and fluid in your body balanced when you have CKD or are on dialysis.\nPeople on dialysis need this special diet to limit the buildup of waste products in the body. Limiting fluid intake between dialysis treatments is very important because most people on dialysis urinate very little. Without urination, fluid will build up in the body and cause too much fluid in the heart and lungs.\nRecommendations\nAsk your health care provider to refer you to a registered dietitian to help you with your diet for kidney disease."}

Some dietitians specialize in kidney diets. Your dietitian can also help you create a diet to fit your other health needs.\nThe Kidney Foundation has chapters in most states. It is a good place for people with kidney disease and their families to find programs and information. You need to take in enough calories each day to keep you healthy and prevent the breakdown of body tissue. Ask your provider and dietitian what your ideal weight should be. Weigh yourself every morning to make sure you are meeting this goal.\nCARBOHYDRATES\nIf you do not have a problem eating carbohydrates, these foods are a good source of energy. If your provider has recommended a low-protein diet, you may replace the calories from protein with:\nFruits, breads, grains, and vegetables. These foods provide energy, as well as fiber, minerals, and vitamins.\nHard candies, sugar, honey, and jelly."}

If needed, you can even eat high-calorie desserts such as pies, cakes, or cookies, as long as you limit desserts made with dairy, chocolate, nuts, or bananas.\nFATS\nFats can be a good source of calories. Make sure to use monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats (olive oil, canola oil, safflower oil) to protect your heart health. Talk to your provider or dietitian about fats and cholesterol that may increase your risk for heart problems.\nPROTEIN\nLow-protein diets may be helpful before you start dialysis. Your provider or dietitian may advise a lower-protein diet based on your weight, stage of disease, how much muscle you have, and other factors. But you still need enough protein, so work with your provider to find the right diet for you.\nOnce you start dialysis, you will need to eat more protein. A high-protein diet with fish, poultry, pork, or eggs at every meal may be recommended.\nPeople on dialysis should eat 8 to 10 ounces (225 to 280 grams) of high-protein foods each day."}

Your provider or dietitian may suggest adding egg whites, egg white powder, or protein powder.\nCALCIUM AND PHOSPHOROUS\nThe minerals calcium and phosphorous will be checked often. Even in the early stages of CKD, phosphorous levels in the blood can get too high. This can cause:\nLow blood calcium. This causes the body to pull calcium from your bones, which can make your bones weaker and more likely to break.\nItching.\nYou will need to limit the amount of dairy foods you eat, because they contain large amounts of phosphorous. This includes milk, yogurt, and cheese. Some dairy foods are lower in phosphorous, including:\nTub margarine\nButter\nCream, ricotta, brie cheese\nHeavy cream\nSherbet\nNondairy whipped toppings\nYou may need to take calcium supplements to prevent bone disease, and vitamin D to control the balance of calcium and phosphorous in your body."}

Ask your provider or dietitian about how best to get these nutrients.\nYour provider may recommend medicines called \"phosphorous binders\" if diet changes alone do not work to control the balance of this mineral in your body.\nFLUIDS\nIn the early stages of kidney failure, you do not need to limit the fluid you drink. But, as your condition gets worse, or when you are on dialysis, you will need to watch the amount of liquid you take in.\nIn between dialysis sessions, fluid can build up in your body. Too much fluid will lead to shortness of breath, an emergency that needs immediate medical attention.\nYour provider and dialysis nurse will let you know how much you should drink every day."}

Most other herbs are safe, and you can use them to flavor your food instead of salt.\nDO NOT use salt substitutes because they contain potassium.
