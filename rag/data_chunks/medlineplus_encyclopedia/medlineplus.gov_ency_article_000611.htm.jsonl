Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nQ fever\nQ fever\nQ fever is an infectious disease caused by bacteria spread by domestic and wild animals and\nticks\n.\nCauses\nQ fever is caused by the bacteria\nCoxiella burnetii\n, which live in domestic animals such as cattle, sheep, goats, birds, and cats. Some wild animals and ticks also carry these bacteria.\nYou can get Q fever by drinking raw (unpasteurized) milk, or after breathing in dust or droplets in the air that are contaminated with infected animal feces, blood, or birth products.\nPeople at risk for infection include slaughterhouse workers, veterinarians, researchers, food processors, and sheep and cattle workers. Men are infected more often than women. Most people who get Q fever are age 30 to 70 years.\nIn rare cases, the disease affects children, especially those who live on a farm. In infected children younger than 3 years old, Q fever is usually noticed while looking for the cause of\npneumonia\n.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms usually develop 2 to 3 weeks after coming in contact with the bacteria. This time is called the incubation period."}

If symptoms occur, they may last for several weeks.\nCommon symptoms may include:\nDry cough (nonproductive)\nFever\nHeadache\nJoint pain\n(arthralgia)\nMuscle pains\nOther symptoms that may develop include:\nAbdominal pain\nChest pain\nJaundice\n(yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)\nRash\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam may reveal abnormal sounds (crackles) in the lungs or an\nenlarged liver\nor spleen."}

In the late stages of the disease, a\nheart murmur\nmay be heard.\nTests that may be done include:\nchest x-ray\nto detect pneumonia or other changes in the lungs\nBlood tests to check for antibodies to\nCoxiella burnetti\nLiver function test\nComplete blood count\n(CBC) with differential\nTissue staining of infected tissues to identify the bacteria\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG) or\nechocardiogram\n(echo) to look at the heart for damage caused by the\nCoxiella burnetti\nbacteria\nTreatment\nTreatment with antibiotics can shorten the length of the illness. Antibiotics that are commonly used include tetracycline and doxycycline. Pregnant women or children who still have any baby teeth should avoid tetracycline by mouth because it can permanently discolor growing teeth.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people get better with treatment. However, complications can be very serious and sometimes even life threatening."}

However, complications can be very serious and sometimes even life threatening. Q fever should always be treated if it causes symptoms.\nPossible Complications\nIn rare cases, Q fever causes a heart infection (\nendocarditis\n) that can lead to severe symptoms or even death if untreated. Other complications can include:\nBone infection (\nosteomyelitis\n)\nBrain infection (\nencephalitis\n)\nLiver infection (chronic hepatitis)\nLung infection (pneumonia)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you develop symptoms of Q fever. Also contact your provider if you have been treated for Q fever and symptoms return or new symptoms develop.\nPrevention\nPasteurization of milk destroys the bacteria that cause early Q fever. Domestic animals should be inspected for signs of Q fever if people exposed to them have developed symptoms of the disease.\nAlternative Names\nQuery fever\nImages\nTemperature measurement\nReferences\nFournier P-E, Raoult D.
