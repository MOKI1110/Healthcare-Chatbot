Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nStereotactic radiosurgery - Gamma Knife\nStereotactic radiosurgery - Gamma Knife\nStereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a form of radiation therapy that focuses high-power energy on a small area of the body.\nDespite its name, radiosurgery is not actually a surgical procedure -- there is no cutting or sewing, rather it is a radiation therapy treatment technique.\nMore than one commercially available system\nis used to perform radiosurgery. This article is about Gamma Knife radiosurgery.\nDescription\nThe Gamma Knife radiosurgery system is used to treat either cancers or growths in the head or upper spine area. For cancers or growths lower down in the spine or anywhere else in the body, another focused radiosurgery system may be used.\nBefore treatment, you may be fitted with a \"head frame\" or a mask (frameless system). The frame is a metal circle that is used to precisely position you into the Gamma Knife machine to improve accuracy and pinpoint targeting. The frame is attached to your scalp and skull."}

The frame is a metal circle that is used to precisely position you into the Gamma Knife machine to improve accuracy and pinpoint targeting. The frame is attached to your scalp and skull. The process is performed by a neurosurgeon, but does not require cutting or sewing. Some Gamma Knife procedures do not need a head frame; they use a face mask or net, and they are called \"frameless.\" When a frame is used, here is what you should know:\nThe head frame is placed over your head, and four small pins are attached to your skull. The pins are designed to hold the head frame in place by going through the skin into the surface of your skull.\nYou are given a local anesthetic and should not feel pain, but rather only pressure. You also are usually given medicine to help relax you during the fitting procedure.\nThe frame will remain attached for the whole treatment procedure, usually a few hours, and then will be removed.\nWhether or not a frame is attached to your head, imaging tests such as\nCT\n,\nMRI\n, or\nangiogram\nare done."}

The images show the exact location, size, and shape of your tumor or problem area and allow precision targeting.\nAfter the imaging, you will be brought to a room to rest while your health care providers and medical physics team prepare the computer plan. This planning involves drawing the contours of the area to be irradiated while preserving the normal tissue. It may take approximately 45 minutes to an hour. Next, you will be brought to the treatment room.\nDuring treatment:\nYou will not need to be put to sleep. You will get medicine to help you relax. The treatment itself does not cause pain.\nYou lie on a table that slides into a machine that delivers radiation.\nThe head frame or face mask aligns with the machine, which has a helmet with holes to deliver small precise beams of radiation directly to the target.\nThe machine may move your head slightly so that the energy beams are delivered to the exact spots that need treatment.\nYour providers are in another room."}

Most often, no more than 5 sessions are needed.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nHighly focused radiation beams using the Gamma Knife system target and destroy an abnormal area.

Compared with other types of radiation therapy, some believe that Gamma Knife radiosurgery, because it delivers pinpoint treatment, is less likely to damage nearby healthy tissue.\nAfter radiation to the brain, local swelling, called edema, may occur, sometimes months after the procedure. You may be given medicine before and after the procedure to lower this risk, but it is still possible. The swelling usually goes away without further treatment. In rare cases, hospitalization and surgery with incisions (open surgery) is needed to treat the brain swelling caused by the radiation.  Common symptoms of local swelling are headaches and nausea, as well as somnolence.\nThere are rare cases of swelling causing people to have problems breathing, and there are reports of fatalities after radiosurgery.\nWhile this type of treatment is less invasive than open surgery, it still has risks."}

This should go away with time. There may be some bruising.\nBefore the Procedure\nThe day before your procedure:\nDo not use any hair cream or hair spray.\nDo not eat or drink anything after midnight unless told otherwise by your provider.\nThe day of your procedure:\nWear comfortable clothing.\nBring your regular prescription medicines with you to the hospital.\nDo not wear jewelry, makeup, nail polish, or a wig or hairpiece.\nYou will be asked to remove contact lenses, eyeglasses, and dentures.\nYou will change into a hospital gown.\nAn intravenous (\nIV\n) line will be placed into your arm to deliver contrast material, medicines, and fluids.\nAfter the Procedure\nOften, you can go home the same day of treatment."}

Arrange ahead of time for someone to drive you home, because the medicines you are given can make you drowsy. You can go back to your regular activities the next day if there are no complications, such as swelling. If you have complications, or your provider believes it is required, you may need to stay in the hospital overnight for monitoring.\nFollow instructions given to you by your nurses for how to\ncare for yourself at home\n.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe effects of Gamma Knife radiosurgery may take weeks or months to be seen. The prognosis depends on the condition being treated.
