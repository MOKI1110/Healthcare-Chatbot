Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nVenous insufficiency\nVenous insufficiency\nVenous insufficiency is a condition in which the veins have problems sending blood from the legs back to the heart.\nCauses\nNormally, valves in your deeper leg veins keep blood moving forward toward the heart. With long-term (chronic) venous insufficiency, vein walls are weakened and valves are damaged. This causes the\nveins to stay filled with blood\n, especially when you are standing.\nChronic venous insufficiency is a long-term condition. It is most commonly due to malfunctioning (incompetent) valves in the veins."}
