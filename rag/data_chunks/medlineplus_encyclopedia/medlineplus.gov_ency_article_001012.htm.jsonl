It affects the eyelids, eyebrows, and cheeks. It may begin suddenly or be a result of an infection that gradually becomes worse.\nCauses\nOrbital cellulitis is a dangerous infection, which can cause lasting problems. Orbital cellulitis is different than\nperiorbital cellulitis\n, which is an infection of the eyelid or skin around the eye.\nIn children, it often starts out as a sinus infection from bacteria such as\nHaemophilus influenza.\nThe infection used to be more common in young children, under the age of 7. It is now rare due to a vaccine that helps prevent this infection.\nThe bacteria\nStaphylococcus aureus\n,\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n, and beta-hemolytic streptococci may also cause orbital cellulitis.\nOrbital cellulitis infections in children may get worse very quickly and can lead to visual difficulties or blindness."}
