Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTransposition of the great arteries\nTransposition of the great arteries\nTransposition of the great arteries (TGA) is a heart defect that occurs from birth (\ncongenital\n). The two major arteries that carry blood away from the heart -- the aorta and the pulmonary artery -- are switched (transposed).\nCauses\nThe cause of TGA is unknown. It is not associated with any one common genetic abnormality. It rarely occurs in other family members.\nTGA is a\ncyanotic heart defect\n. This means there is decreased oxygen in the blood that is pumped from the heart to the rest of the body.\nIn normal hearts, blood that returns from the body goes through the right side of the heart and pulmonary artery to the lungs to get oxygen. The blood then comes back to the left side of the heart and travels out the aorta to the body.\nIn TGA, venous blood returns normally to the heart through the right atrium. But, instead of going to the lungs to absorb oxygen, this blood is pumped out through the aorta and back to the body."}

But, instead of going to the lungs to absorb oxygen, this blood is pumped out through the aorta and back to the body. This blood has not been recharged with oxygen and leads to cyanosis, a bluish discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes.\nSymptoms appear at birth or very soon afterward. How bad the symptoms are depends on the type and size of additional heart defects (such as atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect, or patent ductus arteriosus) and how much the blood can mix between the two abnormal circulations.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nBluish color to the skin\n(cyanosis) due to low oxygen level in the blood\nClubbing of the fingers or toes\nPoor feeding\nShortness of breath\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider may detect a heart murmur while listening to the chest with a stethoscope."}

The baby will immediately receive a medicine called prostaglandin through an IV (intravenous line). This medicine helps keep a blood vessel called the ductus arteriosus open, allowing some mixing of the two blood circulations. In some cases, an opening between the right and left atrium can be created with procedure using a balloon catheter. This allows blood to mix. This procedure is known as balloon atrial septostomy.\nPermanent treatment involves heart surgery during which the great arteries are cut and stitched back to their correct position. This is called an arterial switch operation (ASO)."}

This is called an arterial switch operation (ASO). Prior to the development of this surgery, a surgery called an atrial switch (or Mustard procedure or Senning procedure) was used.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe child's symptoms will improve after surgery to correct the defect. Most infants who undergo arterial switch do not have symptoms after surgery and live normal lives. If corrective surgery is not performed, the life expectancy is only months.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nCoronary artery problems\nHeart valve problems\nIrregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nThis condition can be diagnosed before birth using a fetal echocardiogram."}

Rubella infection in a pregnant woman can cause CHD.\nWomen who are pregnant should get good prenatal care:\nAvoid alcohol and illegal drugs during pregnancy.\nTell your provider that you are pregnant before taking any new medicines.\nHave a blood test early in your pregnancy to see if you are immune to rubella."}
