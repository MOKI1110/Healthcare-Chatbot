However, the correct term for that condition is presbyopia. Although related, presbyopia and hyperopia (farsightedness) are different conditions. People with hyperopia will also develop presbyopia with age.\nCauses\nFarsightedness is the result of the visual image being focused behind the\nretina\nrather than directly on it. It may be caused by the eyeball being too small or the focusing power being too weak. It can also be a combination of both.\nFarsightedness is often present from birth. However, children have a very flexible eye lens, which helps make up for the problem. As aging occurs, glasses or contact lenses may be needed to correct the vision."}

However, you may need reading glasses sooner than people who do not have this condition.\nExams and Tests\nA general eye exam to diagnose farsightedness may include the following tests:\nEye movement testing\nGlaucoma testing\nRefraction test\nRetinal examination\nSlit-lamp examination\nVisual acuity\nCycloplegic refraction, a refraction test done with the eyes dilated\nThis list is not all-inclusive.\nTreatment\nFarsightedness is easily corrected with glasses or contact lenses. Surgery is available for correcting farsightedness in adults."}
