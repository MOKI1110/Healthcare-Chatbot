XP causes the skin and tissue covering the eye to be extremely sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) light. Some people also develop nervous system problems.\nCauses\nXP is an\nautosomal recessive inherited disorder\n. This means you must have 2 copies of an abnormal gene in order for the disease or trait to develop. The disorder is inherited from both your mother and father at the same time. The abnormal gene is rare, so the chances of both parents having the gene are very rare. For this reason, it is unlikely for somebody with the condition to pass it on to the next generation, although it is possible.\nUV light, such as from sunlight, damages the genetic material (DNA) in skin cells. Normally, the body repairs this damage. But in people with XP, the body does not fix the damage."}

As a result, the skin gets very thin and patches of varying color (splotchy pigmentation) appear.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms usually appear by the time a child is 2 years old.\nSkin symptoms include:\nSunburn that does not heal after just a little bit of sun exposure\nBlistering\nafter just a little bit of sun exposure\nSpider-like blood vessels under the skin\nPatches of discolored skin that get worse, resembling severe aging\nCrusting of the skin\nScaling\nof the skin\nOozing raw skin surface\nDiscomfort when being in bright light (\nphotophobia\n)\nSkin cancer at a very young age (including\nmelanoma\n,\nbasal cell carcinoma\n,\nsquamous cell carcinoma\n)\nEye symptoms include:\nDry eye\nClouding of the cornea\nUlcers of the cornea\nSwelling or inflammation of the eyelids\nCancer of eyelids, cornea or sclera\nNervous system (neurologic) symptoms, which develop in some children, include:\nIntellectual disability\nDelayed growth\nLoss of hearing\nMuscle weakness of the legs and arms\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider"}

The provider will also ask about a family history of XP.\nTests that may be done include:\nSkin biopsy\nin which skin cells are studied in the laboratory\nDNA testing for the problem gene\nThe following tests can help diagnose the condition in a baby before birth:\nAmniocentesis\nChorionic villus sampling\nCulture of amniotic cells\nTreatment\nPeople with XP need total\nprotection from sunlight\n. Even the light coming through windows or from fluorescent bulbs can be dangerous.\nWhen out in the sun, protective clothing must be worn.\nTo protect the skin and eyes from the sunlight:\nUse sunscreen with the highest SPF you can find.\nWear long-sleeve shirts and long pants.\nWear sunglasses that block UVA and UVB rays."}
