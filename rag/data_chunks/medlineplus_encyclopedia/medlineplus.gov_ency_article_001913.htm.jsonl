The term LASER stands for light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation.\nInformation\nThe laser light beam does not pose health risks to the person or medical team. Laser treatment has some of the same risks as open surgery, including pain, bleeding, and scarring. But recovery time from laser surgery is usually faster than recovery from open surgery.\nLasers can be used for many medical purposes. Because the laser beam is so small and precise, it allows health care providers to safely treat tissue without injuring the surrounding area.\nLasers are often used to:\nTreat varicose veins\nImprove vision during\neye surgery on the cornea\nRepair a detached retina of the eye\nRemove parts of the prostate\nRemove kidney stones\nRemove\ntumors\nLasers are also often used during\nskin surgery\n.\nImages\nLaser therapy\nReferences\nJames WD, Elston DM, Treat JR, Rosenbach MA, Neuhaus IM.
