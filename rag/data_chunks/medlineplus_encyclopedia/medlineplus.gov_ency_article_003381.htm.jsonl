Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nX-ray - skeleton\nX-ray - skeleton\nA skeletal\nx-ray\nis an imaging test used to look at your bones. It is used to detect\nfractures\n, tumors, or conditions that cause wearing away (degeneration) of the bone.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is done in a hospital radiology department or in your health care provider's office by an x-ray technologist.\nYou will lie on a table or stand in front of the x-ray machine, depending on the bone that is injured. You may be asked to change position so that different x-ray views can be taken.\nThe x-rays pass through your body. A computer or special film records the images.\nStructures that are dense (such as bone) will block most of the x-ray particles. These areas will appear white. Metal and contrast media (special dye used to highlight areas of the body) will also appear white. Structures containing air will be black. Muscle, fat, and fluid will appear as shades of gray.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nTell your provider if you are pregnant."}

Structures containing air will be black. Muscle, fat, and fluid will appear as shades of gray.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nTell your provider if you are pregnant. You must remove all jewelry before the x-ray.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe x-rays are painless. Changing positions and moving the injured area for different x-ray views may be uncomfortable. If the whole skeleton is being imaged, the test most often takes 1 hour or more.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is used to look for:\nFractures or broken bone\nCancer that has spread to other areas of the body\nOsteomyelitis\n(inflammation of the bone caused by an infection)\nBone damage due to trauma (such as an auto accident) or degenerative conditions\nAbnormalities in the soft tissue around the bone\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal findings include:\nFractures\nBone tumors\nDegenerative bone conditions\nOsteomyelitis\nRisks\nThere is low radiation exposure. X-rays machines are set to provide the smallest amount of radiation exposure needed to produce the image."}

X-rays machines are set to provide the smallest amount of radiation exposure needed to produce the image. Most experts feel that the risk is low compared with the benefits.\nChildren and the fetuses of pregnant women are more sensitive to the risks of the x-ray.
