ADH normally causes the kidneys to make the urine more concentrated.\nAs a result of not responding to the ADH signal, the kidneys release too much water into the urine. This causes the body to produce a large quantity of very dilute urine.\nNDI is very rare. Congenital nephrogenic diabetes insipidus means it is present at birth. It is a result of a genetic variant passed down through families. Men are usually affected, though women can pass this gene on to their children.\nMost commonly, NDI develops because of other reasons. This is called an acquired disorder."}

Factors that can trigger the acquired form of this condition include:\nBlockage in the urinary tract\nHigh blood calcium levels\nLow blood potassium levels\nUse of certain medicines (lithium, demeclocycline, amphotericin B)\nSymptoms\nYou may have intense or uncontrollable thirst, and crave ice water.\nYou will produce large amounts of urine, usually more than 3 liters, and up to 15 liters per day. The urine is very dilute and looks almost like water. You may need to urinate every hour or even more, even during the night when you are not eating or drinking as much.\nIf you do not drink enough fluids, dehydration can result."}

A large amount of fluids will be given. The amount should be about equal to the amount of water being lost in the urine.\nIf the condition is due to a certain medicine, stopping the medicine may improve symptoms. But, do not stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.\nMedicines may be given to improve symptoms by reducing urine output.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf a person drinks enough water, this condition will not have much effect on the fluid or\nelectrolyte\nbalance of the body."}
