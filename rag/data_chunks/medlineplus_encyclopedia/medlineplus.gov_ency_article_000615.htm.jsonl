Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTetanus\nTetanus\nTetanus is an infection of the nervous system with a type of bacteria that is potentially deadly, called\nClostridium tetani (C tetani)\n.\nCauses\nSpores\nof the bacterium\nC tetani\nare found in the soil, and in animal feces and mouth (gastrointestinal tract). In the spore form,\nC tetani\ncan remain inactive in the soil. But it can remain infectious for more than 40 years.\nYou can get tetanus infection when the spores enter your body through an injury or wound. The spores become active bacteria that spread in the body and make a poison called tetanus toxin (also known as tetanospasmin). This poison blocks nerve signals from your spinal cord to your muscles, causing severe muscle spasms. The spasms can be so powerful that they tear the muscles or cause\nfractures\nof the spine.\nThe time between infection and the first sign of symptoms is about 7 to 21 days. Nearly all cases of tetanus in the United States occur in those who have not been vaccinated against the disease.\nSymptoms\nTetanus often begins with mild spasms in the jaw muscles (lockjaw)."}

Nearly all cases of tetanus in the United States occur in those who have not been vaccinated against the disease.\nSymptoms\nTetanus often begins with mild spasms in the jaw muscles (lockjaw). The spasms can also affect your chest, neck, back, and\nabdominal muscles\n. Back muscle spasms often cause arching, called\nopisthotonos\n.\nSometimes, the spasms affect muscles that help with breathing, which can lead to breathing problems.\nProlonged muscular action causes sudden, powerful, and painful contractions of muscle groups. This is called tetany. These are the episodes that can cause fractures and muscle tears.\nOther symptoms include:\nDrooling\nExcessive sweating\nFever\nHand or foot spasms\nIrritability\nSwallowing difficulty\nUncontrolled urination or defecation\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history."}

No specific lab test is available to diagnose tetanus.\nTests may be used to check for\nmeningitis\n,\nrabies\n, strychnine poisoning, and other diseases with similar symptoms.\nTreatment\nTreatment may include:\nAntibiotics\nBedrest with a calm environment (dim light, reduced noise, and stable temperature)\nMedicine to neutralize the poison (tetanus immune globulin)\nMuscle relaxers, such as diazepam\nSedatives\nSurgery to clean the wound and remove the source of the poison (debridement)\nBreathing support with oxygen, a breathing tube, and a breathing machine may be necessary.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWithout treatment, 1 out of 4 infected people die. The death rate for newborns with untreated tetanus is even higher. With proper treatment, less than 15% of infected people die.\nWounds on the head or face seem to be more dangerous than those on other parts of the body. If the person survives the\nacute\nillness, recovery is generally complete."}

The DTaP vaccine is a 3-in-1 vaccine that protects against\ndiphtheria\n,\npertussis\n, and tetanus.\nTd vaccine\nor\nTdap vaccine\nis used to maintain immunity in people age 7 and older. Tdap vaccine should be given once, before age 65, as a substitute for Td for those who have not had Tdap. Td boosters are recommended every 10 years starting at age 19.\nOlder teenagers and adults who get injuries, especially puncture-type wounds, should get a tetanus booster if it has been more than 10 years since the last booster.\nIf you have been injured outside or in any way that makes contact with soil likely, contact your provider about your risk of getting a tetanus infection. Injuries and wounds should be thoroughly cleaned right away."}
