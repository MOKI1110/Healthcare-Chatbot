This may place pressure on nearby nerves or the spinal cord.\nCauses\nThe bones (vertebrae) of the spinal column protect nerves that come out of the brain and travel down your back to form the spinal cord. Nerve roots are large nerves that branch out from the spinal cord and leave your spinal column between each vertebra.\nThe spinal bones are separated by disks. These disks cushion the spinal column and put space between your vertebrae. The disks allow movement between the vertebrae, which lets you bend and reach.\nWith herniated disk:\nThe disk may move out of place (herniate) or break open (rupture) from injury or\nstrain\n. When this happens, there may be pressure on one or more spinal nerves. This can lead to pain, numbness, or weakness.\nThe lower back (lumbar area) of the spine is the most common area affected by a herniated disk. The neck (cervical) disks are the second most commonly affected area."}

The neck (cervical) disks are the second most commonly affected area. The upper-to-mid-back (thoracic) disks are rarely involved.\nA herniated disk is a cause of radiculopathy. This is a condition that affects one or more of the spinal nerve roots.\nHerniated disks occur more often in middle-aged and older men, usually after strenuous activity. Other risk factors may include:\nLifting heavy objects\nBeing overweight\nRepetitive bending or twisting the lower back or neck\nSitting or standing in same position for long hours\nInactive lifestyle\nSmoking\nWatch this video about:\nHerniated nucleus pulposus (slipped disk)\nSymptoms\nThe pain most often occurs on one side of the body. Symptoms vary, depending on the site of injury, and may include the following:\nWith a herniated disk in your lower back, you may have sharp pain in one part of the leg, hip, or buttocks, and numbness in other parts. You may also feel pain or numbness in the back of the calf or sole of the foot."}

You can also have numbness along your shoulder, elbow, forearm, and fingers.\nThe pain often starts slowly. It may get worse:\nAfter standing or sitting\nAt night\nWhen sneezing, coughing, or laughing\nWhen bending backward or walking more than a few yards or meters\nWhen straining or holding your breath, such as when having a bowel movement\nYou may also have weakness in certain muscles. Sometimes, you may not notice it until your health care provider examines you. In other cases, you will notice that you have a hard time lifting your leg or arm, standing on your toes on one side, squeezing tightly with one of your hands, or other problems."}

It can look at how healthy your bone is and also look for how much room there is for your spinal nerves to travel out of the spinal cord. However, it is not possible to diagnose a herniated disk by a spine x-ray alone.\nBone density tests to check your bone quality. If your bone is weak, you may be given medicine to improve bone health.\nTreatment\nThe first treatment for a slipped disk is a short period of rest and taking medicines for the pain. This is usually followed by physical therapy."}

Your provider may prescribe any of the following:\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for long-term pain control\nNarcotics\nif the pain is severe and does not respond to NSAIDs\nMedicines to calm the nerves\nMuscle relaxants to relieve back spasms\nLIFESTYLE CHANGES\nIf you are overweight, diet and exercise are very important for improving back pain.\nPhysical therapy is important for nearly everyone with disk disease. Therapists will teach you how to properly lift, dress, walk, and perform other activities. They will teach you how to strengthen muscles that help support the spine. You will also learn how to increase flexibility in your spine and legs.\nTake care of your back at home\n:\nReduce activity for the first few days."}

These injections reduce swelling around the spinal nerve and disk and relieve many symptoms. They do not solve the underlying problem and your pain may return after weeks or months. Spinal injections are an outpatient procedure.\nSURGERY\nSurgery may be an option if your symptoms do not go away with other treatments and time.\nOne such surgery is\ndiskectomy\n, which removes all or part of a disk.\nDiscuss with your provider which treatment options are best for you.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people improve with treatment."}
