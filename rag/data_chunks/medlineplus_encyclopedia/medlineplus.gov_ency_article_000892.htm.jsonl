Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nVaginal dryness\nVaginal dryness\nVaginal dryness is present when the tissues of the vagina are not well-lubricated and healthy.\nCauses\nAtrophic vaginitis is caused by a decrease in estrogen.\nEstrogen keeps the tissues of the vagina lubricated and healthy. Normally, the lining of the vagina makes a clear, lubricating fluid. This fluid makes sexual intercourse more comfortable. It also helps decrease vaginal dryness.\nIf estrogen levels drop off, the tissues of the vagina shrink and become thinner. This causes dryness and inflammation.\nEstrogen levels normally drop after menopause. The following may also cause estrogen levels to drop:\nMedicines or hormones used in the treatment of breast cancer, endometriosis, fibroids, or infertility\nSurgery to remove the ovaries\nRadiation treatment to the pelvic area\nChemotherapy\nSevere stress, depression\nSmoking\nSome women develop this problem right after childbirth or while breastfeeding."}

Estrogen levels are lower at these times.\nThe\nvagina can also become further irritated\nfrom soaps, laundry detergents, lotions, perfumes, or douches. Certain medicines, smoking, tampons, and condoms may also cause or worsen vaginal dryness.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nBurning on urination\nLight\nbleeding\nafter intercourse\nPainful sexual intercourse\nSlight\nvaginal discharge\nVaginal soreness,\nitching\nor burning\nExams and Tests\nA pelvic exam shows that the walls of the vagina are thin, pale or red.\nYour vaginal discharge may be tested to check for other causes for the condition. You may also have hormone level tests to find out if you are in menopause.\nTreatment\nThere are many treatments for vaginal dryness. Before treating your symptoms on your own, a health care provider must find out the cause of the problem.\nTry using lubricants and\nvaginal moisturizing creams\n. They will often moisten the area for several hours, up to a day."}

Products with petroleum jelly, mineral oil, or other oils may damage latex condoms or diaphragms.\nAvoid scented soaps, lotions, perfumes, or douches.\nPrescription estrogen can work well to treat atrophic vaginitis. It is available as a cream, tablet, suppository, or ring. All of these are placed directly into the vagina. These medicines deliver estrogen directly to the vaginal area. Only a little estrogen is absorbed into the bloodstream. The use of topical vaginal estrogen may also reduce your chances of developing a urinary tract infection. That is particularly true if you have a history of recurrent urinary tract infections.\nYou may take estrogen (\nhormone therapy\n) in the form of a skin patch, or in a pill that you take by mouth if you have hot flashes or other symptoms of menopause. The pill or patch may not provide adequate estrogen to treat your vaginal dryness."}
