Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThere are two types of the Coombs test:\nDirect\nIndirect\nThe direct Coombs test is used to detect antibodies that are stuck to the surface of red blood cells. Many diseases and medicines can cause this to happen. These antibodies sometimes destroy red blood cells and cause\nanemia\n. Your health care provider may recommend this test if you have signs or symptoms of anemia or\njaundice\n(yellowing of the skin or eyes).\nThe indirect Coombs test looks for antibodies that are in the blood. These antibodies could act against certain red blood cells."}

These antibodies could act against certain red blood cells. This test is most often done to determine if you may have a reaction to a blood transfusion.\nNormal Results\nA normal result is called a negative result. It means there was no clumping of cells and you have no antibodies to red blood cells.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal (positive) direct Coombs test means you have antibodies that act against your red blood cells."}
