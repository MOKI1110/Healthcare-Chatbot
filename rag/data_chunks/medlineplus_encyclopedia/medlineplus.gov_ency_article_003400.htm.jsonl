It can also monitor whether or not treatment is working. A high temperature is a\nfever\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends not to use glass thermometers with mercury. The glass can break, and mercury is a poison.\nElectronic thermometers are most often suggested. An easy-to-read panel shows the temperature. The probe can be placed in the mouth, rectum, or armpit.\nMouth: Place the probe under the tongue and close the mouth. Breathe through the nose. Use the lips to hold the thermometer tightly in place. Leave the thermometer in the mouth for 3 minutes or until the device beeps.\nRectum: This method is for infants and small children. They cannot hold a thermometer safely in their mouth. Place petroleum jelly on the bulb of a rectal thermometer. Place the child face down on a flat surface or lap. Spread the buttocks and insert the bulb end about 1/2 to 1 inch (1 to 2.5 centimeters) into the anal canal."}

Place the child face down on a flat surface or lap. Spread the buttocks and insert the bulb end about 1/2 to 1 inch (1 to 2.5 centimeters) into the anal canal. Be careful not to insert it too far. Struggling can push the thermometer in further. Remove after 3 minutes or when the device beeps.\nArmpit: Place the thermometer in the armpit. Press the arm against the body. Wait for 5 minutes before reading or when the device beeps.\nPlastic strip thermometers change color to show the temperature. This method is the least accurate.\nPlace the strip on the forehead. Read it after 1 minute while the strip is in place.\nPlastic strip thermometers for the mouth are also available.\nElectronic ear thermometers are common. They are easy to use. However, some users report that the results are less accurate than with probe thermometers.\nElectronic forehead thermometers are more accurate than ear thermometers and their accuracy is similar to probe thermometers.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nAlways clean the thermometer before and after using."}

You can use cool, soapy water or rubbing alcohol.\nWait at least 1 hour after heavy exercise or a hot bath before measuring body temperature. Wait for 20 to 30 minutes after smoking, eating, or drinking a hot or cold liquid.\nNormal Results\nThe average normal body temperature is 98.6 °F (37 °C). The normal temperature can vary due to things such as:\nAge (in children over 6 months, daily temperature can vary by 1 to 2 degrees Fahrenheit)\nDifferences among individuals\nTime of day (often highest in the evening)\nWhich type of measurement was taken (oral, rectal, forehead, or armpit)\nYou need to have an accurate temperature measurement to determine if a fever is present. Be sure to tell your health care provider which type of temperature measurement you used when discussing a fever.\nThe exact relationship between different types of temperature measurement is unclear."}

However, the following general guidelines for temperature results are used:\nThe average normal oral temperature is 98.6 °F (37 °C).\nA rectal temperature is 0.5 °F (0.3 °C) to 1 °F (0.6 °C) higher than an oral temperature.\nAn ear temperature is 0.5 °F (0.3 °C) to 1 °F (0.6 °C) higher than an oral temperature.\nAn armpit temperature is most often 0.5 °F (0.3 °C) to 1 °F (0.6 °C) lower than an oral temperature.\nA forehead scanner is most often 0.5 °F (0.3 °C) to 1 °F (0.6 °C) lower than an oral temperature.\nOther factors to take into account are:\nIn general, rectal temperatures are considered to be more accurate when checking for fever in a young child.\nPlastic strip thermometers measure skin temperature, not body temperature. They are not recommended for general home use.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf the reading on the thermometer is more than 1 to 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit above your normal temperature, you have a\nfever\n."}
