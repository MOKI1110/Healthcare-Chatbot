This leads to a hunchback or slouching posture.\nCauses\nKyphosis can occur at any age, although it is rare at birth.\nA type of kyphosis that occurs in young teens is known as Scheuermann disease. It is caused by the wedging together of several bones of the spine (vertebrae) in a row. The cause of this condition is unknown. Kyphosis can also occur in young teens who have\ncerebral palsy\n.\nIn adults, kyphosis can be caused by:\nDegenerative diseases of the spine (such as\narthritis\nor disk degeneration)\nFractures\ncaused by\nosteoporosis\n(osteoporotic compression fractures)\nInjury (trauma)\nSlipping of one vertebra forward on another (\nspondylolisthesis\n)\nPrevious surgeries or fusion on the spine\nOther causes of kyphosis include:\nCertain hormone (\nendocrine\n) diseases\nConnective tissue disorders\nInfection (such as\ntuberculosis\n)\nMuscular dystrophy\n(group of inherited disorders that cause muscle weakness and loss of muscle tissue)\nNeurofibromatosis\n(disorder in which nerve tissu"}

Other symptoms may include any of the following:\nRound back appearance\nTenderness and stiffness in the spine\nFatigue\nDifficulty breathing\n(in severe cases)\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam by your health care provider can confirm the abnormal curve of the spine. Your provider will also look for any nervous system (neurological) changes. These include weakness, paralysis, or changes in sensation below the curve."}

Sometimes surgery is needed for large (greater than 60 degrees), painful curves.\nCompression fractures\nfrom osteoporosis can be left alone if there are no nervous system problems or pain. But the osteoporosis needs to be treated to help prevent future fractures. For severe deformity or pain from osteoporosis, surgery is an option.\nKyphosis caused by infection or tumor needs prompt treatment, often with surgery and medicines.\nTreatment for other types of kyphosis depends on the cause."}

Surgery is needed if nervous system symptoms or constant pain develop.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nYoung teens with Scheuermann disease tend to do well, even if they need surgery. The disease stops once they stop growing. If the kyphosis is due to\ndegenerative joint disease\nor multiple compression fractures, surgery is needed to correct the defect and improve pain.\nPossible Complications\nUntreated kyphosis can cause any of the following:\nDecreased lung capacity\nDisabling back pain\nNervous system symptoms, including leg weakness or paralysis\nRound back deformity\nIncreased self-consciousness or body awareness\nPrevention\nTreating and preventing osteoporosis can prevent many cases of kyphosis in older adults. Early diagnosis and bracing for Scheuermann disease can reduce the need for surgery, but there is no way to prevent the disease.\nAlternative Names\nScheuermann disease; Roundback; Hunchback; Postural kyphosis; Neck pain - kyphosis\nImages\nSkeletal spine\nKyphosis\nReferences\nMagee DJ, Manske RC."}
