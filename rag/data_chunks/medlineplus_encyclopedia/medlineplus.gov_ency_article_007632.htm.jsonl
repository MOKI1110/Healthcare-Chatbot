This lining is called the endometrium. The surgery may be done in a hospital, outpatient surgery center, or the health care provider's office.\nDescription\nEndometrial ablation is a procedure used to treat abnormal bleeding by destroying tissue in the uterine lining. The tissue can be removed using:\nHigh frequency radio waves\nLaser energy\nHeated fluids\nBalloon therapy\nFreezing\nElectrical current\nSome types of procedures are done using a thin, lighted tube called a hysteroscope that sends images of the inside of the womb to a video monitor. Most of the time general anesthesia is used so you will be asleep and pain free.\nHowever, newer techniques can be done without using a hysteroscope. For these, a shot of numbing medicine is injected into the nerves around the\ncervix\nto block pain.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThis procedure can treat heavy or irregular periods."}

Your provider will likely have tried other treatments first, such as hormone medicines or an IUD.\nEndometrial ablation will not be used if you may want to become pregnant in the future. Though this procedure does not prevent you from getting pregnant, it may reduce your chances of getting pregnant. Reliable contraception is important in all women who get the procedure.\nIf a woman gets pregnant after an ablation procedure, the pregnancy will often miscarry or be extremely high risk because of the scar tissue in the uterus.\nRisks\nRisks of hysteroscopy include:\nHole (perforation) in the wall of the womb\nScarring of the lining of the womb\nInfection of the uterus\nDamage to the cervix\nNeed for surgery to repair damage\nSevere bleeding\nDamage to the bowels\nRisks of ablation procedures vary depending on the method used."}

Younger women may be treated with a hormone that blocks estrogen from being made by the body for 1 to 3 months before the procedure.\nYour provider may prescribe medicine to open your cervix. This makes it easier to insert the scope."}

These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E.
