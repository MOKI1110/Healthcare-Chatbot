Cleft lip and palate may occur along with other syndromes or birth defects.\nA cleft lip and palate can:\nAffect the appearance of the face\nLead to problems with feeding and speech\nLead to ear infections\nBabies are more likely to be born with a cleft lip and palate if they have a family history of these conditions or other birth defects.\nSymptoms\nA child may have one or more birth defects and the severity can vary significantly.\nA cleft lip may be just a small notch in the lip. It may also be a complete split in the lip that goes all the way to the base of the nose.\nA cleft palate can be on one or both sides of the roof of the mouth."}

It may go the full length of the palate.\nOther symptoms include:\nChange in nose shape (how much the shape changes varies)\nPoorly aligned teeth\nProblems that may be present because of a cleft lip or palate are:\nFailure to gain weight\nFeeding problems\nFlow of milk through nasal passages during feeding\nPoor growth\nRepeated ear infections\nSpeech difficulties\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam of the mouth, nose, and palate confirms a cleft lip or cleft palate. Medical tests may be done to rule out other possible health conditions.\nTreatment\nSurgery to close the cleft lip\nis often done when the child is between 2 to 9 months old. Surgery may be needed later in life if the problem has a major effect on the nose area. Some patients may receive tympanostomy tubes during the surgery also.\nA cleft palate is most often closed within the first year of life so that the child's speech develops normally."}

Sometimes, a prosthetic device is temporarily used to close the palate so the baby can feed and grow until surgery can be done.\nContinued follow-up may be needed with speech therapists and orthodontists.\nSupport Groups\nFor more resources and information, see\ncleft palate support groups\n.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost babies will heal without problems. How your child will look after healing depends on the severity of their condition. Your child might need another surgery to fix the scar from the surgery wound.\nChildren who had a cleft palate repair may need to see a dentist or orthodontist. Their teeth may need to be corrected as they come in.\nHearing problems are common in children with cleft lip or palate. Your child should have a hearing test at an early age, and it should be repeated over time.\nYour child may still have problems with speech after the surgery. This is caused by muscle problems in the palate."}
