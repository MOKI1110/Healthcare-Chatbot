This type of seizure is a brief (usually less than 15 seconds) change in awareness due to abnormal electrical activity in the brain.\nCauses\nSeizures result from overactivity in the brain. Absence seizures occur most often in people under age 20, usually in children ages 4 to 12 years.\nIn some cases, the seizures are triggered by flashing lights or when the person breathes faster and more deeply than usual (hyperventilates).\nThey may also occur with other types of seizures, such as\nbilateral tonic-clonic seizures\n(grand mal seizures), twitches or jerks (\nmyoclonus\n), or sudden loss of muscle strength (atonic seizures).\nSymptoms\nMost absence seizures last only a few seconds. They often involve staring episodes."}

The episodes may:\nOccur many times a day\nOccur for weeks to months before being noticed\nInterfere with school and learning\nBe mistaken for lack of attention, daydreaming or other misbehavior\nUnexplained difficulties in school and learning difficulties may be the first sign of absence seizures.\nDuring the seizure, the person may:\nStop walking and start again a few seconds later\nStop talking in mid-sentence and start again a few seconds later\nThe person usually does not fall during the seizure.\nRight after the seizure, the person is usually:\nWide awake\nThinking clearly\nUnaware of the seizure\nSpecific symptoms of typical absence seizures may include:\nChanges in muscle activity, such as no movement,\nhand fumbling\n, fluttering eyelids, lip smacking, chewing\nChanges in alertness (consciousness)\n, such as staring episodes, lack of awareness of surroundings, sudden halt in movement, talking, and other awake activities\nSome absence seizures begin slower and last longer."}

These are called atypical absence seizures. Symptoms are similar to regular absence seizures, but muscle activity changes may be more noticeable.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. This will include a detailed look at the brain and nervous system.\nAn\nelectroencephalogram\n(EEG) will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain. People with seizures often have abnormal electrical activity seen on this test. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start. The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures.\nBlood and urine tests may also be ordered to check for other health problems that may be causing the seizures.\nHead CT\nor\nMRI scan\nmay be done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain.\nTreatment\nTreatment\nfor absence seizures includes medicines, changes in lifestyle for\nadults\nand\nchildren\n, such as activity and diet, and sometimes surgery."}
