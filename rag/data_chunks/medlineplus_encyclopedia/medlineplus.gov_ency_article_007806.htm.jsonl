Symptoms of RSV infection may include runny nose, decrease in appetite, coughing, sneezing, fever, or wheezing.\nAnyone can become infected by RSV, and almost all children get an RSV infection by the time they are 2 years old."}

While most children recover from an RSV infection in a week or two, RSV infection can be dangerous for infants and some young children, causing difficulty breathing, low oxygen levels, and dehydration. In the United States, RSV is the most common cause of bronchiolitis (inflammation of the small airways in the lungs) and pneumonia (infection of the lungs) in children younger than 1 year of age. Children who get sick from RSV may need to be hospitalized, and some might even die.\nRSV Preventive Antibodies\nThe RSV preventive antibody (generic name nirsevimab, trade name Beyfortus) is a shot that prevents severe RSV disease in infants and young children. Antibodies are proteins that the body's immune system uses to fight off harmful germs. Like traditional vaccines, preventive antibodies are immunizations that provide protection against a specific pathogen. While both are immunizations, the way they provide immunity is different."}

Like traditional vaccines, preventive antibodies are immunizations that provide protection against a specific pathogen. While both are immunizations, the way they provide immunity is different. Nirsevimab is an immunization that provides antibodies directly to the recipient. Traditional vaccines are immunizations that stimulate the recipient's immune system to produce antibodies.\nInfants born during the RSV season (typically fall through spring) should receive a single dose of the RSV Immunization within 1 week after birth. Most infants whose mothers got the RSV vaccine don't need to get nirsevimab, too. Both protect infants from severe RSV by providing antibodies, either from the mother to the infant or directly to the infant. Most infants will likely only need protection from either the maternal RSV vaccine or nirsevimab (not both)."}
