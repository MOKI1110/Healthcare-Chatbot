Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nOsmolality blood test\nOsmolality blood test\nOsmolality blood test is a test that measures the concentration of all chemical particles found in the fluid part of blood.\nOsmolality in the urine can be measured with a\nurine test\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample is needed\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nFollow any instructions from your health care provider about not eating before the test. Your provider may tell you to temporarily stop taking any medicines that may interfere with test results. Such medicines may include water pills (diuretics).\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test helps check your body's water balance."}

Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test helps check your body's water balance. Your provider may order this test if you have signs of any of the following:\nLow sodium\n(hyponatremia) or water loss\nPoisoning from harmful substances such as\nethanol\n,\nmethanol\n, or\nethylene glycol\nProblems producing urine\nExcessive thirst\nExcessive urination\nIn healthy people, when osmolality in the blood becomes high, the body releases\nantidiuretic hormone\n(ADH).\nThis hormone causes the kidneys to reabsorb water. This results in more concentrated urine. The reabsorbed water dilutes the blood. This allows blood osmolality to fall back to normal.\nLow blood osmolality suppresses ADH. This reduces how much water the kidneys reabsorb. Dilute urine is passed to get rid of the excess water, which increases blood osmolality back toward normal.\nNormal Results\nNormal values range from 275 to 295 mOsm/kg (275 to 295 mmol/kg).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA higher than normal osmolality may be due to:\nDiabetes insipidus\nHigh blood sugar level\n(hyperglycemia)\nHigh level of nitrogen waste products in the blood (\nuremia\n)\nHigh sodium level (hypernatremia)\nStroke\nor head trauma resulting in decreased ADH secretion\nWater loss\n(dehydration)\nA lower than normal osmolality may be due to:\nADH oversecretion\nAdrenal gland not working normally\nConditions linked to\nlung cancer\n(causing syndrome of inappropriate ADH production, or\nSIADH\n)\nOther conditions or medicines that cause SIADH\nDrinking too much water or fluid\nLow sodium level (hyponatremia)\nUnderactive thyroid gland (\nhypothyroidism\n)\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.
