It causes\nweakness\n,\nabnormal sensations\n, mental problems, and\nvision difficulties\n.\nCauses\nSCD is caused by\nvitamin B12 deficiency\n. It mainly affects the spinal cord. But its effects on the brain and the peripheral (body) nerves are the reason for the term \"combined.\" At first, the nerve covering (myelin sheath) is damaged. Later, the entire nerve cell is affected.\nHealth care providers do not know exactly how a lack of vitamin B12 damages the nerves."}

Later, the entire nerve cell is affected.\nHealth care providers do not know exactly how a lack of vitamin B12 damages the nerves. It is possible that the lack of this vitamin causes abnormal fatty acids to form around cells and nerves.\nPeople are at high risk for this condition if vitamin B12 cannot be absorbed from their intestine or if they have:\nPernicious anemia\n, a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells due to vitamin B12 deficiency\nDisorders of the small intestine, including\nCrohn disease\nProblems absorbing nutrients, which can occur after gastrointestinal surgery, including weight loss surgery\nUse of nitrous oxide (laughing gas), especially if used as a recreational drug\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nAbnormal sensations (tingling and numbness)\nWeakness of the legs, arms, or other areas\nThese symptoms slowly get worse and are usually felt on both sides of the body.\nAs the disease worsens, symptoms may include any of the following:\nClumsiness\n, stiff or awkward movements.\nMental changes, which can range from mild memory problems, irritability, apathy, and confusion, to severe d"}

The exam usually shows muscle weakness and sensation problems on both sides of the body, especially in the legs. Reflexes are often abnormal. Muscles may have\nspasticity\n. There may be reduced senses of touch, pain, and temperature.\nTests may be needed to determine why you are deficient in vitamin B12.\nNerve conduction studies and\nelectromyography\n(EMG) may be done to test for nerve damage in the extremities.\nAn eye exam may show damage to the optic nerve, a condition called\noptic neuropathy\n."}

There may also be abnormal pupil responses, loss of sharp vision, and other changes.\nBlood tests that may be ordered include:\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nVitamin B12 blood level\nMethylmalonic acid and homocysteine blood level\nAntibodies to intrinsic factor or parietal cells (gastric cells)\nTreatment\nVitamin B12 is given, usually by injection into a muscle. Injections are often given once a day for a week, then weekly for about 1 month, and then monthly. Vitamin B12 supplements, either by injection or high-dose pills, must continue throughout life to prevent symptoms from returning.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nEarly treatment improves the chance of a good outcome.\nHow well a person does depends on how long they had symptoms before receiving treatment. If treatment is received within a few weeks, complete recovery may be expected."}

If treatment is delayed for longer than 1 or 2 months, full recovery may not be possible.\nUntreated, SCD results in continued and permanent damage to the nervous system.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if abnormal sensations, muscle weakness, or other symptoms of SCD develop. This is particularly important if you or a family member has had pernicious anemia or other risk factors.\nPrevention\nSome vegetarian diets, especially vegan, may be low in vitamin B12. Taking a supplement can help prevent SCD.\nAlternative Names\nSubacute combined degeneration of the spinal cord; SCD\nImages\nCentral nervous system and peripheral nervous system\nCentral nervous system\nReferences\nKoppel BS, Weimer LH, Daras M.
