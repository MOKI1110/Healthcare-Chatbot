Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCystometric study\nCystometric study\nA cystometric study measures the amount of fluid in the bladder when you first feel the need to urinate, when you are able to sense fullness, and when your bladder is completely full.\nHow the Test is Performed\nPrior to the cystometric study, you may be asked to urinate (void) into a special container that is interfaced with a computer. This type of study is called a uroflow, during which the following will be recorded by the computer:\nThe time it takes you to begin urinating\nThe pattern, speed, and continuity of your urinary stream\nThe amount of urine\nHow long it took you to empty your bladder\nYou will then lie down, and a thin, flexible tube (catheter) is gently placed in your bladder. The catheter measures any urine left in the bladder. A smaller catheter is sometimes placed in your rectum in order to measure abdominal pressure. Measuring electrodes, similar to the sticky pads used for an ECG, are placed near the rectum.\nA tube used to monitor bladder pressure (cystometer) is attached to the catheter."}

Measuring electrodes, similar to the sticky pads used for an ECG, are placed near the rectum.\nA tube used to monitor bladder pressure (cystometer) is attached to the catheter. Water flows into the bladder at a controlled rate. You will be asked to tell your health care provider when you first feel the need to urinate and when you feel that your bladder is completely full.\nOften, your provider may need more information and will order tests to evaluate your bladder function. This set of tests is often referred to as urodynamics or complete urodynamics. The combination includes three tests:\nMeasured voiding without a catheter (uroflow)\nCystometry (filling phase)\nVoiding or emptying phase test\nFor complete urodynamic testing, a much smaller catheter is placed in the bladder. You will be able to urinate around it. Because this special catheter has a sensor on the tip, the computer can measure the pressure and volumes as your bladder fills and as you empty it. You may be asked to cough or push so that the provider can check for urine leakage."}

You may be asked to cough or push so that the provider can check for urine leakage. This type of complete testing can reveal a lot of information about your bladder function.\nFor even more information, x-rays can be taken during the test. In this case, instead of water, a special fluid (contrast) that shows on an x-ray is used to fill your bladder. This type of urodynamics is called videourodynamics.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparations are needed for this test.\nFor infants and children, preparation depends on the child's age, past experiences, and level of trust. For general information regarding how you can prepare your child, see the following topics:\nPreschooler test or procedure preparation\n(3 to 6 years)\nSchool age test or procedure preparation\n(6 to 12 years)\nAdolescent test or procedure preparation\n(12 to 18 years)\nHow the Test will Feel\nThere is some discomfort associated with this test."}

Existing infection increases the possibility of false test results. The test itself increases the possibility of spreading the infection.\nAlternative Names\nCMG; Cystometrogram\nImages\nMale reproductive anatomy\nReferences\nBrucker BM, Nitti VW.
