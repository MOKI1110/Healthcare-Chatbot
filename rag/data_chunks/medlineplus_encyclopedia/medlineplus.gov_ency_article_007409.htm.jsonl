Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nConscious sedation for surgical procedures\nConscious sedation for surgical procedures\nConscious sedation uses a combination of medicines to help you relax (a sedative) and to reduce pain (an analgesic) during a medical or dental procedure. You will probably stay awake, but may feel sleepy and relaxed.\nConscious sedation lets you recover quickly and return to your everyday activities soon after your procedure.\nDescription\nA nurse, health care provider, or dentist, will give you conscious sedation in the hospital or outpatient clinic. Most of the time, it will not be an anesthesiologist. The medicine will wear off quickly, so it is used for short, uncomplicated procedures.\nYou may receive the medicine through an\nintravenous\nline (IV, in a vein) or a shot into a muscle. You will begin to feel drowsy and relaxed very quickly. If your provider gives you the medicine to swallow, you will feel the effects after about 30 to 60 minutes.\nYour breathing will slow and your blood pressure may drop a little."}

Your provider will monitor you during the procedure to make sure you are OK. This provider will stay with you at all times during the procedure.\nYou should not need help with your breathing. But you may receive extra oxygen through a mask or IV fluids through a tube (catheter) into a vein.\nYou may fall asleep, but you will wake up easily to respond to people in the room. You may be able to respond to verbal cues."}

After conscious sedation, you may feel drowsy and not remember much about your procedure.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nConscious sedation is safe and effective for people who need minor surgery or a procedure to diagnose a condition.\nSome of the tests and procedures that conscious sedation may be used for are:\nBreast biopsy\nDental prosthetic or reconstructive surgery\nMinor bone fracture repair\nMinor foot surgery\nMinor skin surgery\nPlastic or reconstructive surgery\nProcedures to diagnose and treat some stomach (\nupper endoscopy\n), colon (\ncolonoscopy\n), lung (\nbronchoscopy\n), and bladder (\ncystoscopy\n) conditions\nRisks\nConscious sedation is usually safe. However, if you are given too much of the medicine, problems with your breathing may occur. A provider will be watching you during the whole procedure.\nProviders always have special equipment to help you with your breathing, if needed."}
