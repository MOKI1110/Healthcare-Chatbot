Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPrimary biliary cholangitis\nPrimary biliary cholangitis\nThe bile ducts are tubes that move\nbile\nfrom the liver to the small intestine. Bile is a substance that helps with digestion. All of the bile ducts together are called the biliary tract.\nWhen the bile ducts become swollen or inflamed, this blocks the flow of bile. These changes can lead to scarring of the liver called cirrhosis. This is called biliary cirrhosis. Advanced cirrhosis can lead to liver failure.\nCauses\nThe cause of inflamed bile ducts in the liver is not known. However, primary biliary cholangitis is an autoimmune disorder. That means your body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. The disease may be linked to\nautoimmune disorders\nsuch as:\nCeliac disease\nRaynaud phenomenon\nSicca syndrome (dry eyes or mouth)\nThyroid disease\nThe disease most often affects middle-aged women.\nSymptoms\nMore than one half of people have no symptoms at the time of diagnosis. Symptoms most often  begin slowly."}

Early symptoms may include:\nNausea and belly pain\nFatigue and loss of energy\nFatty deposits under the skin\nFatty stools\nItching (pruritus)\nPoor appetite and weight loss\nAs liver function worsens, symptoms may include:\nFluid buildup in the legs (edema) and in the abdomen (ascites)\nYellow color in the skin, mucous membranes, or eyes (jaundice)\nRedness on the palms of the hands\nIn men, impotence, shrinking of the testicles, and breast swelling\nEasy bruising and abnormal bleeding, most often from swollen veins in the digestive tract\nConfusion or problems thinking\nPale or clay-colored stools\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will do a physical exam.\nThe following tests can check to see if your liver is working properly:\nAlbumin blood test\nLiver function tests\n(serum alkaline phosphatase is most important)\nProthrombin time\n(PT)\nCholesterol and lipoprotein blood tests\nOther tests that can help measure how severe liver disease may be include:\nElevated immunoglobulin M level in the blood"}

Ursodeoxycholic acid may improve removal of bile from the bloodstream. This may improve survival in some people. A newer drug called obeticholic acid (Ocaliva) is also available.\nVitamin replacement therapy restores vitamins A, K, E and D, which are lost in the fatty stools that may occur in people with primary biliary cholangitis."}

If the condition is not treated, most people will die without a liver transplant. About one quarter of people who have had the disease for 10 years will have liver failure. Doctors can now use a statistical model to predict the best time to do the transplant. Other diseases, such as hypothyroidism and anemia, can also develop.
