The adrenal glands are two triangle-shaped glands. One gland is located on top of each kidney.\nCauses\nACC is most common in children younger than 5 years old and adults in their 40s and 50s.\nThe condition may be linked to a cancer syndrome that is passed down through families (inherited). Both men and women can develop this tumor.\nACC can produce the hormones cortisol, aldosterone, estrogen, or testosterone, as well as other hormones. In women the tumor often releases these hormones, which can lead to male characteristics.\nACC is very rare."}

ACC may not improve with\nchemotherapy\n. Medicines may be given to reduce production of cortisol, which causes many of the symptoms.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome depends on how early the diagnosis is made and whether the tumor has spread (metastasized). Tumors that have spread usually lead to death within 1 to 3 years.\nPossible Complications\nThe tumor can spread to the liver, bone, lung, or other areas.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you or your child has symptoms of ACC,\nCushing syndrome\n, or failure to grow.\nAlternative Names\nTumor - adrenal; ACC - adrenal\nImages\nEndocrine glands\nAdrenal metastases - CT scan\nAdrenal Tumor - CT\nReferences\nHabra M, Else T, Fassnacht M.
