The swelling is due to inflamed blood vessels.\nThe problem may also include nasal discharge or \"runny nose.\" If excess mucus runs down the back of the throat (postnasal drip), it may cause a cough or sore throat.\nConsiderations\nMost of the time, nasal congestion in older children and adolescents is not serious by itself, but can cause other problems.\nWhen nasal stuffiness is just on one side, the child may have inserted something into the nose.\nNasal congestion can interfere with the ears, hearing, and speech development. Congestion that is very bad may interfere with sleep.\nThe mucous drainage may plug up the eustachian tube between the nose and the ear, causing an\near infection\nand pain."}
