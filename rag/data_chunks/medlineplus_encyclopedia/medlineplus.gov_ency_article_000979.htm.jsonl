Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEar wax\nEar wax\nThe ear canal is lined with hair follicles. The ear canal also has glands that produce a waxy oil called cerumen. The wax will most often make its way to the opening of the ear. There it will fall out or be removed by washing.\nWax can build up and block the ear canal. Wax blockage is one of the most common causes of hearing loss.\nCauses\nEar wax protects the ear by:\nTrapping and preventing dust, bacteria, and other germs and small objects from entering and damaging the ear\nProtecting the delicate skin of the ear canal from getting irritated when water is in the canal\nIn some people, the glands produce more wax than can be easily removed from the ear. This extra wax may harden in the ear canal and block the ear, causing an impaction. When you try to clean the ear, you may instead push wax deeper and block the ear canal."}

This extra wax may harden in the ear canal and block the ear, causing an impaction. When you try to clean the ear, you may instead push wax deeper and block the ear canal. For this reason, health care providers recommend against trying to reach into your own ear to clean it.\nSymptoms\nSome of the common symptoms are:\nEarache\nFullness in the ear or a sensation that the ear is plugged\nNoises in the ear (\ntinnitus\n)\nPartial hearing loss, which may get worse\nTreatment\nMost cases of ear wax blockage can be treated at home. The following remedies can be used to soften wax in the ear:\nBaby oil\nCommercial ear drops\nGlycerin\nMineral oil\nWater\nAnother method is to wash out the wax.\nUse body-temperature water (cooler water may cause brief but severe dizziness or\nvertigo\n).\nHold your head upright and straighten the ear canal by holding the outside ear and gently pulling upward.\nUse a syringe (you can buy one at the store) to gently direct a small stream of water against the ear canal wall next to the wax plug.\nTip your head to allow the water to drain."}

You may use a few drops of alcohol in the ear or a hair dryer set on low to help dry the ear.\nYou may clean the outer ear canal by using a cloth or paper tissue wrapped around your finger. Mineral oil can be used to moisturize the ear and prevent the wax from drying.\nDo not clean your ears too often or too hard. Ear wax also helps protect your ears."}

Hearing loss is often temporary. In most cases, hearing returns completely after the blockage is removed. Hearing aid users should have their ear canal checked for excess wax every 3 to 6 months.\nRarely, trying to remove ear wax may cause an infection in the ear canal."}
