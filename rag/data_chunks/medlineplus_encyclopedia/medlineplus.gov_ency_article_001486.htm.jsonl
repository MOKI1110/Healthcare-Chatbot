It is most often seen in rural areas of developing countries. Children are often affected. However, the scarring caused by the infection may not be noticed until later in life. The condition is rare in the United States. However, it is more likely to occur in crowded or unclean living conditions.\nThe bacteria that cause trachoma are spread through direct contact with infected eye, nose, or throat fluids. They can also be passed by contact with contaminated objects, such as towels or clothes. Certain flies can also spread the bacteria.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms begin 5 to 12 days after being exposed to the bacteria. The condition begins slowly. It first appears as inflammation of the tissue lining the eyelids (\nconjunctivitis\n, or \"pink eye\")."}

In certain cases, eyelid surgery may be needed to prevent long-term scarring, which can lead to blindness if not corrected.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nOutcomes are very good if treatment is started early before scarring and changes to the eyelids develop.\nPossible Complications\nIf the eyelids become very irritated, the eyelashes may turn in and rub against the cornea."}
