Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBreast MRI scan\nBreast MRI scan\nA breast\nMRI\nscan is an imaging test that uses powerful magnets and radio waves to create pictures of the breast and surrounding tissue. It does not use radiation (\nx-rays\n).\nA breast MRI is most often done in combination with\nmammography\nor\nultrasound\n. It is not a replacement for mammography.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will wear a hospital gown or clothes without metal snaps or a zipper (sweatpants and a t-shirt). Some types of metal can cause blurry images.\nYou will lie on your stomach on a narrow table with your breasts hanging down into cushioned openings. The table slides into a large tunnel-like tube.\nSome exams require a special dye (contrast). You will get the dye through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. The dye helps the radiology specialist (radiologist) see some areas more clearly.\nDuring the MRI, the person who operates the machine will watch you from another room."}

The test usually lasts 30 to 60 minutes, but may take longer.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou likely won't need to do anything to prepare for the test. Ask your health care provider about eating and drinking before the test.\nTell your provider if you are afraid of tight spaces (have claustrophobia). You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious. Also, your provider may suggest an \"open\" MRI."}

You will need to lie still."}

If medicine is taken, you must have someone drive you home from the facility.\nThe table may be hard or cold, but you can ask for a blanket or pillow. The machine makes loud thumping and humming noises when turned on. You will likely be given ear plugs to help reduce the noise.\nAn intercom in the room lets you speak to someone at any time. Most MRI centers have special headphones for music to help the time pass.\nThere is no recovery time, unless you were given a medicine to relax. After an MRI scan, you can return to your normal diet, activity, and medicines unless your provider tells you otherwise.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nMRI provides detailed pictures of the breast."}

No side effects from the magnetic fields and radio waves have been reported.\nThe most common type of contrast (dye) used is gadolinium. It is very safe. Allergic reactions to this dye are rare.

However, breast MRI may not always be able to distinguish breast cancer from noncancerous breast growths. This can lead to a false-positive result.\nMRI also cannot pick up tiny pieces of calcium (microcalcifications), which a mammogram can detect. Certain types of calcifications can be an indication of breast cancer.\nbiopsy\nis needed to confirm the results of a finding suspicious for cancer on a breast MRI.\nAlternative Names\nMRI - breast; Magnetic resonance imaging - breast; Breast cancer - MRI; Breast cancer screening - MRI\nReferences\nAmerican Cancer Society website."}
