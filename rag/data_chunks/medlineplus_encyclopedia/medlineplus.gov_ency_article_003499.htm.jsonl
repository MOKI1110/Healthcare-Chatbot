Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLDH isoenzyme blood test\nLDH isoenzyme blood test\nThe\nlactate dehydrogenase\n(LDH) isoenzyme test checks how much of the different types of LDH, called isoenzymes, are present in the blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour health care provider may tell you to temporarily stop taking certain medicines before the test.\nMedicines that can increase LDH measurements include:\nAnesthetics\nAspirin\nColchicine\nClofibrate\nCocaine\nFluorides\nMithramycin\nNarcotics\nProcainamide\nStatins\nSteroids (glucocorticoids such as hydrocortisone or prednisone)\nDo not stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel slight pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nLDH is an\nenzyme\nfound in many body tissues such as the heart, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, brain, blood cells, and lungs."}

This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nLDH is an\nenzyme\nfound in many body tissues such as the heart, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, brain, blood cells, and lungs. When body tissue is damaged, LDH is released into the blood.\nThe LDH test helps determine the location of tissue damage.\nLDH exists in five forms, which differ slightly in structure.\nLDH-1 is found primarily in heart muscle and red blood cells.\nLDH-2 is concentrated in white blood cells.\nLDH-3 is highest in the lung.\nLDH-4 is highest in the kidney, placenta, and pancreas.\nLDH-5 is highest in the liver and skeletal muscle.\nAll of these can be measured in the blood.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nLDH levels that are higher than normal may suggest:\nHemolytic anemia\nLow blood pressure (\nhypotension\n)\nInfectious mononucleosis\nIntestinal ischemia (blood deficiency) or infarction (tissue death)\nIschemic cardiomyopathy\nLiver disease such as\nhepatitis\nLung tissue death\nMuscle injury\nMuscular dystrophy\nPancreatitis\nStroke\nRisks\nThere is little risk in having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
