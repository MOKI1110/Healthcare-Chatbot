Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMitral stenosis\nMitral stenosis\nMitral stenosis is a disorder in which the mitral valve does not fully open. This restricts the flow of blood.\nCauses\nBlood that flows between different chambers of your heart must flow through a valve. The valve between the 2 chambers on the left side of your heart is called the mitral valve. It opens up enough so that blood can flow from the upper chamber of your heart (left atrium) to the lower chamber (left ventricle). It then closes, keeping blood from flowing backwards.\nMitral stenosis means that the valve cannot open enough. As a result, less blood flows to the body. The upper heart chamber swells as pressure builds up. Blood and fluid may then collect in the lung tissue (pulmonary edema), making it hard to breathe.\nIn adults, mitral stenosis occurs most often in people who have had rheumatic fever. This is a disease that can develop after an illness with strep throat that was not properly treated.\nThe valve problems develop 5 to 10 years or more after having rheumatic fever. Symptoms may not show up for even longer."}

Symptoms may not show up for even longer. Rheumatic fever is rare in the United States because strep infections are most often treated. This has made mitral stenosis less common.\nRarely, other factors can cause mitral stenosis in adults. These include:\nCalcium deposits forming around the mitral valve\nRadiation treatment to the chest\nSome medicines\nChildren may be born with mitral stenosis (congenital) or other birth defects involving the heart that cause mitral stenosis. Often, there are other heart defects present along with the mitral stenosis.\nMitral stenosis may run in families.\nSymptoms\nAdults may have no symptoms. However, symptoms may appear or get worse with exercise or other activity that raises the heart rate. Symptoms will most often develop between ages 20 and 50.\nSymptoms may begin with an episode of atrial fibrillation (especially if it causes a fast heart rate)."}

The sound often gets louder just before the heart begins to contract.\nThe exam may also reveal an irregular heartbeat or lung congestion. Blood pressure is most often normal.\nNarrowing or blockage of the valve or swelling of the upper heart chambers, or their complications, may be seen on:\nChest x-ray\nEchocardiogram\nECG (electrocardiogram)\nMRI or CT of the heart\nTransesophageal echocardiogram (TEE)\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the symptoms and condition of the heart and lungs.

People who have had rheumatic fever may need long-term preventive treatment with an antibiotic such as penicillin.\nIn the past, most people with heart valve problems were given antibiotics before dental work or invasive procedures, such as colonoscopy. The antibiotics were given to prevent an infection of the damaged heart valve. However, antibiotics are now used much less often."}

Ask your provider whether you need to use antibiotics.\nSome people may need heart surgery or procedures to treat mitral stenosis. These include:\nPercutaneous mitral balloon valvotomy (also called\nvalvuloplasty\n). During this procedure, a tube (catheter) is inserted into a vein, usually in the leg. It is threaded up into the heart. A balloon on the tip of the catheter is inflated, widening the mitral valve and improving blood flow. This procedure may be tried instead of surgery in people with a less damaged mitral valve (especially if the valve does not leak very much). Even when successful, the procedure may need to be repeated months or years later.\nSurgery to repair or\nreplace\nthe mitral valve. Replacement valves can be made from different materials.
