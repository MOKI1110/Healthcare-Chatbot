Fructose is a fruit sugar that naturally occurs in the body. Man-made fructose is used as a sweetener in many foods, including baby food and drinks.\nCauses\nThis condition occurs when the body is missing an enzyme called aldolase B. This substance is needed to break down fructose.\nIf a person without this substance eats fructose or sucrose (cane or beet sugar, table sugar), complicated chemical changes occur in the body. The body cannot change its stored form of sugar (glycogen) into glucose. As a result, blood sugar falls and dangerous substances build up in the liver.\nHereditary fructose intolerance is inherited, which means it can be passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the aldolase B gene, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of being affected."}

If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the aldolase B gene, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of being affected. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms can be seen after a baby starts eating food or formula.\nThe early symptoms of fructose intolerance are similar to those of\ngalactosemia\n(inability to use the sugar galactose). Later symptoms relate more to liver disease.\nSymptoms may include:\nConvulsions\nExcessive sleepiness\nIrritability\nYellow skin or whites of the eyes (jaundice)\nPoor feeding and growth as a baby,\nfailure to thrive\nProblems after eating fruits and other foods that contain fructose or sucrose\nVomiting\nExams and Tests\nPhysical examination may show:\nEnlarged liver\nand\nspleen\nJaundice\nTests that confirm the diagnosis include:\nBlood clotting tests\nBlood sugar test\nEnzyme studies\nGenetic testing\nKidney function tests\nLiver function tests\nLiver biopsy\nUric acid blood test\nUrinalysis\nBlood sugar will be low, especially after receiving fructose or sucrose."}
