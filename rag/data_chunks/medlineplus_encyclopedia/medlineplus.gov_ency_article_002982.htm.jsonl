That means you will be asleep and pain-free.\nHealthy skin is taken from a place on your body called the donor site. Most people who are having a skin graft have a split-thickness skin graft. This takes the two top layers of skin from the donor site (the epidermis) and the layer under the epidermis (the dermis).\nThe donor site can be any area of the body. Most times, it is an area that is hidden by clothes, such as the buttock, back, or inner thigh.\nThe graft is carefully spread on the bare area where it is being transplanted. It is held in place either by gentle pressure from a well-padded dressing that covers it, or by staples or a few small stitches. The donor-site area is covered with a sterile dressing for 3 to 5 days.\nPeople with deeper tissue loss, or in a cosmetic area such as the face, may need a full-thickness skin graft."}

The donor-site area is covered with a sterile dressing for 3 to 5 days.\nPeople with deeper tissue loss, or in a cosmetic area such as the face, may need a full-thickness skin graft. This requires the entire thickness of skin from the donor site, not just the top two layers.\nA full-thickness skin graft is a more complicated procedure. Common donor sites for full-thickness skin grafts include the chest wall, neck, back, or abdominal wall.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nSkin grafts may be recommended for:\nAreas where there has been infection that caused a large amount of skin loss\nBurns\nCosmetic reasons or reconstructive surgeries where there has been skin damage or skin loss\nSkin cancer surgery\nSurgeries that need skin grafts to heal\nVenous ulcers,\npressure ulcers\n, or diabetic ulcers that do not heal\nVery large wounds\nA wound that the surgeon has not been able to close properly\nFull-thickness grafts are sometimes done when a lot of tissue is lost."}

These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\nLet your surgeon know about any illness you may have before your surgery. This includes COVID-19, cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness."}

Full-thickness grafts need a longer recovery time. If you received this kind of graft, you may need to stay in the hospital for recovery.\nAfter you are discharged from the hospital, follow instructions on how to care for your skin graft, including:\nWearing a dressing for 1 to 2 weeks. Ask your provider how you should care for the dressing, such as protecting it from getting wet.\nProtecting the graft from trauma for 3 to 4 weeks. This includes avoiding being hit or doing any exercise that might injure or dislodge the graft.\nGetting physical therapy, if your surgeon recommends it.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost skin grafts are successful, but some do not heal well."}
