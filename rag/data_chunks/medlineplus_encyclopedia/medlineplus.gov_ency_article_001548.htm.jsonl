The movements often increase with stress, frustration, and boredom.\nThe cause of this disorder, when it doesn't occur with other conditions, is unknown.\nStimulant drugs such as cocaine and amphetamines can cause a severe, short period of movement behavior. This may include picking, hand wringing, head tics, or lip-biting."}
