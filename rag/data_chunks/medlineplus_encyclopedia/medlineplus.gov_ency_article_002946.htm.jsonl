You will be asleep (unconscious) and pain-free during surgery.\nOnce you are unconscious, the heart surgeon will make an 8 to 10-inch (20.5 to 25.5 cm) surgical cut in the middle of your chest. Your breastbone will be separated to create an opening. This allows your surgeon to see your heart and aorta, the main blood vessel leading from the heart to the rest of your body.\nMost people who have heart bypass surgery are connected to a heart-lung bypass machine or bypass pump.\nYour heart is stopped while you are connected to this machine.\nThis machine does the work of your heart and lungs while your heart is stopped for the surgery."}

The machine adds oxygen to your blood, moves blood through your body, and removes carbon dioxide.\nAnother type of bypass surgery does not use the heart-lung bypass machine. The procedure is done while your heart is still beating. This is called off-pump coronary artery bypass, or OPCAB.\nDuring bypass surgery:\nThe surgeon will take a vein or artery from another part of your body and use it to make a detour (or graft) around the blocked area in your artery. Your surgeon may use a vein, called the saphenous vein, from your leg.\nTo reach this vein, a surgical cut will be made along the inside of your leg, between your ankle and groin. One end of the graft will be sewn to your coronary artery. The other end will be sewn to an opening made in your aorta.\nA blood vessel in your chest, called the internal mammary artery (IMA), can also be used as the graft. One end of this artery is already connected to a branch of your aorta."}

One end of this artery is already connected to a branch of your aorta. The other end is attached to your coronary artery.\nOther arteries can also be used for grafts in bypass surgery. The most common one is the radial artery in your wrist.\nAfter the graft has been created, your breastbone will be closed with wires. These wires stay inside you. The surgical cut will be closed with stitches.\nThis surgery can take 4 to 6 hours. After the surgery, you will be taken to the intensive care unit.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nYou may need this procedure if you have a blockage in one or more of your coronary arteries. Coronary arteries are the vessels that supply your heart with oxygen and nutrients that are carried in your blood.\nWhen one or more of the coronary arteries becomes partly or totally blocked, your heart does not get enough blood. This is called ischemic heart disease, or coronary artery disease (CAD). It can cause chest pain (\nangina\n).\nCoronary artery bypass surgery can be used to improve blood flow to your heart."}

These might cause increased bleeding during the surgery. They include aspirin, ibuprofen (such as Advil and Motrin), naproxen (such as Aleve and Naprosyn), and other similar medicines. If you are taking clopidogrel (Plavix), talk with your surgeon about when to stop taking it.\nAsk which medicines you should still take on the day of the surgery.\nIf you smoke, try to stop\n. Ask your provider for help.\nContact your provider if you have a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or any other illness.\nPrepare your home\nso you can move around easily when you return from the hospital.\nThe day before your surgery:\nShower and shampoo well.\nYou may be asked to wash your whole body below your neck with a special soap."}

Rinse your mouth with water if it feels dry, but be careful not to swallow.\nTake any medicines that you have been told to take with a small sip of water.\nYou will be told when to arrive at the hospital.\nAfter the Procedure\nAfter the operation, you will spend 3 to 7 days in the hospital. You will spend the first night in an intensive care unit (ICU). You will probably be moved to a regular or transitional care room within 24 to 48 hours after the procedure.\nTwo to three tubes will be in your chest to drain fluid from around your heart.
