It may also occur in people with:\nCardiomyopathy\nHeart failure (also called congestive heart failure)\nHeart surgery\nMyocarditis\nValvular heart disease\nVT can occur without other heart disease.\nScar tissue may form in the muscle of the ventricles days, months, or years after a heart attack. This can lead to ventricular tachycardia.\nVT can also be caused by:\nAnti-arrhythmic drugs (used to treat an abnormal heart rhythm)\nChanges in blood chemistry (such as a low potassium level)\nChanges in blood pH (acid-base)\nLack of enough oxygen\n\"Torsade de pointes\" is a specific form of VT."}

It is often due to\ncongenital heart disease\nor the use of certain medicines.\nSymptoms\nYou may have symptoms if the heart rate during a VT episode is very fast or lasts longer than a few seconds. Symptoms may include:\nChest discomfort\n(\nangina\n)\nFainting\n(syncope)\nLightheadedness or\ndizziness\nSensation of feeling the heart beat (\npalpitations\n)\nShortness of breath\nSymptoms may start and stop suddenly."}

In some cases, there are no symptoms.\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will look for:\nAbsent pulse\nLoss of consciousness\nNormal or low blood pressure\nRapid pulse\nTests that may be used to detect ventricular tachycardia include:\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG)\nHolter monitor\nIntracardiac\nelectrophysiology study\n(EPS)\nRhythm monitoring with a loop recorder or device\nYou may also have\nblood chemistries\nand other tests.\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the symptoms, and the type of heart disorder.\nIf someone with VT is in distress, they may require:\nCardiopulmonary resuscitation\n(CPR)\nCardioversion (electric shock)\nMedicines (such as lidocaine, procainamide, sotalol, or amiodarone) given through a vein\nAfter an episode of VT, steps are taken to prevent further episodes.\nMedicines taken by mouth may be needed for long-term treatment. However, these medicines may have severe side effects."}

However, these medicines may have severe side effects. They are being used less often as other treatments are developed.\nA procedure to destroy the heart tissue that is causing the abnormal heartbeat (called\nablation\n) may be done.\nAn\nimplantable cardioverter defibrillator\n(ICD) may be recommended. It is an implanted device that detects any life-threatening, rapid heartbeat. This abnormal heartbeat is called an arrhythmia. If it occurs, the ICD quickly sends an electrical shock to the heart to change the rhythm back to normal. This is called defibrillation.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome depends on the heart condition and symptoms.\nPossible Complications\nVentricular tachycardia may not cause symptoms in some people. However, it can be deadly. It is a major cause of sudden cardiac death.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nGo to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have a rapid, irregular pulse, faint, or have\nchest pain\n."}
