It can also be used to burn and thus seal blood vessels. This helps reduce or stop bleeding during surgery or after an injury. It is a safe procedure.\nA small probe with an electric current running through it is used to burn or destroy the tissue. A grounding pad is placed on the body (usually the thigh) before the surgery to protect the person from the harmful effects of the electricity.\nAlternative Names\nCauterization\nReferences\nPfenninger JL.
