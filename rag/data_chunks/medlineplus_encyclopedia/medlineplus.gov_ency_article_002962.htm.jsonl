Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBunion removal\nBunion removal\nBunion\nremoval is surgery to treat deformed bones of the big toe and foot. A bunion occurs when the big toe points outward toward the second toe, forming a bump on the inner side of the foot.\nDescription\nYou will be given anesthesia (numbing medicine) so that you won't feel pain.\nLocal anesthesia -- Your foot may be numbed with pain medicine. You may also be given medicines that relax you. You will stay awake.\nSpinal anesthesia --\nThe pain medicine is injected into a space in your spine. You will be awake but will not be able to feel anything below your waist.\nRegional anesthesia -- The pain medicine is injected into your leg. It will numb your lower leg and foot. You may still require general anesthesia to make you sleep through the procedure. However, the amount of anesthesia needed is much less as you cannot feel your leg during surgery.\nGeneral anesthesia --\nYou will be asleep and pain-free.\nThe surgeon makes a cut around the toe joint and bones."}
