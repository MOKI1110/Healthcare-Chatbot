Immunoglobulins are proteins that function as\nantibodies\n, which fight infection. There are many types of immunoglobulins that fight different types of infections. Some immunoglobulins can be abnormal and may be due to some types of\ncancer\n.\nImmunoglobulins can also be measured in the\nurine\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample is needed\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no special preparation for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is most often used to check the types and amounts of immunoglobulins when certain cancers and other disorders are present or suspected.\nNormal Results\nA normal (negative) result means that the blood sample had normal types and amounts of immunoglobulins. The level of  one immunoglobulin was not higher than any other.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be due to:\nAmyloidosis\n(buildup of abnormal proteins in tissues and organs)\nLeukemia\n(cancer of the bone marrow)\nWaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia\n(a type of lymphoma)\nLymphoma (cancer of the lymph tissue)\nMonoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS, a type of blood disorder)\nMultiple myeloma\n(a type of blood cancer)\nOther cancers\nInfection\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from  one person to another and from  one side of the body to the other."}
