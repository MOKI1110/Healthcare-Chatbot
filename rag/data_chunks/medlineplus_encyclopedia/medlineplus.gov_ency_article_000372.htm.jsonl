They can cause problems with the removal of waste from the body in the urine.\nCauses\nThe urea cycle is a process in which waste (ammonia) is removed from the body. When you eat proteins, the body breaks them down into amino acids. Ammonia is produced from leftover amino acids, and it must be removed from the body.\nThe liver produces several chemicals (enzymes) that change ammonia into a form called urea, which the body can remove in the urine. If this process is disturbed, ammonia levels begin to rise.\nSeveral inherited conditions can cause problems with this waste-removal process."}

If this process is disturbed, ammonia levels begin to rise.\nSeveral inherited conditions can cause problems with this waste-removal process. People with a urea cycle disorder have a defective gene that makes the enzymes needed to break down ammonia in the body.\nThese diseases include:\nArgininosuccinic aciduria\nArginase deficiency\nCarbamyl phosphate synthetase (CPS) deficiency\nCitrullinemia\nN-acetylglutamate synthetase (NAGS) deficiency\nOrnithine transcarbamylase (OTC) deficiency\nAs a group, these disorders occur in 1 in 30,000 newborns. OTC deficiency is the most common of these disorders.\nBecause this is an X-linked condition, boys are more often affected by OTC deficiency than girls. Girls are rarely affected with OTC. Those girls who are affected have milder symptoms and can develop the disease later in life. Because they are autosomal recessive conditions, the other conditions that cause this problem affect both girls and boys equally.\nTo get the other types of disorders, you need to receive a non-working copy of the gene from both parents."}

Sometimes parents don't know they carry a non-working copy of the gene until their child gets the disorder.\nSymptoms\nTypically, an affected baby begins nursing well and seems normal. However, over time the baby develops poor feeding, vomiting, and sleepiness, which may be so deep that the baby is difficult to awaken. This most often occurs within the first week after birth.\nSymptoms include:\nConfusion\nDecreased food intake\nDislike of foods that contain protein\nIncreased sleepiness, difficulty waking up\nNausea, vomiting\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will often diagnose these disorders when the child is still an infant.\nSigns may include:\nAbnormal amino acids in blood and urine\nAbnormal level of orotic acid in blood or urine\nHigh blood ammonia level\nNormal level of acid in blood\nTests may include:\nArterial blood gas\nBlood ammonia\nBlood glucose\nPlasma amino acids\nUrine organic acids\nGenetic tests\nLiver biopsy\nMRI\nor\nCT scan\nTreatment\nLimiting protein in the diet can help treat"}

(The waste is in the form of ammonia.) Special low-protein infant and toddler formulas are available.\nIt is important that a provider guides the baby's protein intake. The provider can balance the amount of protein the baby gets so that it is enough for growth, but not enough to cause symptoms.\nIt is very important for people with these disorders to avoid fasting.\nPeople with urea cycle abnormalities must also be very careful under times of physical stress, such as when they have infections. Stress, such as a fever, can cause the body to break down its own proteins. These extra proteins can make it hard for the abnormal urea cycle to remove the byproducts.\nDevelop a plan with your provider for when you are sick to avoid all protein, drink high carbohydrate drinks, and get enough fluids.\nMost people with urea cycle disorders will need to stay in the hospital at some point."}

During such times, they may be treated with medicines that help the body remove nitrogen-containing wastes. Dialysis may help rid the body of excess ammonia during extreme illness. Some people may need a liver transplant.\nSupport Groups\nRareConnect: Urea Cycle Disorder Official Community --\nwww.rareconnect.org/en/community/urea-cycle-disorders\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well people do depends on:\nWhich urea cycle abnormality they have\nHow severe it is\nHow early it is discovered\nHow closely they follow a protein-restricted diet\nBabies diagnosed in the first week of life and put on a protein-restricted diet right away may do well.\nSticking to the diet can lead to normal adult intelligence.
