CGD is characterized by repeated and severe infections.\nCauses\nIn CGD, immune system cells called phagocytes are unable to kill some types of bacteria and fungi. This disorder leads to long-term (\nchronic\n) and repeated (recurrent) infections. The condition is often discovered very early in childhood. Milder forms may be diagnosed during the teenage years, or even in adulthood.\nRisk factors include a family history of recurrent or chronic infections.\nAbout half of CGD cases are passed down through families as a\nsex-linked recessive trait\n. This means that boys are more likely to get the disorder than girls. The variant gene is carried on the X chromosome. Boys have 1 X chromosome and 1 Y chromosome. If a boy has an X chromosome with the variant gene, he may inherit this condition. Girls have 2 X chromosomes."}

If a girl has 1 X chromosome with the variant gene, the other X chromosome may have a working gene to make up for it. A girl must inherit the variant X gene from each parent in order to have the disease.\nSymptoms\nCGD can cause many types of skin infections that are hard to treat, including:\nBlisters or sores on the face (\nimpetigo\n)\nEczema\nGrowths filled with pus (\nabscesses\n)\nPus-filled lumps in the skin (\nboils\n)\nCGD can also cause:\nPersistent diarrhea\nSwollen lymph nodes\nin the neck\nLung infections, such as pneumonia or lung abscess\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will do an exam and may find:\nLiver swelling\nSpleen swelling\nSwollen lymph nodes\nThere may be signs of a bone infection, which may affect many bones.\nTests that may be done include:\nBone scan\nChest x-ray\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nFlow cytometry tests to help confirm the diagnosis\nGenetic testing to confirm the diagnosis\nTest of white blood cell function\nTissue\nbiopsy\nTreatment\nAntibiotics are used to treat infec"}

Chronic use of antibiotics may prevent infections. A medicine called interferon-gamma may also help reduce the number of severe infections. Surgery may be needed to treat some abscesses.\nThe only cure for CGD is a bone marrow or\nstem cell transplant\n.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nLong-term antibiotic treatments may help reduce infections, but early death can occur from repeated lung infections.\nPossible Complications\nCGD may cause these complications:\nBone damage and infections\nChronic infections in the nose\nPneumonia\nthat keeps coming back and is hard to cure\nLung damage\nSkin damage\nSwollen lymph nodes that stay swollen, occur often, or form abscesses that need surgery to drain them\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIf you or your child has this condition and you suspect pneumonia or another infection, contact your provider right away.\nTell your provider if a lung, skin, or other infection does not respond to treatment.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling\nis reco"}
