The monitor senses the pressure inside the skull and sends measurements to a recording device.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThere are three ways to monitor ICP. ICP is the pressure inside the skull. These procedures are most often done on people with life-threatening neurological emergencies.\nINTRAVENTRICULAR CATHETER\nThe intraventricular catheter is the most accurate monitoring method.\nTo insert an intraventricular catheter, a hole is drilled through the skull. The catheter is inserted through the brain into the lateral ventricle. This area of the brain contains cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a liquid that protects the brain and spinal cord.\nThe intraventricular catheter can also be used to drain fluid out through the catheter.\nThe catheter may be hard to get into place when the intracranial pressure is high.\nSUBDURAL SCREW (BOLT)\nThis method is used if monitoring needs to be done right away."}

A hollow screw is inserted through a hole drilled in the skull. It is placed through the membrane that protects the brain and spinal cord (dura mater). This allows the sensor to record from inside the subdural space.\nEPIDURAL SENSOR\nAn epidural sensor is inserted between the skull and dural tissue. The epidural sensor is placed through a hole drilled in the skull. This procedure is less invasive than other methods, but it cannot remove excess CSF.\nFirst the area is shaved and cleansed with antiseptic.\nAfter the area is dry, a surgical cut is made. The skin is pulled back until the skull is seen.\nA drill is then used to cut through the bone.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nMost of the time, this procedure is done when a person is in the hospital intensive care unit. If you are awake and aware, your health care provider will explain the procedure and the risks."}

If you are awake and aware, your health care provider will explain the procedure and the risks. You will have to sign a consent form.\nHow the Test will Feel\nIf the procedure is done using\ngeneral anesthesia\n, you will be asleep and pain-free. When you wake up, you will feel the normal side effects of anesthesia. You will also have some discomfort from the cut made in your skull.\nIf the procedure is done under local anesthesia, you will be awake. Numbing medicine will be injected in the place where the cut is to be made. This will feel like a prick on your scalp, like a bee sting. You may feel a tugging sensation as the skin is cut and pulled back. You will hear a drill sound as it cuts through the skull. The amount of time this takes will depend on the type of drill that is used. You will also feel a tugging as the surgeon sutures the skin back together after the procedure.\nYour provider may give you mild pain medicines to ease your discomfort."}

You may not get strong pain medicines, because your provider will want to check for signs of brain function.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is most often done to measure ICP. It may be done when there is a severe head injury or brain disease. It also may be done after surgery to remove a tumor or fix damage to a blood vessel if the surgeon is worried about brain swelling.\nHigh ICP can be treated by draining CSF through the catheter. It can also be treated by:\nChanging the ventilator settings for people who are on a respirator\nGiving certain medicines through a vein (intravenously)\nNormal Results\nNormally, the ICP ranges from 1 to 20 mm Hg.\nTalk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nHigh ICP means that both nervous system and blood vessel tissues are under pressure. If not treated, this can lead to permanent damage."}
