It occurs in people with\nrheumatoid arthritis\nwho have breathed in dust, such as from coal (\ncoal worker's pneumoconiosis\nsilica\n.\nCauses\nRP is caused by breathing in inorganic dust. This is dust that comes from grinding metals, minerals, or rock. After the dust enters the lungs, it causes inflammation. This can lead to the formation of many small lumps in the lungs and an airway disease similar to mild asthma.\nIt is not clear how RP develops. There are two theories:\nWhen people breathe in inorganic dust, it affects their immune system and leads to rheumatoid arthritis (RA)."}

RA is an\nautoimmune disease\nin which the body's immune system attacks healthy body tissue by mistake.\nWhen people who already have RA or are at high risk for it are exposed to mineral dust, they develop RP.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of RP are:\nCough\nJoint swelling\nand pain\nLumps under the skin (rheumatoid nodules)\nShortness of breath\nWheezing\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will take a detailed medical history.

Since your lungs are already damaged, it's very important to have the infection treated promptly."}
