The urethra (the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside the body) does not end at the tip of the\npenis\n. Instead, it ends on the underside of the penis. In more severe cases, the urethra opens at the middle or bottom of the penis, or in or behind the scrotum.\nDescription\nHypospadias\nrepair is done most often when boys are between 6 months and 2 years old. The surgery is done as an outpatient. The child rarely has to spend a night in the hospital. Boys who are born with hypospadias should not be circumcised at birth. The extra tissue of the foreskin may be needed to repair the hypospadias during surgery.\nBefore surgery, your child will receive general anesthesia. This will make him sleep and make him unable to feel pain during surgery. Mild defects may be repaired in one procedure."}

This will make him sleep and make him unable to feel pain during surgery. Mild defects may be repaired in one procedure. Severe defects may need two or more procedures.\nThe surgeon will use a small piece of foreskin or tissue from another site to create a tube that increases the length of the urethra. Extending the length of the urethra will allow it to open at the tip of the penis.\nDuring surgery, the surgeon may place a catheter (tube) in the urethra to make it hold its new shape. The catheter may be sewn or fastened to the head of the penis to keep it in place. It will be removed 1 to 2 weeks after surgery.\nMost of the stitches used during surgery will dissolve on their own and will not have to be removed later.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nHypospadias is one of the most common birth defects in boys."}

If your child is ill, the surgery may be delayed.\nAfter the Procedure\nRight after surgery, your child's penis may be taped to his belly so that it does not move.\nOften, a bulky dressing or plastic cup is placed over the penis to protect the surgical area. A urinary catheter (a tube used to drain urine from the bladder) will be put through the dressing so urine can flow into the diaper.\nYour child will be encouraged to drink fluids so that he will urinate. Urinating will keep pressure from building up in the urethra.\nYour child may be given medicine to relieve pain."}

Most children do well after this surgery. The penis will look almost or completely normal and function well.\nIf your child has a complicated hypospadias, he may need more operations to improve the penis appearance or to repair a hole or narrowing in the urethra.\nFollow-up visits with a urologist may be needed after the surgery has healed."}
