Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nThroat or larynx cancer\nThroat or larynx cancer\nThroat cancer is cancer of the vocal cords, larynx (voice box), pharynx, or other areas of the throat.\nCauses\nPeople who smoke or use tobacco are at risk for developing throat cancer. Drinking too much alcohol over a long time also increases risk. People who both smoke and drink alcohol have the highest risk for throat cancer.\nMost throat cancers develop in adults older than 50. Men are more likely than women to develop throat cancer.\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) infections (the same virus that causes genital warts) account for a larger number of oral and throat cancers than in the past."}

One type of HPV, type 16 or HPV-16, is much more commonly associated with almost all throat cancers.\nWatch this video about:\nCancer of the throat or larynx\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of throat cancer include any of the following:\nAbnormal (high-pitched) breathing sounds\nCough\nCoughing up blood\nDifficulty swallowing\nHoarseness that does not get better in 3 to 4 weeks\nNeck or ear pain\nSore throat that does not get better in 2 to 3 weeks, even with antibiotics\nSwelling or lumps in the neck\nWeight loss not due to dieting\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam. This may show a lump on the outside of the neck.\nThe provider may look in your throat or nose using a flexible tube with a small camera at the end.\nOther tests that may be ordered include:\nBiopsy\nof suspected tumor."}

If this is not possible, the voice box is removed. This surgery is called a\nlaryngectomy\n.\nDepending on what type of treatment you require, supportive treatments that may be needed include:\nSpeech therapy.\nTherapy to help with chewing and swallowing.\nLearning to eat enough protein and calories to keep your weight up."}

Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThroat cancers may be cured when detected early. If the cancer has not spread (\nmetastasized\n) to surrounding tissues or lymph nodes in the neck, about one half of patients can be cured. If the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and parts of the body outside the head and neck, the cancer is not curable. Treatment is aimed at prolonging and improving quality of life.\nIt is possible but not fully proven that cancers which test positive for HPV may have better outlooks. Also, people who smoked for less than 10 years may do better.\nAfter treatment, therapy is needed to help with speech and swallowing."}
