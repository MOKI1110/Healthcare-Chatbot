Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTraumatic injury of the bladder and urethra\nTraumatic injury of the bladder and urethra\nTraumatic injury of the bladder and urethra involves damage caused by an outside force.\nCauses\nTypes of bladder injuries include:\nBlunt trauma (such as a blow to the body)\nPenetrating wounds (such as bullet or stab wounds)\nThe amount of injury to the bladder depends on:\nHow full the bladder was at the time of injury\nWhat caused the injury\nInjury to the bladder due to trauma is not very common. The bladder is located within the bones of the pelvis. This protects it from most outside forces. Injury may occur if there is a blow to the pelvis severe enough to break the bones. In this case, bone fragments may pierce the bladder wall. Less than 1 in 10 pelvic fractures lead to bladder injury.\nOther causes of bladder or urethra injury include:\nSurgeries of the pelvis or groin (such as hernia repair and\nremoval of the uterus\n).\nTears, cuts, bruises, and other injuries to the urethra. The urethra is the tube that carries urine out of the body."}

This injury may occur if there is direct force that injures the area behind the scrotum.\nDeceleration injury. This injury may occur during a motor vehicle accident. Your bladder can get injured if it is full and you are wearing a seatbelt.\nInjury to the bladder or urethra may cause urine to leak into the abdomen. This may\nlead to infection\n.\nSymptoms\nSome common symptoms are:\nLower\nabdominal pain\nAbdominal tenderness\nBruising at the site of injury\nBlood in the urine\nBloody urethral discharge\nDifficulty beginning to urinate\nor inability to empty the bladder\nLeakage of urine\nPainful urination\nPelvic pain\nSmall, weak urine stream\nAbdominal distention or bloating\nShock\nor internal bleeding may occur after a bladder injury. This is a medical emergency."}

If the health care provider suspects an injury, you may have the following tests:\nRetrograde urethrogram (an x-ray of the urethra using dye) for injury of urethra\nRetrograde cystogram (imaging of bladder) for injury of the bladder\nCT scan\nThe exam may also show:\nBladder injury or swollen (distended) bladder\nOther signs of pelvic injury, such as bruising over the penis, scrotum, and perineum\nSigns of hemorrhage or shock, including decreased blood pressure -- especially in cases of pelvic fracture\nTenderness and bladder fullness when touched (caused by urine retention)\nTender and unstable pelvic bones\nUrine in the abdominal cavity\nA urinary"}

The bladder may be drained by a catheter through the urethra or the abdominal wall (called a suprapubic tube) over a period of days to weeks.

This will prevent urine from building up in the bladder. It will also allow the injured bladder or urethra to heal and prevent swelling in the urethra from blocking urine flow.\nIf the urethra has been cut, a urological specialist (urologist) can try to put a catheter in place. If this cannot be done, a tube will be inserted through the abdominal wall directly into the bladder. This is called a suprapubic tube. It will be left in place until the swelling goes away and the urethra can be repaired with surgery. This takes 3 to 6 months.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nInjury of the bladder and urethra due to trauma can be minor or fatal. Short- or long-term serious complications can occur.\nPossible Complications\nSome of the possible complications of injury of the bladder and urethra are:\nBleeding, shock.\nBlockage to the flow of urine\n."}
