Tissue around the lump is also removed. This surgery is called an excisional breast biopsy, or lumpectomy.\nWhen a noncancerous tumor such as a\nfibroadenoma\nof the breast is removed, this is also called an excisional breast biopsy, or a lumpectomy.\nDescription\nSometimes, the health care provider cannot feel the lump when examining you. However, it can be seen on imaging results, such as a mammogram or ultrasound. In this case, a wire localization will be done before the surgery.\nA radiologist will use a\nmammogram\nor\nultrasound\nto place a needlewire (or needlewires) in or near the abnormal breast area.\nThis will help the surgeon know where the lump is so that it can be removed.\nBreast lump removal is done as an outpatient surgery most of the time. You will be given\ngeneral anesthesia\n(you will be asleep, but pain free) or local anesthesia (you are lightly sedated and pain free)."}

You will be given\ngeneral anesthesia\n(you will be asleep, but pain free) or local anesthesia (you are lightly sedated and pain free). The procedure takes about 1 hour.\nThe surgeon makes a small cut on your breast. The lump and some of the normal breast tissue around it is removed. If a lump is known to be cancerous, a pathologist examines a sample of the removed tissue to make sure all the cancer has been taken out.\nWhen no cancer cells are found near the edges of the removed tissue, it is called a clear margin.\nYour surgeon may also remove some or all of the lymph nodes in your armpit to see if the cancer has spread to them.\nOften, small metal clips will be placed inside the breast to mark the area of tissue removal, especially if there is a concern for cancer. This makes the area easy to see on future mammograms. It also helps guide radiation therapy, when needed.\nThe surgeon will close your skin with stitches or staples. These may dissolve or need to be removed later. Rarely, a drain tube may be placed to remove extra fluid."}

It may be hard to know whether lumpectomy or mastectomy (removal of the entire breast) is best. You and the providers who are treating your breast cancer will decide together. In general:\nLumpectomy is often preferred for smaller\nbreast lumps\n. This is because it is a smaller procedure and it has about the same chance of curing breast cancer as a\nmastectomy\n."}

It is a good option as you get to keep most of your breast tissue that has not been affected by cancer.\nMastectomy to remove all breast tissue may be done if the area of cancer is too large or there are multiple tumors which cannot be removed without deforming the breast.\nYou and your provider should consider:\nThe size of your tumor\nWhere it is in your breast\nIf there is more than one tumor\nHow much of the breast is affected\nThe size of your breasts in relation to the tumor\nYour age\nYour family history\nYour general health, including whether you have reached menopause\nIf you are pregnant\nIf you are not a candidate for additional treatment such as radiation\nRisks\nRisks for surgery are:\nBleeding\nInfection\nPoor wound healing\nHeart attack\n,\nstroke\n, death\nReactions to medicines\nRisks associated with general anesthesia\nThe appearance of your breast may change after surgery.
