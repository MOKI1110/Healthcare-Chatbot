It affects mostly young children. This may be due to their tracheas being smaller and more easily blocked by swelling.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nDeep\ncough\n(similar to that caused by\ncroup\n)\nDifficulty breathing\nHigh\nfever\nHigh-pitched breathing sound (\nstridor\n)\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and listen to the child's lungs. The muscles between the ribs may pull in as the child tries to breathe. This is called\nintercostal retractions\n.\nTests that may be done to diagnose this condition include:\nBlood oxygen level\nNasopharyngeal culture\nto look for bacteria\nTracheal culture to look for bacteria\nX-ray\nof the trachea or neck\nTracheoscopy\nTreatment\nThe child often needs to have a tube placed into the airways to help with breathing. This is called an endotracheal tube."}

This is called an endotracheal tube. Bacterial debris often needs to be removed from the trachea at that time.\nThe child will receive antibiotics through a vein. The health care team will closely monitor the child's breathing and use oxygen, if needed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWith prompt treatment, the child should recover.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nAirway obstruction\n(can lead to death)\nToxic shock syndrome\nif the condition was caused by the bacteria staphylococcus\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nTracheitis is an emergency medical condition.
