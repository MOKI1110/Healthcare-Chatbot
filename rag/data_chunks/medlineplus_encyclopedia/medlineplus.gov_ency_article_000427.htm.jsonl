The pain is most often accompanied by fatigue, sleep problems, difficulty concentrating, headaches, depression, and anxiety.\nPeople with fibromyalgia may also have tenderness in the joints, muscles, tendons, and other soft tissues.\nCauses\nThe cause of fibromyalgia is not known. Researchers think that it is due to a problem with how the central nervous system processes pain signals from nerves. Possible causes or triggers of fibromyalgia include:\nPhysical or emotional trauma.\nAbnormal pain response: Areas in the brain that control pain may react differently in people with fibromyalgia.\nSleep disturbances.\nInfection, such as a virus, although none has been identified.\nFibromyalgia is more common in females as compared to males."}

Fibromyalgia appears to be on one end of a range of chronic widespread pain, which may be present in 10% to 15% of the general population. Fibromyalgia falls on the far end of that pain severity and chronicity scale and occurs in 1% to 5% of the general population.\nThe central feature of fibromyalgia is chronic pain in multiple sites."}

Fibromyalgia falls on the far end of that pain severity and chronicity scale and occurs in 1% to 5% of the general population.\nThe central feature of fibromyalgia is chronic pain in multiple sites. These sites are the head, each arm, the chest, the abdomen, each leg, the upper back and spine, and the lower back and spine (including the buttocks).\nThe pain may be mild to severe.\nIt may feel like a deep ache, or a stabbing, burning pain.\nIt may feel like it is coming from the joints, although the joints are not affected or damaged and appear normal.\nPeople with fibromyalgia tend to wake up with body pain and stiffness. For some people, pain improves during the day and gets worse at night. Some people have pain all day long.\nPain may get worse with:\nPhysical activity\nCold or damp weather\nAnxiety and stress\nMost people with fibromyalgia have at least one of these symptoms: fatigue, depressed mood, or sleep problems."}

These disorders include:\nRheumatoid arthritis\nOsteoarthritis\nSpondyloarthritis\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\nTreatment\nThe goals of treatment are to help relieve pain and other symptoms, to reduce disability, and to help the person cope with the symptoms.\nThe first type of treatment may involve:\nPhysical therapy\nAn exercise and fitness program\nStress-relief methods, including light massage and relaxation techniques\nIf these treatments do not work, your provider may also prescribe an antidepressant or muscle relaxant."}
