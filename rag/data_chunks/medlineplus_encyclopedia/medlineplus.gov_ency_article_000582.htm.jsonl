Platelets help the blood clot. Congenital means present from birth.\nCauses\nCongenital platelet function defects are bleeding disorders that cause reduced platelet function.\nMost of the time, people with these disorders have a family history of a bleeding disorder, such as:\nBernard-Soulier syndrome which occurs when platelets lack a substance that sticks to the walls of blood vessels. Platelets are typically large and reduced in number. This disorder may cause severe bleeding.\nGlanzmann thrombasthenia\n,  a condition caused by the lack of a protein needed for platelets to clump together. Platelets are typically of normal size and number."}

Platelets are typically of normal size and number. This disorder may also cause severe bleeding.\nPlatelet storage pool disorder (also called platelet secretion disorder) which occurs when substances called granules inside platelets aren't stored or released properly. Granules help platelets function properly. This disorder causes easy bruising or bleeding.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nExcessive bleeding during and after surgery\nBleeding gums\nEasy bruising or pinpoint red spots on the skin (\npetechiae\n)\nHeavy menstrual periods\nNosebleeds\nProlonged bleeding with small injuries\nExams and Tests\nThe following tests may be used to diagnose this condition:\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nPartial thromboplastin time\n(PTT)\nPlatelet aggregation test\nProthrombin time\n(PT)\nPlatelet function analysis\nFlow cytometry\nYou may need other tests. Your relatives may need to be tested.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for these disorders."}

However, your health care provider will likely monitor your condition.\nYou may also need:\nTo avoid taking aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen and naproxen, because they can worsen bleeding symptoms.\nPlatelet transfusions, such as during surgery or dental procedures.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThere is no cure for congenital platelet function disorders. Most of the time, treatment can control the bleeding.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nSevere bleeding\nIron deficiency anemia\nin menstruating women\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nYou have bleeding or bruising and do not know the cause.\nBleeding does not respond to the usual method of control.\nPrevention\nA blood test can detect the gene responsible for the platelet defect."}
