It mostly affects the bones and joints at the base of the spine where it connects with the pelvis. These joints can become swollen and inflamed. Over time, the affected spinal bones may join together.\nCauses\nAS is the main member of a family of similar forms of arthritis called spondyloarthritis. Other members include psoriatic arthritis, arthritis of inflammatory bowel disease and reactive arthritis. This family of arthritis affects up to 1 in 100 people.\nThe cause of AS is unknown, however genes seem to play a role. The majority of people with AS are positive for the\nHLA-B27\ngene, but not everyone who has this gene has AS.\nThe disease often begins between ages 20 and 40, but it may begin before age 10."}

It affects more males than females.\nSymptoms\nAS starts with lower back pain that comes and goes but usually becomes present most of the time as the condition progresses.\nPain and stiffness are worse at night, in the morning, or when you are less active. The discomfort may wake you from sleep.\nThe pain often gets better with activity or exercise.\nBack pain may begin in the joint between the pelvis and spine (sacroiliac joints). Over time, it may involve all or part of the spine.\nYour lower spine may become less flexible."}

These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn).\nOther NSAIDs are prescribed by your provider.\nTalk to your provider or pharmacist before daily long-term use of any over-the-counter NSAID.\nYou may also need stronger medicines to control pain and swelling, such as:\nCorticosteroid therapy (such as prednisone) used for short periods of time\nSulfasalazine\nA biologic tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor (such as etanercept, adalimumab, infliximab, certolizumab or golimumab)\nA biologic inhibitor of IL17A, secukinumab\nSurgery, such as hip replacement, may be done if pain or joint damage is severe.\nExercises can help improve posture and breathing.
