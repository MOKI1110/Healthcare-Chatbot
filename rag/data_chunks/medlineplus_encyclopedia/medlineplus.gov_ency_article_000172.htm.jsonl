Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nThromboangiitis obliterans\nThromboangiitis obliterans\nThromboangiitis obliterans is a rare disease in which blood vessels of the hands and feet become blocked.\nCauses\nThromboangiitis obliterans (Buerger disease) causes small blood vessels to become inflamed and swollen. The blood vessels then narrow or get blocked by blood clots (thrombosis). Blood vessels of the hands and feet are mostly affected. Arteries are more affected than veins. Average age when symptoms begin is around 35. Women and older adults are affected less often.\nThis condition mostly affects men ages 20 to 45 who are heavy smokers or chew tobacco. Female smokers may also be affected. The condition affects more people in the Middle East, Asia, the Mediterranean, and Eastern Europe. Many people with this problem have poor dental health, most likely due to tobacco use.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms most often affect 2 or more limbs and may include:\nFingers or toes that appear pale, red, or bluish and feel cold to the touch.\nSudden severe pain in the hands and feet."}

The pain may feel like a burning or tingling sensation.\nPain in the hands and feet that most often occurs when at rest. The pain may be worse when the hands and feet get cold or during emotional stress.\nPain in the legs\n, ankles, or feet when walking (intermittent claudication). The pain is often located in the arch of the foot.\nSkin changes or small painful ulcers on the fingers or toes.\nOccasionally, arthritis in the wrists or knees develops before the blood vessels become blocked.\nExams and Tests\nThe following tests may show blockage of blood vessels in the affected hands or feet:\nPlethysmography\nexam of the extremity, including pulse volume recording\nDoppler ultrasound of the blood vessels in the extremity\nCatheter-based\nx-ray arteriogram\nBlood tests for other causes of inflamed blood vessels (\nvasculitis\n) and blocked (occlusion of) blood vessels may be done. These causes include\ndiabetes\n,\nscleroderma\n, vasculitis, hypercoagulability, and\natherosclerosis\n."}

There are no blood tests that diagnose thromboangiitis obliterans.\nA heart echocardiogram may be done to look for sources of blood clots. In rare cases when the diagnosis is unclear, a\nbiopsy\nof the blood vessel is done.\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for thromboangiitis obliterans. The goal of treatment is to control symptoms and prevent the disease from getting worse.\nStopping tobacco use of any kind is key to controlling the disease. Smoking cessation treatments are strongly recommended. It is also important to avoid cold temperatures and other conditions that reduce blood flow in the hands and feet.\nApplying warmth and doing gentle exercises can help increase circulation.\nAspirin and medicines that open the blood vessels (vasodilators) may help. In very bad cases, surgery to cut the nerves to the area (surgical sympathectomy) can help control pain."}

Rarely, bypass surgery is considered in certain people.\nIt may become necessary to amputate the fingers or toes if the area becomes very infected and tissue dies.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSymptoms of thromboangiitis obliterans may go away if the person stops tobacco use. People who continue to use tobacco may need repeated amputations.\nPossible Complications\nComplications include:\nTissue death (\ngangrene\n)\nAmputation of fingers or toes\nLoss of blood flow in the limb of the affected fingers or toes\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if:\nYou have symptoms of thromboangiitis obliterans.\nYou have thromboangiitis obliterans and symptoms get worse, even with treatment.\nYou develop new symptoms.\nPrevention\nPeople with a history of\nRaynaud phenomenon\nor blue, painful fingers or toes, especially with ulcers, should not use any form of tobacco.\nAlternative Names\nBuerger disease\nImages\nThromboangiitis obliterans\nCirculatory system\nReferences\nAkar AR, Ãnan MB, Sar"}
