The clean-catch method is used to prevent germs from the penis or vagina from getting into a urine sample. To collect your urine, your health care provider may give you a special clean-catch kit that contains a cleansing solution and sterile wipes.

There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test helps check your body's water balance and urine concentration.\nUrine osmolality is a more exact measurement of urine concentration than the\nurine specific gravity\ntest.\nNormal Results\nNormal values are as follows:\nRandom specimen: 50 to 1200 mOsm/kg (50 to 1200 mmol/kg)\n12 to 14 hour fluid restriction: Greater than 850 mOsm/kg (850 mmol/kg)\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}
