You may feel it in your groin or pain in your thigh or knee.\nCauses\nHip pain may be caused by problems in the bones or cartilage of your hip, including:\nHip fractures\n-- can cause sudden and acute hip pain. These injuries can be serious and lead to major problems. It is more common in older patients because their bones can be weaker.\nInfection in the\nbones\nor\njoints\n.\nOsteonecrosis of the hip (necrosis from loss of blood supply to the bone).\nArthritis\n-- often felt in the front part of the thigh or groin.\nLabral tear of the hip.\nFemoral acetabular impingement -- abnormal growth around your hip that is a precursor to hip arthritis."}
