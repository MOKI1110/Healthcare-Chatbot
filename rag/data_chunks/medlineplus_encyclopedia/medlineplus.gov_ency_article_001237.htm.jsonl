Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nIngrown toenail\nIngrown toenail\nAn ingrown toenail occurs when the edge of the nail grows into the skin of the toe.\nCauses\nAn ingrown toenail can result from a number of things. Poorly fitting shoes and toenails that are not properly trimmed are the most common causes. The skin along the edge of a toenail may become red and infected. The great toe is affected most often, but any toenail can become ingrown.\nAn ingrown toenail may occur when extra pressure is placed on your toe. This pressure is caused by shoes that are too tight or fit poorly. If you walk often or play sports, a shoe that is even a little tight can cause this problem."}

This pressure is caused by shoes that are too tight or fit poorly. If you walk often or play sports, a shoe that is even a little tight can cause this problem. Deformities of the foot or toes can also place extra pressure on the toe.\nNails that are not trimmed properly can also cause ingrown toenails:\nToenails that are trimmed too short, or if the edges are rounded rather than cut straight across may cause the nail to curl and grow into the skin.\nPoor eyesight, inability to reach the toes easily, or having thick nails can make it hard to properly trim nails.\nPicking or tearing at the corners of the nails can also cause an ingrown toenail.\nSome people are born with nails that are curved and grow into the skin. Others have toenails that are too large for their toes."}

Stubbing your toe or other injuries can also lead to an ingrown toenail.\nSymptoms\nThere may be pain, redness, and swelling around the nail.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine your toenail and ask about your symptoms.\nTests or x-rays aren't usually needed.\nTreatment\nIf you have\ndiabetes\n,\nnerve problems\nin the leg or foot, poor blood circulation to your foot, or an infection around the nail, contact your provider right away. Don't try to treat an ingrown nail at home.\nOtherwise, to treat an ingrown nail at home:\nSoak the foot in warm water 3 to 4 times a day if possible. After soaking, keep the toe dry.\nGently massage over the inflamed skin.\nPlace a small piece of cotton or dental floss under the nail. Wet the cotton or floss with water or antiseptic.\nWhen trimming your toenails:\nBriefly soak your foot in warm water to soften the nails.\nUse a clean, sharp trimmer.\nTrim toenails straight across the top."}

This will only make the problem worse.\nConsider wearing sandals until the problem goes away. Over-the-counter medicine that is applied to the ingrown toenail may help with the pain, but it does not treat the problem.\nIf this doesn't work and the ingrown nail gets worse, see your provider or a foot specialist (podiatrist).\nIf the ingrown nail doesn't heal or keeps coming back, your provider may remove part of the nail:\nNumbing medicine is first injected into the toe.\nThe ingrown part of the nail is removed. This procedure is called a partial nail avulsion.\nIt takes 2 to 4 months for the nail to regrow.\nIf the toe is infected, your provider may prescribe antibiotics.\nAfter the procedure, follow any\ninstructions\nfor helping your nail heal.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nTreatment usually controls the infection and relieves pain."}
