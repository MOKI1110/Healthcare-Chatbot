In some people, back pain persists. It may not go away completely or it may get more painful at times.\nMedicines can help with your back pain.\nOVER-THE-COUNTER PAIN RELIEVERS\nOver-the-counter means you can buy them without a prescription.\nMost health care providers recommend acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) first because it has fewer side effects than other medicines. Do not take more than 3 grams (3,000 mg) on any one day, or over 24 hours. Overdosing on acetaminophen can cause severe damage to your liver. If you already have liver disease, ask your provider if acetaminophen is OK for you to take.\nIf your pain continues, your provider may suggest nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). You can buy some NSAIDs, such as ibuprofen and naproxen, without a prescription."}

They work well for short-term relief.
