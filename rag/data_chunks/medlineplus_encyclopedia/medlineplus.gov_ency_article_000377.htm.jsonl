Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nDiabetes insipidus\nDiabetes insipidus\nDiabetes insipidus (DI) is an uncommon condition in which the kidneys are unable to prevent the excretion of water.\nDI is not the same as\ndiabetes mellitus types 1 and 2\n. However, untreated, both DI and diabetes mellitus cause constant thirst and frequent urination. People with diabetes mellitus have high blood sugar (glucose). Those with DI have normal blood sugar levels, but their kidneys are not able to balance fluid and salt in the body.\nCauses\nDuring the day, your kidneys filter all your blood many times. Normally, most of the water is reabsorbed, and only a small amount of concentrated urine, relative to the volume of blood, is excreted. DI occurs when your kidneys cannot concentrate the urine normally, and a large amount of dilute urine is excreted.\nThe amount of water excreted in the urine is controlled by antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is also called vasopressin. ADH is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. It is then stored and released from the pituitary gland."}

ADH is also called vasopressin. ADH is produced in a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. It is then stored and released from the pituitary gland. This is a small gland just below the base of the brain.\nDI caused by a lack of ADH is called\ncentral diabetes insipidus\n. When DI is caused by a failure of the kidneys to respond to ADH, the condition is called\nnephrogenic diabetes insipidus\n. Nephrogenic means related to the kidney.\nCentral DI is rare. It can be caused by damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland as a result of:\nGenetic problems\nHead injury (common cause)\nInfection in the brain\nProblem with the ADH-producing cells due to an\nautoimmune disease\nLoss of blood supply to the pituitary gland\nSurgery in the area of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus (most common cause)\nTumors\nin or near the pituitary gland\nNephrogenic DI involves a defect in the kidneys. As a result, the kidneys do not respond to ADH. Nephrogenic DI is very rare."}

But after many years of use of some medicines, such as lithium, nephrogenic DI can be permanent.\nHereditary nephrogenic DI and lithium-induced nephrogenic DI are treated by drinking enough fluids to match urine output. Medicines that lower urine output also need to be taken.\nNephrogenic DI is treated with anti-inflammatory medicines and diuretics (water pills).\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome depends on the underlying disorder."}
