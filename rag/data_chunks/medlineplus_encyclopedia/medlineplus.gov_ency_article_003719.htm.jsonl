This is the sac surrounding the heart. It involves using crystal violet stain to test a sample of the fluid.\nThe\nGram stain method\ncan be used on almost any specimen. It's one of the most commonly used techniques to rapidly identify the type of bacteria causing an infection.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA sample of fluid will be taken from the pericardium. This is done with a procedure called\npericardiocentesis\n. Before this is done, you may have a heart monitor to check for heart problems. Patches called electrodes are put on the chest, similar to during an\nelectrocardiogram\n(ECG). You will have a\nchest x-ray\nor\nultrasound\nbefore the test.\nThe skin of the chest is cleaned with antibacterial soap. Your doctor (usually a cardiologist or radiologist) then inserts a small needle into the chest between the ribs and into the pericardium."}

A small amount of fluid is taken out.\nYou may have an ECG and chest x-ray after the procedure. Sometimes, the pericardial fluid is taken during open heart surgery.\nA drop of the pericardial fluid is spread in a very thin layer on a microscope slide. This is called a smear. The specimen is stained with crystal violet stain and goes through more processing before it is examined under the microscope for bacteria.\nThe characteristic appearance of the bacteria, such as their color, shape, clustering (if any), and pattern of staining help determine the type of bacteria.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will be asked not to eat or drink anything for several hours before the test. A chest x-ray or ultrasound may be done before the test to identify the area of fluid collection.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will feel pressure and some pain as the needle is inserted into the chest and when the fluid is removed."}

Your doctor will likely give you pain medicine so that the procedure is not too uncomfortable.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour health care provider may order this test if you have a heart infection (\nmyocarditis\n), signs of a heart sac infection (\npericarditis\n), or a pericardial effusion (fluid buildup of the pericardium) with an unknown cause.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means no bacteria are seen in the stained fluid sample.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf bacteria are present on the Gram stain, you may have an infection of the pericardium or heart. Blood tests and bacterial culture can help identify the specific organism causing the infection.\nRisks\nComplications are rare but may include:\nHeart or lung puncture\nInfection\nAlternative Names\nGram stain of pericardial fluid\nImages\nPericardial fluid stain\nReferences\nLeWinter MM, Cremer PC, Klein AL.
