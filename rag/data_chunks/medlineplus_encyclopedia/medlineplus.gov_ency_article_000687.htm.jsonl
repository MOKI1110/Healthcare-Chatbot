Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFemoral nerve dysfunction\nFemoral nerve dysfunction\nFemoral nerve dysfunction is a loss of movement or sensation in parts of the legs due to damage to the femoral nerve.\nCauses\nThe femoral nerve is located in the pelvis and goes down the front of the leg. It helps the muscles move the hip and straighten the leg. It provides feeling (sensation) to the front of the thigh and part of the lower leg.\nA nerve is made up of many fibers, called axons, surrounded by insulation, called the myelin sheath.\nDamage to any one nerve, such as the femoral nerve, is called\nmononeuropathy\n. Mononeuropathy is usually due to a local cause of damage to a single nerve."}

This will include an exam of the nerves and muscles in your legs.\nThe exam may show that you have:\nWeakness when you straighten the knee or bend at the hip\nSensation changes at the front of the thigh or in the foreleg\nAn abnormal knee reflex\nSmaller than normal quadriceps muscles on the front of the thigh\nTests that may be done include:\nElectromyography (EMG)\nto check the health of the muscles and the nerves that control the muscles.\nNerve conduction (NCV\n) tests to check how fast electrical signals move through a nerve. This test is usually done at the same time as an EMG.\nMRI\nor CT scan to check for masses or tumors.\nYour provider may order additional tests, depending on your medical history and symptoms."}

Tests may include blood tests, x-rays, and other imaging tests.\nTreatment\nYour provider will try to identify and treat the cause of the nerve damage. You'll be treated for any medical problems (such as diabetes or bleeding in the pelvis) that may be causing the nerve damage. In some cases, the nerve will heal with treatment of the underlying medical problem.\nOther treatments may include:\nSurgery to remove a tumor or growth that is pressing on the nerve\nMedicines to relieve pain\nWeight loss and change in lifestyle if diabetes or excess weight is contributing to the nerve damage\nIn some cases, no treatment is needed and you'll recover on your own. If so, any treatment, such as physical therapy and occupational therapy, is aimed at increasing mobility, maintaining muscle strength, and independence while you recover."}

In some cases, there may be partial or complete\nloss of movement\nor sensation, resulting in some degree of permanent disability.\nNerve pain\nmay be uncomfortable and can continue for a long time. Injury to the femoral area may also injure the femoral artery or vein, which can cause bleeding and other problems.\nPossible Complications\nComplications that may result include:\nRepeated injury to the leg that goes unnoticed due to loss of sensation\nInjury from falls due to muscle weakness\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of femoral nerve dysfunction.\nAlternative Names\nNeuropathy - femoral nerve; Femoral neuropathy\nImages\nFemoral nerve damage\nReferences\nClinchot DM, Craig EJ.
