Often, the person needs to be admitted to the intensive care unit. Treatment may include:\nOxygen therapy for breathing problems\nFluids for dehydration\nCooling blankets to return the body temperature to normal\nMonitoring any excess fluid in older people with heart or kidney disease\nMedicines to manage agitation\nMedicine to slow the heart rate\nVitamins and glucose\nThe goal of treatment is to decrease thyroid hormone levels in the blood. Sometimes, high doses of iodine is given to try and stun the thyroid. Other medicines known as thionamides may be given to lower the hormone level in the blood. Beta blocker medicines are often given by vein (IV) to slow the heart rate, lower blood pressure, and block the effects of the thyroid hormone excess."}
