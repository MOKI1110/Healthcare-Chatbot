The parasite cryptosporidium causes this infection.\nCauses\nCryptosporidium has recently been recognized as a cause of diarrhea worldwide in all age groups. It has a greater effect on people with a weakened immune system, including:\nPeople who take medicines to suppress their immune system\nPeople with HIV/AIDS\nTransplant recipients\nIn these groups, this infection is not just bothersome, but can lead to severe and life-threatening loss of muscle and body mass (wasting) and\nmalnutrition\n.\nThe major risk factor is drinking water contaminated with stool (feces)."}

In people with HIV/AIDS, this can be done by using HIV-antiviral medicines. Using this type of treatment can lead to a complete remission of cryptosporidium enteritis.\nMedicines such as nitazoxanide have been used in children and adults. Other medicines that are sometimes used include:\nNitazoxanide\nParomomycin\nThese medicines often help only for a little while. It is common for the infection to return.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn healthy people, the infection will clear up, but it can last up to a month."}

However, the pores of the filter must be smaller than 1 micron to be effective."}
