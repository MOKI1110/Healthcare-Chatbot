Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nUnconsciousness - first aid\nUnconsciousness - first aid\nUnconsciousness is when a person is unable to respond to people and activities. Health care providers often call this a\ncoma\nor being in a comatose state.\nOther changes in awareness can occur without becoming unconscious. These are called altered mental status or changed mental status. They include sudden confusion, disorientation, or stupor.\nUnconsciousness or any other sudden unexplained change in mental status must be treated as a medical emergency.\nCauses\nUnconsciousness can be caused by nearly any major illness or injury. It can also be caused by substance (medicine or drug) and alcohol use.\nChoking on an object can result in unconsciousness\nas well.\nBrief unconsciousness (or\nfainting\n) is often a result from dehydration,\nlow blood sugar\n, or temporary low blood pressure. It can also be caused by serious heart or nervous system problems."}

It can also be caused by serious heart or nervous system problems. A provider can determine if the affected person needs tests to diagnose their fainting.\nOther causes of fainting include straining during a bowel movement or urination, coughing very hard, breathing very fast (\nhyperventilating\n), or vasovagal syncope.\nSymptoms\nThe person will be unresponsive (does not respond to activity, touch, sound, or other stimulation).\nThe following symptoms may occur after a person has been unconscious:\nAmnesia\n(not remembering) for events before, during, and even after the period of unconsciousness\nConfusion\nDrowsiness\nHeadache\nInability to speak or move parts of the body (\nstroke\nsymptoms)\nLightheadedness\nLoss of bowel or bladder control (incontinence)\nRapid heartbeat (\npalpitations\n)\nSlow heartbeat\nStupor\n(severe confusion and weakness)\nIf the person is unconscious from choking, symptoms may include:\nInability to speak\nDifficulty breathing\nNoisy breathing or high-pitched sounds while inhaling\nWeak, ineffective coughing\nBluish skin color\n(cyanosis)\nBeing asle"}

A sleeping person will respond to loud noises or gentle shaking. An unconscious person will not.\nFirst Aid\nIf someone is awake but less alert than usual, ask a few simple questions, such as:\nWhat is your name?\nWhat is the date?\nHow old are you?\nWrong answers or not being able to answer the question suggest a change in mental status.\nIf a person is unconscious or has a change in mental status, follow these first aid steps:\nCall or tell someone to call 911 or the local emergency number.\nCheck the person's airway, breathing, and pulse frequently. If necessary, begin\nCPR\n.\nIf the person is breathing and lying on their back, and you do not think there is a\nspinal injury\n, carefully roll the person toward you onto their side. Bend the top leg so both hip and knee are at right angles. Gently tilt their head back to keep the airway open."}

If the person vomits, roll the entire body at one time to their side. Support their neck and back to keep the head and body in the same position while you roll.\nKeep the person warm until medical help arrives.\nIf you see a person fainting, try to prevent a fall. Lay the person flat on the floor and raise their feet about 12 inches (30 centimeters).\nIf fainting is likely due to\nlow blood sugar\n, give the person something sweet to eat or drink only when they become conscious.\nIf the person is unconscious from choking:\nBegin\nCPR\n. Chest compressions may help dislodge the object.\nIf you see something blocking the airway and it is loose, try to remove it. If the object is lodged in the person's throat, do not try to grasp it."}
