These include spina bifida,\nanencephaly\n, and some heart defects.\nExperts recommend women who can become pregnant or who plan to become pregnant take at least 400 micrograms ( µg) of folic acid every day, even if they are not expecting to become pregnant.\nThis is because many pregnancies are unplanned. Also, birth defects often occur in the early days before you may know you are pregnant.\nIf you become pregnant, you should take a prenatal vitamin, which will include folic acid. Most prenatal vitamins contain 800 to 1000 mcg of folic acid. Taking a multivitamin with folic acid helps ensure that you get all the nutrients you need during pregnancy.\nWomen with a history of delivering a baby with a neural tube defect may need a higher dose of folic acid."}
