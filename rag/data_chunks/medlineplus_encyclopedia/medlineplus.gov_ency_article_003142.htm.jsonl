The urethra is the tube that carries urine out of your body from your bladder. You may leak urine from time to time. Or, you may not be able to hold any urine.\nThe three main types of urinary incontinence are:\nStress incontinence\n-- occurs during activities like coughing, sneezing, laughing, or exercise.\nUrge incontinence\n-- occurs as a result of a strong, sudden need to urinate immediately. Then the bladder squeezes and you lose urine. You don't have enough time after you feel the urge to urinate to get to the bathroom before you begin urinating.\nOverflow incontinence -- occurs when the bladder does not empty and the volume of urine exceeds its capacity. This leads to dribbling.\nMixed incontinence occurs when you have more than one type of incontinence, usually both stress and urge urinary incontinence.\nBowel incontinence\nis when you are unable to control the passage of stool."}

Which treatment you get depends on what caused your incontinence and what type you have.\nThere are several treatment approaches for urinary incontinence:\nLifestyle changes.\nThese changes may help improve incontinence. You may need to make these changes along with other treatments.\nKeep your bowel movements regular to avoid constipation. Try increasing the fiber in your diet.\nQuit smoking to reduce coughing and bladder irritation. Smoking also increases your risk for bladder cancer.\nAvoid alcohol and caffeinated drinks such as coffee, which can stimulate your bladder.\nLose weight if you need to.\nAvoid foods and drinks that may irritate your bladder."}

These include spicy foods, carbonated drinks, and citrus fruits and juices.\nIf you have diabetes, keep your blood sugar under good control.\nFor urine leaks, wear absorbent pads or undergarments. There are many\nwell-designed products\nthat no one else will notice.\nBladder training and pelvic floor exercises.\nBladder retraining helps you gain better control over your bladder. Kegel exercises can help strengthen the muscles of your pelvic floor. Your provider can show you how to do them. Many women do not do these exercises correctly, even if they believe they are doing them correctly. Often, people benefit from formal bladder strengthening and retraining with a pelvic floor specialist.\nMedicines.\nDepending on the type of incontinence you have, your provider may prescribe one or more medicines. These medicines help prevent bladder muscle spasms, relax the bladder, and improve bladder function."}

The type of surgery you have will depend on:\nThe type of incontinence you have (such as\nurge\n,\nstress\n, or overflow)\nThe severity of your symptoms\nThe cause (such as pelvic prolapse,\nenlarged prostate\n, enlarged uterus, or other causes)\nIf you have overflow incontinence or you cannot fully empty your bladder, you may need to use a urinary\ncatheter\n. You may use a catheter that stays in your bladder long-term, or one that you are taught to put in and take out yourself.\nBladder nerve stimulation.\nUrge incontinence and urinary frequency can sometimes be treated by electrical nerve stimulation. Pulses of electricity are used to reprogram bladder reflexes. In one technique, the provider inserts a stimulator through the skin near a nerve in the leg."}

This is done weekly in the provider's office. Another method uses battery-operated implanted device similar to a pacemaker that is placed under the skin in the lower back.\nBotox injections.\nUrge incontinence can sometimes be treated with an injection of onabotulinum A toxin (also known as Botox). The injection relaxes the bladder muscle and increases the storage capacity of the bladder. The injection is delivered through a thin tube with a camera on the end (cystoscope). In most cases, the procedure can be done in the provider's office.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nTalk to your provider about incontinence. Some providers who treat incontinence are gynecologists and urologists that specialize in this problem."}
