Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNeck x-ray\nNeck x-ray\nA neck x-ray is an imaging test to look at the cervical vertebrae. These are the 7 bones of the spine in the neck.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis test is done in a hospital radiology department. It may also be done in your health care provider's office by an x-ray technologist.\nYou will lie on the x-ray table.\nYou will be asked to change positions of your neck so that more images can be taken. Usually 2, or up to 7 different images may be needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nTell your provider if you are or think you may be pregnant. Also tell your provider if you have had surgery or have implants around your neck, jaw, or mouth.\nRemove all jewelry.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the x-rays are taken, there is no discomfort. If the x-rays are done to check for injury, there may be discomfort as your neck is being positioned. Care will be taken to prevent further injury.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe x-ray is used to evaluate neck injuries and numbness, pain, or weakness that does not go away."}

Care will be taken to prevent further injury.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe x-ray is used to evaluate neck injuries and numbness, pain, or weakness that does not go away. A neck x-ray can also be used to help see if air passages are blocked by swelling in the neck or something stuck in the airway.\nOther tests, such as\nMRI\n, may be used to look for disk or nerve problems.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA neck x-ray can detect:\nBreathing in a foreign object\nBroken bone (fracture)\nDisk problems (disks are the cushion-like tissue that separate the vertebrae)\nExtra bone growths (bone spurs) on the neck bones (for example, due to osteoarthritis)\nInfection that causes swelling of the vocal cords (croup)\nInflammation of the tissue that covers the windpipe (epiglottitis)\nProblem with the curve of the upper spine, such as\nkyphosis\nSpine joint that is out of position (dislocation)\nThinning of the bone (\nosteoporosis\n)\nWearing away of the neck vertebrae or cartilage\nAbnormal development in the spine of a child\nRisks\nThere is low radiation exposure."}
