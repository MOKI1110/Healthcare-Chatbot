It is one of the components of salt used in cooking and is found naturally in many foods.\nFunction\nChloride is needed to keep the proper balance of body fluids. It is an essential part of digestive (stomach) juices.\nFood Sources\nChloride is found in table salt or sea salt as sodium chloride. It is also found in many vegetables. Foods with higher amounts of chloride include seaweed, rye, tomatoes, lettuce, celery, and olives.\nChloride, combined with potassium, is also found in many foods. Potassium chloride is a common salt substitute.\nMost Americans probably get more chloride than they need from table salt and the salt in prepared foods.\nSide Effects\nToo little chloride in the body can occur when your body loses a lot of fluids. This may be due to\nheavy sweating\n,\nvomiting\n, or\ndiarrhea\n."}

DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA):\nThe average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people. An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence.\nAdequate Intake (AI):\nThis level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA."}
