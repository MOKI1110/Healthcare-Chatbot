This protein is part of the\ncomplement system\n. The complement system is a group of nearly 60 proteins that are found in the blood plasma or on the surface of some cells.\nThe proteins work with your immune system and play a role in protecting from infection. They also help to remove dead cells and foreign material from the body. Rarely, people may inherit deficiency of one or more complement proteins. These people are prone to certain infections or autoimmune disorders.\nThere are nine major complement proteins. They are labeled C1 through C9. This article describes the test that measures C4.\nHow the Test is Performed\nBlood is drawn from a vein."}

They are labeled C1 through C9. This article describes the test that measures C4.\nHow the Test is Performed\nBlood is drawn from a vein. A vein from the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand is most often used.\nThe procedure is as follows:\nThe site is cleaned with an antiseptic.\nThe health care provider wraps an elastic band around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area and make the vein swell with blood.\nThe provider gently inserts a needle into the vein.\nThe blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm.\nOnce the blood has been collected, the needle is removed. The puncture site is covered to stop any bleeding.\nIn infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin and make it bleed. The blood collects into a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip. A bandage may be placed over the area if there is any bleeding.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain."}

Others may feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nC3 and C4 are the most commonly measured complement components. When the complement system is turned on during inflammation, levels of complement proteins may go down. Complement activity may be measured to determine how severe a disease is or if treatment is working.\nA complement test may be used to monitor people with an\nautoimmune disorder\n. For example, people with active\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\nmay have lower-than-normal levels of the complement proteins\nC3\nand\nC4\n.\nComplement activity varies throughout the body. In people with\nrheumatoid arthritis\n, complement activity may be normal or higher-than-normal in the blood, but much lower-than-normal in the joint fluid.\nNormal Results\nThe normal range for C4 is 15 to 45 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (0.15 to 0.45 g/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}
