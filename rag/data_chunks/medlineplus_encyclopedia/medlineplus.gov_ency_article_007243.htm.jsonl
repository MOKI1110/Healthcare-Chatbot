This article addresses PICCs in babies.\nWHY IS A PICC USED?\nA PICC is used when a baby needs IV (intravenous) fluids or medicines over a long period of time, or the nutrition or medication is not safe to give through a smaller vein.  Regular IVs only last 1 to 3 days and need to be replaced."}

Regular IVs only last 1 to 3 days and need to be replaced. A PICC can stay in for 2 to 3 weeks or longer.\nPICCs are often used in\npremature babies\nwho cannot be fed because of bowel problems or who need IV medicines for a long time.\nHOW IS A PICC PLACED?\nThe health care provider will:\nGive the baby pain medicine.\nClean the baby's skin with a germ-killing medicine (antiseptic).\nInsert a needle into a small vein in the arm or leg.\nMove the PICC through the needle into a larger (central) vein, putting its tip near (but not in) the heart.\nTake an x-ray to confirm the PICC is in the correct position.\nRemove the needle after the catheter is placed.\nWHAT ARE THE RISKS OF HAVING A PICC PLACED?\nThe health care team may have to try more than once to place the PICC. In some cases, the PICC cannot be properly positioned and a different therapy will be needed.\nThere is a small risk for infection. The longer the PICC is in place, the greater the risk.\nSometimes, the catheter may wear away the blood vessel wall."}

The longer the PICC is in place, the greater the risk.\nSometimes, the catheter may wear away the blood vessel wall. IV fluid or medicine can leak into nearby areas of the body.\nVery rarely, the PICC can wear away the wall of the heart. This can cause irregular heartbeat, serious bleeding, and poor heart function.\nVery rarely, the catheter may break inside the blood vessel.\nAlternative Names\nPICC - infants; PQC - infants; Pic line - infants; Per-Q cath - infants\nReferences\nCenter of Disease Control and Prevention website.
