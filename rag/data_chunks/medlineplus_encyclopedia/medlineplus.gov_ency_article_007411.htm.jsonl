Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMitral valve surgery - minimally invasive\nMitral valve surgery - minimally invasive\nMitral valve surgery is surgery to either repair or replace the mitral valve in your heart.\nBlood flows from the lungs and enters a pumping chamber of the heart called the left atrium. The blood then flows into the final pumping chamber of the heart called the left ventricle. The mitral valve is located between these two chambers. It makes sure that the blood keeps moving forward through the heart.\nYou may need surgery on your mitral valve if:\nThe mitral valve is hardened (calcified). This prevents blood from moving forward through the valve.\nThe mitral valve is too loose. Blood tends to flow backward when this occurs.\nMinimally invasive mitral valve surgery is done through several small cuts."}

Blood tends to flow backward when this occurs.\nMinimally invasive mitral valve surgery is done through several small cuts. Another type of operation,\nopen mitral valve surgery\n, requires a larger cut.\nDescription\nBefore your surgery, you will receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n.\nYou will be asleep and pain-free.\nThere are several different ways to perform minimally invasive mitral valve surgery.\nYour heart surgeon may make a 2- to 3-inch-long (5 to 7.5 centimeters) cut in the right part of your chest near the sternum (breastbone). Muscles in the area will be divided. This lets the surgeon reach the heart. A small cut is made in the left side of your heart so the surgeon can repair or replace the mitral valve.\nIn endoscopic surgery, your surgeon makes 1 to 4 small holes in your chest. Surgery is done through the cuts using a camera and special surgical tools. For\nrobotically-assisted\nvalve surgery, the surgeon makes 2 to 4 tiny cuts in your chest. The cuts are about 1/2 to 3/4 in (1.5 to 2 cm) each. The surgeon uses a special computer to control robotic arms during the surgery."}

The cuts are about 1/2 to 3/4 in (1.5 to 2 cm) each. The surgeon uses a special computer to control robotic arms during the surgery. A 3D view of the heart and mitral valve are displayed on a computer in the operating room.\nYou will need a heart-lung machine for these types of surgery. You will be connected to this device through small cuts in the groin or on the chest.\nIf your surgeon can repair your mitral valve, you may have a:\nRing annuloplasty -- The surgeon tightens the valve by sewing a ring of metal, cloth, or tissue around the valve.\nValve repair -- The surgeon trims, shapes, or rebuilds one or both of the flaps that open and close the valve.\nYou will need a new valve if there is too much damage to your mitral valve. This is called mitral valve replacement surgery. Your surgeon may remove some or all of your mitral valve and sew a new one into place. There are two main types of new valves:\nMechanical -- Made of man-made materials, such as titanium and carbon. These valves last the longest."}

These valves last 10 to 15 years or longer, but you will probably not need to take blood thinners for life.\nThe surgery may take 2 to 4 hours.\nThis surgery can sometimes be done through a groin artery, with no cuts on your chest. The surgeon sends a catheter (flexible tube) with a balloon attached on the end. The balloon inflates to stretch the opening of the valve."}

However, some people may not be able to have this type of procedure.\nPercutaneous valvuloplasty is only done in people who are too sick to have anesthesia. The results of this procedure are not long-lasting.\nRisks\nRisks for any surgery are:\nBlood clots\nin the legs that may travel to the lungs\nBlood loss\nBreathing problems\nInfection, including in the lungs, kidneys, bladder, chest, or heart valves\nReactions to medicines\nMinimally invasive surgery techniques have far fewer risks than open surgery."}
