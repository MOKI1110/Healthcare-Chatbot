Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEctropion\nEctropion\nEctropion is the turning out of the eyelid so that the inner surface is exposed. It most often affects the lower eyelid.\nCauses\nEctropion is very often caused by the aging process. The connective (supporting) tissue of the eyelid becomes weak. This causes the lid to turn out so that the inside of the lower lid is no longer against the eyeball. It can also be caused by:\nA defect that occurs before birth (for example, in children with\nDown syndrome\n)\nFacial muscle weakness\nScar tissue from burns or injuries\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nDry, painful eyes\nExcess tearing of the eye (\nepiphora\n)\nEyelid turns outward (downward)\nLong-term (chronic)\nconjunctivitis\nKeratitis\nRedness of the lid and white part of the eye\nIf you have ectropion, you will most likely have excess tearing. This happens because the eye gets dry, then makes more tears. The excess tears can't get into the tear drainage duct."}

This happens because the eye gets dry, then makes more tears. The excess tears can't get into the tear drainage duct. Therefore, they build up inside the lower lid and then spill over the edge of the lid onto the cheek.\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will make a diagnosis by doing an exam of the eyes and eyelids. Special tests are not needed most of the time.\nTreatment\nArtificial tears (a lubricant) may ease dryness and keep the cornea moist. Ointment may be helpful when the eye can't close all of the way, such as when you are asleep.\nSurgery is very often effective. When ectropion is related to aging or paralysis, the surgeon can tighten the muscles that hold the eyelids in place. If the condition is due to scarring of the skin, a skin graft or laser treatment may be used. The surgery is most often done in the office or at an outpatient surgery center."}

A medicine is used to numb the area (local anesthesia) before the surgery.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome is very often good with treatment.\nPossible Complications\nCorneal dryness and irritation may lead to:\nCorneal abrasions\nCorneal ulcers\nEye infections\nCorneal ulcers can cause vision loss.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nMake an appointment with your provider if you have symptoms of ectropion.\nIf you have ectropion, get emergency medical help if you have:\nVision that is getting worse\nPain\nSensitivity to light\nEye redness that is getting worse quickly\nPrevention\nMost cases cannot be prevented. You may want to use artificial tears or ointments to prevent injury to the cornea, especially if you are waiting for a more permanent treatment.\nImages\nEye\nReferences\nCioffi GA, Liebmann JM.
