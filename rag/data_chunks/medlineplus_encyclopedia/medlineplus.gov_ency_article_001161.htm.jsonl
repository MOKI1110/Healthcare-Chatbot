Metabolic neuropathy may be caused by:\nA problem with the body's ability to use energy, often due to a lack of enough nutrients (nutritional deficiency)\nDangerous substances (toxins) that build up in the body\nDiabetes is one of the most common causes of metabolic neuropathies."}

Abnormal blood sugar level or thyroid function may need medicines to correct the problem. For alcoholic neuropathy, the best treatment is to stop drinking alcohol.\nIn some cases, pain is treated with medicines that reduce abnormal pain signals from the nerves. In some cases, lotions, creams, or medicated patches can provide relief.\nWeakness is often treated with physical therapy. You may need to learn how to use a cane or walker if your balance is affected. You may need special ankle braces to help you walk better.\nSupport Groups\nThese groups can provide more information on neuropathy:\nNeuropathy Action Foundation --\nwww.neuropathyaction.org\nThe Foundation for Peripheral Neuropathy --\nwww.foundationforpn.org\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook mainly depends on the cause of the disorder.

Proper fitting shoes can lessen the chance of skin breakdown in sensitive areas of the feet.\nAlternative Names\nNeuropathy - metabolic\nImages\nCentral nervous system and peripheral nervous system\nNervous system\nReferences\nGoodman BP.
