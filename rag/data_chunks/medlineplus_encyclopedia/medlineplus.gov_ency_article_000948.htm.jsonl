They are prescribed to treat pain after surgery or a dental procedure. Sometimes, they are used to treat severe cough or diarrhea. The illegal drug heroin is also an opioid. When\nabused\n, opioids cause a person to feel relaxed and intensely happy (euphoria). In short, the drugs are used to get high.\nOpioid intoxication is a condition in which you're not only high from using the drug, but you also have body-wide symptoms that can make you ill and impaired.\nCauses\nOpioid intoxication may occur when a health care provider prescribes an opioid, but:\nThe provider doesn't know the person is already taking another opioid at home.\nThe person has a health problem, such as a liver or kidney problem, that may easily result in intoxication.\nThe provider prescribes a sleep medicine (sedative) in addition to the opioid.\nThe provider doesn't know that another provider already prescribed an opioid.\nIn people who use opioids"}
