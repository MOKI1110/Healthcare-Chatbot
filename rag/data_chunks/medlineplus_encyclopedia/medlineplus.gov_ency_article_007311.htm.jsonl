You can eat or drink normally before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is done to find out if your baby might be at risk for certain birth defects, such as Down syndrome and birth defects of the spinal column and brain (called neural tube defects). This test is a screening test, so it does not diagnose problems.\nCertain women are at greater risk of having a baby with these defects, including:\nWomen who are over 35 years old during pregnancy\nWomen taking insulin to treat diabetes\nWomen with a family history of birth defects\nNormal Results\nNormal levels of AFP, hCG, uE3, and inhibin A.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}

Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal test result does NOT mean that your baby definitely has a birth defect. Often, the results can be abnormal if your baby is older or younger than your provider had thought.\nIf you have an abnormal result, you will have another ultrasound to check the age of the developing baby.\nMore tests and counseling may be recommended if the ultrasound shows a problem. However, some people choose not to have any more tests done, for personal or religious reasons. Possible next steps include:\nAmniocentesis\n, which checks the AFP level in the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby."}
