This type of pneumonia can be very severe. Sometimes, it can be fatal.\nCauses\nPneumonia\nis a common illness. It is caused by many different germs. Pneumonia that starts in the hospital tends to be more serious than other lung infections because:\nPeople in the hospital are often very sick and cannot fight off germs.\nThe types of germs present in a hospital are often more dangerous and more resistant to treatment than those outside in the community.\nPneumonia occurs more often in people who are using a ventilator, which is a machine that helps them breathe. This is called ventilator-associated pneumonia.\nHospital-acquired pneumonia can also be spread by health care workers, who can pass germs from their hands, clothes, or instruments from one person to another."}
