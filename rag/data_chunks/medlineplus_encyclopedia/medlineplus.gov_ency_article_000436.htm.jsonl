It is a common cause of chronic neck pain.\nCauses\nCervical spondylosis is caused by aging and\nchronic\nwear on the cervical spine. This includes the disks or cushions between the neck vertebrae and the joints between the bones of the cervical spine. There may be abnormal growths or spurs on the bones of the spine (vertebrae).\nOver time, these changes can press down on (compress) one or more of the nerve roots. In advanced cases, the spinal cord becomes involved. This can affect your arms, legs, and balance.\nEveryday wear and tear may start these changes. People who are very active at work or in sports may be more likely to have them.\nThe major risk factor is aging. By age 60, most people show signs of cervical spondylosis on x-ray."}

People who are very active at work or in sports may be more likely to have them.\nThe major risk factor is aging. By age 60, most people show signs of cervical spondylosis on x-ray. Other factors that can make someone more likely to develop spondylosis are:\nBeing overweight and not exercising\nHaving a job that requires heavy lifting or a lot of bending and twisting\nPast neck injury (often several years before)\nPast spine surgery\nRuptured or slipped disk\nSevere arthritis\nPrevious surgery on the neck\nSymptoms\nSymptoms often develop slowly over time. But they may start or get worse suddenly. The pain may be mild, or it can be deep and so severe that you are unable to move.\nYou may feel the pain over the shoulder blade. It may spread to the upper arm, forearm, or fingers (in rare cases).\nThe pain may get worse:\nAfter standing or sitting\nAt night\nWhen you sneeze, cough, or laugh\nWhen you bend the neck backward or twist your neck or walk more than a few yards (meters)\nYou may also have weakness in certain muscles. Sometimes, you may not notice it until your health care provider examines you."}

Sometimes, a few visits will help with neck pain.\nCold packs and heat therapy may help your pain during flare-ups.\nA type of talk therapy called cognitive behavioral therapy may be helpful if the pain is having a serious impact on your life.

Surgery is done to relieve the pressure on the nerves or spinal cord, and it can involve fusion of part of the neck.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people with cervical spondylosis have some long-term symptoms.
