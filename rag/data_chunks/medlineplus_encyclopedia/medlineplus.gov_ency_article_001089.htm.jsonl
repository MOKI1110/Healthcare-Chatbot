Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nByssinosis\nByssinosis\nByssinosis is a disease of the lungs. It is caused by breathing in (inhaling) cotton dust or dusts from other vegetable fibers such as flax, hemp, or sisal while at work.\nCauses\nInhaling the dust produced by raw cotton can cause byssinosis. It is most common in people who work in the textile industry.\nThose who are sensitive to the dust can have an\nasthma-like condition\nafter being exposed.\nMethods of prevention in the United States have reduced the number of cases. Byssinosis is still common in developing countries. Smoking increases risk  of developing this disease. Being exposed to the dust many times can lead to  long-term (chronic) lung disease.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nChest tightness\nCough\nWheezing\nShortness of breath\nSymptoms are worse at the beginning of the work week and improve later in the week. Symptoms are also less severe when the person is away from the workplace.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will take your medical history."}

Symptoms are also less severe when the person is away from the workplace.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will take your medical history. You'll be asked if your symptoms relate to certain exposures or times of exposure. Your provider will also do a physical exam, paying special attention to the lungs.\nTests that may be ordered include:\nChest x-ray\nChest CT scan\nLung function tests\nTreatment\nThe most important treatment is to stop being exposed to the dust. Reducing dust levels in the factory (by improving machinery or ventilation) will help prevent byssinosis. Some people may have to change jobs to avoid further exposure.\nMedicines used for asthma, such as bronchodilators, usually improve symptoms. Corticosteroid medicines may be prescribed in more severe cases.\nStopping smoking is very important for people with this condition. Breathing treatments, including\nnebulizers\n, may be prescribed if the condition becomes long-term."}

Home oxygen therapy may be needed if blood oxygen level is low.\nPeople with a long-term (chronic) lung disease can be helped with:\nPhysical exercise programs\nBreathing exercises\nPatient education programs\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nStopping exposure to the dust often improves symptoms. Continued exposure can lead to reduced lung function. In the United States, worker's compensation may be available to people with byssinosis.\nPossible Complications\nChronic bronchitis\nmay develop. This is swelling (inflammation) of the large airways of the lungs with a large amount of phlegm production. Continued exposure can lead to end-stage lung disease.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you:\nHave symptoms of byssinosis and know you have been exposed to cotton or other fibers\nThink you have been exposed to cotton or other fiber dust at work and you have breathing problems\nHaving byssinosis makes it easier for you to develop lung infections."}

So if you've been diagnosed with byssinosis, contact your provider right away if you develop:\nA cough\nShortness of breath\nFever\nOther signs of a lung infection\nSymptoms of the flu or COVID-19\nSince your lungs are already damaged, it's important to have the infection treated right away. This will prevent breathing problems from becoming severe. It will also prevent further damage to your lungs.\nTalk to your provider about getting the flu, pneumonia, and other recommended vaccines.\nPrevention\nControlling dust, using face masks, and other measures can reduce the risk. Stop smoking, especially if you work in textile manufacturing.\nAlternative Names\nCotton worker's lung; Cotton bract disease; Mill fever; Brown lung disease; Monday fever\nImages\nLungs\nReferences\nGo LHT, Cohen RA.
