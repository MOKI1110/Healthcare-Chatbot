It is caused by an infection.\nCauses\nMost perirenal abscesses are caused by a\nurinary tract infection\nthat starts in the bladder. It then spreads to the kidney, and to the area around the kidney. Surgery in the urinary tract or reproductive system or a bloodstream infection can also lead to a perirenal abscess.\nThe biggest risk factor for perirenal abscess is\nkidney stones\n, which may block urine flow. This provides a place for an infection to grow. Bacteria tend to stick to the stones and antibiotics cannot kill the bacteria there.\nStones are found in 20% to 60% of people with perirenal abscess. Other risk factors for perirenal abscess include:\nDiabetes\nHaving an abnormal urinary tract\nTrauma to the kidney\nIntravenous\n(IV) drug use\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of perirenal abscess include:\nChills\nFever\nPain in the flank (side of the abdomen) or\nabdomen\n, which may extend to the groin or down the leg\nSweating\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will examine you."}

You may have tenderness in the back or abdomen.\nTests include:\nBlood culture\nCT scan\nof the abdomen\nUltrasound of the abdomen\nUrinalysis\nUrine culture\nTreatment\nTo treat perirenal abscess, the pus can be drained through a catheter that is placed through the skin or with surgery. Antibiotics should also be given, at first through a vein (IV), then can switch to pills when the infection starts improving.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn general, quick diagnosis and treatment of a perirenal abscess should lead to a good outcome. Kidney stones must be treated to avoid further infections.\nIn rare cases, the infection can spread beyond the kidney area and into the bloodstream. This can be deadly.\nPossible Complications\nIf you have kidney stones, the infection may not go away.\nYou may need to have the infection surgically removed.\nYou may have to have the kidney removed if infection cannot be cleared or is recurrent."}
