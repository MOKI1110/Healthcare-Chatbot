Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCrush injury\nCrush injury\nA crush injury occurs when excessive force or pressure is put on a body part. This type of injury most often happens when part of the body is squeezed between two heavy objects.\nDamage related to crush injuries include:\nBleeding\nBruising\nCompartment syndrome\n(increased pressure, usually in an arm or leg, that causes serious muscle, nerve, blood vessel, and tissue damage)\nBroken bone\n(fracture)\nOpen wound\n(laceration)\nNerve injury\nInfection (caused by bacteria that enter the body through a wound)\nFirst Aid\nSteps for first aid treatment of a crush injury are:\nStop bleeding by applying direct pressure.\nCover the area with a moist cloth or bandage. Then, raise the area above the level of the heart, if possible.\nIf there is suspicion of a head, neck, or spinal injury, immobilize those areas if possible and then limit movement to only the crushed area.\nCall 911 or the local emergency number.\nCrush injuries most often need to be evaluated in a hospital emergency department. Surgery may be needed.\nReferences\nSheridan RL."}
