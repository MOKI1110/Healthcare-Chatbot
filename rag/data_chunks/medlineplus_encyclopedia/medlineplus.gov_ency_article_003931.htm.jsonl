The disks are held in place with a sticky paste. The electrodes are connected by wires to a recording machine. The machine changes the electrical signals into patterns that can be seen on a monitor or drawn on paper. These patterns look like wavy lines.\nYou need to lie still during the test with your eyes closed. This is because movement can change the results. You may be asked to do certain things during the test, such as breathe fast and deeply for several minutes or look at a bright flashing light.\nYou may be asked to sleep during the test.\nIf your provider needs to monitor your brain activity for a longer period, an ambulatory EEG will be ordered."}

In addition to the electrodes, you will wear or carry a special recorder for up to 3 days. You will be able to go about your normal routine as the EEG is being recorded. Or, your provider may ask you to stay overnight in a special EEG monitoring unit where your brain activity will be monitored continuously. Video recording may be done at the same time to see what you are doing during the various electrical signals.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nWash your hair the night before the test. Do not use conditioner, oils, sprays, or gel on your hair. If you have a hair weave, ask your provider for special instructions.\nYour provider may want you to stop taking certain medicines before the test. Do not change or stop taking any medicines without first talking to your provider. Bring a list of your medicines with you.\nAvoid all food and drinks containing caffeine for 8 hours before the test.\nYou may need to sleep during the test."}

If so, you may be asked to reduce your sleep time the night before. If you are asked to sleep as little as possible before the test, do not eat or drink any caffeine, energy drinks, or other products that help you stay awake.\nFollow any other specific instructions you are given.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe electrodes may feel sticky and strange on your scalp, but should not cause any other discomfort. You should not feel any discomfort during the test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nBrain cells communicate with each other by producing tiny electrical signals, called impulses. An EEG measures this activity."}

It can be helpful when trying to decide if a person is brain dead.\nAn EEG cannot be used to measure intelligence.\nNormal Results\nBrain electrical activity has a certain number of waves per second (frequencies) that are normal for different levels of alertness."}

For example, brain waves are faster when you are awake and slower in certain stages of sleep.\nThere are also normal patterns to these waves.\nNote: A normal EEG does not mean that a seizure did not occur.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results on an EEG test may be due to:\nAbnormal bleeding (hemorrhage) in the brain\nAn abnormal structure in the brain (such as a brain tumor)\nTissue death due to a blockage in blood flow (cerebral infarction, also called a\nstroke\n)\nMedicines\nIllicit drug or alcohol use\nHead injury\nMigraines\n(in some cases)\nSeizure disorder (such as\nepilepsy\n)\nSleep disorder (such as\nnarcolepsy\n)\nBrain infection\nKidney or liver disease (metabolic disease)\nRisks\nAn EEG test is very safe. The flashing lights or fast breathing (\nhyperventilation\n) required during the test may trigger seizures in those with seizure disorders."}
