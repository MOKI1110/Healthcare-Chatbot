This article discusses urinary tract infections in children.\nThe infection can affect different parts of the urinary tract, including the bladder (cystitis), kidneys (pyelonephritis), and urethra (urethritis), the tube that empties urine from the bladder to the outside.\nCauses\nUrinary tract infections (UTIs) can occur when bacteria get into the bladder or the kidneys. These bacteria are common on the skin around the anus."}

These bacteria are common on the skin around the anus. They can also be present near the vagina.\nSome factors make it easier for bacteria to enter or stay in the urinary tract, such as:\nVesicoureteral reflux\nin which urine flow backs up from the bladder into the ureters and kidneys.\nBrain or nervous system illnesses (such as myelomeningocele or spinal cord injury).\nBubble baths or tight-fitting clothes (girls).\nChanges or birth defects in the structure of the urinary tract.\nNot urinating often enough during the day.\nWiping from back (near the anus) to front after going to the bathroom. In girls, this can bring bacteria to the opening where the urine comes out.\nUTIs are more common in girls. This may occur as children begin toilet training around 3 years of age. Boys who are not circumcised have a slightly higher risk of UTIs before age 1.\nSymptoms\nYoung children with UTIs may have a fever, poor appetite, vomiting, or no symptoms at all.\nMost UTIs in children only involve the bladder."}

The sample is examined under a microscope and sent to a lab for a\nurine culture\n.\nIt may be hard to get a urine sample in a child who is not toilet trained.
