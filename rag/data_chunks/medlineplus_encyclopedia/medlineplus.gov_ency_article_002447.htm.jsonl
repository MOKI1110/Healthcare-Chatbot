Infant formulas include powders, concentrated liquids, and ready-to-use forms.\nFood Sources\nThere are different formulas available for infants younger than 12 months old who are not\ndrinking breast milk\n. While there are some differences, infant formulas sold in the United States have all the nutrients babies need to grow and thrive.\nTYPES OF FORMULAS\nBabies need iron in their diet. It's best to use a formula fortified with iron, unless your child's health care provider says not to.\nStandard cow's milk-based formulas:\nAlmost all babies do well on cow's milk-based formulas.\nThese formulas are made with cow's milk protein that has been changed to be more like breast milk. They contain lactose (a type of sugar in milk) and minerals from the cow's milk.\nVegetable oils, plus other minerals and vitamins are also in the formula.\nFussiness and colic are common problems for all babies."}

Most of the time, cow's milk formulas are not the cause of these symptoms. This means that you likely do not need to switch to a different formula if your baby is fussy. If you're not sure, talk with your infant's provider.\nSoy-based formulas:\nThese formulas are made using soy proteins. They do not contain lactose.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) suggests using cow's milk-based formulas when possible rather than soy-based formulas.\nFor parents who do not want their child to eat animal protein, the AAP recommends breastfeeding. Soy-based formulas are also an option.\nSoy-based formulas have NOT been proven to help with milk allergies or\ncolic\n. Babies who are allergic to cow's milk may also be allergic to soy milk.\nSoy-based formulas should be used for infants with\ngalactosemia\n, a rare condition."}

They are usually needed only for infants with\nreflux\nwho are not gaining weight or who are very uncomfortable.\nFormulas for premature and low-birth-weight infants have extra calories and minerals to meet the needs of these infants.\nSpecial formulas may be used for infants with heart disease, malabsorption syndromes, and problems digesting fat or processing certain amino acids.\nNewer formulas with no clear role:\nToddler formulas are offered as added nutrition for toddlers who are picky eaters.

The AAP does not recommend regular cow's milk for children under 1 year old. After 1 year, the child should only get whole milk, not skim or reduced-fat milk.\nStandard formulas contain 20 Kcal/ounce or 20 Kcal/30 milliliters and 0.45 grams of protein/ounce or 0.45 grams of protein/30 milliliters. Formulas based on cow's milk are appropriate for most full-term and preterm infants.\nInfants who drink enough formula and are gaining weight usually do not need extra vitamins or minerals."}
