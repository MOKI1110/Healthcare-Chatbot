Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nType 2 diabetes\nType 2 diabetes\nType 2 diabetes is a lifelong (\nchronic\n) disease in which there is a high level of sugar (glucose) in the blood. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of diabetes.\nCauses\nInsulin is a hormone produced in the pancreas by special cells, called beta cells. The pancreas is below and behind the stomach. Insulin is needed to move glucose into cells. Inside the cells, glucose is stored and later used for energy.\nWhen you have type 2 diabetes, your fat, liver, and muscle cells do not respond correctly to insulin. This is called insulin resistance. As a result, glucose does not get into these cells to be stored for energy.\nWhen sugar cannot enter cells, a high level of sugar builds up in the blood. This is called hyperglycemia. The body is unable to use the glucose for energy. This leads to the symptoms of type 2 diabetes.\nType 2 diabetes usually develops slowly over time. Many people with the disease are overweight or obese when they are diagnosed."}

Increased fat makes it harder for your body to use insulin the correct way.\nType 2 diabetes can also develop in people who are not overweight or obese. This is more common in older adults.\nFamily history and genes play a role in type 2 diabetes. Low activity level, poor diet, and excess body weight around the waist increase your chance of getting the disease.\nSymptoms\nPeople with type 2 diabetes often have no symptoms at first. They may not have symptoms for many years."}
