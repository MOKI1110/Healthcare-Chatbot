These cells are called \"C\" cells. The thyroid gland is located inside the front of your lower neck.\nCauses\nThe cause of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid (MTC) is unknown. MTC is very rare. It can occur in children and adults.\nUnlike other types of thyroid cancer, MTC is less likely to be caused by radiation therapy to the neck given to treat other cancers during childhood.\nThere are two forms of MTC:\nSporadic MTC, which does not run in families. Most MTCs are sporadic."}

Because this is an uncommon tumor, surgery should be performed by a surgeon who is familiar with this type of cancer and experienced with the operation required.\nFurther treatment will depend on your calcitonin levels."}

Your provider can tell you more about these, if needed.\nNear relatives of persons diagnosed with hereditary forms of MTC are at increased risk of this cancer and should discuss with their providers.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\ncancer support group\n.

But, being aware of your risk factors, especially your family history, may allow for early diagnosis and treatment. For people who have a very strong family history of MTC, the option to remove the thyroid gland may be recommended. You should carefully discuss this option with a doctor who is very familiar with the disease.\nAlternative Names\nThyroid - medullary carcinoma; Cancer - thyroid (medullary carcinoma); MTC; Thyroid nodule - medullary\nImages\nThyroid cancer - CT scan\nThyroid gland\nReferences\nKim M, Kim BH.
