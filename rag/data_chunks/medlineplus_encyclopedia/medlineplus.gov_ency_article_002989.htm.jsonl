Often, this is one cut. An incision may be made beneath your chin.\nMany different techniques exist. The outcomes for each one are similar but how long the improvement lasts may vary.\nDuring a facelift, the surgeon may:\nRemove and lift some of the fat and muscle underneath the skin (called the SMAS layer; this is the main lifting part of the facelift)\nRemove or move loose skin\nTighten muscles\nPerform\nliposuction\nof the neck and jowls\nUse stitches (sutures) to close the cuts\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nSagging or wrinkled skin occurs naturally as you get older."}

Folds and fat deposits appear around the neck. Deep creases form between the nose and mouth. The jawline grows jowly and slack. Genes, poor diet, smoking, or obesity can make skin problems start sooner or get worse faster.\nA facelift can help improve some of the visible signs of aging. Fixing damage to skin, fat, and muscles can restore a younger, more refreshed and less tired look.\nPeople have a facelift because they are not satisfied with the signs of aging on their face, but they are in otherwise good health.\nRisks\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:\nReactions to medicines\nBreathing problems\nBleeding\n,\nblood clots\n, or infection\nRisks of face lift surgery include:\nA pocket of blood under the skin (hematoma) that may need to be drained surgically\nDamage to the nerves that control muscles of the face (this is usually temporary, but may be permanent)\nWounds that do not heal well\nPain that does not go away\nNumbness\nor other changes in skin sensation\nAlthough most people are"}
