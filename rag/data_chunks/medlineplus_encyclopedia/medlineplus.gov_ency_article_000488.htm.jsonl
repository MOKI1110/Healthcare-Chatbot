The renal papillae are the areas where the openings of the collecting ducts enter the kidney and where urine flows into the ureters.\nCauses\nRenal papillary necrosis often occurs with\nanalgesic nephropathy\n. This is damage to one or both kidneys caused by overexposure to pain medicines. But, other conditions can also cause renal papillary necrosis, including:\nDiabetic nephropathy\nKidney infection (pyelonephritis)\nKidney transplant rejection\nSickle cell anemia\n, a common cause of renal papillary necrosis in children\nUrinary tract blockage\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of renal papillary necrosis may include:\nBack pain or\nflank pain\nBloody, cloudy, or dark urine\nTissue pieces in the urine\nOther symptoms that may occur with this disease:\nFever and chills\nPainful urination\nNeeding to urinate more often than usual (frequent urination) or a sudden, strong urge to urinate (urgency)\nDifficulty starting or maintaining a ur"}

There may be a history of urinary tract infections. There may be signs of\nblocked urine flow\nor kidney failure.\nTests that may be done include:\nUrine test\nBlood tests\nUltrasound, CT, or other imaging tests of the kidneys\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for renal papillary necrosis. Treatment depends on the cause. For example, if analgesic nephropathy is the cause, your health care provider will recommend that you stop using the medicine that is causing it. This may allow the kidney to heal over time.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well a person does, depends on what is causing the condition. If the cause can be controlled, the condition may go away on its own."}

To prevent renal papillary necrosis from analgesic nephropathy,  follow your provider's instructions when using medicines, including over-the-counter pain relievers.
