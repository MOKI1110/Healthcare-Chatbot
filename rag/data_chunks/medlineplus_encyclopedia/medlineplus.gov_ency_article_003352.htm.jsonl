HSV-2 most often causes genital herpes.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nThe sample is taken to the lab and tested for the presence and amount of\nantibodies\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special steps are needed to prepare for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel a little pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is done to find out whether a person has ever been infected with oral or\ngenital herpes\n.

An antibody is a substance made by the body's immune system when it detects harmful substances such as the herpes virus. This test does not detect the virus itself.\nNormal Results\nA negative (normal) test most often means you have not been infected with HSV-1 or HSV-2.\nIf the infection occurred very recently (within a few weeks to 3 months), the test may be negative, but you may still be infected. This is called a false negative. It can take up to 3 months after a possible herpes exposure for this test to be positive.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA positive test means you have been infected with HSV recently or at some point in the past.\nTests can be done to help determine if you have a recent infection.\nAbout 70% of adults have been infected by HSV-1 and have antibodies against the virus."}

About 20% to 50% of adults will have antibodies against the HSV-2 virus, which causes genital herpes.\nHSV stays in your system once you have been infected. It may be \"asleep\" (dormant), and cause no symptoms, or it may flare up and cause symptoms. This test cannot tell whether you are having a flare-up.\nRisks\nRisks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nConsiderations\nEven when you do not have sores, you can pass (shed) the virus to someone during sexual or other close contact. To protect others:\nLet any sexual partner know that you have herpes before having sex. Allow him or her to decide what to do."}
