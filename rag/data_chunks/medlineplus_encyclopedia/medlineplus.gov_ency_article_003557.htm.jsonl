Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAntithyroglobulin antibody test\nAntithyroglobulin antibody test\nAntithyroglobulin antibody is a test to measure\nantibodies\nto a protein called thyroglobulin. This protein is found in thyroid cells, but a small amount leaks out into the bloodstream. Sometimes the immune system produces antibodies against this protein.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be told not to eat or drink anything for several hours (usually overnight). Your health care provider may monitor you or tell you to stop taking certain medicines for a short time before the test because they may affect the test results. Do not stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test helps detect possible thyroid problems.\nAntithyroglobulin antibodies can be a sign of thyroid gland damage caused by the immune system. They may be measured if\nthyroiditis\nis suspected.\nMeasuring thyroglobulin antibody levels after treatment for thyroid cancer can help your provider decide what the best test is to monitor you for a recurrence of the cancer.\nNormal Results\nA negative test result is a normal result. It means no antibodies to thyroglobulin are found in your blood.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA positive test means antithyroglobulin antibodies are found in your blood."}

They may be present with:\nGraves disease\nor\noveractive thyroid\nHashimoto thyroiditis\nSubacute thyroiditis\nUnderactive thyroid\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\nType 1 diabetes\nPregnant women and relatives of those with autoimmune thyroiditis may also test positive for these antibodies.\nIf you have a positive test for antithyroglobulin antibodies, this may make it harder to measure your thyroglobulin level accurately. Thyroglobulin level is an important blood test to determine risk that thyroid cancer will recur.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
