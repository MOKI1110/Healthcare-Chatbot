The clean-catch method is used to prevent germs from the penis or vagina from getting into a urine sample. To collect your urine, you may get a special clean-catch kit from your health care provider that contains a cleansing solution and sterile wipes. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary for this test. If the collection is being taken from an infant, a couple of extra collection bags may be necessary.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nHemoglobin is a molecule contained within red blood cells. Hemoglobin helps move oxygen through the body.\nRed blood cells have an average life span of 120 days. After this time, they are broken down into parts that can make a new red blood cell."}

Hemoglobin helps move oxygen through the body.\nRed blood cells have an average life span of 120 days. After this time, they are broken down into parts that can make a new red blood cell. This breakdown takes place in the spleen, bone marrow, and liver. If the red blood cells break down in the blood vessels, their parts move freely in the bloodstream.\nIf the level of hemoglobin in the blood rises too high, then hemoglobin begins to appear in the urine. This is called hemoglobinuria.\nThis test may be used to help diagnose causes of hemoglobinuria.\nNormal Results\nNormally, hemoglobin does not appear in the urine.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nHemoglobinuria may be a result of any of the following:\nBurns\nCrushing injury\nHemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS)\n, a disorder that occurs when an infection in the digestive system produces toxic substances\nKidney infection\nKidney inflammation or injury including\nglomerulonephritis\nKidney tumor\nMalaria\nParoxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria\n, disease in which red blood cells break down earlier than normal\nParoxysmal cold hemoglobinuria\n, disease in which the body's immune system produces antibodies that destroy red blood cells\nSickle cell anem"}
