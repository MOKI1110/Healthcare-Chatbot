Vertigo is the feeling that you are spinning or that everything is spinning around you. It may occur when you move your head in a certain position.\nCauses\nBenign positional vertigo is also called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). It is caused by a problem in the inner ear.\nThe inner ear has fluid-filled tubes called semicircular canals. When you move, the fluid moves inside these tubes. The canals are very sensitive to any movement of the fluid. The sensation of the fluid moving in the tube tells your brain the position of your body. This helps you keep your balance.\nBPPV occurs when small pieces of bone-like calcium (called canaliths) break free and float inside the tube. This sends confusing messages to your brain about your body's position.\nBPPV has no major risk factors."}

But, your risk of developing BPPV may increase if you have:\nFamily members with BPPV\nHad a prior head injury (even a slight bump to the head)\nHad an inner ear infection called\nlabyrinthitis\nSymptoms\nBPPV symptoms include any of the following:\nFeeling like you are spinning or moving\nFeeling like the world is spinning around you\nLoss of balance\nNausea and vomiting\nHearing loss\nVision problems, such as a feeling that things are jumping or moving\nThe spinning sensation:\nIs usually triggered by moving your head\nOften starts suddenly\nLasts a few seconds to minutes\nCertain positions can trigger the spinning feeling:\nRolling over in bed\nTilting your head up to look at something\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will do a physical exam and ask about your medical history.\nTo diagnose BPPV, your provider may perform a test called the Dix-Hallpike maneuver.\nYour provider holds your head in a certain position."}

Then you are asked to lie quickly backward over a table.\nAs you do this, your provider will look for abnormal eye movements (called\nnystagmus\n) and ask if you feel like you are spinning.\nIf this test doesn't show a clear result, you may be asked to do other tests.\nYou may have brain and nervous system (neurological) tests to rule out other causes. These may include:\nElectronystagmography\n(ENG)\nHead CT\nscan\nHead MRI\nscan\nHearing test\nMagnetic resonance angiography\nof the head\nWarming and cooling the inner ear with water or air to test eye movements (\ncaloric stimulation\n)\nTreatment\nYour provider may perform a procedure called the\nEpley maneuver\n. It is a series of head movements to reposition the canaliths in your inner ear. The procedure may need to be repeated if symptoms come back, but this treatment works best to cure BPPV.\nYour provider may teach you other repositioning exercises that you can do at home, but may take longer than the Epley maneuver to work."}
