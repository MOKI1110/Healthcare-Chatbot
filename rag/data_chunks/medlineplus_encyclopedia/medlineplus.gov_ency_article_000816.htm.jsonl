There are more than 80 autoimmune disorders.\nCauses\nThe blood cells in the body's immune system help protect against harmful substances. Examples include bacteria, viruses,\ntoxins\n,\ncancer\ncells, and blood and tissue from outside the body. These substances contain antigens. The immune system produces\nantibodies\nagainst these antigens that enable it to destroy these harmful substances.\nWhen you have an autoimmune disorder, your immune system does not distinguish between healthy tissue and potentially harmful antigens. As a result, your body sets off a reaction that destroys normal tissues.\nThe exact cause of autoimmune disorders is unknown. One theory is that some microorganisms (such as bacteria or viruses) or drugs may trigger changes that confuse the immune system."}

This may happen more often in people who have genes that make them more prone to autoimmune disorders.\nAn autoimmune disorder may result in:\nThe destruction of body tissue\nAbnormal growth of an organ\nChanges in organ function\nAn autoimmune disorder may affect one or more organ or tissue types. Areas often affected by autoimmune disorders include:\nBlood vessels\nConnective tissues\nEndocrine\nglands such as the thyroid or pancreas\nJoints\nMuscles\nRed blood cells\nSkin\nA person may have more than one autoimmune disorder at the same time."}
