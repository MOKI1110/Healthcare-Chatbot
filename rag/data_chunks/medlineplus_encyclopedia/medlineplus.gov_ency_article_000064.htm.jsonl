This can include problems falling or staying asleep, too much sleep, or abnormal behaviors with sleep.\nCauses\nSleep problems are common in older adults. The amount of sleep needed stays constant throughout the adult years. Doctors recommend that adults get 7 to 8 hours of sleep each night. In older adults, sleep is less deep and choppier than sleep in younger people.\nA healthy 70-year-old may wake up several times during the night without it being due to disease.\nSleep disturbances in older adults may be due to any of the following:\nAlzheimer disease\nAlcohol use\nChanges in the body's natural internal clock, causing some people to fall asleep earlier in the evening\nLong-term (chronic) disease, such as\nheart failure\nCertain medicines, herbs, supplements, and recreational drugs\nDepression\n(depression is a common cause of sleep problems in people of all ages)\nBrain and nervous system conditions\nNot being very active"}

Treating depression will often improve sleep.\nSleeping in a quiet room that isn't too hot or too cold and having a relaxing bedtime routine may help improve symptoms. Other ways to promote sleep include these healthy lifestyle tips:\nAvoid large meals shortly before bedtime. A light bedtime snack may be helpful. Many people find that warm milk increases sleepiness, because it contains a natural, sedative-like amino acid.\nAvoid stimulants such as caffeine for at least 3 or 4 hours before bed.\nExercise at regular times each day, but not within 3 hours of your bedtime.\nGo to bed and wake up at the same time every day.\nDo not take naps.\nDo not watch television or use your computer, cell phone, or tablet in the bedroom.\nAvoid tobacco products, especially before sleep.\nUse the bed only for sleep or sexual activity.\nIf you can't fall asleep after 20 minutes, get out of bed and do a quiet activity such as reading or listening to music.\nAvoid using sleeping pills to help you sleep, if possible. They can lead to dependence and can make sleep problems worse over time if you don't use them the right way."}

Your provider should assess your risks of daytime sleepiness, mental (cognitive) side effects, and falls before you begin taking sleep medicines.\nIf you think you need sleeping pills, talk with your provider about which pills are safe for you when taken properly. Certain sleeping pills should not be taken on a long-term basis.\nDo not drink alcohol at any time when you are using sleeping pills. Alcohol can make the side effects of all sleeping pills worse.\nWARNING: The FDA has asked manufacturers of certain sleep medicines to put stronger warning labels on their products so that consumers are more aware of the potential risks. Possible risks while taking such medicines include severe allergic reactions and dangerous sleep-related behaviors, including sleep-driving. Ask your provider about these risks.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nFor most people, sleep improves with treatment."}
