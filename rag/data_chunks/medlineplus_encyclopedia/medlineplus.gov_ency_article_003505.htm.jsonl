Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nApolipoprotein CII\nApolipoprotein CII\nApolipoprotein CII (apoCII) is a protein found in large fat particles that the gastrointestinal tract absorbs. It is also found in very low density lipoprotein (\nVLDL\n), which is made up of mostly triglycerides (a type of fat in your blood).\nThis article discusses the test used to check for apoCII in a sample of your blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be told not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, you may feel some pain, or only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing where the needle was inserted.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nApoCII measurements can help determine the type or cause of high blood fats. It is not clear whether the test results improve treatment. Because of this, most health insurance companies will not pay for the test."}

It is not clear whether the test results improve treatment. Because of this, most health insurance companies will not pay for the test. If you do not have high cholesterol or heart disease or a family history of these conditions, this test may not be recommended for you.\nNormal Results\nThe normal range is 3 to 5 mg/dL. However, apoCII results are usually reported as present or absent.\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nHigh levels of apoCII may be due to a family history of\nlipoprotein lipase deficiency\n. This is a condition in which the body does not break down fats normally.\nLow ApoCII levels are also seen in people with a rare condition called familial apoprotein CII deficiency."}
