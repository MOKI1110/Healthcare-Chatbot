Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBartholin cyst or abscess\nBartholin cyst or abscess\nBartholin abscess is the buildup of pus that forms a lump (\nswelling\n) in one of the Bartholin glands. These glands are found on each side of the vaginal opening.\nCauses\nA Bartholin\nabscess\nforms when a small opening (duct) from the gland gets blocked. Fluid in the gland builds up and may become infected. Fluid may build up over many years before an abscess occurs.\nOften the abscess appears quickly over several days. The area will become very warm and swollen. Activity that puts pressure on the\nvulva\n, and walking and sitting, may cause severe pain.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nA tender lump on either side of the vaginal opening\nSwelling and redness\nPain with sitting or walking\nFever\n, in people with low immunity\nPain with sexual intercourse\nVaginal discharge\nVaginal pressure\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will do a pelvic exam. The Bartholin gland will be enlarged and tender."}

In rare cases, a biopsy may be suggested in older women to look for a tumor.\nAny\nvaginal discharge\nor fluid drainage will be sent to a lab for testing.\nTreatment\nSELF-CARE STEPS\nSoaking in warm water 4 times a day for several days can ease the discomfort. It can also help the abscess open and drain on its own. However, the opening is often very small and closes quickly. Therefore, the abscess often returns.\nDRAINAGE OF THE ABSCESS\nA small surgical cut can completely drain the abscess. This relieves symptoms and provides the fastest recovery.\nThe procedure can be done under local anesthesia in a provider's office.\nA 1 to 2 cm cut is made at the site of abscess. The cavity is irrigated with normal saline. A catheter (tube) may be inserted and left in place for 4 to 6 weeks. This allows continuous drainage while the area heals. Sutures are not required.\nYou should begin soaking in warm water 1 to 2 days afterward."}

You cannot have sexual intercourse until the catheter is removed.\nYou may be asked to take antibiotics if there is pus or other signs of infection.\nMARSUPIALIZATION\nWomen can also be treated with a minor surgery called marsupialization.\nThe procedure involves creating an elliptical opening along the cyst to help the gland drain. The abscess is removed. The provider places stitches at the edges of the cyst.\nThe procedure can sometimes be done in the clinic with medicine to numb the area. In other cases, it may need to be done in the hospital with\ngeneral anesthesia\nso that you are asleep and pain-free.\nYou should begin soaking in warm water 1 to 2 days afterward. You cannot have sexual intercourse for 4 weeks after surgery.\nYou can use oral pain medicines after the procedure."}
