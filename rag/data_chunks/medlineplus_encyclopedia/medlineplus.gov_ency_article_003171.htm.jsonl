A group of four muscles and their tendons, called the rotator cuff, give the shoulder its wide range of motion.\nSwelling, damage, or bone changes around the rotator cuff can cause shoulder pain. You may have pain when lifting the arm above your head or moving it forward or behind your back.\nCauses\nThe most common cause of shoulder pain occurs when rotator cuff tendons become trapped under the bony area in the shoulder.
