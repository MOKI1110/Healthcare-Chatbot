These hormones include:\nGonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)\nFollicle stimulating hormone (FSH)\nLuteinizing hormone (LH)\nNormally:\nThe hypothalamus in the brain releases GnRH.\nThis hormone stimulates the pituitary gland to release FSH and LH.\nThese hormones tell the female ovaries or the male testes to release hormones that lead to normal sexual development in puberty, normal menstrual cycles, estrogen levels and fertility in adult women, and normal testosterone production and sperm production in adult men.\nAny change in this hormone release chain causes a lack of sex hormones."}
