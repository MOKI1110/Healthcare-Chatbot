The bacteria produce a toxin that causes skin damage. The damage creates blisters, as if the skin were scalded by heat. These blisters can occur at areas of the skin away from the initial site.\nSSS is found most commonly in infants and children under the age of 5.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nBlisters\nFever\nLarge areas of skin peel or fall away (exfoliation or desquamation)\nPainful skin\nRedness of the skin (\nerythema\n), which spreads to cover most of the body\nSkin slips off with gentle pressure, leaving wet red areas (\nNikolsky sign\n)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and look at the skin."}

IV fluids are also given to prevent dehydration. Much of the body's fluid is lost through open skin.\nMoist compresses to the skin may improve comfort. You can apply a moisturizing ointment to keep the skin moist."}
