Most of the time, it is caused by an infection that reaches the heart.\nWhen you have an infection, your immune system produces special cells to fight off disease. If the infection affects your heart, the disease-fighting cells enter the heart. However, the chemicals made by these cells can also damage the heart muscle. As a result, the heart can become thick, swollen, and weak.\nMany cases are caused by a virus that reaches the heart."}

These can include the SARS-CoV-2 virus (the virus that causes\nCOVID-19\n), influenza (flu) virus, coxsackievirus, parvovirus,\ncytomegalovirus\n, adenovirus, and others.\nIt may also be caused by bacterial infections such as Lyme disease, streptococcus, mycoplasma, and\nchlamydia\n.\nOther causes of myocarditis include:\nReactions to certain medicines, such as certain chemotherapy medicines\nExposure to chemicals in the environment, such as heavy metals\nInfections due to fungus or parasites\nRadiation\nAutoimmune disorders that cause inflammation throughout the body\nMyocarditis following COVID-19 vaccination has been reported, but is very rare\nSometimes the exact cause may not be discovered.\nSymptoms\nThere may be no symptoms.

If the provider suspects myocarditis based on the exam and chest x-ray, an\nelectrocardiogram\n(ECG) may also be done to help make the diagnosis. Heart biopsy is the most accurate way to confirm the diagnosis, but it is not always needed. Also, a heart biopsy may not reveal the diagnosis if the small piece of heart tissue that is removed does not contain the suspected organism or other indicators. Echocardiography (heart ultrasound) and cardiac MRI are also frequently used.\nOther tests that may be needed include:\nBlood cultures to check for infection\nBlood tests to look for antibodies against viruses or the heart muscle itself\nBlood tests to check liver and kidney function\nComplete blood count\nSpecial tests to check for the presence of viruses in the blood (viral PCR)\nTreatment\nTreatment is aimed at the cause of the problem, and may involve:\nAntibiotics to fight bacterial infection\nMedicines called steroids to reduce swelling\nIntravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a medicine made of substanc"}

Abnormal heart rhythms may require the use of other medicines. You may also need a device such as a pacemaker, or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator to correct a dangerous abnormal heartbeat.
