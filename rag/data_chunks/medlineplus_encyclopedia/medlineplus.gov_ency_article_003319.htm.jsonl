However, it is quite common in dogs (such as Dalmatians and Australian sheep dogs), cats, and horses.\nCauses\nMost cases of heterochromia are hereditary, caused by a disease or syndrome, or due to an injury. Sometimes, one eye may change color following certain diseases or injuries.\nSpecific causes of eye color changes include:\nBleeding (hemorrhage)\nFamilial heterochromia\nForeign object in the eye\nGlaucoma\n, or some medicines used to treat it\nInjury\nMild inflammation affecting only one eye\nNeurofibromatosis\nWaardenburg syndrome\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nTalk to your health care provider if you notice new changes in the color of one eye, or two differently colored eyes in your infant."}

A thorough eye exam is needed to rule out a medical problem.\nSome conditions and syndromes associated with heterochromia, such as pigmentary glaucoma, can only be detected by a thorough eye exam.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nYour provider may ask the following questions to help evaluate the cause:\nDid you notice the two different eye colors when the child was born, shortly after the birth, or recently?\nAre any other symptoms present?\nAn infant with heterochromia should be examined by both a pediatrician and an ophthalmologist for other possible problems.\nA complete eye exam can rule out most causes of heterochromia. If there doesn't seem to be an underlying disorder, no further testing may be needed. If another disorder is suspected diagnostic tests, such as blood tests or\nchromosome studies\n, may be done to confirm the diagnosis.\nAlternative Names\nDifferently colored eyes; Eyes - different colors\nImages\nHeterochromia\nReferences\nNischal KK.
