Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPyloroplasty\nPyloroplasty\nPyloroplasty is surgery to widen the opening in the lower part of the stomach (pylorus) so that stomach contents can empty into the small intestine (\nduodenum\n) more easily.\nThe pylorus is a thick, muscular area. When it thickens or its opening narrows, food cannot pass through normally.\nDescription\nThe surgery is done while you are under\ngeneral anesthesia\n(asleep and pain free).\nIf you have open surgery, the surgeon:\nMakes a large surgical cut in your belly to open the area.\nCuts through some of the thickened muscle where your stomach empties so it becomes wider.\nCloses the cut in a way that keeps the pylorus open. This allows the stomach to empty more easily.\nSurgeons can also do this surgery using a laparoscope. A laparoscope has a tiny camera that is inserted into your belly through a small cut. Video from the camera will appear on a monitor in the operating room. The surgeon views the monitor to do the surgery. During the surgery:\nThree to five small cuts are made in your belly."}

Smoking slows recovery and increases the risk of problems."}
