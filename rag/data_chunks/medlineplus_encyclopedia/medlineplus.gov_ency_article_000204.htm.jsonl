Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRenovascular hypertension\nRenovascular hypertension\nRenovascular hypertension is\nhigh blood pressure\ndue to narrowing of the arteries that carry blood to the kidneys. This condition is also called renal artery stenosis.\nCauses\nRenal artery stenosis is a narrowing or blockage of the arteries that supply blood to the kidneys.\nThe most common cause of renal artery stenosis is a blockage in the arteries. This problem most often occurs when a sticky, fatty substance called plaque builds up on the inner lining of the arteries, causing a condition known as atherosclerosis.\nWhen the arteries that carry blood to your kidneys become narrow, less blood flows to the kidneys. The kidneys mistakenly respond as if your blood pressure is low. As a result, they release hormones that tell the body to hold on to more salt and water."}

It is typically seen in women under age 50. It tends to run in families. The condition is caused by abnormal growth of cells in the walls of the arteries leading to the kidneys."}

There are many types available.\nEveryone responds to medicine differently. Your blood pressure should be checked often. The amount and type of medicine you take may need to be changed from time to time.\nAsk your provider what blood pressure reading is right for you.\nTake all medicines the way your provider prescribed them.\nHave your cholesterol levels checked, and treated if it is needed."}
