Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEnteroscopy\nEnteroscopy\nEnteroscopy is a procedure used to examine the small intestine (small bowel).\nHow the Test is Performed\nAn enteroscope uses a long flexible tube with a balloon and a camera attached that can go deep down the inside of the small bowel.\nDuring a single- or double-balloon enteroscopy, balloons attached to the endoscope can be inflated to allow the doctor to view a section of the small intestine. The enteroscope is usually inserted through the mouth for upper enteroscopy.\nIn a\ncolonoscopy\n, a flexible tube is inserted through your rectum and colon. The tube can most often reach into the end part of the small intestine (ileum). Occasionally, an enteroscope is inserted through the rectum to reach further into the end of the small intestine.\nCapsule endoscopy\nis done with a disposable capsule that you swallow. This transmits pictures to a recorder and is uploaded to a computer for viewing the pictures.\nTissue samples removed during enteroscopy are sent to the lab for examination."}

This transmits pictures to a recorder and is uploaded to a computer for viewing the pictures.\nTissue samples removed during enteroscopy are sent to the lab for examination. (Biopsies cannot be taken with a capsule endoscopy.)\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nTell the doctor doing your enteroscopy if you take blood thinners such as warfarin (Coumadin), clopidogrel (Plavix), apixaban (Eliquis), aspirin, or daily NSAIDs because these may interfere with the test. Do not stop taking any medicine unless told to do so by your doctor or health care provider.\nDo not eat any solid foods or milk products after midnight on the day of your procedure. You may have clear liquids until 4 hours before your exam.  Occasionally a laxative is given before the enteroscopy. Follow your specific instructions.\nYou must sign a consent form.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will be given calming and sedating medicine for the procedure and will not feel any discomfort. You may have some bloating or cramping when you wake up."}

You may have some bloating or cramping when you wake up. This is from air that is pumped into the abdomen to expand the area during the procedure.\nA capsule endoscopy causes no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is most often performed to help diagnose diseases of the small intestine. It may be done if you have:\nAbnormal x-ray results\nTumors in the small intestine\nUnexplained diarrhea\nUnexplained gastrointestinal bleeding\nNormal Results\nIn a normal test result, the doctor will not find sources of bleeding in the small bowel, and will not find any tumors or other abnormal tissue.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal signs during an enteroscopy may include:\nAbnormalities of the tissue lining the small intestine (mucosa) or the tiny, finger-like projections on the surface of the small intestine (villi)\nAbnormal lengthening of blood vessels (angioectasia) in the intestinal lining\nImmune cells called PAS-positive macrophages\nPolyps\nor cancer\nRadiation enteritis\nSwollen or enlarged\nlymph nodes\nor lymphatic vessels\nUlcers\nChanges found"}
