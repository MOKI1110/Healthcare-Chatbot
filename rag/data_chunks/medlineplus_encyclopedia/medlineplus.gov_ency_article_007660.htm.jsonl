Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPediatric sleep apnea\nPediatric sleep apnea\nWith pediatric sleep apnea, a child's breathing pauses during sleep because the airway has become narrowed or partly blocked.\nCauses\nDuring sleep, all of the muscles in the body become more relaxed. This includes the muscles that help keep the throat open so air can flow into the lungs.\nNormally, the throat remains open enough during sleep to let air pass by. However, some children have a narrow throat. This is often because of large tonsils or adenoids, which partially block the airflow. When the muscles in their upper throat relax during sleep, the tissues close in and block the airway. This stop in breathing is called apnea.\nOther factors that also may increase the risk of sleep apnea in children include:\nA small jaw\nCertain shapes of the roof of the mouth (palate)\nLarge tongue, which may fall back and block the airway\nObesity\nPoor muscle tone due to conditions such as\nDown syndrome\nor\ncerebral palsy\nSymptoms\nLoud snoring is a telltale symptom of sleep apnea."}

Snoring is caused by air squeezing through the narrowed or blocked airway. However, not every child who snores has sleep apnea.\nChildren with sleep apnea also have the following symptoms at night:\nLong silent pauses in breathing followed by snorts, choking, and gasps for air\nBreathing mainly though the mouth\nRestless sleep\nWaking up often\nSleepwalking\nSweating\nBedwetting\nDuring the daytime, children with sleep apnea may:\nFeel sleepy or drowsy throughout the day\nAct grumpy, impatient, or irritable\nHave trouble concentrating in school\nHave hyperactive behavior\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will take your child's medical history and do a physical exam.\nYour provider will check your child's mouth, neck, and throat.\nYour child may be asked about daytime sleepiness, how well they sleep, and bedtime habits.\nYour child may be given a\nsleep study\nto confirm sleep apnea.\nTreatment\nSurgery to remove the tonsils and adenoids often cures the condition in children.\nIf needed, surgery als"}

In that case, your child may use a\ncontinuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device\n.\nYour child wears a mask over their nose during sleep.\nThe mask is connected by a hose to a small machine that sits at the side of the bed.\nThe machine pumps air under pressure through the hose and mask and into the airway during sleep. This helps keep the airway open.\nIt can take some time to get used to sleeping using CPAP therapy. Good follow-up and support from a sleep center can help your child overcome any problems using CPAP.\nOther treatments may include:\nInhaled nasal steroids.\nDental device."}
