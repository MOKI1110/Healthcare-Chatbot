As a result, the covering (\nmyelin\nsheath) around the nerve cells is damaged. This disturbs the signals between spinal nerves and rest of the body.\nTransverse myelitis can cause pain, muscle weakness, paralysis, and bladder or bowel problems.\nCauses\nTransverse myelitis is a rare nervous system disorder. In many cases, the cause is unknown. However, certain conditions may lead to transverse myelitis:\nBacterial, viral, parasitic, or fungal infection, such as HIV,\nsyphilis\n, varicella zoster (\nshingles\n), West Nile virus,\nZika virus\n, enteroviruses, and\nLyme disease\nImmune system disorders, such as\nmultiple sclerosis (MS)\n,\nSjÃ¶gren syndrome\n, and\nlupus\nOther inflammatory disorders, such as\nsarcoidosis\n, or a connective tissue disease called\nscleroderma\nBlood vessel disorders that affect the spine\nTransverse myelitis affects men and women of all ages and races.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of transverse myelitis may develop within a few hours or days."}

Or, they may develop over 1 to 4 weeks. Symptoms can quickly become severe.\nSymptoms tend to occur at or below the damaged area of the spinal cord. Both sides of the body are often affected, but sometimes only one side is affected.\nSymptoms include:\nAbnormal sensations:\nNumbness\nPricking\nTingling\nColdness\nBurning\nSensitivity to touch or temperature\nBowel and bladder symptoms:\nConstipation\nInability to urinate\nFrequent need to urinate\nDifficulty holding urine\nUrine leakage (incontinence)\nPain:\nSharp or blunt\nMay start in your lower back\nMay shoot down your arms and legs or wrap around your trunk or chest\nMuscle weakness:\nLoss of balance\nDifficulty walking (stumbling or dragging your feet)\nPartial loss of function, which may develop into paralysis\nSexual dysfunction:\nDifficulty having an orgasm (men and women)\nErectile dysfunction in men\nOther symptoms can include loss of appetite, fever, and respiratory problems."}

The provider will also do a nervous system examination to check for:\nWeakness or loss of muscle function, such as muscle tone and reflexes\nPain level\nAbnormal sensations\nTests to diagnose transverse myelitis and to rule out other causes include:\nMRI\nof the spinal cord to check for inflammation or abnormalities\nSpinal tap (lumbar puncture)\nBlood tests\nTreatment\nTreatment for transverse myelitis helps to:\nTreat an infection that caused the condition\nReduce inflammation of the spinal cord\nRelieve or reduce symptoms\nYou may be given:\nSteroid medicines through a vein (IV) to decrease inflammation.\nPlasma exchange therapy."}

Most recovery occurs within 3 months after the condition occurs. For some, healing may take months to years. About a third of people with transverse myelitis recover completely. Some people recover with moderate disabilities, such as bowel problems and trouble walking. Others have permanent disability and need help with daily activities.\nThose who may have poor chance of recovery are:\nPeople who have rapid onset of symptoms\nPeople whose symptoms do not improve within the first 3 to 6 months\nTransverse myelitis usually only occurs once in most people."}
