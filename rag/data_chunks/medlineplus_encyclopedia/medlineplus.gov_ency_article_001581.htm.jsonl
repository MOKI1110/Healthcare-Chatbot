Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nApert syndrome\nApert syndrome\nApert syndrome is a genetic disease in which the seams between the skull bones close earlier than normal. This affects the shape of the head and face. Children with Apert syndrome often have deformities of the hands and feet as well.\nCauses\nApert syndrome can be passed down through families (inherited) as an\nautosomal dominant\ntrait. This means that only one parent needs to pass on the altered gene to a child to have the condition.\nMost cases may occur without a known family history.\nApert syndrome is caused by one of two changes to the\nFGFR2\ngene. This gene change causes some of the bony sutures of the skull to close too early."}

This gene change causes some of the bony sutures of the skull to close too early. This condition is called\ncraniosynostosis\n.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nEarly closure of sutures between bones of the skull, noted by ridging along sutures (craniosynostosis)\nFrequent ear infections\nFusion or severe webbing of the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th fingers, often called \"mitten hands\"\nHearing loss\nLarge or late-closing soft spot on a baby's skull (fontanelle)\nPossible, slow intellectual development (varies from person to person)\nProminent or bulging eyes\nSevere under-development of the midface\nSkeletal (limb) abnormalities\nShort height\nWebbing or fusion of the toes\nSeveral other syndromes can lead to a similar appearance of the face and head, but do not include the severe hand and foot features of Apert syndrome. These similar syndromes include:\nCarpenter syndrome (kleeblattschadel, cloverleaf skull deformity)\nCrouzon disease (craniofacial dysostosis)\nPfeiffer syndrome\nSaethre-Chotzen syndrome\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

Hand, foot, and\nskull x-rays\nwill be done. Hearing tests should always be performed.\nGenetic testing can confirm the diagnosis of Apert syndrome.\nTreatment\nTreatment consists of surgery to correct abnormal bone growth of the skull, as well as for the fusion of the fingers and toes. Children with this disorder should be examined by a specialized craniofacial surgery team at a children's medical center.\nA hearing specialist should be consulted if there are hearing problems.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with Apert syndrome and their families can be found at:\nChildren's Craniofacial Association:\nccakids.org\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have a family history of Apert syndrome or you notice your baby's skull is not developing normally.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling may be helpful if you have a family history of this disorder and are planning to become pregnant."}
