Exposure may occur:\nAfter a needle stick or sharps injury\nIf blood from someone who has HCV contacts a cut on your skin or contacts your eyes or mouth\nWhile injecting street drugs\nPeople at risk for HCV are those who:\nInject street drugs or share a needle with someone who has HCV\nHave been on long-term kidney dialysis\nHave regular contact with blood at work (such as a health care worker)\nHave unprotected sexual contact with a person who has HCV\nWere born to a mother who had HCV\nReceived a tattoo or acupuncture with needles that were not disinfected properly after being used on another person (risk is very low with practitioners who have a tattoo license or permit or an acupuncture license)\nReceived an organ transplant from"}

Some people have yellowing of the skin (jaundice). Chronic infection often causes no symptoms. But fatigue, depression and other problems can occur.\nPersons who have long-term (chronic) infection often have no symptoms until their liver becomes scarred (\ncirrhosis\n)."}

This screening test checks for antibodies against HCV (anti-HCV). If the antibody test is positive, a PCR test is used to confirm HCV infection.\nFurther genetic testing is done to check for the type of HCV (genotype). There are six types of the virus (genotypes 1 through 6)."}

Ask your provider about liver disease resources and support groups in your area.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people (75% to 85%) who are infected with the virus develop chronic HCV. This condition poses a risk for cirrhosis and liver cancer. The outlook for HCV depends in part on the genotype.\nA good response to treatment occurs when the virus can no longer be detected in the blood 12 weeks or more after treatment. This is called \"sustained virologic response\" (SVR). Up to 90% of those treated for some genotypes have this type of response.\nSome people do not respond to initial treatment."}
