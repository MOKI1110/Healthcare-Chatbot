The heart must be donated by someone who is brain-dead but is still on life support. The donor heart must be in normal condition without disease and must be matched as closely as possible to your blood and tissue type to reduce the chance that your body will reject it.\nFor this surgery, you are put into a deep sleep with\ngeneral anesthesia\n, and a cut is made through the breastbone.\nYour blood flows through a heart-lung bypass machine while the surgeon works on your heart. This machine does the work of your heart and lungs while they are stopped, and supplies your body with blood and oxygen.\nYour diseased heart is removed and the donor heart is stitched in place. The heart-lung machine is then disconnected."}

They will want to make sure that you are a good candidate for a transplant. You will visit many times over several weeks or even months. You will need to have blood drawn and x-rays taken. The following may also be done:\nBlood or skin tests to check for infections\nTests of your kidney and liver\nTests to evaluate your heart, such as\nECG\n,\nechocardiogram\n, and\ncardiac catheterization\nTests to look for cancer\nTissue and blood typing\n, to help make sure your body will not reject the donated heart\nUltrasound of your neck and legs\nYou will want to look at one or more transplant centers to see which would be best for you:\nAsk them how many transplants they perform every year and what their survival rates are.

Key factors include the type and severity of your heart disease, and how sick you are at the time you are listed.\nThe amount of time you spend on a waiting list is usually NOT a factor for how soon you get a heart, except in the case of children.\nMost, but not all, people who are waiting for a heart transplant are very ill and need to be in the hospital.

Many will need some sort of device to help their heart pump enough blood to the body. Most often, this is a\nventricular assist device\n(VAD).\nAfter the Procedure\nYou should expect to stay in the hospital for 7 to 21 days after a heart transplant. The first 24 to 48 hours will likely be in the intensive care unit (ICU). During the first few days after a transplant, you will need close follow-up to make sure that you do not get an infection and your heart is working well.\nThe recovery period is about 3 months and often, your transplant team will ask you to stay fairly close to the hospital during that time period. You will need to have regular check-ups with blood tests, x-rays, and echocardiograms for many years.\nFighting rejection is an ongoing process. The body's immune system considers the transplanted organ a foreign body and fights it. For this reason, organ transplant patients must take medicines that suppress the body's\nimmune response\n."}

The body's immune system considers the transplanted organ a foreign body and fights it. For this reason, organ transplant patients must take medicines that suppress the body's\nimmune response\n. To prevent rejection, it is very important to take these medicines and carefully follow your self-care instructions.\nBiopsies of the heart muscle are often done every month during the first 6 to 12 months after transplant, and then less often after that. This helps determine if your body is rejecting the new heart, even before you have symptoms.\nYou must take medicines that prevent transplant rejection for the rest of your life. You will need to understand how to take these medicines, and know their side effects.\nYou can go back to your normal activities 3 months after the transplant as soon as you feel well enough, and after talking with your health care provider. Consult your provider if you plan to engage in vigorous physical activity.\nIf you develop coronary disease after a transplant, you may have cardiac catheterization every year.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHeart transplant prolongs the life of people who would otherwise die."}

About 90% of heart transplant patients are alive 2 years after the operation. At 5 years, 75% of patients will still be alive after a heart transplant.\nThe main problem, as with other transplants, is rejection. If rejection can be controlled, survival increases to over 10 years.\nAlternative Names\nCardiac transplant; Transplant - heart; Transplantation - heart\nImages\nHeart - section through the middle\nHeart - front view\nNormal anatomy of the heart\nHeart transplant  - series\nReferences\nChiu P, Robbins RC, Ha R.
