A hernia is tissue that bulges out of a weak spot in the abdominal wall. Your intestine may bulge out through this weakened area.\nDescription\nDuring surgery to repair the hernia, the bulging tissue is pushed back into your abdomen. Your abdominal wall is strengthened and supported with sutures (stitches), and often mesh. This repair can be done with open or laparoscopic surgery. You and your surgeon can discuss which type of surgery is right for you.\nYour surgeon will decide which kind of anesthesia you will receive:\nGeneral anesthesia\nis medicine that keeps you asleep and pain-free.\nRegional anesthesia\n, which numbs you from the waist to your feet.\nLocal anesthesia and medicine to relax you\n.\nIn open surgery:\nYour surgeon makes a cut near the hernia.\nThe hernia is located and separated from the tissues around it."}

The hernia sac is removed or the hernia is gently pushed back into your abdomen.\nYour surgeon then closes your weakened abdominal muscles with stitches.\nOften a piece of mesh is also sewn into place to strengthen your abdominal wall. This repairs the weakness in the wall of your abdomen.\nAt the end of the repair, the cut is stitched, stapled or glued.\nIn laparoscopic surgery:\nThe surgeon makes three to five small cuts in your lower belly.\nA medical device called a laparoscope is inserted through one of the cuts. The scope is a thin, lighted tube with a camera on the end. It lets your surgeon see inside your belly.\nA harmless gas is pumped into your belly to expand the space. This gives your surgeon more room to see and work.\nOther tools are inserted through the other cuts. Your surgeon uses these tools to repair the hernia.\nThe same repair will be done as the repair in open surgery, including mesh placement.\nAt the end of the repair, the scope and other tools are removed."}

The cuts are stitched.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nYour health care provider may suggest hernia surgery if you have pain or your hernia bothers you during your everyday activities. If the hernia is small and not causing any symptoms, you may not need surgery. However, these hernias most often do not go away on their own, tend to get larger, and a good number end up needing surgery.\nSometimes the intestine can be trapped inside the hernia. This is called an incarcerated or strangulated hernia. It can cut off blood supply to the intestines. This can be life threatening."}

These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\nLet your surgeon know about any illness you may have before your surgery.

Most can go home the same day, but some may need to stay in the hospital overnight.\nSome men may have problems passing urine after hernia surgery. If you have problems urinating, you may need a catheter. This is a thin flexible tube that is inserted into your bladder for a short time to drain urine.\nFollowing instructions about how active you can be while recovering. This may include:\nReturning to light activities soon after going home, but avoiding strenuous activities and heavy lifting for a few weeks.\nAvoiding activities that can increase pressure in the groin and belly."}
