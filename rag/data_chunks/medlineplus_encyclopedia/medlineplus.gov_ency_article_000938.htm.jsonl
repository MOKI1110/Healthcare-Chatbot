The person does not have a full-blown\npsychotic\ndisorder, such as\nschizophrenia\n.\nCauses\nCauses of PPD are unknown. PPD seems to be more common in families with psychotic disorders, such as schizophrenia and delusional disorder. This suggests genes may be involved. Other factors may play a role as well.\nPPD seems to be more common in men.\nSymptoms\nPeople with PPD are very suspicious of other people. As a result, they severely limit their social lives.
