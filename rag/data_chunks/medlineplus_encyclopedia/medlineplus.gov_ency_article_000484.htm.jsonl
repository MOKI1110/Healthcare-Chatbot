Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nGlomerulonephritis\nGlomerulonephritis\nGlomerulonephritis is a type of kidney disease in which the part of your kidneys that helps filter waste and fluids from the blood is damaged.\nCauses\nThe filtering unit of the kidney is called the glomerulus. Each kidney has many thousands of glomeruli. The glomeruli help the body get rid of harmful substances.\nGlomerulonephritis may be caused by problems with the body's immune system. Often, the exact cause of this condition is unknown.\nDamage to the glomeruli causes blood and protein to be lost in the urine.\nThe condition may develop quickly, and kidney function is lost within weeks or months."}
