Certain sensations or movements produce  specific muscle responses.\nConsiderations\nThe presence and strength of a reflex is an important sign of nervous system development and function.\nMany infant reflexes disappear as the child grows older, although some remain through adulthood. A reflex that is still present after the age when it would normally disappear can be a sign of brain or nervous system damage.\nInfant reflexes are responses that are normal in infants, but abnormal in other age groups. These include:\nMoro reflex\nSucking reflex (sucks when area around mouth is touched)\nStartle reflex (pulling arms and legs in after hearing loud noise)\nStep reflex (stepping motions when sole of foot touches hard surface)\nOther infant reflexes include:\nTONIC NECK REFLEX\nThis reflex occurs when the head of a child who is relaxed and lying face up is moved to the side."}

The arm on the side where the head is facing reaches away from the body with the hand partly open. The arm on the side away from the face is flexed and the fist is clenched tightly. Turning the baby's face in the other direction reverses the position. The tonic neck position is often described as the fencer's position because it looks like a fencer's stance.\nTRUNCAL INCURVATION OR GALANT REFLEX\nThis reflex occurs when the side of the infant's spine is stroked or tapped while the infant lies on the stomach. The infant will twitch their hips toward the touch in a dancing movement.\nGRASP REFLEX\nThis reflex occurs if you place a finger on the infant's open palm. The hand will close around the finger. Trying to remove the finger causes the grip to tighten. Newborn infants have strong grasps and can almost be lifted up if both hands are grasping your fingers.\nROOTING REFLEX\nThis reflex occurs when the baby's cheek is stroked."}

The infant will turn toward the side that was stroked and begin to make sucking motions.\nPARACHUTE REFLEX\nThis reflex occurs in slightly older infants when the child is held upright and the baby's body is rotated quickly to face forward (as in falling). The baby will extend their arms forward as if to break a fall, even though this reflex appears long before the baby walks.\nExamples of reflexes that last into adulthood are:\nBlinking reflex: blinking the eyes when they are touched or when a sudden bright light appears\nCough reflex: coughing when the airway is stimulated\nGag reflex: gagging when the throat or back of the mouth is stimulated\nSneeze reflex: sneezing when the nasal passages are irritated\nYawn reflex: yawning when the body needs more oxygen\nCauses\nInfant reflexes can occur in adults who have:\nBrain damage\nStroke\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nYour health care provider will often discover abnormal infant reflexes during an exam that is done for another reason."}
