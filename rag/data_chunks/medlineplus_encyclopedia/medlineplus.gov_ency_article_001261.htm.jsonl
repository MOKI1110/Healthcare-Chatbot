Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHigh arch\nHigh arch\nHigh arch is a foot arch that is raised more than normal. The arch runs from the toes to the heel on the bottom of the foot. It is also called pes cavus.\nHigh arch is the opposite of\nflat feet\n.\nCauses\nHigh foot arches are much less common than flat feet. They can be caused by a bone (orthopedic) or nerve (neurological) condition.\nUnlike flat feet, highly arched feet tend to be painful. This is so because more stress is placed on the section of the foot between the ankle and toes (metatarsals). This condition can make it difficult to fit into shoes. People who have high arches most often need foot support. A high arch may cause disability.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nShortened foot length\nDifficulty fitting shoes\nFoot pain\nwith walking, standing, and running (not everyone has this symptom)\nExams and Tests\nWhen the person stands on the foot, the instep looks hollow."}

Most of the weight is on the back and balls of the foot (metatarsals head).\nYour health care provider will check to see if the high arch is flexible, meaning it can be moved around.\nTests that may be done include:\nX-ray\nof the feet\nX-ray of the spine\nElectromyography\nMRI of the spine\nNerve conduction studies\nGenetic testing to look for genes that you can pass on to your child\nTreatment\nHigh arches, particularly ones that are flexible or well cared for, may not need any treatment.\nOrthotics that can be placed in shoes may help the symptoms of high arches. Corrective shoes may help relieve pain and improve walking. This includes changes to the shoes, such as an arch insert and a supportive insole.\nSurgery to flatten the foot is sometimes needed in severe cases. Any nerve problems that exist must be treated and monitored by specialists.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook depends on the condition causing high arches."}
