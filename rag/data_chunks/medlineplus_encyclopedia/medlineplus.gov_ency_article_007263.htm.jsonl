Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAvian influenza\nAvian influenza\nAvian influenza A viruses cause the influenza (\nflu\n) infection in birds. These viruses occur in wild birds and can infect domestic poultry. The viruses that cause the disease in birds can change their genes (mutate) so they can spread to other animals and humans.\nAs of May 2024, H5N1 bird flu has spread to poultry and dairy cows in the United States and has infected some poultry and dairy workers.\nCauses\nThe first avian influenza in humans was reported in Hong Kong in 1997. It was called avian influenza (H5N1). The outbreak was linked to chickens.\nSince then, there have been human cases of avian influenza A in Asia, Africa, Europe, Indonesia, Vietnam, the Pacific, and the Near East. The virus has caused illness and even death in humans. While rare, avian influenza has also spread to humans in the United States.\nThe latest outbreak in the United States started in 2022 and has affected over 1,100 flocks of birds in 48 states.\nIn March 2024, the virus was detected for the first time in dairy cows."}

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports at least 16 states where H5N1 bird flu has infected dairy cows.\nSince April 2024, there have been a total of 61 reported cases of H5N1 in humans in the United States. Symptoms have included a cough, runny nose, sore throat, chills, fever, and\nconjunctivitis\n(eye infection). In December 2024, one person was hospitalized with a severe case of H5N1 after exposure to sick and dead birds in a backyard flock.\nCurrently, the risk for infection in people is low."}

Birds who were infected with the avian flu can shed the virus in their feces and saliva for as long as 10 days.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of avian flu infection in humans depend on the strain of virus.\nThe avian influenza virus in humans causes typical flu-like symptoms, such as:\nCough\nDiarrhea\nTrouble breathing\nFever\ngreater than 100.4 °F (38 °C)\nHeadache\nGeneral ill feeling\n(malaise)\nMuscle aches\nRunny nose\nSore throat\nExams and Tests\nIf you think you have been exposed to the avian flu virus, notify your health care provider before your office visit.

For the medicine to work, you need to start taking it within 48 hours after your symptoms start.\nOseltamivir may also be prescribed for people who live in the same house as people with avian flu.
