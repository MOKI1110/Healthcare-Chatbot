The full effect to your skin may not appear for 24 hours or longer. Possible symptoms include:\nRed, tender skin that is warm to the touch\nBlisters\nthat develop hours to days later\nSevere reactions (sometimes called sun poisoning), including fever, chills, nausea, or rash\nSkin peeling on sunburned areas several days after the sunburn\nSymptoms of sunburn are usually temporary. But the damage to skin cells is often permanent, which can have serious long-term effects. These include\nskin cancer\nand\nearly aging of the skin\n. By the time the skin starts to become painful and red, the damage has been done. Pain is worst between 6 to 48 hours after sun exposure.\nCauses\nSunburn results when the amount of exposure to the sun or other ultraviolet light source exceeds the ability of melanin to protect the skin.\nMelanin\nis the skin's protective coloring (pigment)."}

Sunburn in a very light-skinned person may occur in less than 15 minutes of midday sun exposure, while a dark-skinned person may tolerate the same exposure for hours.\nKeep in mind:\nThere is no such thing as a \"healthy tan.\" Unprotected sun exposure causes early aging of the skin and skin cancer.\nSun exposure can cause first- and second-degree\nburns\n.\nSkin cancer usually appears in adulthood. But it is caused by sun exposure and sunburns that began as early as childhood.\nFactors that make sunburn more likely:\nInfants and children are very sensitive to the burning effects of the sun.\nPeople with fair skin are more likely to get sunburn. But even dark and black skin can burn and should be protected.\nThe sun's rays are strongest during the hours of 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. The sun's rays are also stronger at higher altitudes and lower latitudes (closer to the equator)."}

These can cause allergies in some people and make the burn worse.\nIf there are blisters, dry bandages may help prevent infection.\nIf your skin is not blistering, moisturizing cream may be applied to relieve discomfort. DO NOT use butter, petroleum jelly (Vaseline), or other oil-based products. These can block pores so that heat and sweat cannot escape, which can lead to infection."}

DO NOT pick at or peel away the top part of the blisters.\nCreams with vitamins C and E may help limit damage to skin cells.\nOver-the-counter medicines, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, help to relieve pain from sunburn. DO NOT give aspirin to children.\nCortisone creams may help reduce inflammation.\nLoose cotton clothing should be worn.\nDrink lots of water.\nWays to prevent sunburn include:\nUse a broad-spectrum sunscreen of SPF 30 or higher. A broad-spectrum sunscreen protects from both UVB and UVA rays.\nApply a generous amount of sunscreen to fully cover exposed skin. Reapply sunscreen every 2 hours or as often as the label says.\nReapply sunscreen after swimming or sweating and even when it is cloudy.\nUse a lip balm with sunscreen.\nWear a hat with a wide brim and other protective clothing.
