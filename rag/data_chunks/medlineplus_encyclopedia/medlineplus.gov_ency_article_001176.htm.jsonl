Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nGrowth hormone deficiency - children\nGrowth hormone deficiency - children\nGrowth hormone deficiency means the pituitary gland does not make enough growth hormone.\nCauses\nThe pituitary gland is located at the base of the brain. This gland controls the body's balance of hormones. It also makes growth hormone. This hormone causes a child to grow.\nGrowth hormone deficiency may be present at birth. Growth hormone deficiency may be the result of a medical condition. Severe brain injury may also cause growth hormone deficiency.\nChildren with physical defects of the face and skull, such as\ncleft lip or cleft palate\n, may have decreased growth hormone level.\nMost of the time, the cause of growth hormone deficiency is unknown.\nSymptoms\nSlow growth may first be noticed in infancy and continue through childhood. Your child's health care provider will most often draw your child's growth curve on a\ngrowth chart\n. Children with growth hormone deficiency have a slow or flat rate of growth."}

Your child's health care provider will most often draw your child's growth curve on a\ngrowth chart\n. Children with growth hormone deficiency have a slow or flat rate of growth. The slow growth may not show up until a child is 2 or 3 years old.\nThe child will be much shorter than most children of the same age and sex. The child will still have normal body proportions, but may be chubby. The child's face often looks younger than other children of the same age. The child will have normal intelligence in most cases.\nIn older children, puberty may come late or may not come at all, depending on the cause.\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam, including weight, height, and body proportions, will show signs of slowed growth. The child will not follow the normal growth curves.\nhand x-ray\ncan determine bone age. Normally, the size and shape of bones change as a person grows. These changes can be seen on an x-ray and they most often follow a pattern as a child grows older.\nTesting is most often done after the provider has looked into other causes of poor growth."}

These changes can be seen on an x-ray and they most often follow a pattern as a child grows older.\nTesting is most often done after the provider has looked into other causes of poor growth. Tests that may be done include:\nInsulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3). These are substances that growth hormones cause the body to make. Tests can measure these growth factors. Accurate growth hormone deficiency testing involves a\nstimulation test\n. This test takes several hours.\nMRI\nof the head can show the hypothalamus and pituitary glands.\nTests to measure other hormone levels may be done, because a lack of growth hormone may not be the only problem.\nTreatment\nTreatment involves growth hormone shots (injections) given at home. The shots are most often given once a day. Older children can often learn how to give themselves the shot.\nTreatment with growth hormone is long-term, often lasting for several years. During this time, the child needs to be seen regularly by their provider to ensure the treatment is working."}

Common side effects include:\nHeadache\nFluid retention\nMuscle and joint aches\nSlippage of the hip bones\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe earlier the condition is treated, the better the chance that a child will grow to near-normal adult height. Many children gain 4 or more inches (about 10 centimeters) during the first year, and 3 or more inches (about 7.6 centimeters) during the next 2 years."}
