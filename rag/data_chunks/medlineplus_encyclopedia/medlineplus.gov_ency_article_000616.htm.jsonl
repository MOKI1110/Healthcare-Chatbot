It is caused by\nLegionella\nbacteria.\nCauses\nThe bacteria that cause Legionnaires disease have been found in water delivery systems. They can survive in the warm, moist air conditioning systems of large buildings, including hospitals.\nMost cases are caused by the bacteria\nLegionella pneumophila\n. The rest of the cases are caused by other\nLegionella\nspecies.\nSpread of the bacteria from person to person has not been demonstrated.\nMost infections occur in middle-aged or older people. In rare cases, children can get the infection. When they do, the disease is less severe.\nRisk factors include:\nAlcohol use\nCigarette smoking\nChronic illnesses, such as\nkidney failure\nor\ndiabetes\nLong-term (chronic) lung disease, such as\nCOPD\nLong-term use of a breathing machine (ventilator)\nMedicines that suppress the immune system, including\nchemotherapy\nand steroid medicines\nOlder age\nSymptoms\nSymptoms tend to get worse during the first 4 to 6 days."}

Abnormal sounds, called crackles, may be heard when listening to the chest with a stethoscope.\nTests that may be done include:\nArterial blood gases\nBlood cultures or other tests to identify the bacteria\nBronchoscopy\nto view the airways and diagnose lung disease\nChest x-ray\nor\nCT scan\nComplete blood count\n(CBC), including\nwhite blood cell count\nLiver blood tests\nTests and cultures on sputum to identify\nLegionella\nbacteria\nUrine tests to check for\nLegionella pneumophila\nbacteria\nMolecular tests with polymerase chain reaction (PCR)\nTreatment\nAntibiotics are used to fight the infection. Treatment is started as soon as Legionnaire disease is suspected, without waiting for results of any lab test.\nOther treatments may include receiving:\nFluids through a vein (IV)\nOxygen, which is given through a mask or breathing machine\nMedicines that are breathed in to ease breathing\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nLegionnaires disease can be life threatening."}
