This is an involuntary stop in breathing that is not in the child's control.\nCauses\nBabies as young as 2 months old and up to 2 years old can start having breath-holding spells. Some children have severe spells.\nChildren can have breath-holding spells when they are responding to:\nFear\nPain\nTraumatic event\nBeing startled or confronted\nBreath-holding spells are more common in children with:\nGenetic conditions, such as\nRiley-Day syndrome\nor\nRett syndrome\nIron deficiency anemia\nA family history of breath-holding spells (parents may have had similar spells when they were children)\nSymptoms\nBreath-holding spells most often occur when a child becomes suddenly upset or surprised. The child makes a short gasp, exhales, and stops breathing. The child's nervous system slows the heart rate or breathing for a short amount of time. Breath- holding spells are not thought to be a willful act of defiance, even though they often occur with\ntemper tantrums\n."}

Breath- holding spells are not thought to be a willful act of defiance, even though they often occur with\ntemper tantrums\n. Symptoms can include:\nBlue (cyanosis) or pale skin\nCrying, then no breathing\nFainting or loss of alertness (unconsciousness)\nJerky movements (short, seizure-like movements)\nNormal breathing starts again after a brief period of unconsciousness. The child's color improves with the first breath. This may occur several times per day, or only on rare occasions.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions about your child's medical history and symptoms.\nBlood tests may be done to check for an iron deficiency.\nOther tests that may be done include:\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG) to check the heart\nElectroencephalogram\n(EEG) to check for seizures\nTreatment\nNo treatment is usually needed. But iron drops or pills may be given if your child has an iron deficiency.\nBreath-holding can be a frightening experience for parents."}
