The area of the bite may become warm and red. When one of these spiders is threatened, it rubs its hind legs across its own body surface and flicks thousands of tiny hairs toward the threat. These hairs have barbs that can pierce human skin. This causes causing swollen, itchy bumps to form. Itching may last for weeks.\nIf you are allergic to tarantula venom, these symptoms may occur:\nBreathing difficulty\nLoss of blood flow to major organs (an extreme reaction)\nEyelid puffiness\nItchiness\nLow blood pressure and collapse (\nshock\n)\nRapid heart rate\nSkin rash\nSwelling at the site of the bite\nSwelling of the lips and throat\nHome Care\nSeek medical help right away.\nWash the area with soap and water. Place ice (wrapped in a clean cloth or other covering) on the site of the sting for 10 minutes and then off for 10 minutes. Repeat this process."}
