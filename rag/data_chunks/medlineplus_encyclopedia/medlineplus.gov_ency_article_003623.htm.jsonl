Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCSF-VDRL test\nCSF-VDRL test\nThe CSF-VDRL test is used to help diagnose\nneurosyphilis\n. It looks for substances (proteins) called\nantibodies\n, which are sometimes produced by the body in reaction to the syphilis-causing bacteria.\nHow the Test is Performed\nsample of spinal fluid\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nFollow your health care provider's instructions on how to prepare for this test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe CSF-VDRL test is done to diagnose syphilis in the brain or spinal cord. Brain and spinal cord involvement is often a sign of late-stage syphilis.\nBlood screening tests (\nVDRL\nand\nRPR\n) are better at detecting middle-stage (secondary or latent) syphilis.\nNormal Results\nA negative result is normal.\nFalse-negatives can occur. This means you can have syphilis even if this test is normal. Therefore, a negative test does not always rule out the infection."}

This means you can have syphilis even if this test is normal. Therefore, a negative test does not always rule out the infection. Other signs and tests may be used to diagnose neurosyphilis.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA positive result is abnormal and is a sign of neurosyphilis.\nRisks\nRisks for this test are those related to lumbar puncture, which may include:\nBleeding into the spinal canal or around the brain (subdural hematomas).\nDiscomfort during the test.\nHeadache after the test that can last a few hours or days. If headaches last more than a few days (especially when you sit, stand or walk) you might have a CSF-leak. You should talk to your physician if this occurs.\nHypersensitivity (allergic) reaction to the anesthetic.\nInfection introduced by the needle going through the skin.\nYour provider can tell you about any other risks.\nAlternative Names\nVenereal disease research laboratory slide test - CSF; Neurosyphilis - VDRL\nImages\nCSF test for syphilis\nReferences\nKarcher DS, McPherson RA.
