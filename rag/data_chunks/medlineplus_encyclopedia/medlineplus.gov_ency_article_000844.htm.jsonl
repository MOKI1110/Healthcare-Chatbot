An allergen is a substance that, for most people, is harmless, but in some people, it can cause an allergic reaction.\nAfter being exposed to a substance such as bee sting venom, the person's immune system becomes sensitized to it. When the person is exposed to that allergen again, an allergic reaction may occur. Anaphylaxis usually happens quickly after the exposure. The condition is severe and involves the whole body.\nTissues in different parts of the body release histamine and other substances. This causes the airways to tighten and leads to other symptoms.\nSome medicines (morphine, x-ray dye, aspirin, and others) may cause an anaphylactic-like reaction (often called an anaphylactoid reaction) when people are first exposed to them. These reactions are not the same as the immune system response that occurs with true anaphylaxis."}

These reactions are not the same as the immune system response that occurs with true anaphylaxis. But, the symptoms, risk of complications, and treatment are the same for both types of reactions.\nAnaphylaxis can occur in response to any allergen. Common causes include:\nMedicine allergies\nFood allergies\nInsect bites/stings\nPollen and other inhaled allergens rarely cause anaphylaxis. Some people have an anaphylactic reaction with no known cause.\nAnaphylaxis is life threatening and can occur at any time. Risks include a history of any type of allergic reaction.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms develop quickly, often within seconds or minutes."}

Call 911 or the local emergency number immediately.\nCheck the person's airway, breathing, and circulation, which are known as the ABC's of Basic Life Support. A warning sign of dangerous throat swelling is a very hoarse or whispered voice, or coarse sounds when the person is breathing in air."}

If necessary, begin rescue breathing and\nCPR\n.\nCall 911 or the local emergency number.\nCalm and reassure the person.\nIf the allergic reaction is from a bee sting, scrape the stinger off the skin with something firm (such as a fingernail or plastic credit card). Do not use tweezers. Squeezing the stinger will release more venom.\nIf the person has emergency allergy medicine on hand, help them take or inject it. Do not give medicine by the mouth if the person is having difficulty breathing. An epinephrine injector should be used immediately if it is available.\nTake steps to prevent\nshock\n. Have the person lie flat, raise the person's feet about 12 inches (30 centimeters), and cover  the person  with a coat or blanket."}

This can block the airways.\nDo not give the person anything by mouth if they are  having trouble breathing.\nParamedics or other providers may\nplace a tube through the nose or mouth\ninto the airways.
