Over time, scarring and\ncirrhosis\ncan occur. Cirrhosis is the final phase of alcoholic liver disease.\nAlcoholic liver disease does not occur in all heavy drinkers. The chances of getting liver disease go up the longer you have been drinking and more alcohol you consume. You do not have to get drunk for the disease to happen.\nThe disease is most common in people between 40 and 50 years of age. Men are more likely to have this problem. However, women may develop the disease after less exposure to alcohol than men. Some people may have an inherited risk for the disease.\nSymptoms\nThere may be no symptoms, or symptoms may come on slowly. This depends on how well the liver is working."}
