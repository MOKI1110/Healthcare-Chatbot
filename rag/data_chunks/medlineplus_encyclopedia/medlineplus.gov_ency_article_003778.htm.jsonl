It is also used to check the female pelvic organs during pregnancy.\nWatch this video about:\nUltrasound\nHow the Test is Performed\nTo have the procedure:\nYou will lie on your back on an exam table.\nThe person performing the test will spread a clear, water-based gel on your belly and pelvis area. A handheld probe will then be moved over the area. The gel helps the probe transmit sound waves.\nThese waves bounce off the body structures, including the developing baby, to create a picture on the ultrasound machine.\nIn some cases, a pregnancy ultrasound may be done by\nplacing the probe into the vagina\n. This is more likely in early pregnancy. Many women will have the length of their cervix measured by vaginal ultrasonography around 20 to 24 weeks of pregnancy.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will need to have a full bladder to get the best ultrasound image."}

You may be asked to drink 2 to 3 glasses of liquid an hour before the test. DO NOT urinate before the procedure.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThere may be some discomfort from pressure on the full bladder. The conducting gel may feel slightly cold and wet. You will not feel the ultrasound waves.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nAn ultrasound may be done to determine if there is a problem with the pregnancy, how far along the pregnancy is, or to take measurements and screen for potential problems.\nTalk to your health care provider to determine the most appropriate scanning schedule for you.\nA pregnancy ultrasound may be done during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy to:\nConfirm a normal pregnancy\nDetermine the baby's age\nLook for problems, such as ectopic pregnancies or the chances for a miscarriage\nDetermine the baby's heart rate\nLook for multiple pregnancies (such as twins and triplets)\nIdentify problems of the placenta, uterus, cervix, and ovaries\nLook for findings that might indicate an increased r"}
