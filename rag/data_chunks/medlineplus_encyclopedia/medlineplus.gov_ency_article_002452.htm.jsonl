They recommend that babies feed only on breast milk for the first 6 months, and then continue to have breast milk as a main part of their diet until they are at least 1 to 2 years old.\nIt is true that breastfeeding is not always easy for moms and babies. It can take a little time for you both to get the hang of it. It is important to know this up front, so that you can make sure you have all the support and commitment you need if a problem does come up.\nRecommendations\nBreastfeeding (nursing) your baby can be a good experience for both the mother and the baby. It takes time and practice to get comfortable with breastfeeding."}

It takes time and practice to get comfortable with breastfeeding. Things you can do to help the process include:\nStart breastfeeding your baby in the hospital, right after birth.\nAsk for help from a lactation consultant or nurse to get you started.\nRead about breastfeeding\nbefore your baby is born.\nNIPPLE SORENESS\nMost women are able to breastfeed with no pain. Sometimes, breast tenderness and nipple soreness will occur in the first week. Getting help with a proper latch right away from a breastfeeding support person can help this go away more quickly.\nNipple soreness may be caused by many things, including:\nPoor\nfeeding techniques\nWrong\nposition of the baby when breastfeeding\nNot taking care of your nipples\nFor many women, there is no clear cause of nipple soreness. A simple change in your baby's position while feeding may ease soreness.\nYou might have sore nipples if your baby keeps sucking as they come off the breast."}

A simple change in your baby's position while feeding may ease soreness.\nYou might have sore nipples if your baby keeps sucking as they come off the breast. You can help your baby learn to let go by gently inserting a finger into the side of the mouth to break the suction.\nSkin that is too dry or too moist can also cause nipple soreness.\nBras made from man-made (synthetic) fabrics may cause moisture to collect. These fabrics may increase sweating and slow evaporation.\nUsing soaps or solutions that remove natural skin oils can cause dry skin. Olive oil, expressed milk, and ointments containing lanolin can help\nsoothe dry or cracking nipples\n.\nSome babies chew or bite on the nipples when they start teething.\nGiving your baby something cold and wet to chew on a few minutes before breastfeeding can help avoid this problem. A clean, wet washcloth from the refrigerator works well.\nOffer your baby another cold, wet washcloth before feeding on the other breast.\nBREAST ENGORGEMENT OR BREAST FULLNESS\nBreast fullness is the slow buildup of blood and milk in the breast a few days after birth. It is a sign that your milk is coming in."}

It is a sign that your milk is coming in. It will not prevent you from breastfeeding.\nBreast engorgement is caused by back up in the blood vessels in the breast. The breasts are swollen, hard, and painful. The nipples may not stick out enough to allow the baby to latch on correctly.\nThe let-down reflex is a normal part of breastfeeding. Milk made in the milk glands is released into the milk ducts. Pain, stress, and anxiety can interfere with the reflex. As a result, milk will build up. Treatment includes:\nLearning to relax and finding a comfortable position\nReducing distractions during nursing, performing a gentle massage, and applying heat to the breast\nNursing often (8 times or more in 24 hours) and for at least 15 minutes at each feeding can also prevent engorgement.\nOther ways to relieve breast engorgement:\nFeed more often or express milk manually or with a pump."}

Electric breast pumps work best.\nAlternate between taking warm showers and using cold compresses to help ease the discomfort.\nNOT ENOUGH MILK FOR THE BABY'S NEEDS\nAlmost all women can produce enough milk for their babies. Though many women are very worried about this, it is quite rare that a mother will produce too little milk.\nMaking too little milk can happen for a few reasons, including using infant formula to feed your baby in addition to breastfeeding. If you are worried about how your baby is growing, you should talk with your baby's health care provider right away before starting to supplement with formula.\nThe mother's supply is based on the baby's demand for milk. Frequent feedings, adequate rest, good nutrition, and drinking enough fluids can help maintain a good milk supply.\nPLUGGED MILK DUCT\nA milk duct can become plugged. This may happen if the baby does not feed well, if the mother skips feedings (common when the child is weaning), or if the mother's bra is too tight."}

Symptoms of a plugged milk duct include:\nTenderness\nHeat and redness in one area of the breast\nA lump that can be felt close to the skin\nSometimes, a tiny white dot can be seen at the opening of the duct on the nipple. Massaging the area and putting gentle pressure on it can help to remove the plug.\nBREAST INFECTION\nA breast infection (mastitis) causes aching muscles, fever, and a red, hot, tender area on one breast. Call your provider if you develop these symptoms.\nTreatment often includes:\nTaking antibiotics for the infection\nApplying moist, warm compresses to the infected area\nGetting rest\nWearing a comfortable bra between feedings\nContinuing to nurse from the infected breast will help healing take place. Breast milk is safe for your baby, even when you have a breast infection. This will prevent further breast engorgement.\nIf nursing is too uncomfortable, you may try pumping or manual expression to move milk out of the breast."}

Talk to your provider about ways to manage the problem.\nTHRUSH\nThrush is a common yeast infection that can be passed between the mother and the baby during breastfeeding. The yeast (\nCandida albicans\n) thrives in warm, moist areas.\nThe baby's mouth and the mother's nipples are good places for this yeast to grow. Yeast infections often occur during or after antibiotic treatments.\nSymptoms of yeast infection in the mother are deep-pink nipples that are tender or uncomfortable during, and right after, nursing. White patches and increased redness in your baby's mouth are symptoms of a yeast infection.\nYour baby may also have a diaper rash, a change in mood, and will want to suckle more frequently. Call your provider to get a prescription for an antifungal medicine for affected members of your family.\nILLNESS\nIf you develop a fever or illness, contact your provider."}
