These disorders can lead to heavy and prolonged bleeding after an injury or surgery. Bleeding can also begin on its own and may be difficult to stop.\nSpecific bleeding disorders include:\nAcquired platelet function defects\nCongenital platelet function defects\nDisseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)\nProthrombin deficiency\nFactor V deficiency\nFactor VII deficiency\nFactor X deficiency\nFactor XI deficiency (hemophilia C)\nGlanzmann disease\nHemophilia A\nHemophilia B\nIdiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)\nVon Willebrand disease\n(types I, II, and III)\nCauses\nWatch this video about:\nBlood clotting\nNormal blood clotting involves blood particles, called platelets, and as many as 20 different plasma proteins that layer over the platelets. These proteins are known as blood clotting or coagulation factors."}

These proteins are known as blood clotting or coagulation factors. These factors interact with other chemicals to form a substance called fibrin that stops bleeding.\nProblems can occur when platelets are low in number or do not work properly or when certain coagulation factors are low or missing. Bleeding problems can range from mild to severe.\nSome bleeding disorders are present at birth and are passed down through families (inherited). Others develop from:\nIllnesses, such as vitamin K deficiency or severe liver disease\nTreatments, such as the use of medicines to stop blood clots (anticoagulants) or the long-term use of antibiotics\nBleeding disorders can also result from a problem with the number or function of platelets. These disorders can also be either inherited or develop later (acquired)."}
