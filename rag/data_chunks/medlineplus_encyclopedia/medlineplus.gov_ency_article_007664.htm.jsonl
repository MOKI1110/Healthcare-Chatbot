The laser spots are usually applied in 1 of 3 patterns.\nBefore the procedure, you will be given eye drops to dilate your pupils. Rarely, you will get a shot of a local anesthetic. The shot may be uncomfortable. You will be awake and pain-free during the procedure.\nYou will be seated with your chin in a chin rest. A special lens will be placed on your eye. The lens contains mirrors that help the doctor aim the laser. You will be instructed to look straight ahead or at a target light with your other eye.\nThe doctor will aim the laser at the area of the retina needing treatment."}

You will be instructed to look straight ahead or at a target light with your other eye.\nThe doctor will aim the laser at the area of the retina needing treatment. With each pulse of the laser, you will see a flash of light. Depending on the condition being treated, there may be only a few pulses, or as many as 500.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nDiabetes can harm the eyes by causing\ndiabetic retinopathy\n. It is one of the most common eye diseases that needs laser photocoagulation. It can damage the\nretina\n, the back part of your eye. The most severe form of the condition is proliferative diabetic retinopathy, in which abnormal vessels grow on the retina. Over time, these vessels can bleed or cause scarring of the retina.\nIn laser photocoagulation for diabetic retinopathy, laser energy is aimed at certain areas of the retina to prevent abnormal vessels from growing or shrinking those that may already be there."}

Sometimes it is done to make edema fluid in the center of the retina (macula) go away.\nThis surgery may also be used to treat the following eye problems:\nRetinal tumor\nMacular degeneration\n, an eye disorder that slowly destroys sharp, central vision\nA tear in the retina\nA blockage of the small veins\nthat carry blood away from the retina\nRetinal detachment\n, when the retina in the back of the eye separates from the layers below\nRisks\nSince each pulse of the laser causes a microscopic burn in the retina, you may develop:\nMild loss of vision\nReduced night vision\nBlind spots\nReduced side vision\nDifficulty focusing\nBlurred vision\nReduced color vision\nIf not treated, diabetic retinopathy can cause permanent blindness.\nBefore the Procedure\nSpecial preparations are rarely needed before laser photocoagulation. Usually, both eyes will be dilated for the procedure.\nArrange to have someone to drive you home after the procedure.\nAfter the Procedure\nYou vision will be blurry for the first 24 hours."}

You may see floaters, but these will subside over time. If your treatment was for macular edema, your vision may seem worse for a few days.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nLaser surgery works best in the early stages of vision loss. It cannot bring back lost vision. However, it can greatly reduce the risk for permanent vision loss.\nManaging your\ndiabetes\ncan help prevent diabetic retinopathy. Follow your eye doctor's advice on how to\nprotect your vision\n. Have\neye exams\nas often as recommended, usually once every 1 to 2 years.\nAlternative Names\nLaser coagulation; Laser eye surgery; Photocoagulation; Laser photocoagulation - diabetic eye disease; Laser photocoagulation - diabetic retinopathy; Focal photocoagulation; Scatter (or pan retinal) photocoagulation; Proliferative retinopathy - laser; PRP - laser; Grid pattern photocoagulation - laser\nImages\nRetina\nReferences\nAmerican Academy of Ophthalmology website."}
