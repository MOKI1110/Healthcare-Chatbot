The pain often rises in your chest from your stomach. It may also spread to your neck or throat.\nCauses\nAlmost everyone has heartburn at some time. If you have heartburn very often, you may have\ngastroesophageal reflux disease\n(GERD).\nNormally when food or liquid enters your stomach, a band of muscle at the lower end of your esophagus closes off the esophagus. This band is called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). If this band does not close tightly enough, food or stomach acid can back up (reflux) into the esophagus. The stomach contents can irritate the esophagus and cause heartburn and other symptoms.\nWatch this video about:\nHeartburn\nHeartburn is more likely if you have a\nhiatal hernia\n. A hiatal hernia is a condition which occurs when the top part of the stomach pokes into the chest cavity."}

A hiatal hernia is a condition which occurs when the top part of the stomach pokes into the chest cavity. This weakens the LES so that it is easier for acid to back up from the stomach into the esophagus.\nPregnancy and many medicines can bring on heartburn or make it worse.\nMedicines that can cause heartburn include:\nAnticholinergics (such as medicines used for sea sickness)\nBeta-blockers for high blood pressure or heart disease\nBronchodilators for asthma or other lung diseases\nCalcium channel blockers for high blood pressure\nDopamine-like medicines for Parkinson disease\nProgestin for abnormal menstrual bleeding or birth control\nSedatives for anxiety or sleep problems (insomnia)\nTheophylline (for asthma or other lung diseases)\nTricyclic antidepressants\nTalk to your health care provider if you think one of your medicines may be causing heartburn. Never change or stop taking medicine without talking to your provider first.\nHome Care\nYou should treat frequent heartburn (heartburn that occurs 2 or more days per week) because reflux can damage the lining of your esophagus."}

This can cause serious problems over time. Changing your habits can be helpful in preventing heartburn and other symptoms of GERD.\nThe following tips will help you avoid heartburn and other GERD symptoms. Talk to your provider if you are still bothered by heartburn after trying these steps.\nFirst, avoid foods and drinks that can trigger reflux, such as:\nAlcohol\nCaffeine\nCarbonated drinks\nChocolate\nCitrus fruits and juices\nPeppermint and spearmint\nSpicy or fatty foods, full-fat dairy products\nTomatoes and tomato sauces\nNext, try changing your eating habits:\nAvoid bending over or exercising just after eating.\nAvoid eating within 3 to 4 hours of bedtime. Lying down with a full stomach causes the stomach contents to press harder against the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). This allows reflux to occur.\nEat smaller meals.\nMake other lifestyle changes as needed:\nAvoid tight-fitting belts or clothes that are snug around the waist."}

This allows reflux to occur.\nEat smaller meals.\nMake other lifestyle changes as needed:\nAvoid tight-fitting belts or clothes that are snug around the waist. These items can squeeze the stomach, and may force food to reflux.\nLose weight if you are overweight. Obesity increases pressure in the stomach. This pressure can push the stomach contents into the esophagus. In some cases, GERD symptoms go away after an overweight person loses 10 to 15 pounds (4.5 to 6.75 kilograms).\nSleep with your head raised about 6 inches (15 centimeters). Sleeping with the head higher than the stomach helps prevent digested food from backing up into the esophagus. Place books, bricks, or blocks under the legs of the head of your bed. You can also use a wedge-shaped pillow under your mattress. Sleeping on extra pillows does NOT work well for relieving heartburn because you can slip off the pillows during the night.\nStop smoking or using tobacco. Chemicals in cigarette smoke or tobacco products weaken the LES.\nReduce stress."}

Try yoga, tai chi, or meditation to help relax.\nIf you still do not have full relief, try over-the-counter medicines:\nAntacids, like Maalox, Mylanta, or Tums help neutralize stomach acid.\nH2 blockers, like Pepcid AC, Tagamet HB, and Axid AR reduce stomach acid production.\nProton pump inhibitors, like Prilosec OTC, Prevacid 24 HR, Nexium 24 HR, and Zegerid OTC stop nearly all stomach acid production for many hours after your dose.\nPotassium competitive acid blockers (PCABs).
