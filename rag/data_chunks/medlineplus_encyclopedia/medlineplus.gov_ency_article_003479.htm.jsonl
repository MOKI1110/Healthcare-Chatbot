Bilirubin is a yellowish pigment found in bile, a fluid made by the liver.\nBilirubin can also be measured with a\nurine test\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour health care provider may instruct you to not eat or drink or to stop taking medicines that affect the test.\nMany medicines may change the bilirubin level in your blood. Make sure your provider knows which medicines you are taking.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA small amount of older red blood cells is replaced by new blood cells every day. Bilirubin is left in the blood after these older blood cells are removed."}

Bilirubin is left in the blood after these older blood cells are removed. The liver helps break down bilirubin so that it can be removed from the body in the stool.\nA level of bilirubin in the blood of 2.0 mg/dL can create\njaundice\n. Jaundice is a yellow color in the skin, mucus membranes, or eyes.\nJaundice is the most common reason to check bilirubin level. The test will likely be ordered when:\nThe provider is concerned about a newborn's jaundice (most newborns have some jaundice)\nJaundice develops in older infants, children, and adults\nA bilirubin test is also ordered when the provider suspects a person has liver or gallbladder problems.\nNormal Results\nIt is normal to have some bilirubin in the blood. A normal level is:\nDirect (also called conjugated) bilirubin: less than 0.3 mg/dL (less than 5.1  µmol/L)\nTotal bilirubin: 0.1 to 1.2 mg/dL (1.71 to 20.5  µmol/L)\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIn newborns, bilirubin level is higher for the first few days of life. Your child's provider must consider the following when deciding whether your baby's bilirubin level is too high:\nHow fast the level has been rising\nWhether the baby was born early\nThe baby's age\nJaundice can also occur when more red blood cells than normal are broken down."}
