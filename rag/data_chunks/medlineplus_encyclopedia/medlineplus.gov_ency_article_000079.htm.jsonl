Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAtypical pneumonia\nAtypical pneumonia\nPneumonia is inflamed or swollen lung tissue due to infection with a germ.\nWith atypical pneumonia, the infection is caused by different bacteria than the more common ones that cause pneumonia. Atypical pneumonia also tends to have milder symptoms than typical pneumonia. It more often has symptoms that aren't just related to the lungs, including headache, low-grade fever, rash, joint pain, and stomach symptoms such as diarrhea and vomiting.\nCauses\nBacteria that cause atypical pneumonia include:\nPneumonia\ncaused by the bacteria\nMycoplasma pneumoniae\noften affects people younger than age 40.\nPneumonia due to\nChlamydia pneumoniae\nbacteria occurs year round.\nPneumonia due to\nLegionella pneumophila\nbacteria is seen more often in middle-aged and older adults, smokers, and those with chronic illnesses or a weak immune system. It can be more severe. This type of pneumonia is also called\nLegionnaire disease\n.\nSymptoms\nPneumonia due to mycoplasma or chlamydia bacteria is usually mild."}

Do not give aspirin to children because it may cause a dangerous illness called\nReye syndrome\n.\nDo not take cough medicines without first checking with your provider. Cough medicines may make it harder for your body to cough up the extra sputum.\nDrink plenty of fluids to help loosen secretions and bring up phlegm.\nGet a lot of rest. Have someone else do household chores.\nIf needed, you will be prescribed antibiotics.\nYou may be able to take antibiotics by mouth at home.\nIf your condition is severe, you will likely be admitted to a hospital. There, you will be given antibiotics through a vein (\nintravenously\n), as well as oxygen.\nAntibiotics are usually prescribed for 3 to 5 days, although sometimes they may be used for 2 weeks or more.\nFinish all the antibiotics you've been prescribed, even if you feel better."}

Legionella pneumonia can be severe. It can lead to problems, most often in those with kidney failure, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), or a weakened immune system. It can also lead to death.\nPossible Complications\nComplications that may result include any of the following:\nBrain and nervous system infections, such as\nmeningitis\n, myelitis, and\nencephalitis\nHemolytic anemia\n, a condition in which there are not enough red blood cells in the blood because the body is destroying them\nSevere lung damage\nRespiratory failure requiring breathing machine support (ventilator)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop fever, cough, or shortness of breath.
