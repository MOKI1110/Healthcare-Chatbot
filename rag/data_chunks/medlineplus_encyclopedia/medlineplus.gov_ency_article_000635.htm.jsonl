The infection is uncommon in the United States. Most people in the United States who are diagnosed with chancroid get it outside the country in areas where the infection is more common.\nSymptoms\nWithin 1 day to 2 weeks after becoming infected, a person will get a small bump on the genitals. The bump becomes an\nulcer\nwithin a day after it first appears. The ulcer:\nRanges in size from 1/8 inch to 2 inches (3 millimeters to 5 centimeters) in diameter\nIs painful\nIs soft\nHas sharply defined borders\nHas a base that is covered with a gray or yellowish-gray material\nHas a base that bleeds easily if it is bumped or scraped\nAbout one half of infected men have only a single ulcer. Women often have 4 or more ulcers."}

Women often have 4 or more ulcers. The ulcers appear in specific locations.\nCommon locations in men are:\nForeskin\nGroove behind the head of the penis\nShaft of the penis\nHead of the penis\nOpening of the penis\nScrotum\nIn women, the most common location for ulcers is the outer lips of the vagina (labia majora). \"Kissing ulcers\" may develop. Kissing ulcers are those that occur on opposite surfaces of the labia.\nUlcers also may form on the:\nInner vagina lips (labia minora)\nArea between the genitals and the anus (perineal area)\nInner thighs\nThe most common symptoms in women are pain with urination and intercourse.\nThe ulcer may look like the sore of\nprimary syphilis\n(chancre).\nAbout one half of the people who are infected with a chancroid develop enlarged lymph nodes in the groin.\nIn one half of people who have swelling of the groin lymph nodes, the nodes break through the skin and cause draining\nabscesses\n."}

Large lymph node swellings may need to be drained, either with a needle or local surgery.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nChancroid can get better on its own. Some people have months of painful ulcers and draining. Antibiotic treatment often clears up the lesions quickly with very little scarring.\nPossible Complications\nComplications include urethral\nfistulas\nand scars on the foreskin of the\npenis\nin uncircumcised males."}

People with chancroid should also be checked for other sexually transmitted infections, including but not limited to\nsyphilis\n, HIV, and\ngenital herpes\n.\nIn people with HIV, chancroid may take much longer to heal.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider for an appointment if:\nYou have symptoms of chancroid.\nYou have had sexual contact with a person who you know has an STI.\nYou have engaged in high-risk sexual practices.\nPrevention\nChancroid is spread by sexual contact with an infected person. Avoiding all forms of sexual activity is the only absolute way to prevent an STI.\nHowever,\nsafer sex behaviors\nmay reduce your risk. The proper use of condoms, either the\nmale\nor\nfemale\ntype, greatly decreases the risk of catching an STI."}
