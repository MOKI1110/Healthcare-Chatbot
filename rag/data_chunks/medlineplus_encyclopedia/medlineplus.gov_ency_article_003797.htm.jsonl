It also measures the size and structures of the eye.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is most often done in the ophthalmologist's office or the ophthalmology department of a hospital or clinic.\nYour eye is numbed with anesthetic drops. The ultrasound wand (transducer) is placed against the front surface of the eye.\nThe ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves that travel through the eye. Reflections (echoes) of the sound waves form a picture of the structure of the eye. The test takes about 15 minutes.\nThere are two types of scans: A-scan and B-scan.\nFor the A-scan:\nYou will most often sit in a chair and place your chin on a chin rest. You will look straight ahead.\nA small probe is placed against the front of your eye.\nThe test may also be done with you lying back. With this method, a fluid-filled cup is placed against your eye to do the test."}

With this method, a fluid-filled cup is placed against your eye to do the test. This is called the immersion method and is felt to be more accurate than other methods.\nFor the B-scan:\nYou will be seated and you may be asked to look in many directions. The test is most often done with your eyes closed.\nA gel is placed on the skin of your eyelids. The B-scan probe is gently placed against your eyelids to do the test.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYour eye is numbed, so you should not have any pain in your eye."}

You may be asked to look in different directions to improve the ultrasound image or so it can view different areas of your eye.\nThe gel used with the B-scan may run down your cheek, but you will not feel any discomfort or pain.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou may need this test if you have cataracts or other eye problems.\nAn A-scan ultrasound measures the eye to determine the right power of a lens implant before\ncataract surgery\n.\nA B-scan is done to look at the inside part of the eye or the space around and behind the eye (orbit) that cannot be seen directly. This may occur when you have\ncataracts\nor other conditions that make it hard for the doctor to see into the back of your eye."}

The test may help diagnose\nretinal detachment\n, tumors, or other disorders.\nNormal Results\nFor an A-scan, measurements of the eye are in the normal range.\nFor a B-scan, the structures of the eye and orbit appear normal.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA B-scan may show:\nBleeding into the clear gel (vitreous) that fills the back of the eye (vitreous hemorrhage)\nCancer of the retina (\nretinoblastoma\n), under the retina, or in other parts of the eye (such as\nmelanoma\n)\nDamaged tissue or injuries in the bony socket (orbit) that surrounds and protects the eye\nForeign bodies\nPulling away of the retina from the back of the eye (\nretinal detachment\n)\nSwelling (inflammation)\nRisks\nTo avoid scratching the cornea, do not rub the numbed eye until the anesthetic wears off (about 15 minutes)."}
