Surgery may be needed if the esophagus, stomach, or intestine have developed holes (perforation) from exposure to the acid.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\nSwallowing poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Damage to the esophagus and stomach continues to occur for several weeks after the potassium carbonate was swallowed. Death from complications may occur up to several months later. Holes (perforation) in the esophagus and stomach may cause serious infections in both the chest and abdominal cavities, which may result in death.\nReferences\nHoyte C. Caustics.
