CSF is a clear fluid that flows in the space surrounding the spinal cord and brain.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA sample of CSF is needed [1 to 5 milliliters (ml)]. A\nlumbar puncture\n(spinal tap), is the most common way to collect this sample. Rarely, other methods are used for collecting CSF such as:\nCisternal puncture\nVentricular puncture\nRemoval of CSF from a tube that is already in the CSF, such as a shunt or ventricular drain\nAfter the sample is taken, it is sent to a lab for evaluation.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test may be done to diagnose:\nTumors\nInfections\nInflammation of the\ncentral nervous system\nDelirium\nOther neurological and medical conditions\nNormal Results\nThe glucose level in the CSF should be 50 to 80 mg/100 mL or 2.77 to 4.44 mmol/L (or greater than 2/3 of the blood sugar level).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs."}

Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results. Results can also be affected by your serum glucose level, especially if levels are extreme.\nThe examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results include higher and lower glucose levels. Abnormal results may be due to:\nHigh blood sugar (hyperglycemia)\nInfection (bacterial or fungus)\nInflammation of the central nervous system\nTumor\nAlternative Names\nGlucose test - CSF; Cerebrospinal fluid glucose test\nImages\nLumbar puncture (spinal tap)\nReferences\nDe Luca GC, Griggs RC, Johnston SC.
