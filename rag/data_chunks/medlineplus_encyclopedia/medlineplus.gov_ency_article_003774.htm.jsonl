Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCarotid duplex\nCarotid duplex\nCarotid duplex is an\nultrasound\ntest that shows how well blood is flowing through the carotid arteries. The carotid arteries are located in the neck. They supply blood directly to the brain.\nHow the Test is Performed\nUltrasound is a painless method that uses sound waves to create images of the inside of the body. The test is done in a vascular lab or radiology department.\nThe test is done in the following way:\nYou lie on your back. Your head is supported to keep it from moving. The ultrasound technician applies a water-based gel to your neck to help with the transmission of the sound waves.\nNext, the technician moves a wand called a transducer back and forth over the area.\nThe device sends sound waves to the arteries in your neck. The sound waves bounce off the blood vessels and form images or pictures of the insides of the arteries.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo preparation is necessary.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel some pressure as the transducer is moved around your neck. The pressure should not cause any pain."}

The pressure should not cause any pain. You may also hear a whooshing sound. This is normal.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test checks blood flow in the carotid arteries. It can detect:\nBlood clotting (thrombosis)\nNarrowing in the arteries (stenosis)\nOther causes of blockage in the carotid arteries\nYour health care provider may order this test if:\nYou have had a\nstroke\nor\ntransient ischemic attack (TIA)\nYou need a follow-up test because your carotid artery was found to be narrowed in the past or you have had surgery on the artery\nYour provider hears an abnormal sound called a bruit over the carotid neck arteries. This may mean the artery is narrowed.\nNormal Results\nThe results will tell your provider how open or narrowed your carotid arteries are. For example, the arteries may be 10% narrowed, 50% narrowed, or 75% narrowed.\nA normal result means there is no problem with the blood flow in the carotid arteries."}

The artery is free of any significant blockage, narrowing, or other problem.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result means the artery may be narrowed, or something is changing the blood flow in the carotid arteries. This is a sign of atherosclerosis or other blood vessel conditions.\nIn general, the more narrowed the artery is, the higher your risk for stroke.\nDepending on the results, your provider may want you to:\nConsider treatment with medicines or\nsurgery\nHave additional tests (such as\ncerebral angiography\n,\nCT angiography\n, and\nmagnetic resonance angiography\n)\nFollow a healthy diet and lifestyle to prevent\nhardening of the arteries\nRepeat the test again in the future\nRisks\nThere are no risks with having this procedure.\nAlternative Names\nScan - carotid duplex; Carotid ultrasound; Carotid artery ultrasound; Ultrasound - carotid; Vascular ultrasound - carotid; Ultrasound - vascular - carotid; Stroke - carotid duplex; TIA - carotid duplex; Transient ischemic attack - carotid dup"}
