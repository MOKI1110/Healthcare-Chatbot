These nerves are:\nVestibular nerve (eighth cranial nerve), which runs from the brain to the ears\nOculomotor, trochlear and abducens nerves, which run from the brain to the eyes and control eye movement\nHow the Test is Performed\nPatches called electrodes are placed above, below, and on each side of your eyes. They may be sticky patches or attached to a headband. Another patch is attached to the forehead.\nThe health care provider will spray cold water or air into each ear canal at separate times. The patches record eye movements that occur when the inner ear and nearby nerves are stimulated by the water or air. When cold water enters the ear, you should have rapid, side-to-side eye movements called\nnystagmus\n.\nNext, warm water or air is placed into the ear."}

The eyes should now move rapidly toward the warm water then slowly away.\nYou may also be asked to use your eyes to track objects, such as flashing lights or moving lines.\nThe test takes about 90 minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nMost of the time, you do not need to take special steps before this test.\nYour provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test.\nDo not stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel discomfort due to cold water in the ear."}

During the test, you may have:\nNausea or vomiting\nBrief dizziness (\nvertigo\n)\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is used to determine whether a balance or nerve disorder is the cause of dizziness or vertigo.\nYou may have this test if you have:\nDizziness or vertigo\nHearing loss\nPossible damage to the inner ear from certain medicines\nNormal Results\nCertain eye movements should occur after the warm or cold water or air is placed into your ears.\nNote: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be a sign of damage to the nerve of the inner ear or other parts of the brain that control eye movements.\nAny disease or injury that damages the acoustic nerve can cause vertigo."}

The water part of this test should not be done if your eardrum has been perforated recently.\nConsiderations\nElectronystagmography is very useful because it can record movements behind closed eyelids or with the head in many positions.\nAlternative Names\nENG\nReferences\nDe Luca GC, Griggs RC, Johnston SC."}
