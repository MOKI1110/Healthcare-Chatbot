Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nVaginal itching and discharge - adult and adolescent\nVaginal itching and discharge - adult and adolescent\nVaginal discharge refers to secretions from the\nvagina\n. The discharge may be:\nThick, pasty, or thin\nClear, cloudy, bloody, white, yellow, or green\nOdorless or have a bad odor\nItching of the skin of the vagina and the surrounding area (vulva) may be present along with vaginal discharge. It can also occur on its own.\nCauses\nGlands in the cervix and the walls of the vagina normally produce clear mucus. This is very common among women of childbearing age.\nThese secretions may turn white or yellow when exposed to the air.\nThe amount of mucus produced varies during the menstrual cycle. This happens due to the change in hormone levels in the body.\nThe following factors can increase the amount of normal vaginal discharge:\nOvulation (the release of an egg from your ovary in the middle of menstrual cycle)\nPregnancy\nSexual excitement\nDifferent types of infections may cause itching or an abnormal discharge in the vagina."}

Abnormal discharge means abnormal color (brown, green), and odor. It is associated with itching or irritation.\nThese include:\nInfections spread during sexual contact. These include chlamydia, gonorrhea (GC), and trichomoniasis.\nVaginal yeast infection, caused by a fungus.\nNormal bacteria that live in the vagina overgrow and cause a gray discharge and fishy odor. This is called bacterial vaginosis (BV). BV is not spread through sexual contact.\nOther causes of vaginal discharge and itching may be:\nMenopause and low estrogen levels. This may lead to vaginal dryness and other symptoms (\natrophic vaginitis\n).\nForgotten tampon or foreign body. This may cause a foul odor.\nChemicals found in detergents, fabric softeners, feminine sprays, ointments, creams, douches, and contraceptive foams or jellies or creams."}

Make sure to seek help from health care provider for the best treatment.\nAvoid soap and just rinse with water to clean yourself. Using a spray bottle to wash with water after urination may be helpful.\nSoaking in a warm but not hot bath may help your symptoms. Dry thoroughly afterward. Rather than using a towel to dry, you may find that gentle use of warm or cold air from a hair dryer may result in less irritation than the use of a towel.\nAvoid douching. Many women feel cleaner when they douche, but it may actually worsen symptoms because it removes healthy bacteria that line the vagina."}

Many women feel cleaner when they douche, but it may actually worsen symptoms because it removes healthy bacteria that line the vagina.

You can do this by:\nWearing loose-fitting clothes and not wearing panty hose.\nWearing cotton underwear (rather than synthetic), or underwear that has a cotton lining in the crotch. Cotton increases air flow and decreases moisture buildup.\nNot wearing underwear.\nGirls and women should also:\nKnow how to properly clean their genital area while bathing or showering.\nWipe properly after using the toilet -- always from front to back.\nWash thoroughly before and after using the bathroom.\nAlways practice safe sex."}
