If the blood supply is cut off, the segment of intestine pulled inside can die. Heavy bleeding may also occur. If a hole develops, infection,\nshock\n, and\ndehydration\ncan take place very rapidly.\nThe cause of intussusception is not known. Conditions that may lead to the problem include:\nViral infection\nEnlarged lymph node in the intestine\nPolyp or tumor in the bowel\nIntussusception can affect both children and adults. It is more common in boys."}

It is more common in boys. It usually affects children ages 5 months to 3 years.\nSymptoms\nThe first sign of intussusception is very often sudden, loud crying caused by\nabdominal pain\n. The pain is colicky and not continuous (intermittent), but it comes back often. The pain will get stronger and last longer each time it returns.\nAn infant with severe abdominal pain may draw the knees to the chest while crying.\nOther symptoms include:\nBloody, mucus-like bowel movement, sometimes called a \"currant jelly\" stool\nFever\nShock (\npale\ncolor,\nlethargy\n, sweating)\nStool mixed with blood and mucus\nVomiting\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a thorough exam, which may reveal a\nmass in the abdomen\n. There may also be signs of dehydration or shock.\nTests may include:\nAbdominal ultrasound\nAbdominal x-ray\nAir or contrast\nenema\nTreatment\nThe child will first be stabilized. A tube will be passed into the stomach through the nose (nasogastric tube)."}

A tube will be passed into the stomach through the nose (nasogastric tube). An intravenous (IV) line will be placed in the arm, and fluids will be given to prevent dehydration.\nIn some cases, the\nbowel blockage\ncan be treated with an air or contrast enema. This is done by a radiologist skilled with the procedure. There is a risk of bowel tearing (perforation) with this procedure.\nThe child will need surgery if these treatments do not work. The bowel tissue can very often be saved. Dead tissue will be removed.\nAntibiotics may be needed to treat any infection.\nIntravenous\nfeeding and fluids will be continued until the child has a normal bowel movement.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome is good with early treatment. There is a risk this problem will come back.\nWhen a hole or tear in the bowel occurs, it must be treated right away. If not treated, intussusception is almost always fatal for infants and young children.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIntussusception is a medical emergency."}
