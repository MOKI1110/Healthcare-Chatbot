The most common tests are described below.\nAn antibody test (also called immunoassay) checks for\nantibodies\nto HIV. Your health care provider may order the test for you to have done at a lab. Or, you may have it done at a testing center or used a home kit. These tests can detect antibodies to HIV starting a few weeks after you're infected with the virus. Antibody tests can be done using:\nBlood -- This test is done by drawing blood from a vein, or by a finger prick."}

Antibody tests can be done using:\nBlood -- This test is done by drawing blood from a vein, or by a finger prick. A blood test is the most accurate because blood has a higher level of antibodies than other body fluids.\nOral fluid -- This test checks for antibodies in the cells of the mouth. It is done by swabbing the gums and inside cheeks. This test is less accurate than the blood test.\nUrine -- This test checks for antibodies in the urine. This test is also less accurate than the blood test.\nAn antigen test checks your blood for an HIV antigen, called p24. When you're first infected with HIV, and before your body has a chance to make antibodies to the virus, your blood has a high level of p24. The p24 antigen test is accurate 11 days to 1 month after getting infected. This test is usually not used by itself to screen for HIV infection.\nAn antibody-antigen blood test checks for levels of both HIV antibodies and the p24 antigen. This test can detect the virus as early as 11 days after getting infected.\nFOLLOW-UP TESTS\nA follow-up test is usually done when the screening test is positive."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nThere is no discomfort with an oral swab test or the urine test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nTesting for HIV infection is done for many reasons, including for:\nSexually active individuals\nPeople who want to be tested\nPeople in high-risk groups (men who have sex with men, injection drug users and their sexual partners, and commercial sex workers)\nPeople with certain conditions and infections (such as\nKaposi sarcoma\nor\nPneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia\n)\nPregnant women, to help prevent them from passing the virus to the baby\nPeople ages 15 to 65 who are having a general check up\nNormal Results\nA negative test result is normal. People with early HIV infection may rarely have a negative test result.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA positive result on a screening test does not confirm that the person has HIV infection. More tests are needed to confirm HIV infection.\nA negative test result does not rule out HIV infection."}

More tests are needed to confirm HIV infection.\nA negative test result does not rule out HIV infection. There is a period of time, called the window period, between HIV infection and the appearance of anti-HIV antibodies. During this period, antibodies and antigens may not be measurable.\nIf a person might have acute or primary HIV infection and is in the window period, a negative screening test doesn't rule out HIV infection. Follow-up tests for HIV are needed.\nRisks\nWith the blood test, veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others."}
