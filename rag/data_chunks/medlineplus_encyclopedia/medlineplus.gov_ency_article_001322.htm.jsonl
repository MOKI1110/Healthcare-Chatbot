You get it by breathing in the fungus from soil. The infection starts in the lungs. It commonly affects people over 60 years of age.\nValley fever may also be called coccidioidomycosis.\nTraveling to an area where the fungus is commonly seen raises your risk for this infection."}

However, you're more likely to develop a serious infection if you live where the fungus is found and have a weakened immune system due to:\nAnti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy\nCancer\nChemotherapy\nGlucocorticoid medicines (prednisone)\nHeart or lung conditions\nHIV/AIDS\nOrgan transplant\nPregnancy (especially the first trimester)\nPeople of Native American, African, or Philippine descent are disproportionately affected.\nSymptoms\nMost people with  an infection by this fungus never have symptoms.

Others may have cold- or flu-like symptoms or symptoms of\npneumonia\n. If symptoms occur, they typically start 5 to 21 days after exposure to the fungus.\nCommon symptoms include:\nAnkle, feet, and leg swelling\nChest pain\n(can vary from mild to severe)\nCough, possibly producing blood-tinged phlegm (sputum)\nFever and night sweats\nHeadache\nJoint stiffness and pain or muscle aches\nLoss of appetite\nPainful, red lumps on lower legs (\nerythema nodosum\n)\nRarely, the infection spreads from the lungs through the bloodstream to involve the skin, bones, joints, lymph nodes, and central nervous system or other organs. This spread is called disseminated coccidioidomycosis.\nPeople with this more widespread form may become very sick. Symptoms may also include:\nChange in mental status\nEnlarged or draining lymph nodes\nJoint swelling\nMore severe lung symptoms\nNeck stiffness\nSensitivity to light\nWeight loss\nSkin lesions of valley fever are often a sign of widespread (disseminated) disease."}

Tests done for milder forms of this infection include:\nBlood test to check for antibodies to Coccidioides\n(the fungus that causes Valley fever)\nChest x-ray\nSputum culture\nSputum smear (KOH test)\nTests done for more severe or widespread forms of the infection include:\nBiopsy of the lymph node\n,\nlung\n, or\nliver\nBone marrow biopsy\nBronchoscopy with lavage\nSpinal tap\n(lumbar puncture) to check for meningitis\nTreatment\nIf you have a healthy immune system, the disease almost always goes away without treatment. Your provider may suggest bed rest and treatment for flu-like symptoms until your fever disappears.\nIf you have a weak immune system, you may need antifungal treatment with amphotericin B, fluconazole, or itraconazole."}
