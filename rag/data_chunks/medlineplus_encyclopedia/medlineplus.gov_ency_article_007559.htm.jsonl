Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHammer toe repair\nHammer toe repair\nA hammer toe is a toe that stays in a curled or flexed position.\nThis can occur in more than one toe.\nThis condition is caused by:\nMuscle imbalance\nRheumatoid arthritis\nShoes that do not fit well\nDescription\nSeveral kinds of surgery can repair hammer toe. Your bone or foot doctor will recommend the kind that will work best for you. Some of the surgeries include:\nRemoving parts of bones in the toe\nCutting or transplanting the tendons of the toes (tendons connect bone to muscle)\nFusing the joint together to make the toe straight but no longer able to bend\nAfter surgery, surgical pins or a wire (Kirschner, or K-wire) are used to hold the toe bones in place while your toe heals. You will be asked to use a different shoe to walk to allow your toes to heal. The pins will be removed in a few weeks.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nWhen hammer toe starts to develop, you may still be able to straighten your toe. Over time, your toe may get stuck in a bent position and you can no longer straighten it."}

These include aspirin, ibuprofen, (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), and other medicines.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\nIf you smoke, try to stop. Ask your provider for help. Smoking can slow healing.\nAlways let your surgeon know about any cold, flu, fever, or other illness you may have before your surgery.\nYou may be asked not to drink or eat anything for 6 to 12 hours before surgery.\nIf you have diabetes, heart disease, or other medical conditions, your surgeon may ask you to see the provider who treats you for these conditions before the surgery.\nAfter the Procedure\nMost people go home the same day they have hammer toe surgery."}
