It is a mild form of\nbipolar disorder\n(manic depressive illness), in which a person has mood swings over a period of years that go from mild\ndepression\nto emotional highs.\nCauses\nThe causes of cyclothymic disorder are unknown. Major depression, bipolar disorder, and cyclothymia often occur together in families. This suggests that these mood disorders share similar causes.\nCyclothymia usually begins early in life. Men and women are equally affected.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nPeriods (episodes) of extreme happiness and high activity or energy (hypomanic symptoms), or low mood, activity, or energy (depressive symptoms) for at least 2 years (1 or more years in children and adolescents).\nThese mood swings are less severe than with bipolar disorder or major depression.\nOngoing symptoms, with no more than 2 symptom-free months in a row.\nExams and Tests\nThe diagnosis is usually based on your mood history."}

Your health care provider may order blood and urine tests to check for medical causes of mood swings.\nTreatment\nTreatments for this disorder include mood-stabilizing medicine, antidepressants, talk therapy, or some combination of these three treatments.\nSome of the more commonly used mood stabilizers are lithium and antiseizure medicines.\nCompared with bipolar disorder, some people with cyclothymia may not respond as well to medicines.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of living with cyclothymic disorder by joining a\nsupport group\nwhose members share common experiences and problems.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nLess than one half of people with cyclothymic disorder go on to develop bipolar disorder."}
