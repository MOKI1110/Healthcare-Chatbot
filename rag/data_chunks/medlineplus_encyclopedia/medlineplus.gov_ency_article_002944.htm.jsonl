This surgery is called splenectomy.\nThe spleen is in the upper part of the belly, on the left side underneath the ribcage. The spleen helps the body fight germs and infections. It also helps filter the blood.\nDescription\nThe spleen is removed while you are under\ngeneral anesthesia\n(asleep and pain-free). Your surgeon may do either an open splenectomy, a laparoscopic splenectomy, or a robotic splenectomy.\nDuring open spleen removal:\nYour surgeon makes a cut (incision) in the middle of the belly or on the left side of the belly just below the ribs.\nThe spleen is located and removed.\nIf you are also being treated for\ncancer\n, lymph nodes in the belly are examined. They may also be removed.\nThe incision is closed using stitches or staples.\nDuring laparoscopic or robotic spleen removal:\nYour surgeon makes 3 or 4 small cuts in the belly.\nYour surgeon inserts an instrument called a laparoscope through one of the cuts."}

The scope has a tiny camera and light on the end, which allows the surgeon to see inside the belly. Other instruments are inserted through the other cuts.\nA harmless gas is pumped into the belly to expand it. This makes it easier for your surgeon to work.\nYour surgeon uses the scope and other instruments to remove the spleen.\nThe scope and other instruments are removed. The incisions are closed using stitches or staples.\nWith laparoscopic or robotic surgery, recovery is often faster and less painful than with open surgery. Talk to your surgeon about which type of surgery is right for you or your child.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nConditions that may require spleen removal include:\nAbscess\nor cyst in the spleen.\nBlood clot\n(thrombosis) in the blood vessels of the spleen.\nCirrhosis of the liver\n.\nDiseases or disorders of blood cells, such as\nidiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura\n(ITP),\nhereditary spherocytosis\n, thalassemia,\nhemolytic anemia\n, and\nhereditary elliptocytosis\n."}
