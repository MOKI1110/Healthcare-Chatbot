Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCMV pneumonia\nCMV pneumonia\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonia is a viral infection of the lungs that can occur in people who have a suppressed immune system.\nCauses\nCMV is a member of a group of herpes-type viruses. Infection with CMV is very common. Most people are exposed to CMV in their lifetime, but typically only those with weakened immune systems become ill from CMV infection.\nSerious CMV infections can occur in people with weakened immune systems as a result of:\nHIV/AIDS\nBone marrow transplantation\nChemotherapy\nor other treatments that suppress the immune system\nOrgan transplant (especially\nlung transplant\n)\nIn people who have had organ and bone marrow transplants, the risk for infection is greatest 5 to 13 weeks after the transplant.\nSymptoms\nIn otherwise healthy people, CMV usually produces no symptoms, or it produces a temporary mononucleosis-type illness. However, those with a weakened immune system can develop serious symptoms."}

Symptoms may include:\nCough\nFatigue\nFever\nGeneral discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (\nmalaise\n)\nLoss of appetite\nMuscle aches\nor\njoint pains\nShortness of breath\nSweating, excessive (night sweats)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. In addition, the following tests may be done:\nVenous and/or\narterial blood gas\nOximetry\nBlood culture\nBlood tests to detect and measure substances specific to CMV infection\nBronchoscopy\n(may include\nbiopsy\n)\nChest x-ray\nCT scan of chest\nUrine culture (clean catch)\nSputum Gram stain\nand\nculture\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to use antiviral medicines to stop the virus from copying itself in the body. Some people with CMV pneumonia need IV (\nintravenous\n) medicines. Some people may need oxygen therapy and breathing support with a ventilator to maintain oxygen until the infection is brought under control.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAntiviral medicines stop the virus from copying itself, but do not destroy it."}
