Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHereditary spherocytic anemia\nHereditary spherocytic anemia\nHereditary spherocytic anemia is a rare disorder of the surface layer (membrane) of red blood cells. It leads to red blood cells that are shaped like spheres, and premature breakdown of red blood cells (\nhemolytic anemia\n).\nCauses\nThis disorder is caused by a genetic variation. The variant gene results in an abnormal red blood cell membrane. The affected cells have a smaller surface area for their volume than normal red blood cells, and can break open easily.\nThe anemia can vary from mild to severe. In severe cases the disorder may be found in early childhood."}

In severe cases the disorder may be found in early childhood. In mild cases it may go unnoticed until adulthood.\nThis disorder is most common in people of northern European descent, but it has been found in all races.\nSymptoms\nInfants may have yellowing of the skin and eyes (\njaundice\n) and pale coloring (\npallor\n).\nOther symptoms may include:\nFatigue\nIrritability\nShortness of breath\nWeakness\nExams and Tests\nIn most cases, the spleen is enlarged and can be detected by your health care provider.\nLaboratory tests can help diagnose this condition."}

In mild cases discovered in adults, it may not be necessary to remove the spleen.\nChildren and adults should be given a\npneumococcal vaccine\nbefore spleen removal surgery. They also should receive folic acid supplements."}

After the spleen is removed, the life span of the red blood cell returns to normal.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nGallstones\nMuch lower red blood cell production (aplastic crisis) caused by a viral infection, which can make anemia worse\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nYour symptoms get worse.\nYour symptoms do not improve with new treatment.\nYou develop new symptoms.\nPrevention\nThis is an inherited disorder and may not be preventable."}
