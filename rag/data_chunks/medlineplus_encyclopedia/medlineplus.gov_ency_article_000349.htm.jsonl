Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEmpty sella syndrome\nEmpty sella syndrome\nEmpty sella syndrome is a condition in which the pituitary gland shrinks or becomes flattened.\nCauses\nThe pituitary is a small gland located just underneath the brain. It is attached to the bottom of the brain by the pituitary stalk. The pituitary sits protected inside a saddle-like bony compartment in the base of the skull. This compartment is called the sella turcica, but often just called the sella.\nWhen the pituitary gland shrinks or becomes flattened, it cannot be seen on an\nMRI\nscan. This makes the area of the pituitary gland look like an \"empty sella.\" But the sella is not actually empty. It is often filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. With empty sella syndrome, CSF has leaked into the sella turcica, putting pressure on the pituitary."}

This causes the gland to shrink or flatten.\nPrimary empty sella syndrome occurs when one of the layers (arachnoid) covering the outside of the brain bulges down into the sella and presses on the pituitary.\nSecondary empty sella syndrome occurs when the sella is empty because the pituitary gland has been damaged by:\nA tumor\nRadiation therapy\nSurgery\nTrauma\nEmpty sella syndrome may be seen in a condition called\npseudotumor cerebri\n, which mainly affects young, obese women and causes the CSF to be under higher pressure.\nThe pituitary gland makes several hormones that control other glands and hormones in the body, including:\nAdrenal glands\nLiver hormone related to growth (insulin-like growth factor-1)\nOvaries\nTesticles\nThyroid\nA problem with the pituitary gland can lead to problems with any of the above glands and abnormal hormone levels of these glands.\nSymptoms\nOften, there are no symptoms or loss of pituitary function.\nIf there are symptoms, they may include any of the following:\nErecti"}

Pituitary function is usually normal.\nYour health care provider may order  tests to check if the pituitary gland is working normally.\nSometimes, tests for high pressure in the brain will be done, such as:\nExamination of the retina\nby an ophthalmologist\nLumbar puncture (\nspinal tap\n)\nTreatment\nFor primary empty sella syndrome:\nNo treatment is needed if pituitary function is normal.\nMedicines may be prescribed to treat any abnormal hormone levels.\nFor secondary empty sella syndrome, treatment involves replacing the hormones that are missing.\nIn some cases, surgery is needed to repair the sella to prevent CSF from leaking into the nose and sinuses.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPrimary empty sella syndrome does not cause health problems, and it doe"}

This is a hormone made by the pituitary gland. Prolactin stimulates breast development and milk production in women.\nComplications of secondary empty sella syndrome are related to the cause of pituitary gland disease or to the effects of\ntoo little pituitary hormone\n(hypopituitarism).\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of abnormal pituitary function, such as menstrual cycle problems or impotence.\nAlternative Names\nPituitary - empty sella syndrome; Partial empty sella\nImages\nPituitary gland\nReferences\nBashari WA, Gillett D, MacFarlane J, Scoffings D, Gurnell M.
