You may need a visit with a gastroenterologist, a specially trained doctor of the digestive system, to discuss further testing. Or, your primary provider may wish to recheck your stool for blood with a special test called a fecal immunochemical test (FIT.)\nRisks\nThe test can have false-positive (the test indicates a problem when there actually is none) or false-negative (the test indicates there is not a problem, but there is) results. This is similar to other stool smear tests which can also give false results.\nAlternative Names\nStool occult blood test - flushable home test; Fecal occult blood test - flushable home test\nReferences\nde Kanter C, Dhaliwal S, Hawks M.
