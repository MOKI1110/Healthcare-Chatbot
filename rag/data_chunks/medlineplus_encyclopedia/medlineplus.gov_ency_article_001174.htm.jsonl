Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nGigantism\nGigantism\nGigantism is abnormal growth due to an excess of\ngrowth hormone\n(GH) during childhood.\nCauses\nGigantism is very rare. The most common cause of too much GH release is a noncancerous (benign)\ntumor\nof the pituitary gland. Other causes include:\nGenetic disease that affects the skin color (pigmentation) and causes benign tumors of the skin, heart, and endocrine (hormone) system (Carney complex)\nGenetic disease that affects the bones and skin pigmentation (\nMcCune-Albright syndrome\n)\nGenetic disease in which one or more of the endocrine glands are overactive or form a tumor (\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1\n) or type 4\nGenetic disease that forms pituitary tumors\nDisease in which tumors form on the nerves of the brain and spine (neurofibromatosis)\nIf excess GH occurs after normal bone growth has stopped (end of puberty), the condition is known as\nacromegaly\n.\nSymptoms\nThe child will grow in height, as well as in the muscles and organs."}

Long-term effects on bones, joints, and the heart are common.\nPossible Complications\nSurgery and radiation treatment may lead to low levels of other pituitary hormones. This can cause any of the following conditions:\nAdrenal insufficiency (adrenal glands do not produce enough of their hormones)\nDiabetes insipidus\n(extreme thirst and excessive urination; in rare cases)\nHypogonadism\n(body's sex glands produce little or no hormones)\nHypothyroidism\n(thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your child has signs of excessive growth.\nPrevention\nGigantism cannot be prevented."}
