Depending on the cause of apraxia, a number of other brain or nervous system problems may be present.\nSymptoms\nA person with apraxia is unable to put together the correct order of muscle movements. At times, a completely different word or action is used or occurs than the one the person intended to speak or make.

Testing for other learning disabilities may also be needed.\nTreatment\nPeople with apraxia can benefit from treatment by a health care team. The team should also include family members.\nOccupational and speech therapists play an important role in helping both people with apraxia and their caregivers learn ways to deal with the disorder."}

Those with gait apraxia may benefit from physical therapy to reduce the risk of falls.\nDuring treatment, therapists will focus on:\nRepeating sounds over and over to teach mouth movements\nSlowing down the person's speech\nTeaching different techniques to help with communication\nRecognition and treatment of depression is important for people with apraxia.\nTo help with communication, family and friends should:\nAvoid giving complex directions.\nUse simple phrases to avoid misunderstandings.\nSpeak in a normal tone of voice. Speech apraxia is not a hearing problem.\nNot assume that the person understands.\nProvide communication aids, if possible, depending on the person and condition.\nOther tips for daily living include:\nMaintain a relaxed, calm environment.\nTake time to show someone with apraxia how to do a task, and allow enough time for them to do so."}
