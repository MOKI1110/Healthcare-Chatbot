Genes may play a role. Children with family members who have an anxiety disorder also may be more likely to have one.\nStress\nmay be a factor in developing GAD.\nThings in a child's life that can cause stress and anxiety include:\nLoss, such as death of a loved one or parents' divorce\nBig life changes, such as moving to a new town\nA history of abuse\nLiving with family with members who are fearful, anxious, or violent\nGAD is a common condition, affecting about 2% to 6% of children. GAD usually does not occur until puberty. It is more often seen in girls than in boys.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom is frequent worry or tension for at least 6 months, even with little or no clear cause. Worries seem to float from one problem to another."}

Worries seem to float from one problem to another. Children with anxiety commonly focus their worries on:\nDoing well at school and sports.\nThey may have the feeling that they need to perform perfectly or otherwise feel they are not doing well.\nThe safety of themselves or their family.\nThey may feel intense fear of natural calamities such as earthquakes, tornados, or home break-ins.\nIllness in themselves or their family.\nThey may worry excessively over minor illnesses they have or be fearful of developing new illnesses.\nEven when the child is aware that worries or fears are excessive, a child with GAD still has difficulty controlling them."}

A physical exam or lab tests may be done to check for other conditions that can cause similar symptoms.\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to help your child feel better and function well in daily life. In less severe cases, talk therapy or medicine alone can be helpful. In more severe cases, a combination of these may work best.\nTALK THERAPY\nMany types of talk therapy may be helpful for GAD. One common and effective type of talk therapy is cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). CBT can help your child understand the relationship between their thoughts, behaviors, and symptoms. CBT often involves a set number of visits."}

During CBT, your child can learn how to:\nUnderstand and gain control of distorted views of stressors, such as life events or other people's behavior\nRecognize and replace panic-causing thoughts to help them feel more in control\nManage stress and relax when symptoms occur\nAvoid thinking that minor problems will develop into terrible ones\nOften therapy can be done as a telemedicine visit, which increases access and convenience.\nMEDICINES\nSometimes, medicines are used to help control anxiety in children. Commonly prescribed medicines for GAD include antidepressants and sedatives. These may be used short-term or long-term. Talk with your provider to learn about your child's medicine, including possible side effects and interactions. Be sure your child takes any medicine as prescribed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well a child does depends on how severe the condition is. In some cases, GAD is long-term and is difficult to treat."}
