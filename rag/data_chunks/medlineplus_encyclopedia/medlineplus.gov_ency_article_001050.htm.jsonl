It more commonly occurs as a result of\nchronic ear infection\n.\nThe eustachian tube helps equalize pressure in the middle ear. When it is not working well, negative pressure can build up and pull part of the eardrum (tympanic membrane) inward. This creates a pocket or cyst that fills with old skin cells and other waste material.\nThe cyst may become infected or get bigger. This can cause the breakdown of some of the middle ear bones or other structures of the ear. This can affect hearing, balance, and possibly the function of the facial muscles.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nDizziness\nDrainage from the ear\n, which can be chronic\nHearing loss\nin one ear\nSensation of ear fullness or pressure\nExams and Tests\nAn ear exam may show a pocket or opening (perforation) in the eardrum, often with drainage."}

A deposit of old skin cells may be seen with a microscope or an otoscope, which is  a special instrument to view the ear. Sometimes a group of blood vessels may be seen in the ear.\nThe following tests may be performed to rule out other causes of dizziness:\nCT scan\nElectronystagmography\nMRI scan\nTreatment\nCholesteatomas very often continue to grow if they are not removed. Surgery is most often successful. However, you may need the ear cleaned by a health care provider from time to time."}
