Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAlbumin blood (serum) test\nAlbumin blood (serum) test\nAlbumin is a protein made by the liver. A serum albumin test measures the amount of this protein in the clear liquid portion of the blood.\nAlbumin can also be measured in the\nurine\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour health care provider may tell you to temporarily stop taking certain medicines that can affect the test. Medicines that can increase albumin levels include:\nAnabolic steroids\nAndrogens\nGrowth hormone\nInsulin\nDo not stop taking any of your medicines without talking to your provider first.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nAlbumin helps move many small molecules through the blood, including bilirubin, calcium, progesterone, and some medicines."}

Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma (blood collecting under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nConsiderations\nIf you are receiving large amounts of\nintravenous\nfluids, the results of this test may be inaccurate.\nAlbumin will be decreased during pregnancy.\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nKorneblat KM.
