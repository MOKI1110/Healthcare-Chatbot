Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCervical MRI scan\nCervical MRI scan\nA cervical MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan uses energy from strong magnets to create pictures of the part of the spine that runs through the neck area (cervical spine).\nMRI does not use radiation (x-rays).\nSingle\nMRI\nimages are called slices. The images can be stored on a computer or printed on film. One exam produces many images.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will wear a hospital gown or clothes without metal zippers or snaps (such as sweatpants and a t-shirt). Make sure you take off your watch, jewelry and wallet. MRIs can pull on any metallic objects. Some types of metal can cause blurry images.\nYou will lie on a narrow table that slides into a tunnel-shaped scanner.\nSome exams use a special dye (contrast). Most of the time, you will get the dye through a vein in your arm or hand before the test. The dye can also be given through an injection. The dye helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly.\nDuring the MRI, the person who operates the machine will watch you from another room."}

The test most often lasts 30 to 60 minutes, but may take longer.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan.\nTell your health care provider if you are afraid of closed spaces (have claustrophobia). You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious. Your provider may suggest an \"open\" MRI, in which the machine is not as close to the body.\nBefore the test, tell your provider if you have:\nBrain aneurysm clips\nCertain types of artificial heart valves\nHeart defibrillator or pacemaker\nInner ear (cochlear) implants\nKidney disease or dialysis (you may not be able to receive contrast)\nRecently placed artificial joints or surgery with implanted metal screws and plates\nCertain types of vascular\nstents\nWorked with sheet metal in the past (you may need tests to check for metal pieces in your eyes)\nBecause the MRI contains strong magnets, metal objects are not allowed into the room with the MRI scanner:\nPens, pocketkn"}

You will need to lie still. Too much movement can blur MRI images and cause errors.\nThe table may be hard or cold, but you can ask for a blanket or pillow. The machine makes loud thumping and humming noises when turned on. You can wear ear plugs to help block out the noise.\nAn intercom in the room allows you to speak to someone at any time. Some MRIs have televisions and special headphones to help the time pass.\nThere is no recovery time, unless you were given a medicine to relax."}

After an MRI scan, you can return to your normal diet, activity, and medicines.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe most common reasons for this test are:\nSevere neck, shoulder, or arm pain that does not get better after treatment\nNeck pain along with leg weakness, numbness, or other symptoms\nA cervical MRI scan may also be done for:\nBirth defects of the spine\nInfection that involves your spine\nInjury or trauma to the spine\nMultiple sclerosis\nSevere scoliosis\nTumor or cancer in the spine\nArthritis in the spine\nMRI works better than CT scan in diagnosing these problems most of the time.\nA cervical MRI may also be done before spinal surgery.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means the part of the spine that runs through your neck and nearby nerves appears normal.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThe most common reasons for an abnormal result are:\nHerniated or \"slipped\" disk\n(cervical radiculopathy)\nNarrowing of the cervical spine (\nspinal stenosis\n)\nAbnormal wear of the bones and cartilage in the neck"}

There have been no reported side effects from the magnetic fields and radio waves.\nIt is also safe to have MRI performed during pregnancy. No side effects or complications have been proven.\nThe most common type of contrast (dye) used is gadolinium. It is very safe. Allergic reactions to the substance are rare. However, gadolinium can be harmful to people with kidney problems that need dialysis. If you have kidney problems, please tell your provider before the test.\nThe strong magnetic fields created during an MRI can cause heart pacemakers and other implants to not work as well."}
