Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAdrenoleukodystrophy\nAdrenoleukodystrophy\nAdrenoleukodystrophy (ALD) describes several closely related disorders that disrupt the breakdown of certain fats. These disorders are often passed down (inherited) in families.\nCauses\nALD is usually passed down from parent to child as an\nX-linked genetic trait\n. It affects mostly males. Some women who are carriers can have milder forms of the disease. It affects about 1 in 20,000 people from all races.\nSome cases of ALD occur when the gene changes on its own. This is called sporadic and is not inherited.\nThe condition results in the buildup of very-long-chain fatty acids in the nervous system, adrenal gland, and testes."}

This is called sporadic and is not inherited.\nThe condition results in the buildup of very-long-chain fatty acids in the nervous system, adrenal gland, and testes. This disrupts normal activity in these parts of the body.\nThere are three major categories of disease:\nChildhood cerebral form -- appears in mid-childhood (at ages 4 to 8)\nAdrenomyelopathy -- occurs in men in their 20s or later in life\nImpaired adrenal gland function (called\nAddison disease\nor Addison-like phenotype) -- adrenal gland does not produce enough steroid hormones\nSymptoms\nChildhood cerebral type symptoms include:\nChanges in muscle tone, especially muscle spasms and uncontrolled movements\nCrossed eyes\nHandwriting that gets worse\nDifficulty at school\nDifficulty understanding what people are saying\nHearing loss\nHyperactivity\nWorsening nervous system damage, including coma, decreased fine motor control, and paralysis\nSeizures\nSwallowing difficulties\nVisual impairment or blindness\nAdrenomyelopathy symptoms include:\nDifficulty controlling urination\nPossible worsening muscle weakness or leg stiffness\nProblems with thinking speed and visual memory\nAdrenal gland failure (Addison type"}

This is done with a heel stick to draw blood (as part of the routine screenings done on newborns). Newborn screening does not diagnose the condition, but it can help lead to early testing and diagnosis.\nTests for this condition include:\nBlood levels of very long chain fatty acids and hormones that are produced by the adrenal gland\nChromosome\nstudy to look for changes in the ABCD1 gene that may make the person more likely to develop a disease\nMRI of the head\nSkin biopsy\nTreatment\nAdrenal dysfunction may be treated with steroids (such as cortisol) if the adrenal gland is not producing enough hormones.\nA specific treatment for X-linked ALD is not available."}
