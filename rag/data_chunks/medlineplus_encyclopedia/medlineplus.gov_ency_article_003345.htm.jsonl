Blood typing is done so you can safely donate your blood or receive a blood transfusion. It is also done to see if you have a substance called Rh factor on the surface of your red blood cells.\nYour blood type is based on whether or not certain proteins are on your red blood cells. These proteins are called antigens. Your blood type (or blood group) depends on what types your parents passed down to you.\nBlood is often grouped according to the ABO blood typing system. The 4 major blood types are:\nType A\nType B\nType AB\nType O\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed. The test to determine your blood group is called ABO typing. Your blood sample is mixed with antibodies against type A and B blood. Then, the sample is checked to see whether or not the blood cells stick together. If blood cells stick together, it means the blood reacted with one of the antibodies.\nThe second step is called back typing."}

If blood cells stick together, it means the blood reacted with one of the antibodies.\nThe second step is called back typing. The liquid part of your blood without cells (serum) is mixed with blood that is known to be type A and type B. People with type A blood have anti-B antibodies. People with type B blood have anti-A antibodies. Type O blood contains both types of antibodies.\nThe 2 steps above can accurately determine your blood type.\nRh typing uses a method similar to ABO typing. When blood typing is done to see if you have Rh factor on the surface of your red blood cells, the results will be one of these:\nRh+ (positive), if you have this cell surface protein\nRh- (negative), if you do not have this cell surface protein\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nBlood typing is done so you can safely receive a blood transfusion or a transplant. Your blood type must closely match the blood type of the blood you are receiving. If the blood types do not match:\nYour immune system will see the donated red blood cells as foreign.\nAntibodies will develop against the donated red blood cells and attack these blood cells.\nThe two ways that your blood and the donated blood may not match are:\nA mismatch between blood types A, B, AB, and O. This is the most common form of a mismatch. In most cases, the immune response is very severe.\nRh factor may not match.\nBlood typing is very important during pregnancy. Careful testing can prevent a\nsevere anemia in the newborn\nand\njaundice\n.\nNormal Results\nYou will be told which ABO blood type you have."}

That is why people with type O blood are called universal blood donors.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other."}

Many minor ones are not routinely detected during blood typing. If they are not detected, you may still have a reaction when receiving certain types of blood, even if the A, B, and Rh antigens are matched.\nA process called cross-matching followed by a\nCoombs test\ncan help detect these minor antigens."}
