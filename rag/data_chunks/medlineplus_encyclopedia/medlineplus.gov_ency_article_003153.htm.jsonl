Symptoms usually:\nAre most severe just before each menstrual period\nImprove during or right after the menstrual period\nBreast tissue may have a dense, bumpy, \"cobblestone\" feel to the fingers. This feel is usually more in the outer areas, particularly near the armpit. There may also be an off and on or ongoing sense of breast fullness with dull, heavy pain, and tenderness.\nCauses\nHormone changes during the menstrual cycle may lead to breast swelling. More estrogen is made early in the cycle and it peaks just before mid-cycle. This causes the breast ducts to grow in size. The progesterone level peaks near the 21st day (in a 28-day cycle)."}

More severe symptoms may occur in many women during their childbearing years. Symptoms may be less in women taking birth control pills.\nRisk factors may include:\nFamily history\nHigh-fat diet\nToo much caffeine\nHome Care\nSelf-care tips:\nEat a lower fat diet.\nAvoid caffeine (coffee, tea, and chocolate).\nAvoid salt 1 to 2 weeks before your period starts.\nGet moderate to vigorous exercise every day.\nWear a well-fitting bra day and night to provide good breast support.\nYou should practice breast awareness. Do check your breasts for changes at regular intervals.\nThe effectiveness of vitamin E, vitamin B6, and herbal preparations such as evening primrose oil are somewhat controversial."}
