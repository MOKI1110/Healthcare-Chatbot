Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHome vision tests\nHome vision tests\nHome vision tests measure the ability to see fine detail.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThere are 3 vision tests that can be done at home: Amsler grid, distance vision, and near vision testing.\nAMSLER GRID TEST\nThis test helps detect\nmacular degeneration\n. This is a disease that causes blurred vision, distorted vision, or blank spots in the vision. If you normally wear glasses for reading, wear them for this test. If you wear bifocals, look through the bottom reading portion.\nDo the test with each eye separately, first the right and then the left. Hold the test grid right in front of you, 14 inches (35 centimeters) away from your eye. Look at the dot in the center of the grid, not at the grid pattern.\nWhile looking at the dot, you will see the rest of the grid in your peripheral vision. All the lines, both vertical and horizontal, should appear straight and unbroken. They should meet at all the crossing points with no missing areas."}

All the lines, both vertical and horizontal, should appear straight and unbroken. They should meet at all the crossing points with no missing areas. If any lines appear distorted or broken, note their location on the grid using a pen or pencil.\nDISTANCE VISION\nThis is the standard eye chart that health care providers use, it has been adapted for home use.\nThe chart is attached to a wall at eye level. Stand 10 feet (3 meters) away from the chart. If you wear glasses or contact lenses for distance vision, wear them for the test.\nCheck each eye separately, first the right and then the left. Keep both eyes open and cover one eye with the palm of the hand.\nRead the chart, beginning with the top line and moving down the lines until it is too difficult to read the letters. Record the number of the smallest line that you know you read correctly. Repeat with the other eye.\nNEAR VISION\nThis is similar to the distance vision test above, but the near vision test card is held only 14 inches (35 centimeters) away. If you wear glasses for reading, wear them for the test.\nHold the card about 14 inches (35 centimeters) from your eyes."}

If you wear glasses for reading, wear them for the test.\nHold the card about 14 inches (35 centimeters) from your eyes. Do not bring the card any closer. Read the chart using each eye separately as described above. Record the size of the smallest line you were able to accurately read.\nRecently, smartphone apps have become available that can measure your vision and even produce a prescription. Most of these apps require an additional device to attach to your phone. Be sure to verify their accuracy before relying on them.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou need a well-lit area at least 10 feet (3 meters) long for the distance vision test, and the following:\nMeasuring tape or a yardstick\nEye charts\nTape or tacks to hang the eye charts on the wall\nA pencil to record results\nAnother person to help (if possible), since they can stand close to the chart and tell you if you read the letters correctly\nThe vision chart needs to be tacked to the wall at eye level."}

Mark the floor with a piece of tape exactly 10 feet (3 meters) from the chart on the wall.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe tests cause no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour vision may change gradually without you being aware of it.\nHome vision tests can help detect eye and\nvision problems\nearly. Home vision tests should be performed under the direction of your provider to detect changes that may occur between eye exams. They do not take the place of a professional eye exam.\nPeople who are at risk of developing macular degeneration may be told by their eye doctor to perform the Amsler grid test more often. It is best to do this test not more often than once a week. Macular degeneration changes are gradual, and you can miss them if you test daily."}

It is best to do this test not more often than once a week. Macular degeneration changes are gradual, and you can miss them if you test daily. Recent studies have questioned the value of Amsler grid testing because new changes in the retina may be missed, making the importance of follow-up visits with an eye doctor or retina specialist even more important.\nNormal Results\nNormal results for each of the tests are as follows:\nAmsler grid test: All lines appear straight and unbroken with no distorted or missing areas.\nDistance vision test: All letters on the 20/20 line read correctly.\nNear vision test: You are able to read the line labeled 20/20 or J-1.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may mean you have a vision problem or eye disease and you should have a professional eye examination.\nAmsler grid test: If the grid appears distorted or broken, there may be a problem with the\nretina\n.\nDistance vision test: If you do not read the 20/20 line correctly, it may be a sign of\nnearsightedness\n(myopia),\nfarsightedness\n(hyperopia),\nastigmatism\n, or another eye abnormality.\nNear vision test: Not being able to read the small type"}
