It can also occur when the kidneys cannot remove enough acid from the body. There are several types of metabolic acidosis:\nDiabetic acidosis (also called\ndiabetic ketoacidosis\nand DKA) develops when substances called ketone bodies (which are acidic) build up during uncontrolled diabetes (usually type 1 diabetes).\nHyperchloremic acidosis is caused by the loss of too much sodium bicarbonate from the body, which can happen with severe diarrhea.\nKidney disease (uremia, distal renal tubular acidosis or proximal renal tubular acidosis).\nLactic acidosis.\nPoisoning by aspirin, ethylene glycol (found in antifreeze), or methanol.\nSevere\ndehydration\n.\nLactic acidosis results from a buildup of lactic acid. Lactic acid is mainly produced in muscle cells and red blood cells. It forms when the body breaks down carbohydrates to use for energy when oxygen levels are low."}

Metabolic acidosis itself causes rapid and deep breathing as your body tries to compensate for it. Confusion or lethargy may also occur. Severe metabolic acidosis can lead to shock or death."}

In some situations, metabolic acidosis can be a mild, ongoing (chronic) condition.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about your symptoms.\nThese tests can help diagnose acidosis. They can also determine whether the cause is a breathing problem or a metabolic problem. Tests may include:\nArterial or venous blood gas\nBasic metabolic panel, (a group of blood tests that measure your sodium and potassium levels, kidney function, and other chemicals and functions)\nBlood ketones\nLactic acid test\nUrine ketones\nUrine pH\nOther blood tests may be needed to determine the cause of the acidosis.\nOther tests that may be needed to determine the cause of the acidosis include:\nChest x-ray\nCT abdomen\nUrinalysis\nUrine pH\nTreatment\nTreatment is aimed at the health problem causing the metabolic acidosis. In some cases, sodium bicarbonate (the chemical in baking soda) may be given to reduce the acidity of the blood."}

Often, you will receive lots of fluids through your vein.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMetabolic acidosis can be dangerous if untreated. Many cases respond well to treatment. The outlook will depend on the underlying disease causing the condition.\nPossible Complications\nVery severe metabolic acidosis can lead to shock or death.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nSeek medical help if you have symptoms of any disease that can cause metabolic acidosis.\nPrevention\nDiabetic ketoacidosis can be prevented by keeping\ntype 1 diabetes\nunder control and responding promptly if the blood sugar stays above 250 mg/dL for over 12 hours.\nAlternative Names\nAcidosis - metabolic\nImages\nInsulin production and diabetes\nReferences\nHamm LL, DuBose TD.
