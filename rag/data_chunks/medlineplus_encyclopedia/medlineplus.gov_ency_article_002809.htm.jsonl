The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.\nSwallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue necrosis, resulting in infection, shock and death, even several months after the initial swallowing event. Scars may form in these tissues leading to long-term difficulties with breathing, swallowing, and digestion.\nIf kerosene gets into the lungs (\naspiration\n), serious and, possibly permanent lung damage can occur.\nReferences\nAronson JK.
