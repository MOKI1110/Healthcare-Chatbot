Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBreast enlargement in males\nBreast enlargement in males\nWhen an abnormal amount of breast tissue develops in males, it is called gynecomastia. It is important to find out if the excess growth in the area of the breast is breast tissue and not excess fat tissue (lipomastia).\nConsiderations\nThe condition may occur in one or both breasts. It begins as a small lump beneath the nipple, which may be tender. One breast may be larger than the other. Over time the lump may become less tender and feel harder.\nEnlarged breasts in males are usually harmless, but may cause men to avoid wearing certain clothing or to not want to be seen without a shirt. This can cause significant distress, particularly in young men.\nSome newborns may have breast development along with a milky discharge (\ngalactorrhea\n). This condition usually lasts for a couple of weeks to months. In rare cases, it may last until the child is 1 year old.\nCauses\nNormal hormone changes are the most common cause of breast development in newborns, boys, and men."}

In rare cases, it may last until the child is 1 year old.\nCauses\nNormal hormone changes are the most common cause of breast development in newborns, boys, and men. There are other causes as well.\nHORMONE CHANGES\nBreast enlargement is usually caused by an imbalance of estrogen (female hormone) and testosterone (male hormone). Males have both types of hormones in their body. Changes in the levels of these hormones, or in how the body uses or responds to these hormones, can cause enlarged breasts in males.\nIn newborns, breast growth is caused by being exposed to estrogen from the mother. About one half of boy babies are born with enlarged breasts, called breast buds. They usually go away in 2 to 6 months, but can last longer.\nIn preteens and teens, breast growth is caused by normal hormone changes that occur during puberty. More than one half of boys develop some breast enlargement during puberty. Breast growth often goes away in 6 months to 2 years.\nIn men, hormone changes due to aging can cause breast growth."}
