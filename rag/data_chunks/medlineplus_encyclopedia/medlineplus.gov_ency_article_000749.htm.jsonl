The exam may show:\nThe head is rotated, tilted, or leaning forward or backward."}

The exam may show:\nThe head is rotated, tilted, or leaning forward or backward. In severe cases, the entire head is pulled and turned to one side.\nShortened or larger neck muscles.\nTests that may be done include:\nX-ray\nof the neck\nCT scan\nof the head and neck\nElectromyogram\n(EMG) to see which muscles are most affected\nMRI of the head and neck\nBlood tests to look for medical conditions that are linked to torticollis\nTreatment\nTreating torticollis that is present at birth involves stretching the shortened neck muscle. Passive stretching and positioning are used in infants and small children. In passive stretching, a device such as a strap, a person, or something else is used to hold the body part in a certain position. These treatments are often successful, especially if they are started within 3 months of birth.\nSurgery to correct the neck muscle may be done in the preschool years, if other treatment methods fail.\nTorticollis that is caused by damage to the nervous system, spine, or muscles is treated by finding the cause of the disorder and treating it."}

Depending on the cause, treatment may include:\nPhysical therapy (applying heat,\ntraction\nto the neck, and massage to help relieve head and neck pain).\nStretching exercises and neck braces to help with muscle spasms.\nTaking medicines such as baclofen to reduce neck muscle contractions.\nInjecting botulinum toxin (BTX) into affected muscles.\nTrigger point injections to relieve pain at a particular point.\nSurgery of the spine might be needed when the torticollis is due to dislocated vertebrae. In some cases, surgery involves destroying some of the nerves in the neck muscles, or using brain stimulation.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe condition may be easier to treat in infants and children."}
