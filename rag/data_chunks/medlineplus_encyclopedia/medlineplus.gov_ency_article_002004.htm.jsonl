By the baby's third day of life, mothers can tell their own baby's cry from that of other babies. By the first month of life, most parents can tell if their baby's cry means\nhunger\n, pain, or anger. Crying also causes a nursing mother's milk to fill the breast (letdown).\nThe amount of crying in the first 3 months varies in a healthy infant, from 1 to 3 hours a day. Infants who cry more than 3 hours a day are often described as having colic.\nColic in infants\nis rarely due to a problem with the body. In most cases, it stops by 4 months of age.\nRegardless of the cause,\nexcessive crying\nneeds a medical evaluation."}

It is not a sign of sudden infant death syndrome\nsudden infant death syndrome\n(SIDS). Some infants will vomit or spit up after each feeding, but have nothing physically wrong with them. They continue to gain weight and develop normally.\nOther infants grunt and groan while making a bowel movement, but produce soft, blood-free stools, and their growth and feeding are good. This is due to immature abdominal muscles used for pushing and does not need to be treated.\nSleep/wake cycles vary, and do not stabilize until a baby is 3 months old. These cycles occur in random intervals of 30 to 50 minutes at birth. Intervals gradually increase as the infant matures."}

These cycles occur in random intervals of 30 to 50 minutes at birth. Intervals gradually increase as the infant matures. By age 4 months, most infants will have one 5-hour period of uninterrupted sleep per day.\nBreast-fed infants will want to feed about every 2 hours. Formula-fed infants should be able to go 3 hours between feedings. During periods of rapid growth, they may feed more often.\nYou do not need to give water to a baby. In fact, it could be dangerous. An infant who is drinking enough will produce 6 to 8 wet diapers in a 24-hour period. Teaching the infant to suck a pacifier or their own thumb provides comfort between feedings.\nSAFETY\nSafety is very important for infants. Base safety measures on the child's developmental stage. For example, around age 4 to 6 months, the infant may begin to roll over. Therefore, be very careful while the baby is on the changing table.\nConsider the following important safety tips:\nBe aware of poisons (household cleaners, cosmetics, medicines, and even some plants) in your home and keep them out of your infant's reach. Use drawer and cupboard safety latches."}

Use drawer and cupboard safety latches. Post the national poison control number -- 1-800-222-1222 -- near the phone.\nDo not allow older infants to crawl or walk around in the kitchen while adults or older siblings are cooking. Block the kitchen off with a gate or place the infant in a playpen, highchair, or crib while others cook.\nDo not drink or carry anything hot while holding the infant to avoid burns. Infants begin waving their arms and grabbing for objects at 3 to 5 months.\nDo not leave an infant alone with siblings or pets. Even older siblings may not be ready to handle an emergency if it occurs. Pets, even though they may appear to be gentle and loving, may react unexpectedly to an infant's cries or grabs, or may smother an infant by lying too closely.\nDo not leave an infant alone on a surface from which the child can wiggle or roll over and fall off.\nFor the first 5 months of life, always place your infant on their back to go to sleep. This position has been shown to reduce the risk for SIDS."}

Use a car seat that faces backward until the infant is at least 1 year old and weighs 20 pounds (9 kilograms), or longer if possible. Then you can safely switch to a forward facing car seat. The safest place for the infant's car seat is in the middle of the back seat. It is very important for the driver to pay attention to driving, not playing with the infant."}

If you need to tend to the infant, safely pull the car over to the shoulder and park before trying to help the child.\nUse gates on stairways, and block off rooms that are not child proof. Remember, infants may learn to crawl or scoot as early as 6 months.\nCONTACT YOUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDER IF:\nThe infant does not look good, looks different from normal, or cannot be consoled by holding, rocking, or cuddling.\nThe infant's growth or development does not appear normal.\nYour infant seems to be losing developmental milestones.
