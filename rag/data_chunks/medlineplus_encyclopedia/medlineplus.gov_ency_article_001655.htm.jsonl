Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLesch-Nyhan syndrome\nLesch-Nyhan syndrome\nLesch-Nyhan syndrome is a disorder that is passed down through families (inherited). It affects how the body builds and breaks down chemicals called purines. Purines are a normal part of human tissue that help make up the body's genetic blueprint. They are also found in many different foods.\nCauses\nLesch-Nyhan syndrome is passed down as an X-linked, or\nsex-linked trait\n. It occurs mostly in boys. People with this syndrome are missing or severely lacking an enzyme called hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyltransferase (HPRT). The body needs this substance to recycle purines. Without it, abnormally high levels of\nuric acid\nbuild up in the body.\nSymptoms\nToo much uric acid can cause gout-like swelling in some of the joints. In some cases, kidney and bladder stones develop.\nPeople with Lesch-Nyhan have delayed motor development followed by abnormal movements and increased reflexes. A striking feature of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is self-destructive behavior, including chewing off fingertips and lips."}

A striking feature of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is self-destructive behavior, including chewing off fingertips and lips. It is unknown how the disease causes these problems.\nExams and Tests\nThere may be a family history of this condition.\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam. The exam may show:\nIncreased reflexes\nSpasticity\n(having spasms)\nBlood and urine tests may show high uric acid levels. A\nskin biopsy\nmay show decreased levels of the HPRT1 enzyme.\nTreatment\nNo specific treatment exists for Lesch-Nyhan syndrome. Medicine for treating gout can lower uric acid levels. However, treatment does not improve the nervous system outcome (for example, having increased reflexes and spasms).\nSome symptoms may be relieved with these medicines:\nCarbidopa/levodopa\nDiazepam\nPhenobarbital\nHaloperidol\nSelf-harm can be reduced by removal of teeth or by using a protective mouth guard designed by a dentist.\nYou can help a person with this syndrome using stress-reduction and positive behavioral techniques.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome is likely to be poor."}

People with this syndrome usually need help walking and sitting. Most need a wheelchair.\nPossible Complications\nSevere, progressive disability is likely.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if signs of this illness appear in your child or if there is a history of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome in your family.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling\nfor prospective parents with a family history of Lesch-Nyhan syndrome is recommended. Testing can be done to see if a woman is a carrier of this syndrome.\nReferences\nHarris JC. Disorders of purine and pyrimidine metabolism.
