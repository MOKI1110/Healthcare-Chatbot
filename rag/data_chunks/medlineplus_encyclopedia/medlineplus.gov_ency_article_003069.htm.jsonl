Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBreathing - slowed or stopped\nBreathing - slowed or stopped\nBreathing that stops from any cause is called apnea. Slowed breathing is called bradypnea. Labored or difficult breathing is known as dyspnea.\nConsiderations\nApnea can come and go and be temporary. This can occur with obstructive sleep apnea, for example.\nProlonged apnea means a person has stopped breathing. If the heart is still active, the condition is known as respiratory arrest. This is a life-threatening event that requires immediate medical attention and first aid.\nProlonged apnea with no heart activity in a person who is not responsive is called cardiac (or cardiopulmonary) arrest. In infants and children, the most common cause of cardiac arrest is respiratory arrest. In adults, the opposite usually occurs, cardiac arrest most often leads to respiratory arrest.\nCauses\nBreathing difficulty can occur for many reasons."}
