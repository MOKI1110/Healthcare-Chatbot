The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\nSwallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue death. This may result in infection, shock and death, even several months after substance was swallowed. Scar tissue in the affected areas can lead to long-term problems with breathing, swallowing, and digestion.\nProlonged exposure to mildew removal fumes can cause serious, long-term problems.\nReferences\nAgency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) website."}
