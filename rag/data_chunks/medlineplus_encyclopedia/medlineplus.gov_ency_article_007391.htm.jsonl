Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAortic aneurysm repair - endovascular\nAortic aneurysm repair - endovascular\nEndovascular abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) repair is surgery to repair a widened area in your aorta. This is called an aneurysm. The aorta is the large artery that carries blood from your heart to your belly, pelvis, and legs.\nAn\naortic aneurysm\nis when a part of this artery becomes too large or balloons outward. It occurs due to weakness in the wall of the artery.\nDescription\nThis procedure is done in an operating room, in the radiology department of a hospital, or in a catheterization lab. You will lie on a padded table. You may receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n(you are asleep and pain-free) or epidural or spinal anesthesia."}

You will lie on a padded table. You may receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n(you are asleep and pain-free) or epidural or spinal anesthesia. During the procedure, your surgeon will:\nMake a small surgical cut near the groin, to find the femoral artery.\nInsert a thin, flexible tube (catheter) into the artery through the cut.\nInsert a stent (a metal coil) and a man-made (synthetic) graft along the catheter.\nUse a dye to define the extent of the aneurysm.\nUse x-rays to guide the stent graft up into your aorta, to where the aneurysm is located.\nOpen the stent using a spring-like mechanism and attach it to the walls of the aorta. Your aneurysm will eventually shrink around it.\nUse x-rays and dye again to make sure the graft is in the right place and your aneurysm is not bleeding inside your body.\nRemove the catheter and close the surgical cut where the catheter was inserted.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nEndovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) is done because your aneurysm is very large, growing quickly, or is leaking or bleeding.\nYou may have an AAA that is not causing any symptoms or problems."}

Your health care provider may have found this problem when they examined you or you had an\nultrasound\nor\nCT scan\nfor another reason. There is a risk that this aneurysm may burst (rupture) if you do not have surgery to repair it. However, surgery to repair the aneurysm may also be risky. In such cases, EVAR is an option.\nYou and your provider must decide whether the risk of having this surgery is smaller than the risk for rupture if you do not have surgery to repair the problem. The provider is more likely to recommend that you have surgery if the aneurysm is:\nLarger (about 2 inches or 5 centimeters)\nGrowing more quickly (a little less than 1/4 inch or 0.5 centimeter over the last 6 to 12 months)\nEVAR has a lower risk of developing complications compared to open surgery."}
