Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBile duct obstruction\nBile duct obstruction\nBile duct obstruction is a blockage in the tubes that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine.\nCauses\nBile\nis a liquid released by the liver. It contains cholesterol, bile salts, and waste products such as\nbilirubin\n. Bile salts help your body break down (digest) fats. Bile passes out of the liver through the bile ducts and is stored in the gallbladder. After a meal, it is released into the small intestine.\nWhen the bile ducts become blocked, bile builds up in the liver, and jaundice (yellow color of the skin) develops due to the increasing level of bilirubin in the blood.\nThe possible causes of a blocked bile duct include:\nCysts of the common bile duct\nEnlarged lymph nodes in the porta hepatis (an area on the underside of the liver through which the bile duct passes)\nGallstones\nInflammation of the bile ducts\nNarrowing of the bile ducts from scarring\nInjury of a bile duct from gallbladder surgery\nTumors of the bile ducts or pancreas\nTumors that have spread to the\nbiliary system\nLiver a"}

Stones may be removed using an endoscope during an ERCP.\nIn some cases, surgery is required to bypass the blockage. The gallbladder will usually be surgically removed if the blockage is caused by gallstones. Your provider may prescribe antibiotics if an infection is suspected.\nIf the blockage is caused by cancer, the duct may need to be widened. This procedure is called endoscopic or percutaneous (through the skin next to the liver) dilation."}

Most obstructions can be treated with endoscopy or surgery. Obstructions caused by cancer often have a worse outcome.\nPossible Complications\nLeft untreated, the possible complications include infections,\nsepsis\n, and liver disease, such as biliary\ncirrhosis\n.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you:\nNotice a change in the color of your urine and stools\nDevelop jaundice\nHave abdominal pain that doesn't go away or keeps recurring\nPrevention\nBe aware of any risk factors you have, so that you can get prompt diagnosis and treatment if a bile duct becomes blocked."}
