This is a protein that helps break down a group of chemicals found in nerve tissue called gangliosides. Without this protein, gangliosides, particularly ganglioside GM2, build up in cells, often nerve cells in the brain.\nTay-Sachs disease is caused by a variant gene on\nchromosome\n15. When both parents carry the variant Tay-Sachs gene, a child has a 25% chance of developing the disease. The child must receive two copies of the variant gene, one from each parent, in order to become sick. If only one parent passes the variant gene to the child, the child is called a carrier. They will not be sick, but may pass the disease to their own children.\nAnyone can be a carrier of the Tay-Sachs gene."}

But, the disease is most common among people with Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, where 1 in every 27 people carries the Tay-Sachs gene.\nTay-Sachs disease is divided into infantile, juvenile, and adult forms, depending on the symptoms and when they first appear. Most people with Tay-Sachs have the infantile form. In this form, the nerve damage usually begins while the baby is still in the womb. Symptoms usually appear when the child is 3 to 6 months old."}

The disease tends to get worse very quickly, and the child usually dies by age 4 or 5.\nLate-onset Tay-Sachs disease, which affects adults, is very rare.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nDeafness\nDecreased eye contact,\nblindness\nDecreased muscle tone\n(loss of muscle strength), loss of motor skills, paralysis\nSlow growth and delayed mental and social skills\nDementia\n(loss of brain function)\nIncreased startle reaction\nIrritability\nListlessness\nSeizures\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine your baby and ask about your family history. Tests that may be done are:\nEnzyme\nexam of blood or body tissue for hexosaminidase levels\nEye exam (reveals a cherry-red spot in the\nmacula\n)\nGenetic testing\nTreatment\nThere is no treatment for Tay-Sachs disease itself, only ways to make the person more comfortable.\nSupport Groups\nThe stress of illness may be eased by joining\nsupport groups\nwhose members share common experiences and problems."}
