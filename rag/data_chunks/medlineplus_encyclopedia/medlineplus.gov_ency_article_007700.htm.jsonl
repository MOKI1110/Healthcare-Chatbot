Cardiac event monitors range in size, with the largest being about the size of a deck of cards. The device records your heart rate and rhythm.\nCardiac event monitors are used when you need long-term monitoring of symptoms that occur less than daily.\nHow the Test is Performed\nEach type of monitor is slightly different, but most have sensors (called electrodes) to record the electrical activity of your heart, similar to an electrocardiogram (ECG). In some models, these attach to the skin on your chest using sticky patches. The sensors need good contact with your skin. Poor contact can cause poor results.\nYou should keep your skin free from oils, creams, and sweat (as much as possible)."}

The technician who places the monitor will perform the following to get a good ECG recording:\nMen will have the area on their chest shaved where the electrode patches will be placed.\nThe area of skin where the electrodes will be attached will be cleaned with alcohol before the sensors are attached.\nYou can carry or wear a cardiac event monitor up to 30 days. You carry the device in your hand, wear it on your wrist, or keep it in your pocket. Event monitors can be worn for weeks or until symptoms occur.\nThere are several types of cardiac event monitors.\nLoop memory monitor.\nThe electrodes remain attached to your chest, and the monitor constantly records, but does not save, your ECG. When you feel symptoms, you press a button to activate the device. The device will then save the ECG from shortly before, during, and for a time after your symptoms begin."}

You carry this device in a pocket or wear it on your wrist. When you feel symptoms, you turn on the device and place the electrodes on your chest to record the ECG.\nPatch recorders.\nThis monitor does not use wires or electrodes. It continuously monitors ECG activity for 14 days using an adhesive patch that sticks to the chest.\nImplanted loop recorders.\nThis is a small monitor that is implanted under the skin on the chest. It can be left in place to monitor heart rhythms for 3 or more years.\nWhile wearing the device:\nYou should continue your normal activities while wearing the monitor. You may be asked to exercise or adjust your activity level during the test.\nKeep a diary of what activities you do while wearing the monitor, how you feel, and any symptoms you have."}

This will help your health care provider match symptoms with your monitor findings.\nThe monitoring station staff will tell you how to transfer data over the telephone, if applicable.\nYour provider will look at the data and see if there have been any abnormal heart rhythms.\nThe monitoring company or the provider who ordered the monitor may contact you if a concerning rhythm is discovered.\nWhile wearing the device, you may be asked to avoid certain things that can disrupt the signal between the sensors and the monitor. These may include:\nCell phones\nElectric blankets\nElectric toothbrushes\nHigh-voltage areas\nMagnets\nMetal detectors\nAsk the technician who attaches the device for a list of things to avoid.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nTell your provider if you are allergic to any tape or other adhesives.\nHow the Test will Feel\nFor devices just placed on the skin, this is a painless test. However, the adhesive of the electrode patches may irritate your skin."}

For devices implanted under the skin, you may be given a small amount of local anesthetic to numb the area during the incision. You may have some pain when the device is implanted.\nYou must keep the monitor close to your body.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nMost often, in people with frequent symptoms, a test called\nHolter monitoring\n, which lasts 1 to 2 days, will be performed before using a cardiac event monitor. The event monitor is ordered only if no diagnosis is reached. The event monitor is also used for people who have symptoms that occur less often, such as weekly to monthly.\nCardiac event monitoring may be used:\nTo assess someone with\npalpitations\n.
