Sweat chloride test is the standard test used to diagnose cystic fibrosis (CF).\nHow the Test is Performed\nA colorless, odorless chemical that causes sweating is applied to a small area on an arm or leg. An electrode is then attached to the spot. A weak electrical current is sent to the area to stimulate sweating.\nPeople may feel a tingling in the area, or a feeling of warmth. This part of the procedure lasts for about 5 minutes.\nNext, the stimulated area is cleaned and the sweat is collected on a piece of filter paper or gauze, or in a plastic coil.\nAfter 30 minutes, the collected sweat is sent to a hospital lab to be tested. The collection takes about 1 hour.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special steps are needed before this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test is not painful. Some people have a tingling feeling at the site of the electrode."}

Some people have a tingling feeling at the site of the electrode. This feeling may cause discomfort in small children.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nSweat testing is the standard method for diagnosing cystic fibrosis. People with\ncystic fibrosis\nhave higher amounts of sodium and chloride in their sweat that are detected by the test.\nSome people are tested because of symptoms they are having. In the United States, newborn screening programs test for cystic fibrosis. The sweat test is used to confirm these results.\nNormal Results\nNormal results include:\nA sweat chloride test result of less than 30 mmol/L in all populations means cystic fibrosis is less likely.\nA result between 30 to 59 mmol/L does not give a clear diagnosis. Further testing is needed.\nIf the result is 60 mmol/L or greater, cystic fibrosis is present.\nNote: mmol/L = millimole per liter\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}

Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nSome conditions, such as dehydration or swelling (edema) can affect the test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal test may mean that the child has cystic fibrosis. Results can also be confirmed by CF gene mutation panel testing.\nAlternative Names\nSweat test; Sweat chloride; Iontophoretic sweat test; CF - sweat test; Cystic fibrosis - sweat test\nImages\nSweat test\nSweat test\nReferences\nEgan ME, Schechter MS, Voynow JA.
