Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNabothian cyst\nNabothian cyst\nA nabothian cyst is a lump filled with mucus on the surface of the cervix or cervical canal.\nThe cervix is located at the lower end of the womb (uterus) at the top of the vagina. It is about 1 inch (2.5 centimeters) long.\nCauses\nThe cervix is lined with glands and cells that release mucus. The glands can become covered by a type of skin cells called squamous epithelium. When this happens, the secretions build up in the plugged glands. They form a smooth, rounded bump on the\ncervix\n. The bump is called a nabothian cyst.\nSymptoms\nEach nabothian cyst appears as a small, white raised bump. There can be more than one.\nExams and Tests\nDuring a pelvic exam, your health care provider will see a small, smooth, rounded lump (or collection of lumps) on the surface of the cervix. Rarely, magnifying the area (colposcopy) may be needed to tell these cysts from other bumps that can occur.\nMost women have small nabothian cysts. These can be detected by vaginal ultrasound."}

If you're told you have a nabothian cyst during a vaginal ultrasound exam, don't be concerned, as their presence is normal.\nSometimes the cyst is opened to confirm the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nNo treatment is necessary. Nabothian cysts do not cause any problems.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nNabothian cysts do not cause any harm. They are a\nbenign\ncondition.\nPossible Complications\nThe presence of many cysts or cysts that are large and blocked can make it hard for the provider to do a\nPap test\n. This is rare.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nMost of the time, this condition is found during a routine pelvic exam.\nPrevention\nThere is no known prevention.\nImages\nNabothian cyst\nReferences\nBaggish MS.
