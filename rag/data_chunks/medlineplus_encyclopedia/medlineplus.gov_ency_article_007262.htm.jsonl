Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLipoprotein-a\nLipoprotein-a\nLipoproteins are molecules made of\nproteins\nand fat. They carry cholesterol and similar substances through the blood.\nA blood test can be done to measure a specific type of lipoprotein called lipoprotein-a, or Lp(a). A high level of Lp(a) is considered a risk factor for heart disease.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will be asked not to eat anything for 12 hours before the test.\nDo not smoke before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nA needle is inserted to draw blood. You may feel slight pain, or only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nHigh levels of lipoproteins can increase the risk for heart disease. The test is done to check your risk for\natherosclerosis\n, stroke, and heart attack.\nIt is not yet clear if this measurement leads to improved benefits for patients."}

The test is done to check your risk for\natherosclerosis\n, stroke, and heart attack.\nIt is not yet clear if this measurement leads to improved benefits for patients. Therefore, many insurance companies do not pay for it.\nThe American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology do not recommend the test for most adults who do not have symptoms. It may be useful for people at higher risk because of a strong family history of cardiovascular disease.\nNormal Results\nNormal values are below 30 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter), or 1.7 mmol/L.\nNote: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.\nThe example above shows the common measurements for results of these tests."}
