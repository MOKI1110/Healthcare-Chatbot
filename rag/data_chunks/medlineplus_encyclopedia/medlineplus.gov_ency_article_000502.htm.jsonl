In this disease, many cysts form in the kidneys, causing them to become enlarged.\nCauses\nPKD is passed down through families (inherited). The two inherited forms of PKD are\nautosomal dominant\nand\nautosomal recessive\n.\nPeople with PKD have many clusters of cysts in the kidneys. What exactly triggers the cysts to form is unknown.\nPKD is associated with the following conditions:\nAortic aneurysms\nBrain\naneurysms\nCysts in the liver, pancreas, and\ntestes\nDiverticula\nof the colon\nAs many as half of people with PKD have cysts in the liver.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of PKD may include any of the following:\nAbdominal pain\nor tenderness\nBlood in the urine\nExcessive urination at night\n(nocturia)\nFlank pain\non one or both sides\nDrowsiness\nJoint pain\nNail abnormalities\nExams and Tests\nAn examination may show:\nAbdominal tenderness\nover the liver\nEnlarged kidneys\nEnlarged liver\nHeart murmurs\nor other signs of\naortic insufficiency\nor mitral"}

Treatment may include:\nBlood pressure medicines\nDiuretics (water pills)\nLow-salt diet\nAny urinary tract infection should be treated quickly with antibiotics.\nCysts that are painful, infected, bleeding, or causing a blockage may need to be drained."}
