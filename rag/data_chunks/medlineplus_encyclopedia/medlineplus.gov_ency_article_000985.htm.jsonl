It causes a blockage that may cut off blood flow. Part of the intestine may be damaged as a result.\nCauses\nA birth defect called intestinal malrotation can make an infant more likely to develop a volvulus. However, a volvulus can occur without this condition present.\nVolvulus due to malrotation occurs most often in the first year of life.\nSymptoms\nCommon symptoms of volvulus are:\nBloody or\ndark red stools\nConstipation\nor difficulty releasing stools\nDistended abdomen\nPain or tenderness in the abdomen\nNausea or vomiting\nShock\nVomiting green material\nSymptoms are very often severe and require emergency care."}

Early treatment can be critical for survival.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider may order the following tests to diagnose the condition:\nBarium enema\nBlood tests to check\nelectrolytes\n, infection, blood count, and others\nCT scan\nStool test for occult blood\n(shows small amounts of blood in the stool)\nUpper GI\nseries\nTreatment\nIn some cases,\ncolonoscopy\ncan be used to correct the problem. This involves use of a flexible tube with a light on the end that is passed into the colon (large bowel) through the rectum.\nEmergency surgery is often needed to repair the volvulus. A surgical cut is made in the abdomen. The bowels are untwisted and the blood supply is restored.\nIf a small segment of bowel is dead from a lack of blood flow (necrotic), it is removed. The ends of the bowel are then sewn together. Or, they are used to form a connection of the intestines to the outside of the body (colostomy or ileostomy)."}

Bowel contents can be removed through this opening.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost of the time, prompt diagnosis and treatment of volvulus leads to a good outcome.\nIf part of the bowel is dead, the outlook is poor. The situation may be fatal, depending on how much of the bowel is dead.\nPossible Complications\nPossible complications of volvulus are:\nSecondary peritonitis\n(an infection in the abdomen)\nShort bowel syndrome\n(problems that happen after removal of a large part of the small bowel)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nThis is an emergency condition. The symptoms of childhood volvulus develop quickly and the child will become very ill. Get medical attention right away if this happens.\nAlternative Names\nChildhood volvulus; Abdominal pain - volvulus; Sigmoid volvulus; Cecal volvulus; Acute colonic pseudo-obstruction (ACPO)\nImages\nVolvulus\nVolvulus - x-ray\nReferences\nMaqbool A, Liacouras CA.
