These kits require a prescription. They contain a medicine called epinephrine, which you should take right away if you get a wasp sting.\nTo treat the wasp sting:\nTry to remove the stinger from the skin (if it is still present). To do this, carefully scrape the back of a knife or other thin, blunt, straight-edged object (like a credit card) across the stinger if the person can keep still and it is safe to do so. Or, you can pull out the stinger with tweezers or your fingers. If you do this, do not pinch the venom sac at the end of the stinger. If this sac is broken, more venom will be released.\nClean the area thoroughly with soap and water.\nPlace ice (wrapped in a clean cloth) on the site of the sting for 10 minutes and then off for 10 minutes. Repeat this process."}

If the person has problems with blood circulation, decrease the time that the ice is on the area to prevent possible skin damage.\nKeep the affected area still, if possible, to prevent the venom from spreading.\nLoosen clothing and remove rings and other tight jewelry.\nGive the person diphenhydramine (Benadryl and other brands) by mouth if they can swallow. This antihistamine drug may be used alone for mild symptoms.\nBefore Calling Emergency\nHave this information ready:\nPerson's age, weight, and condition\nType of insect\nTime the sting occurred\nLocation of the sting\nPoison Control\nYour local\npoison control center\ncan be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.
