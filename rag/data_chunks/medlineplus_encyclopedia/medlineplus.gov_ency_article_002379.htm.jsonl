During the well-baby exam, a change from the expected normal head growth may alert your health care provider of a possible problem.\nFor example, a head that is larger than normal or that is increasing in size faster than normal may be a sign of several problems, including water on the brain (\nhydrocephalus\n).\nA very small head size (called\nmicrocephaly\n) or very slow growth rate may be a sign that the brain is not developing properly.\nAlternative Names\nOccipital-frontal circumference\nReferences\nBall JW, Dains JE, Flynn JA, Solomon BS, Stewart RW.
