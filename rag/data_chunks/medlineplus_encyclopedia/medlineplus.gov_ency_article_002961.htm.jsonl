This will help the eyes move correctly.\nEye muscle surgery is most often done on children. However, adults who have similar eye problems may also have it done. Children will most often have\ngeneral anesthesia\nfor the procedure. They will be asleep and will not feel pain.\nDepending on the problem, one or both eyes may need surgery.\nAfter the anesthesia has taken effect, the eye surgeon makes a small surgical cut in the clear tissue covering the white of the eye. This tissue is called the\nconjunctiva\n. Then the surgeon will locate one or more of the eye muscles that needs surgery. Sometimes the surgery strengthens the muscle, and sometimes it weakens it.\nTo strengthen a muscle, a section of the muscle or tendon may be removed to make it shorter."}

Sometimes the surgery strengthens the muscle, and sometimes it weakens it.\nTo strengthen a muscle, a section of the muscle or tendon may be removed to make it shorter. This step in the surgery is called a resection.\nTo weaken a muscle, it is reattached to a point farther toward the back of the eye. This step is called a recession.\nThe surgery for adults is similar. In most cases, adults are awake, but are given medicine to numb the area and help them relax.\nWhen the procedure is done on adults, an adjustable stitch is used on the weakened muscle so that minor changes can be made later that day or the next day. This technique often has a very good outcome.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nStrabismus is a disorder in which the two eyes do not line up in the same direction. Therefore, the eyes do not focus on the same object at the same time."}

If your child is ill, the surgery may be delayed.\nAfter the Procedure\nMost of the time, the surgery does not need an overnight stay in the hospital. The eyes are most often straight right after surgery.\nWhile recovering from the anesthesia and in the first few days after surgery, your child should avoid rubbing their eyes."}

Your surgeon will show you how to prevent your child from rubbing their eyes.\nAfter a few hours of recovery, your child may go home. You should have a follow-up visit with the eye surgeon 1 to 2 weeks after the surgery.\nTo prevent infection, you will probably need to put drops or ointment in your child's eyes.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nEye muscle surgery does not fix the poor vision of a lazy (amblyopic) eye. Your child may have to wear glasses or a patch.\nIn general, the younger a child is when the operation is performed, the better the result. Your child's eyes should look normal a few weeks after the surgery.\nAlternative Names\nRepair of cross-eye; Resection and recession; Strabismus repair; Extraocular muscle surgery\nPatient Instructions\nEye muscle repair - discharge\nImages\nWalleyes\nBefore and after strabismus repair\nEye muscle repair  - series\nReferences\nCoats DK, Olitsky SE.
