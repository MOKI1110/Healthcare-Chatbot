You must replace them by drinking fluids that contain electrolytes. Water does not contain electrolytes.\nCommon electrolytes include:\nCalcium\nChloride\nMagnesium\nPhosphorus\nPotassium\nSodium\nElectrolytes can be acids, bases, or salts. They can be measured by different blood tests. Each electrolyte can be measured separately, such as:\nIonized calcium\nSerum calcium\nSerum chloride\nSerum magnesium\nSerum phosphorus\nSerum potassium\nSerum sodium\nNote: Serum is the part of blood that doesn't contain cells.\nSodium, potassium, chloride, and calcium levels can also be measured as part of a\nbasic metabolic panel\n."}
