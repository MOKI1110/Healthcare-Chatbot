Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nDermatitis herpetiformis\nDermatitis herpetiformis\nDermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is a very itchy rash consisting of bumps and\nblisters\n. The rash is chronic (long-term).\nCauses\nDH usually begins in people age 20 and older. Children can sometimes be affected. It is seen in both men and women.\nThe exact cause is unknown. Despite the name, it is not related to the herpes virus. DH is an\nautoimmune disorder\n. There is a strong link between DH and\nceliac disease\n. Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes inflammation in the small intestine from eating gluten. People with DH also have a sensitivity to gluten, which causes the skin rash. About 25% of people with celiac disease also have DH.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nExtremely itchy bumps or blisters, most often on the elbows, knees, back, and buttocks.\nRashes that are usually the same size and shape on both sides.\nThe rash can look like\neczema\n.\nScratch marks and skin erosions instead of blisters in some people.\nMost people with DH have damage to their intestines from eating gluten."}

But only some have intestinal symptoms.\nExams and Tests\nIn most cases, a\nskin biopsy\nand direct immunofluorescence test of the skin are performed. The health care provider may also recommend a\nbiopsy\nof the intestines. Blood tests may be ordered to support the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nAn antibiotic called dapsone is very effective.\nA strict\ngluten-free diet\nwill also be recommended to help control the disease. Sticking to this diet may eliminate the need for medicines and prevent later complications.\nMedicines that suppress the immune system may be used, but are less effective.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe disease may be well-controlled with treatment."}
