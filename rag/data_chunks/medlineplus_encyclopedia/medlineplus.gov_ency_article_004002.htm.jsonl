Like a male condom, it creates a barrier to prevent the sperm from getting to the egg.\nInformation\nThe female condom protects against pregnancy. It also protects against infections spread during sexual contact, including HIV. However, it is not thought to work as well as male condoms in protecting against sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\nThe female condom is made of a thin, strong plastic called polyurethane. A newer version, which costs less, is made of a substance called nitrile.\nThese condoms fit inside the\nvagina\n. The condom has a ring on each end.\nThe ring that is placed inside the vagina fits over the\ncervix\nand covers it with the rubber material.\nThe other ring is open. It rests outside of the vagina and covers the\nvulva\n.\nHOW EFFECTIVE IS IT?\nThe female condom is about 75% to 82% effective with normal use."}

When used correctly all of the time, female condoms are 95% effective.\nFemale condoms can fail for the same reasons as male condoms, including:\nThere is a tear in a condom. (This can occur before or during intercourse.)\nThe condom is not put in place before the\npenis\ntouches the vagina.\nYou do not use a condom each time you have intercourse.\nThere are manufacturing defects in the condom (rare).\nThe contents of the condom are spilled as it is being removed.\nCONVENIENCE\nCondoms are available without a prescription.\nThey are fairly inexpensive (though more expensive than male condoms).\nYou can buy female condoms at most drugstores, STI clinics, and family planning clinics.\nYou need to plan to have a condom on hand when you have sex."}

This may make intercourse less enjoyable or even uncomfortable, although using lubricant may help.\nIrritation and allergic reactions may occur.\nThe condom may make noise (using the lubricant may help). The newer version is much quieter.\nThere is no direct contact between the penis and the vagina.\nThe woman is not aware of warm fluid entering her body. (This may be important to some women, but not to others.)\nHOW TO USE A FEMALE CONDOM\nFind the inner ring of the condom, and hold it between your thumb and middle finger.\nSqueeze the ring together and insert it as far as possible into the vagina."}

Make sure that the inner ring is past the pubic bone.\nLeave the outer ring outside of the vagina.\nMake sure that the condom has not become twisted.\nPut a couple of drops of water-based lubricant on the penis before and during intercourse as needed.\nAfter intercourse, and before standing up, squeeze and twist the outer ring to make sure the semen stays inside.\nRemove the condom by pulling gently. Use it only once.\nDISPOSING OF FEMALE CONDOMS\nYou should always throw condoms in the trash. Do not flush a female condom down the toilet. It is likely to clog the plumbing.\nIMPORTANT TIPS\nBe careful not to tear condoms with sharp fingernails or jewelry.\nDO NOT use a female condom and a male condom at the same time. Friction between them can cause them to bunch up or tear.\nDO NOT use a petroleum-based substance such as Vaseline as a lubricant."}

This will help avoid the temptation of not using a condom during sex.\nRemove tampons before inserting the condom.\nContact your health care provider or pharmacy for information about emergency contraception (Plan B) if the condom tears or the contents spill when removing it.\nIf you use condoms regularly as your contraceptive, ask your provider or pharmacist about having Plan B on hand to use in case of a condom accident.\nUse each condom only once.\nAlternative Names\nCondoms for women; Contraception - female condom; Family planning - female condom; Birth control - female condom\nImages\nThe female condom\nReferences\nHarper DM, Wilfling LE, Blanner CF.
