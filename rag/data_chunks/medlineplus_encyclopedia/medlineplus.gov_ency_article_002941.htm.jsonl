Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLarge bowel resection\nLarge bowel resection\nLarge bowel resection is surgery to remove all or part of your large bowel. This surgery is also called colectomy. The large bowel is also called the large intestine or colon.\nRemoval of the entire colon and the rectum is called a proctocolectomy.\nRemoval of all of the colon but not the rectum is called subtotal colectomy.\nRemoval of part of the colon but not the rectum is called a partial colectomy.\nThe large bowel connects the small intestine to the anus. Normally, stool passes through the large bowel before leaving the body through the anus.\nDescription\nYou'll receive\ngeneral anesthesia\nat the time of your surgery. This will keep you asleep and pain-free.\nThe surgery can be performed laparoscopically, with open surgery, or robotically. Depending on which surgery you have, the surgeon will make one or more cuts (incisions) in your belly.\nIf you have laparoscopic or robotic surgery:\nThe surgeon makes 3 to 5 small cuts (incisions) in your belly."}

A medical device called a laparoscope is inserted through one of the cuts. The scope is a thin, lighted tube with a camera on the end. It lets the surgeon see inside your belly. Other medical instruments are inserted through the other cuts.\nA cut of about 2 to 3 inches (in) or 5 to 7.6 centimeters (cm) may also be made if your surgeon needs to put their hand inside your belly to feel or remove the diseased bowel.\nYour belly is filled with a harmless gas to expand it. This makes the area easier for the surgeon to see and work in.\nYour surgeon examines the organs in your belly to see if there are any problems.\nThe diseased part of your large bowel is located and removed. Some lymph nodes may also be removed.\nIf you have open surgery:\nYour surgeon makes a cut of 6 to 8 in (15.2 to 20.3 cm) in your lower belly.\nThe organs in your belly are examined to see if there are any problems.\nThe diseased part of your large bowel is located and removed."}

Some lymph nodes may also be removed.\nIn both kinds of surgery, the next steps are:\nIf there is enough healthy large intestine left, the ends are stitched or stapled together. This is called an anastomosis. Most people have this step done.\nIf there is not enough healthy large intestine to reconnect, the surgeon makes an opening called a stoma through the skin of your belly. The colon is attached to the outer wall of your belly. Stool will go through the stoma into a drainage bag outside your body. This is called a\ncolostomy\n. The colostomy may be either short-term or permanent."}

This may involve staying on a liquid diet for a few days and using laxatives.\nDuring the weeks before your surgery:\nYou may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\nLet your surgeon know about any illness you may have before your surgery."}
