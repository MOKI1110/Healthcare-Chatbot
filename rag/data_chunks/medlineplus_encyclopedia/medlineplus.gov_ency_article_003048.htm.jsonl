Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nDrooling\nDrooling\nDrooling is saliva flowing outside the mouth.\nConsiderations\nDrooling is generally caused by:\nProblems keeping saliva in the mouth\nProblems with swallowing\nToo much saliva production\nSome people with drooling problems are at increased risk of breathing saliva, food, or fluids into the lungs. This may cause harm if there is a problem with the body's normal reflexes (such as gagging and coughing).\nCauses\nSome drooling in infants and toddlers is normal. It may occur with teething. Drooling in infants and young children may get worse with colds and allergies.\nDrooling may happen if your body makes too much saliva."}
