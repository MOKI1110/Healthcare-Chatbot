The faster the person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\nSwallowing diesel fuel can damage the linings of the:\nEsophagus\nIntestines\nMouth\nStomach\nThroat\nSerious and permanent damage can occur if the diesel gets into the lungs.\nDelayed injury may occur, including a hole forming in the throat, esophagus, stomach or lungs. This can lead to severe bleeding and infection, and may be fatal. Surgery may be needed to treat these complications.\nThe harsh taste of diesel fuel makes it unlikely that a large amount will be swallowed. However, cases of poisoning have occurred in people trying to suck (siphon) gas from an automobile tank using their mouth and a garden hose (or similar tube). This practice is very dangerous and is not advised.\nAlternative Names\nOil\nReferences\nKuschner WG, Blanc PD. Acute responses to toxic exposures.
