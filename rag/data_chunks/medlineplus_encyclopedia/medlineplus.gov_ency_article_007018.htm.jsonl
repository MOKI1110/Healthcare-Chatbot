It is done to improve vision and reduce a person's need for glasses or contact lenses.\nDescription\nFor clear vision, the eye's cornea and lens must bend (refract) light rays properly. This allows images to be focused on the retina. Otherwise, the images will be blurry.\nThis blurriness is referred to as a \"refractive error.\" It is caused by a mismatch between the shape of the cornea (curvature) and the length of the eye.\nLASIK uses an excimer laser (an ultraviolet laser) to remove a thin layer of corneal tissue. This gives the cornea a new shape so that light rays are focused clearly on the retina. LASIK causes the cornea to be thinner.\nLASIK is an outpatient surgical procedure. It takes 10 to 15 minutes to perform for each eye.\nThe only anesthetic used is eye drops that numb the surface of your eye. The procedure is done when you are awake, but you will get medicine to help you relax."}

The procedure is done when you are awake, but you will get medicine to help you relax. LASIK may be done on one or both eyes during the same session.\nTo do the procedure, a flap of corneal tissue is created. This flap is then peeled back so that the excimer laser can reshape the corneal tissue underneath. A hinge on the flap prevents it from being completely separated from the cornea.\nWhen LASIK was first done, a special automated knife (a microkeratome) was used to cut the flap. Now, a more common and safer method is to use a different type of laser (femtosecond) to create the corneal flap.\nThe amount of corneal tissue the excimer laser will remove is calculated ahead of time. The surgeon will calculate this based on several factors including:\nYour glasses or contact lens prescription\nA wavefront test, which measures how light travels through your eye\nThe shape of your cornea surface\nOnce the reshaping is done, the surgeon replaces and secures the flap. No stitches are needed."}

No stitches are needed. The cornea will naturally hold the flap in place.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nLASIK is most often done on people who use glasses or contact lenses because of\nnearsightedness\n(myopia). It is sometimes used to correct farsightedness. It may also correct astigmatism.\nThe FDA and American Academy of Ophthalmology have developed guidelines for determining LASIK candidates.\nYou should be at least 18 years old (21 in some cases, depending on the laser used). This is because vision may continue to change in people younger than 18. A rare exception is a child with one very nearsighted and one normal eye. Using LASIK to correct a very nearsighted eye may prevent\namblyopia\n(lazy eye).\nYour eyes must be healthy and your prescription stable. If you are nearsighted, you should postpone LASIK until your condition has stabilized."}

If you are nearsighted, you should postpone LASIK until your condition has stabilized. Nearsightedness may continue to increase in some people until their mid to late 20s.\nYour prescription must be within the range that can be corrected with LASIK.\nYou should be in good general health. LASIK may not be recommended for people with diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, glaucoma, herpes infections of the eye, or cataracts. You should discuss this with your surgeon.\nOther recommendations:\nWeigh the risks and rewards. If you're happy wearing contact lenses or glasses, you may not want to have the surgery.\nMake sure you have realistic expectations from the surgery.\nFor people with\npresbyopia\n, LASIK cannot correct vision so that one eye can see at both distance and near. However, LASIK can be done to allow one eye to see near and the other far. This is called \"monovision.\" If you can adjust to this correction, it may eliminate or reduce your need for reading glasses.\nIn some instances, surgery on only one eye is required."}

If your surgeon thinks you're a candidate, ask about the pros and cons.\nRisks\nYou should not have this procedure if you are pregnant or breastfeeding, because these conditions can affect eye measurements.\nYou should not have this procedure if you take certain prescription drugs, such as Accutane, Cardarone, Imitrex, or oral prednisone.\nRisks may include:\nCorneal infection\nCorneal scarring or permanent problems with the cornea's shape, making it impossible to wear contact lenses\nDecrease in contrast sensitivity, even with 20/20 vision, objects may appear fuzzy or gray\nDry eyes\nGlare or halos\nLight sensitivity\nNight driving\nproblems\nPatches of red or pink in the white of the eye (broken blood vessels, usually temporary)\nReduced vision or permanent vision loss\nScratchiness\nBefore the Procedure\nA complete eye exam will be done before surgery to make sure your eyes are healthy."}

This form confirms that you know the procedure's risks, benefits, alternative options, and possible complications.\nAfter the Procedure\nFollowing the surgery\n:\nYou may have burning, itching, or a feeling that something is in your eye. This feeling doesn't last for more than 6 hours in most cases.\nAn eye shield or patch will be placed over your eye to protect the flap.

Although a second surgery may improve distance vision, it may not relieve other symptoms, such as glare, halos, or problems with night driving. These are common complaints following LASIK surgery, especially when an older method is used. These problems should go away by 6 months after the surgery in most cases. However, a small number of people may continue to have problems with glare."}
