Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEntropion\nEntropion\nEntropion is the turning in of an edge of an eyelid. This causes the lashes to rub against the eye. It most often is seen on the lower eyelid.\nCauses\nEntropion can be present at birth (congenital).\nIn babies, it rarely causes problems because the lashes are very soft and do not easily damage the eye. In older people, the condition is most often caused by a spasm or weakening of the muscles surrounding the lower part of the eye.\nAnother cause can be\ntrachoma\ninfection, which can lead to scarring of the inner side of the lid. This is rare in North America and Europe. However, trachoma scarring is one of the three leading causes of blindness in the world.\nRisk factors for entropion are:\nAging\nChemical burn\nInfection with trachoma\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nDecreased vision if the cornea is damaged\nExcessive tearing\nEye discomfort\nor pain\nEye irritation\nRedness\nExams and Tests\nIn most cases, your health care provider can diagnose this condition by looking at your eyelids."}

Special tests are not often necessary.\nTreatment\nArtificial tears can keep the eye from becoming dry and may help you feel better. Surgery to correct the position of the eyelids works well in most cases.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook is most often good if the condition is treated before eye damage occurs.\nPossible Complications\nDry eye and irritation may increase the risk for:\nCorneal abrasions\nCorneal ulcers\nEye infections\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nYour eyelids turn inward.\nYou constantly feel as though there is\nsomething in your eye\n.\nIf you have entropion, the following should be considered an emergency:\nDecreasing vision\nLight sensitivity\nPain\nEye redness that increases rapidly\nPrevention\nMost cases cannot be prevented."}
