Polyneuropathy means several nerves are involved. CIDP often affects both sides of the body.\nCIDP is caused by an abnormal\nimmune response\n. CIDP occurs when the immune system attacks the\nmyelin cover\nof the nerves. For this reason, CIDP is thought to be an\nautoimmune disease\n.\nHealth care providers also consider CIDP as the\nchronic\nform of\nGuillain-BarrÃ© syndrome\n.\nThe specific triggers of CIDP vary."}
