Between 6 months and 2 years, both measurements are about equal. After 2 years, the chest size becomes larger than the head.\nMeasurements over time that show an increased rate of head growth often provide more valuable information than a single measurement that is larger than expected.\nIncreased pressure inside the head (\nincreased intracranial pressure\n) often occurs with increased head circumference."}

More often, repeated measurements of the head circumference over time are needed to confirm that the head circumference is increased and the problem is getting worse.\nDiagnostic tests that may be ordered include:\nHead CT scan\nMRI of the head\nCranial ultrasound\nTreatment depends on the cause of the increased head size. For example, for hydrocephalus, surgery may be needed to relieve the buildup of fluid inside the skull.\nAlternative Names\nMacrocephaly\nImages\nSkull of a newborn\nReferences\nBamba V, Kelly A.
