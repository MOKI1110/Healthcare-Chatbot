The dye is usually given during the test through a vein (\nIV\n) in your hand or forearm. The dye helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly.\nDuring the MRI, the person who operates the machine watches you from another room. The test most often lasts 30 to 60 minutes, but may take longer.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan.\nTell your health care provider if you are afraid of close spaces (have claustrophobia). You may receive medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious."}

You may receive medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious. Or your provider may suggest an open MRI, in which the machine is not as close to the body.\nYou may be asked to wear a hospital gown or clothing without metal ties (such as sweatpants and a t-shirt). Certain types of metal can cause blurry images.\nBefore the test, tell your provider if you have:\nBrain aneurysm clips\nAn artificial heart valve\nHeart defibrillator or pacemaker\nInner ear (cochlear) implants\nKidney disease\nor are on dialysis (you may not be able to receive contrast)\nRecently placed artificial joint\nA blood vessel\nstent\nWorked with sheet metal in the past (you may need tests to check for metal pieces in your eyes)\nThe MRI contains strong magnets.

This includes:\nPens, pocketknives, and eyeglasses\nItems such as jewelry, watches, credit cards, and hearing aids\nPins, hairpins, metal zippers, and similar metallic items\nRemovable dental work\nHow the Test will Feel\nIf you need dye, you will feel the needle pinch in your arm when the dye is injected into the vein.\nAn MRI exam causes no pain. If you have difficulty lying still or are very nervous, you may be given a medicine to relax. Too much movement can blur the images and cause errors.\nThe table may be hard or cold, but you can ask for a blanket or pillow. The machine makes loud thumping and humming noises when turned on. You can ask for ear plugs to help reduce the noise.\nAn intercom in the room allows you to speak to someone at any time. Some MRIs have televisions and special headphones that can help you pass the time or block the scanner noise.\nThere is no recovery time, unless you were given a medicine to relax."}

To date, no side effects from the magnetic fields and radio waves have been reported.\nThe most common type of contrast (dye) used is gadolinium. It is very safe. Allergic reactions to this substance rarely occur. However, gadolinium can be harmful to people with kidney problems who are on dialysis. If you have kidney problems, tell your provider before the test.\nThe strong magnetic fields created during an MRI can make heart pacemakers and other implants not work as well."}

In many cases MRI may be more sensitive than CT scan to problems in the brain such as small masses. CT is usually better at looking for small areas of bleeding.\nTests that may be done instead of an MRI of the head include:\nHead CT scan\nPositron emission tomography\n(PET) scan of the brain\nA CT scan may be preferred in the following cases, since it is faster and usually available right in the emergency room:\nAcute trauma of the head and face\nBleeding in the brain (within the first 24 to 48 hours)\nEarly symptoms of stroke\nSkull bone disorders and disorders involving the bones of the ear\nAlternative Names\nNuclear magnetic resonance - cranial; Magnetic resonance imaging - cranial; MRI of the head; MRI - cranial; NMR - cranial; Cranial MRI; Brain MRI; MRI - brain; MRI - head\nImages\nBrain\nHead MRI\nLobes of the brain\nReferences\nBarras CD, Bhattacharya JJ."}
