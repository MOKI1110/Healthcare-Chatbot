This is one of the proteins in the body that helps the blood clot.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may need to temporarily stop taking some medicines before this test. Your health care provider will tell you which ones.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is used to find the cause of abnormal bleeding (decreased blood clotting). This decreased clotting may be caused by an abnormally low level of factor VII.\nNormal Results\nThe normal value is 50% to 200% of the lab control or reference value.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples."}

Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nDecreased factor VII activity may be related to:\nFactor VII deficiency\n(a bleeding disorder that affects the ability of blood to clot). It can rarely be due to an inherited condition associated with a variant gene.\nDisorder in which the proteins that regulate blood clotting become overactive (\ndisseminated intravascular coagulation\n).\nFat\nmalabsorption\n(not absorbing enough fat from your diet).\nLiver disease\n(such as\ncirrhosis\n).\nVitamin K\ndeficiency.\nTaking certain blood thinners.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other."}

The risk of excessive bleeding is slightly greater than for people without bleeding problems.\nAlternative Names\nStable factor; Proconvertin; Autoprothrombin I\nReferences\nGailani D, Benjamin FT, Wheeler AP.
