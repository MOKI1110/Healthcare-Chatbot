However, the main symptom that tells apart the two conditions is that people with NSML have lentigines.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and listen to the heart with a stethoscope.\nTests that may be done include:\nElectrocardiogram (ECG) and\nechocardiogram\nto check the heart\nHearing test\nCT scan of the brain\nSkull x-ray\nEEG to check the brain's function\nBlood tests to check certain hormone levels\nRemoving a small amount of skin for examination (\nskin biopsy\n)\nTreatment\nSymptoms are treated as appropriate.
