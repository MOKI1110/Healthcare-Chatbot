Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nChronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)\nChronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)\nChronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) is\ncancer\nthat starts inside the bone marrow. This is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells.\nCML causes an uncontrolled growth of immature and mature cells that make a certain type of white blood cell called myeloid cells. The diseased cells build up in the bone marrow and blood.\nCauses\nThe cause of CML is related to an abnormal chromosome called the Philadelphia chromosome.\nRadiation exposure can increase the risk of developing CML. Radiation exposure can be from radiation treatments used in the past to treat thyroid cancer or Hodgkin lymphoma or from a nuclear disaster.\nIt takes many years to develop leukemia from radiation exposure. Most people treated for cancer with radiation do not develop leukemia."}

Most people treated for cancer with radiation do not develop leukemia. And most people with CML have not been exposed to radiation.\nCML most often occurs in middle-age adults and in children.\nSymptoms\nChronic myelogenous leukemia is grouped into phases:\nChronic\nAccelerated\nBlast crisis\nThe chronic phase can last for months or years. The disease may have few or no symptoms during this time. Most people are diagnosed during this stage, when they have blood tests done for other reasons.\nThe accelerated phase is a more dangerous phase. Leukemia cells grow more quickly. Common symptoms include\nfever\n(even without infection),\nbone pain\n, and a\nswollen spleen\n.\nUntreated CML leads to the blast crisis phase."}

Bleeding and infection may occur due to bone marrow failure.\nOther possible symptoms of a blast crisis include:\nBruising\nExcessive sweating\n(night sweats)\nFatigue\nFever\nPressure under the lower left ribs from a swollen spleen\nRash -- small pinpoint red marks on the skin (\npetechiae\n)\nWeakness\nExams and Tests\nA physical examination often reveals a swollen spleen. A complete blood count (\nCBC\n) shows an increased number of white blood cells with many immature forms present and an increased number of platelets. These are parts of the blood that help blood clot.\nOther tests that may be done include:\nBone marrow\nbiopsy\nBlood and bone marrow\ntesting\nfor the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome\nTreatment\nMedicines that target the abnormal protein made by the Philadelphia chromosome are often the first treatment for CML. These medicines can be taken as pills."}

These medicines can be taken as pills. People treated with these drugs often go into remission quickly and can stay in remission for many years.\nSometimes,\nchemotherapy\nis used first to reduce the white blood cell count if it is very high at diagnosis.\nThe blast crisis phase is very difficult to treat. This is because there is a very high count of immature white blood cells (leukemia cells) that are resistant to treatment.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\ncancer support group\n. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nTargeted medicines, such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors, have greatly improved the outlook for people with CML. Most people can remain in remission, assessed typically by blood tests, for many years, and potentially for life, while on this medicine.\nStem cell or bone marrow transplant is often considered in people whose disease comes back or gets worse while taking the medicines."}

Chemotherapy can have serious side effects, depending on the drugs used.\nPrevention\nAvoid exposure to radiation when possible.\nAlternative Names\nCML; Chronic myeloid leukemia; CGL; Chronic granulocytic leukemia; Leukemia - chronic granulocytic\nPatient Instructions\nBone marrow transplant - discharge\nImages\nBone marrow aspiration\nChronic myelocytic leukemia - microscopic view\nChronic myelocytic leukemia\nChronic myelocytic leukemia\nReferences\nKantarjian H, Cortes J.
