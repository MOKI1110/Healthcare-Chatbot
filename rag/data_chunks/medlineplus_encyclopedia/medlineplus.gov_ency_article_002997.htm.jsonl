The bladder is inside out. It is fused with the abdominal wall and is exposed. The pelvic bones are also separated.\nDescription\nBladder exstrophy repair involves two surgeries. The first surgery is to repair the bladder. The second one is to attach the pelvic bones to each other.\nThe first surgery separates the exposed bladder from the abdomen wall. The bladder is then closed. The bladder neck and urethra are repaired. A flexible, hollow tube called a catheter is placed to drain urine from the bladder. This is placed through the abdominal wall. A second catheter is left in the urethra to promote healing.\nThe second surgery, pelvic bone surgery, may be done along with the bladder repair."}

It may also be delayed for weeks or months.\nA third surgery may be needed if there is a bowel defect or any problems with the first two repairs.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThe surgery is recommended for children who are born with bladder exstrophy. This defect occurs more often in boys and is often linked to other birth defects.\nSurgery is necessary to:\nAllow the child to develop normal urinary control\nAvoid future problems with sexual function\nImprove the child's physical appearance (genitals will look more normal)\nPrevent infection that could harm the kidneys\nSometimes, the bladder is too small at birth. In this case, the surgery will be delayed until the bladder has grown. These newborns are sent home on antibiotics. The bladder, which is outside the abdomen, must be kept moist.\nIt can take months for the bladder to grow to the right size. The infant will be followed closely by a medical team."}

In this case, the hospital staff will prepare your child for the surgery.\nIf the surgery was not done when your child was a newborn, your child may need the following tests at the time of surgery:\nUrine test (\nurine culture\nand\nurinalysis\n) to check your child's urine for infection and to test kidney function\nBlood tests (\ncomplete blood count\n, electrolytes, and kidney tests)\nRecord of urine output\nX-ray of pelvis\nUltrasound of the kidneys\nAlways tell your child's health care provider what medicines your child is taking. Also let them know about the medicines or herbs you bought without a prescription that your child takes.\nTen days before the surgery, your child may be asked to stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen, warfarin (Coumadin), and any other medicines. These medicines make it hard for the blood to clot."}

Ask the surgeon which medicines your child should still take on the day of the surgery.\nOn the day of the surgery:\nYour child will usually be asked not to drink or eat anything for several hours before the surgery.\nGive the medicines your child's surgeon told you to give with a small sip of water.\nYour child's surgeon will tell you when to arrive.\nAfter the Procedure\nAfter pelvic bone surgery, your child will need to be in a lower body cast or sling for 4 to 6 weeks. This helps the bones heal.\nAfter the bladder surgery, your child will have a tube that drains the bladder through the abdominal wall (\nsuprapubic catheter\n). This will be in place for 3 to 4 weeks.\nYour child will also need pain management, wound care, and antibiotics. The provider will teach you about these things before you leave the hospital.\nDue to the high risk for infection, your child will need to have a urinalysis and urine culture at every well-child visit."}

Some children take antibiotics on a regular basis to prevent infection.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nUrinary control most often happens after the neck of the bladder is repaired. This surgery is not always successful. The child may need to repeat the surgery later on.\nEven with repeat surgery, a few children will not have control of their urine. They may need\ncatheterization\n.\nAlternative Names\nBladder birth defect repair; Everted bladder repair; Exposed bladder repair; Repair of bladder exstrophy\nPatient Instructions\nSurgical wound care - open\nReferences\nDi Carlo HN, Crigger CB .
