In the United States, local, state, and national agencies (for example, county and state health departments or the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]) require that these diseases be reported when they are diagnosed by health care providers or laboratories.\nReporting allows for the collection of statistics that show how often the disease occurs. This helps researchers identify disease trends and track disease outbreaks. This information can help control future outbreaks.\nInformation\nAll US states have a reportable diseases list. It is the responsibility of your provider, not you, to report cases of these diseases. Many diseases on the list must also be reported to the CDC.\nReportable diseases are divided into several groups:\nMandatory written reporting: A report of the disease must be made in writing."}
