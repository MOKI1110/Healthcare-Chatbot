Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nProlactinoma\nProlactinoma\nA prolactinoma is a noncancerous (benign) pituitary tumor that produces a hormone called prolactin. This results in too much prolactin in the blood.\nCauses\nProlactin is a hormone that triggers the breasts to produce milk (lactation).\nProlactinoma is the most common type of\npituitary tumor\n(adenoma) that produces a hormone. It makes up about 30% of all pituitary adenomas. Almost all pituitary tumors are noncancerous (benign). Prolactinoma may occur as part of an inherited condition called\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia type 1\n(MEN 1).\nProlactinomas occur most commonly in people under age 40. They are more common in women than in men and are rare in children.\nAt least half of all prolactinomas are very small (less than 3/8 of an inch or 1 centimeter [cm] in diameter). These small tumors occur more often in women and are called microprolactinomas.\nLarger tumors are more common in men. They tend to occur at an older age. The tumor can grow to a large size before symptoms appear."}

They tend to occur at an older age. The tumor can grow to a large size before symptoms appear. Tumors larger than 3/8 inch (1 cm) in diameter are called macroprolactinomas.\nThe tumor is often detected at an earlier stage in young women than in men because the high prolactin causes irregular menstrual periods.\nSymptoms\nIn women:\nAbnormal milk flow from the breast in a woman who is not pregnant or nursing (\ngalactorrhea\n)\nBreast tenderness\nDecreased sexual interest (libido)\nDecreased peripheral vision\nHeadache\nInfertility\nStopping of menstruation not related to\nmenopause\n, or irregular menstruation\nVision changes\nIn men:\nDecreased sexual interest (libido)\nDecreased peripheral vision\nEnlargement of breast tissue\n(gynecomastia)\nHeadache\nErection problems\n(impotence)\nInfertility\nVision changes\nSymptoms caused by pressure from a larger tumor may include:\nHeadache\nLethargy\nNasal drainage\nNausea and vomiting\nProblems with the sense of smell\nSinus pain or pressure\nVision changes, such as double vision,\ndrooping eyelids\n, or visual field loss\nThere may be no symptoms, especially in older"}

You will also be asked about medicines and substances you are taking.\nTests that may be ordered include:\nPituitary MRI or\nbrain CT scan\nTestosterone\nlevel in men\nProlactin\nlevel\nThyroid function\ntests (important because an underactive thyroid can mimic a prolactinoma - pseudoprolactinoma)\nOther tests of pituitary function\nTreatment\nMedicine is usually successful in treating prolactinoma. Some people have to take these medicines for life. Other people can stop taking the medicines after 2 to 3 years, especially if their tumor was small (less than 1 cm) when it was discovered or has disappeared from the MRI images."}

Radiation may be given in the form of:\nConventional radiation\nGamma knife (stereotactic radiosurgery)\n-- a type of radiation therapy that focuses high-powered x-rays on a small area in the brain.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook is usually excellent but depends on the success of medical treatment or surgery."}

Getting tested to check whether the tumor has returned after treatment is important.\nTreatment for prolactinoma may change the levels of other hormones in the body, especially if surgery or radiation is performed.\nHigh levels of estrogen or testosterone may be involved in the growth of a prolactinoma. Women with prolactinomas should be followed closely during pregnancy. They should discuss this tumor with their provider before taking birth control pills with a higher than usual estrogen content.\nUntreated pituitary adenomas always have a small risk of suddenly getting bigger, most commonly from bleeding inside the tumor. This is called pituitary apoplexy, and it is a medical emergency."}
