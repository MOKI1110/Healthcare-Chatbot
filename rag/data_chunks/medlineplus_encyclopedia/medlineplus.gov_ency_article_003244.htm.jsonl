It is most easily seen on the face, lining of the eyes, inner mouth, and nails. Local paleness usually affects a single limb.\nHow easily paleness is diagnosed varies with skin color and the thickness and amount of blood vessels in the tissue under the skin. Sometimes it is only a lightening of skin color. Paleness may be difficult to detect in a dark-skinned person and is detected only in the eye and mouth lining.\nCauses\nPaleness may be the result of decreased blood supply to the skin. It can also be due to decreased number of red blood cells (anemia). Paleness of the skin is not the same as loss of pigment from the skin."}
