It causes problems with the skin, sinuses, lungs, bones, and teeth.\nCauses\nHyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome is also called Job syndrome. It is named after the biblical character Job, whose faithfulness was tested by an affliction with draining skin sores and\npustules\n. People with this condition have long-term, severe skin infections.\nThe symptoms are most often present in childhood, but because the disease is so rare, it often takes years before a correct diagnosis is made.\nRecent research suggests that the disease is often caused by a genetic change that takes place in the\nSTAT3\ngene\non\nchromosome\n17. How this gene abnormality causes the symptoms of the disease is not well understood."}

The goal of treatment is to control the infections. Medicines include:\nAntibiotics\nAntifungal and antiviral medicines (when appropriate)\nSurgery is sometimes needed to drain abscesses.\nGamma globulin given through a vein (IV) may help build up the immune system if you have severe infections.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHyper IgE syndrome is a lifelong chronic condition. Each new infection requires treatment.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nRepeated infections\nSepsis\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have symptoms of Hyper IgE syndrome.\nPrevention\nThere is no proven way to prevent Hyper IgE syndrome. Good general hygiene is helpful in preventing skin infections.\nSome providers may recommend preventive antibiotics for people who develop many infections, especially with\nStaphylococcus aureus\n."}
