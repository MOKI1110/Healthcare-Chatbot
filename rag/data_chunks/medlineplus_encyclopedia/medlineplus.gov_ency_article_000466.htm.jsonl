Nephropathy is damage, disease, or other problems with the kidney.\nIgA nephropathy is also called Berger disease.\nCauses\nIgA is a protein, called an\nantibody\n, that helps the body fight infections. IgA nephropathy occurs when too much of this protein is deposited in the kidneys. IgA builds up inside the small blood vessels of the kidney. Structures in the kidney called glomeruli become inflamed and damaged.\nThe disorder can appear suddenly (\nacute\n), or get worse slowly over many years (chronic\nglomerulonephritis\n).\nRisk factors include:\nA personal or family history of IgA nephropathy or Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein\npurpura\n, a form of\nvasculitis\nthat affects many parts of the body\nWhite or Asian ethnicity\nIgA nephropathy can occur in people of all ages, but it most often affects males in their teens to late 30s.\nSymptoms\nThere may be no symptoms for many years.\nWhen there are symptoms, they may include:\nBloody urine that starts during or soon"}

Sometimes, the blood pressure may be high or there may be swelling in parts of the body.\nTests include:\nBlood urea nitrogen\n(BUN) test to measure kidney function\nCreatinine blood test\nto measure kidney function\nKidney biopsy\nto confirm the diagnosis\nUrinalysis\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent or delay\nchronic renal failure\n.\nThe treatment may include:\nAngiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) to control high blood pressure and swelling (\nedema\n)\nCorticosteroids, other medicines that suppress the immune system\nFish oil\nMedicines to lower cholester"}

In many cases, it does not get worse at all.
