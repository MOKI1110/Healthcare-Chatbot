It usually occurs in infants and children.\nCauses\nNeuroblastoma can occur in many areas of the body. It develops from the tissues that form the sympathetic nervous system. This is the part of the nervous system that regulates body functions, such as heart rate and blood pressure, digestion, and levels of certain hormones.\nMost neuroblastomas begin in the abdomen, in the adrenal gland, next to the spinal cord, or in the chest. Neuroblastomas can spread to the bones. Commonly affected bones include those in the face, skull, pelvis, shoulders, arms, and legs. It can also spread to the bone marrow, liver, lymph nodes, skin, and around the eyes (orbits).\nThe cause of the tumor is not known. Experts believe that a variant in a gene may play a role. Half of tumors are present at birth. Neuroblastoma is most commonly diagnosed in children before the age of 5 years. Each year, there are around 700 new cases in the United States."}

Half of tumors are present at birth. Neuroblastoma is most commonly diagnosed in children before the age of 5 years. Each year, there are around 700 new cases in the United States. The disorder is slightly more common in boys.\nIn most people, the tumor has spread when it is first diagnosed.\nSymptoms\nThe first symptoms are usually fever, a general sick feeling (\nmalaise\n), and pain. There may also be loss of appetite, weight loss, and diarrhea.\nOther symptoms depend on the site of the tumor, and may include:\nBone pain or tenderness\n(if the cancer has spread to the bones)\nDifficulty breathing or a chronic cough (if the cancer has spread to the chest)\nEnlarged abdomen (from a large tumor or excess fluid)\nFlushed, red skin\nPale skin and bluish color around the eyes\nProfuse sweating\nRapid heart rate (\ntachycardia\n)\nBrain and nervous system problems may include:\nInability to empty the bladder\nLoss of movement (\nparalysis\n) of the hips, legs, or feet\nProblems with balance\nUncontrolled eye movements\nor leg and feet movements (called opsoclonus-myoclonus syndrome, or \"dancing eyes and dancing feet\")\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine your child."}

These include:\nBone scan\nBone x-rays\nChest x-ray\nCT scan\nof chest and abdomen\nMRI scan\nof chest and abdomen\nOther tests that may be done include:\nBiopsy\nof the tumor\nBone marrow biopsy\nComplete blood count\n(CBC) showing\nanemia\nor other abnormality\nCoagulation studies and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (\nESR\n)\nHormone tests (blood tests to check levels of hormones such as\ncatecholamines\n)\nMIBG scan\n(imaging test to confirm the presence of neuroblastoma)\nUrine 24-hour test\nfor catecholamines, homovanillic acid (HVA), and vanillylmandelic acid (VMA)\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on:\nLocation of the tumor\nHow much and where"}

Often, though, other therapies are needed as well. Anticancer medicines (\nchemotherapy\n) may be recommended if the tumor has spread.\nRadiation therapy\nmay also be used.\nHigh-dose chemotherapy, autologous\nstem cell transplantation\n, and\nimmunotherapy\nare also used.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\ncancer support group\n. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you and your child not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome varies. In very young children, the tumor may go away on its own, without treatment. Or, the tissues of the tumor may mature and develop into a non-cancerous (benign) tumor called a\nganglioneuroma\n, which can be surgically removed. In other cases, the tumor spreads quickly.\nThe response to treatment also varies. Treatment is often successful if the cancer has not spread. If it has spread, neuroblastoma is harder to cure."}
