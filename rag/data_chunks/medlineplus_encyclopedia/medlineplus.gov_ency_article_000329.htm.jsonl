Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nType V glycogen storage disease\nType V glycogen storage disease\nType V (five) glycogen storage disease (GSD V) is a rare inherited condition in which the body is not able to break down glycogen. Glycogen is an important source of energy that is stored in all tissues, especially in the muscles and liver.\nGSD V is also called McArdle disease.\nCauses\nGSD V is caused by a flaw in the gene that makes an\nenzyme\ncalled muscle glycogen phosphorylase. As a result, the body cannot break down glycogen in the muscles.\nGSD V is an\nautosomal recessive\ngenetic disorder. This means to have the disorder, you must receive a copy of the nonworking gene from both parents. A person who receives a nonworking gene from only one parent usually does not develop this syndrome. A family history of GSD V increases the risk.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms commonly start during early childhood. But, it may be difficult to separate these symptoms from those of normal childhood."}
