Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCT angiography - abdomen and pelvis\nCT angiography - abdomen and pelvis\nCT angiography combines a CT scan with the injection of dye. This technique is able to create pictures of the blood vessels in your belly (abdomen) or pelvis area. CT stands for computed tomography.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner. Most often, you will lie on your back with your arms raised above your head.\nOnce you are inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you. Modern \"spiral\" scanners can perform the exam without stopping.\nA computer creates separate images of the belly area, called slices. These images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, or printed on film. Three-dimensional models of the belly area can be made by stacking the slices together.\nYou must be still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images."}

Three-dimensional models of the belly area can be made by stacking the slices together.\nYou must be still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time.\nThe scan should take less than 30 minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou need to have a special dye, called contrast, put into your body before some exams. Contrast helps certain areas show up better on the x-rays.\nContrast can be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. If contrast is used, you also may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.\nYou may also have to drink a different contrast before the exam. When you drink the contrast will depend on the type of exam being done. Contrast has a chalky taste, although some have flavors so that they taste a little better. The contrast will pass out of your body through your stools.\nLet your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast."}

The contrast will pass out of your body through your stools.\nLet your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test in order to safely receive this substance.\nBefore receiving the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes medicine metformin (Glucophage). People taking this medicine may have to stop taking it for a while before the test.\nThe contrast can worsen kidney function problems in patients with poorly functioning kidneys. Talk to your provider if you have a history of kidney problems.\nToo much weight can damage the scanner."}

Talk to your provider about this risk and the benefit of the test for getting a correct diagnosis of your medical problem. Most modern scanners use techniques to use less radiation.\nSome people have allergies to contrast dye. Let your provider know if you have ever had an allergic reaction to injected contrast dye.\nThe most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. If you have an iodine allergy, you may have\nnausea or vomiting\n,\nsneezing\n,\nitching\n, or\nhives\nif you get this type of contrast.\nIf you must be given such contrast, your provider may give you antihistamines (such as Benadryl) or steroids before the test.\nYour kidneys help remove iodine out of the body. You may need extra fluids after the test to help flush the iodine out of your body if you have kidney disease or diabetes.\nRarely, the dye may cause a life-threatening allergic response called\nanaphylaxis\n."}
