Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nContact dermatitis\nContact dermatitis\nContact dermatitis is a condition in which the skin becomes red, sore, or inflamed after direct contact with a substance.\nCauses\nThere are 2 types of contact dermatitis.\nIrritant dermatitis:\nThis is the most common type. It is not caused by an allergy, but rather the skin's reaction to irritating substances or friction. Irritating substances may include acids, alkaline materials such as soaps and\ndetergents\n, fabric softeners, solvents, or other chemicals. Very irritating chemicals may cause a reaction after just a short period of contact."}

However, you will form a reaction after future exposures. You may become more sensitive and develop a reaction if you use it regularly. It is possible to tolerate the substance for years or even decades before developing allergy. Once you develop an allergy you will be allergic for life.\nThe reaction most often occurs 24 to 48 hours after the exposure. The rash may persist for weeks after the exposure stops.\nSome products cause a reaction only when the skin is also exposed to sunlight (photosensitivity)."}

The same person may also have different symptoms over time.\nAllergic reactions may occur suddenly, or develop after months or years of exposure.\nContact dermatitis often occurs on the hands. Hair products, cosmetics, and perfumes can lead to skin reactions on the face, head, and neck. Jewelry can also cause skin problems in the area under it.\nItching is a common symptom.

Irritant dermatitis often shows as dry, red, and rough skin. Cuts (fissures) may form on the hands. Skin may become inflamed with long-term exposure.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will make the diagnosis based on how the skin looks and by asking questions about substances you may have come in contact with.\nAllergy testing\nwith skin patches (called patch testing) may be necessary to determine what is causing the reaction.

Patch testing is used for certain people who have long-term or repeated contact dermatitis. It requires at least 3 office visits and must be done by a provider with the skill to interpret the results correctly.\nOn the first visit, small patches of possible allergens are applied to the skin. These patches are removed at the second visit 48 hours later to see if a reaction has occurred.\nA third visit, about 2 days later, is done to look for any delayed reaction. For certain allergens such as metals, a final visit may be necessary on the 10th day.\nIf you have already tested a material on a small area of your skin and noticed a reaction, you should bring the material with you.\nOther tests may be used to rule out other possible causes, including\nskin lesion biopsy\nor culture of the\nskin lesion\n.\nTreatment\nYour provider will recommend treatment based on what is causing the problem. In some cases, the best treatment is to do nothing to the area.\nOften, treatment includes washing the area with a lot of water to get rid of any traces of the irritant that are still on the skin."}

They are a key part of preventing and treating irritant contact dermatitis.\nTopical corticosteroid medicines are commonly used to treat contact dermatitis.\nTopical means you place it on the skin. You will be prescribed a cream or ointment. Topical corticosteroids may also be called topical steroids or topical cortisones.\nDO NOT use more medicine or use it more often than your provider advises you to use it.\nYour provider may also prescribe other creams or ointments, such as tacrolimus or pimecrolimus, to use on the skin.\nIn severe cases, you may need to take corticosteroid pills.
