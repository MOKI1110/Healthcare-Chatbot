Pain due to muscles can also be felt in ligaments, tendons, and fascia. Fascias are the soft tissues that connect muscles, bones, and organs.\nConsiderations\nMuscle pain is most often related to tension, overuse, or muscle injury from exercise or hard physical work. The pain tends to involve specific muscles and starts during or just after the activity. It is often obvious which activity is causing the pain.\nMuscle pain also can be a sign of conditions affecting your whole body."}

Apply ice for the first 24 to 72 hours after injury to reduce pain, swelling, and inflammation. After that, heat often feels more soothing and may speed healing.\nMuscle aches from overuse and fibromyalgia often respond well to massage. Gentle stretching exercises after a long rest period are also helpful.\nRegular exercise can help restore proper muscle tone. Walking, cycling, and swimming are good aerobic activities to try. A physical therapist or athletic trainer can teach you stretching, toning, and aerobic exercises to help you feel better and stay pain-free. Begin slowly and increase workouts gradually. Avoid high-impact aerobic activities and weight lifting when injured or while in pain.\nBe sure to get plenty of sleep and try to reduce stress."}
