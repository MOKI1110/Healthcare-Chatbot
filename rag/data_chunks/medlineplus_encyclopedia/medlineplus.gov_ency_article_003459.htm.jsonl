You will need to\ncollect your urine over 24 hours\n. Your health care provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider will instruct you, if necessary, to stop medicines that may interfere with the test. These may include:\nBirth control pills that contain estrogen\nCertain antibiotics\nGlucocorticoids\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\n17-OHCS is a product formed when the liver and other body tissues break down the steroid hormone cortisol.\nThis test can help determine if the body is producing too much cortisol. The test may be used to diagnose\nCushing syndrome\n."}

This is a disorder that occurs when the body has a constant high level of cortisol.\nThe urine volume and urine creatinine are often done with 17-OHCS test at the same time. This helps the provider interpret the test.\nThis test is not done often now. The free\ncortisol urine test\nis a better screening test for Cushing disease.\nNormal Results\nNormal values:\nMale: 3 to 9 mg/24 hours (8.3 to 25  µmol/24 hours)\nFemale: 2 to 8 mg/24 hours (5.5 to 22  µmol/24 hours)\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}
