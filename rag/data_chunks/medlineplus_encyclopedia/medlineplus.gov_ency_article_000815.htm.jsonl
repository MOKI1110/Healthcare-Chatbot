As soon as these antigens enter the body, the immune system recognizes that they are not from that person's body and that they are foreign, and attacks them.\nWhen a person receives an organ from someone else during transplant surgery, that person's immune system may recognize that it is foreign."}

This is because the person's immune system detects that the antigens on the cells of the organ are different or not \"matched.\" Mismatched organs, or organs that are not matched closely enough, can trigger a\nblood transfusion reaction\nor transplant rejection.\nTo help prevent this reaction, health care providers type, or match both the organ donor and the person who is receiving the organ. The more similar the antigens are between the donor and recipient, the less likely that the organ will be rejected.\nTissue typing ensures that the organ or tissue is as similar as possible to the tissues of the recipient. The match is usually not perfect. No two people, except identical twins, have identical tissue antigens.\nProviders use medicines to suppress the recipient's immune system. The goal is to prevent the immune system from attacking the newly transplanted organ."}

The goal is to prevent the immune system from attacking the newly transplanted organ. If these medicines are not used, the body will almost always launch an immune response and destroy the foreign tissue.\nThere are some exceptions, though. Cornea transplants are rarely rejected because the cornea has no blood supply. Also, transplants from one identical twin to another are almost never rejected.\nThere are three types of rejection:\nHyperacute rejection occurs a few minutes after the transplant when the antigens are completely unmatched. The tissue must be removed right away so the recipient does not die. This type of rejection is seen when a recipient is given an organ that is a different blood type. For example, when a person is given an organ that is type A blood when he or she has type B blood.\nAcute rejection may occur any time from the first week after the transplant to 3 months afterward. All recipients have some amount of acute rejection.\nChronic rejection can take place over many years."}

Suppressing the immune response may prevent transplant rejection.\nMedicines will likely be used to suppress the immune response. Dosage and choice of medicines depends on your condition.
