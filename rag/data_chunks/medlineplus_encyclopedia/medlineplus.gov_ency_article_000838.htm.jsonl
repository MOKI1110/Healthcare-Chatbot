They feed on human blood and lay their eggs and deposit waste matter on the skin and clothing.\nLice die within 3 days at room temperature if they fall off a person into most areas of the environment. However, they can live in the seams of clothing for up to 1 month.\nYou can get body lice if you come in direct contact with someone who has lice. You can also get lice from infected clothing, towels, or bedding.\nBody lice are bigger than other types of lice.\nYou are more likely to get body lice if you do not bathe and wash your clothes often or live in close (overcrowded) conditions. Lice are unlikely to last if you:\nBathe regularly\nWash clothes and bedding at least once a week\nSymptoms\nLice cause severe itching. The itching is a reaction to the saliva from the insect's bite."}
