About one half of all women over the age of 50 will have a fracture of the hip, wrist, or vertebrae (bones of the spine) during their lifetime. Spine fractures are the most common.\nYour body needs the minerals calcium and phosphate to make and keep healthy bones.\nDuring your life, your body continues to both reabsorb old bone and create new bone.\nAs long as your body has a good balance of new and old bone, your bones stay healthy and strong.\nBone loss occurs when more old bone is reabsorbed than new bone is created.\nSometimes, bone loss occurs without any known cause. Other times, bone loss and thin bones run in families. In general, white, older women are the most likely to have bone loss.\nBrittle, fragile bones can be caused by anything that makes your body reabsorb too much bone, or keeps your body from making enough new bone."}

As you age, your body may reabsorb calcium and phosphate from your bones instead of keeping these minerals in your bones. This makes your bones weaker.\nWatch this video about:\nOsteoporosis\nA major risk factor is not consuming enough\ncalcium to build new bone tissue\n. It is important to eat/drink enough high-calcium foods. You also need vitamin D, because it helps your body absorb calcium. Your bones may become brittle and more likely to fracture if:\nIf you do not eat enough food with calcium and vitamin D\nYour body does not absorb enough calcium and vitamin D from your food, such as after\ngastric bypass surgery\nor due to other medical conditions\nOther\ncauses of bone loss\ninclude:\nA decrease in estrogen in women at the time of\nmenopause\nand a decrease in testosterone in men as they age\nBeing confined to a bed due to a prolonged illness (mostly affects bones in children)\nHaving certain medical conditions that cause increased inflammation in the body such as Crohn disease or rheumatoid ar"}

Many times, people will have a fracture before learning they have the disease.\nFractures of the bones of the spine can cause pain almost anywhere in the spine. These are called\ncompression fractures\n. They often occur without an injury. The pain may occur suddenly or slowly over time.\nThere can be a loss of height (as much as 6 inches or 15 centimeters) over time."}

A stooped posture or a condition called a dowager's hump may develop.\nExams and Tests\nDEXA scan\nis a low-radiation x-ray that measures the density of the minerals in your bones. Most often, it measures density in the spine and hip bones. Your health care provider uses this test to:\nDiagnose bone loss and osteoporosis.\nPredict your risk for future bone fractures.\nSee how well an osteoporosis medicine is working. (For this purpose, the DEXA scan is most often repeated every 2 years or longer.)\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force recommends this screening test at least once for women age 65 and older, and for some women younger than age 65 who have an increased risk for osteoporosis. So far, research does not show a need for repeating screening after the test at age 65.\nA simple spine or hip x-ray may show fracture or collapse of the spinal bones. However, simple x-rays of other bones are not very accurate in predicting whether you are likely to have osteoporosis."}

A low-radiation spine x-ray called a vertebral fracture assessment (VFA) can be done with a DEXA to better identify fractures that do not have any symptoms. Trabecular bone score (TBS) can also be performed to gauge bone quality and help evaluate fracture risk.\nYou may need blood and urine tests if your provider thinks the cause of your osteoporosis is a medical condition, rather than the slow bone loss that occurs with aging.\nDEXA scan results compare your bone mineral density with both a young adult who has no bone loss and with people your age and sex."}
