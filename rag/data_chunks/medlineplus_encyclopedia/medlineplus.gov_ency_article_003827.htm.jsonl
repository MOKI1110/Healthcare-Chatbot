Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPET scan\nPET scan\nA positron emission tomography (PET) scan is a type of imaging test. It uses a radioactive substance called a tracer to look for disease in the body.\nA PET scan shows how organs and tissues are working.\nThis is different than\nMRI\nand\nCT\nscans. These tests show the structure of, and blood flow to and from organs.\nMachines that combine the PET and CT images, called a PET/CT, are commonly used.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA PET scan uses a small amount of radioactive tracer. The tracer is given through a vein (IV). The needle is most often inserted on the inside of your elbow. The tracer travels through your blood and collects in organs and tissues. This helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly.\nYou will need to wait as the tracer is absorbed by your body. This takes about 1 hour.\nThen, you will lie on a narrow table that slides into a large tunnel-shaped scanner. The PET detects signals from the tracer. A computer changes the signals into 3D pictures."}

The PET detects signals from the tracer. A computer changes the signals into 3D pictures. The images are displayed on a monitor for your health care provider to read.\nYou must lie still during the test. Too much movement can blur images and cause errors.\nHow long the test takes depends on what part of the body is being scanned.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked not to eat anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan. You will be able to drink water but no other beverages including coffee. If you have diabetes, your provider will tell you not to take your diabetes medicine before the test. These medicines will interfere with the results.\nTell your provider if:\nYou are afraid of close spaces (have claustrophobia). You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious.\nYou are pregnant or think you might be pregnant.\nYou have any allergies to injected dye (contrast).\nAlways tell your provider about the medicines you are taking. Let your provider know about the medicines you bought without a prescription."}

The table may be hard or cold, but you can request a blanket or pillow.\nAn intercom in the room allows you to speak to someone at any time.\nThere is no recovery time, unless you were given a medicine to relax.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe most common use for a PET scan is for cancer, when it may be done:\nTo see how far cancer has spread."}

This helps to select the best treatment approach.\nTo check how well your cancer is responding, either during treatment or after treatment is completed.\nThis test can also be used to:\nCheck brain function  most often in people with symptoms of cognitive problems\nIdentify the source of epilepsy in the brain\nShow areas in which there is\npoor blood flow to the heart\nDetermine if a\nmass in your lung is cancerous or harmless\nNormal Results\nA normal result means there were no problems seen in the size, shape, or position of an organ. There are no areas in which the tracer has abnormally collected.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results depend on the part of the body being studied. Abnormal results may be due to:\nCancer\nInfection\nProblem with organ function\nRisks\nThe amount of radiation used in a PET scan is about the same amount as used in most CT scans. These scans use short-lived tracers, so the radiation is gone from your body in about 2 to 10 hours."}

These scans use short-lived tracers, so the radiation is gone from your body in about 2 to 10 hours. Having many x-rays, CT or PET scans over time may increase your risk for cancer. However, the risk from any one scan is small. You and your provider should weigh this risk against the benefits of getting a correct diagnosis for a medical problem.\nTell your provider before having this test if you are pregnant or breastfeeding. Infants and babies developing in the womb are more sensitive to radiation because their organs are still growing.\nRarely, people may have an allergic reaction to the tracer material. Some people have pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site.\nConsiderations\nIt is possible to have false results on a PET scan.\nBlood sugar\nor insulin levels may affect the test results in people with diabetes.\nMost PET scans are now performed along with a CT scan. This combination scan is called a PET/CT."}
