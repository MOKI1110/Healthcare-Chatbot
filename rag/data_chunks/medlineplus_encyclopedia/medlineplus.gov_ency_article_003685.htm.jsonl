TSIs are\nantibodies\nthat tell the thyroid gland to become more active and release excess amounts of thyroid hormone into the blood. A TSI test measures the amount of thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin in your blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is usually necessary.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain.

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour health care provider may recommend this test if you have signs or symptoms of an overactive thyroid (\nhyperthyroidism\n), including symptoms of:\nGraves disease\nToxic multinodular goiter\nThyroiditis (swelling and inflammation of the thyroid gland caused by an overactive immune system)\nThe test is also done during the last 3 months of pregnancy to predict Graves disease in the baby.\nThe TSI test is most commonly done if you have signs or symptoms of hyperthyroidism but are unable to have a test called\nthyroid uptake\nand\nscan\n.\nThis test is not commonly done because it is expensive. Most of the time, another test called TSH receptor antibody test is ordered instead.\nNormal Results\nNormal values are less than 130% of basal activity.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA higher-than-normal level may indicate:\nGraves disease (most common)\nHashitoxicosis (very rare)\nNeonatal thyrotoxicosis\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma\n(blood buildup under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nTSH receptor stimulating antibody; Thyroid stimulating immunoglobulin; Hypothyroidism - TSI; Hyperthyroidism - TSI; Goiter - TSI; Thyroiditis - TSI\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nGuber HA, Oprea M, Russell YX.
