This may be because:\nSound is not reaching the eardrum.\nThe eardrum is not vibrating in response to sound.\nThe 3 tiny bones of the ear (ossicles) are not conducting sound properly.\nCauses of conductive hearing loss can often be treated."}

Don't use sharp instruments to remove foreign objects.\nSee your provider for any other hearing loss.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nHearing problems interfere with your lifestyle.\nHearing problems do not go away or become worse.\nThe hearing is worse in one ear than the other.\nYou have sudden, severe hearing loss or ringing in the ears (tinnitus).\nYou have other symptoms, such as\near pain\n, along with hearing problems.\nYou have new headaches, weakness, or numbness anywhere on your body.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nThe provider will take your medical history and do a physical exam.\nTests that may be done include:\nAudiometric testing\n(hearing tests used to check the type and amount of hearing loss)\nCT\nor\nMRI scan of the head\n(if a t"}
