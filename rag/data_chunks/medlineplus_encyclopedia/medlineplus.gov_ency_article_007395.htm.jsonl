They often stick out and are blue in color.\nNormally, valves in your veins keep your blood flowing up toward the heart, so the blood does not collect in one place.\nThe valves in varicose veins have been damaged or are missing. This causes the veins to become filled with blood, especially when you are standing.\nThe following treatments for varicose veins can be done in a health care provider's office or clinic. You will receive local anesthesia to numb your leg. You will be awake, but will not feel pain.\nSclerotherapy\nworks best for spider veins. These are small varicose veins.\nSalt water (saline) or a chemical solution is injected into the varicose vein.\nThe vein will harden and then disappear.\nLaser treatment\ncan be used on the surface of the skin."}

Small bursts of light can make small varicose veins disappear.\nPhlebectomy\ntreats surface varicose veins. Very small cuts are made near the damaged vein. Then the vein is removed. One method uses a light under the skin to guide treatment.\nThis may be done along with other procedures, such as ablation.\nAblation\nuses intense heat to treat the vein. There are two methods. One uses radiofrequency energy and the other uses laser energy. During these procedures:\nYour provider will puncture the varicose vein.\nYour provider will thread a flexible tube (catheter) through the vein.\nThe catheter will send intense heat to the vein."}
