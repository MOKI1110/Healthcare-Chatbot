Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTensilon test\nTensilon test\nThe Tensilon test is a method to help diagnose\nmyasthenia gravis\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA medicine called Tensilon (also called edrophonium) is given during this test. Your health care provider gives the medicine through one of your veins (intravenously, through an IV). You may also be given a medicine called atropine before receiving Tensilon to reduce chances of side effects. Your heart rate may be monitored to make sure the medicine doesn't slow your heart down.\nYou will be observed for any improvement in strength from the medicine. Muscles that are weak will be tested before and right after the medicine is given. Any weak muscles are monitored, although the muscles of the eyes or face are most commonly tested.\nThe test may be repeated and you may have other Tensilon tests to help tell the difference between myasthenia gravis and other conditions.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is usually necessary."}

Follow your provider's instructions about how to prepare.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will feel a sharp prick as the IV needle is inserted. The medicine may cause a feeling of a churning of the stomach or a slight feeling of decreased heart rate, especially if atropine is not given first.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test helps:\nDiagnose myasthenia gravis\nTell the difference between myasthenia gravis and other similar brain and nervous system conditions\nMonitor treatment with oral anticholinesterase medicines\nThe test may also be done for conditions such as\nLambert-Eaton syndrome\n. This is a disorder in which faulty communication between nerves and muscles leads to muscle weakness.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIn many people with myasthenia gravis, the muscle weakness will improve right after receiving Tensilon. The improvement lasts only a few minutes."}

The improvement lasts only a few minutes. For some types of myasthenia, Tensilon may make the weakness worse.\nWhen the disease gets worse enough to cause significant weakness, there is a brief improvement in muscle strength.\nWhen there is an overdose of anticholinesterase (cholinergic crisis), Tensilon does not improve strength and may make the person even weaker.\nRisks\nThe medicine used during the test may cause side effects, including low heart rate, fainting, nausea, or breathing failure. This is why the test is done by a provider in a medical setting.\nAlternative Names\nMyasthenia gravis - Tensilon test; Edrophonium test\nImages\nMuscle fatigue\nReferences\nGuptill JT, Sanders DB.
