Calcium helps build strong bones and teeth. It is important for heart function, and helps with muscle contraction, nerve signaling, and blood clotting.\nSee also:\nCalcium - blood\nHow the Test is Performed\nA 24-hour urine sample is most often needed:\nOn day 1, urinate into the toilet when you wake up in the morning.\nCollect all urine (in a special container) for the next 24 hours.\nOn day 2, urinate into the container in the morning when you wake up.\nCap the container. Keep it in the refrigerator or a cool place during the collection period."}

Keep it in the refrigerator or a cool place during the collection period. Label the container with your name, the date, and the time you finish it, and return it as instructed.\nFor an infant, thoroughly wash the area where urine exits the body.\nOpen a urine collection bag (a plastic bag with an adhesive paper on one end).\nFor males, place the entire penis in the bag and attach the adhesive to the skin.\nFor females, place the bag over the labia.\nDiaper as usual over the secured bag.\nThis procedure may take a few tries. An active baby can move the bag, causing urine to go into the diaper. You may need extra collection bags.\nCheck the infant often and change the bag after the infant has urinated into it."}

If you are eating a diet low in calcium, the amount of calcium in the urine will be 50 to 150 mg/day or 1.25 to 3.75 mmol/24 hours.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nThe examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests."}
