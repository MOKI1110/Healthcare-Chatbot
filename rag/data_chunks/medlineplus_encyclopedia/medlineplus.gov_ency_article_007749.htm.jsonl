It causes skin to become thick and hard on the back of the neck, shoulders, arms, and upper back.\nCauses\nScleredema diabeticorum is thought to be a rare disorder, but some people think that the diagnosis is often missed. The exact cause is unknown. The condition tends to occur in men with poorly-controlled diabetes who:\nAre obese\nUse insulin\nHave poor blood sugar control\nHave other diabetes complications\nSymptoms\nSkin changes happen slowly. Over time, you may notice:\nThick, hard skin that feels smooth. You cannot pinch the skin over the upper back or neck.\nReddish, painless lesions.\nLesions occur on the same areas on both sides of the body (symmetrical).\nIn severe cases, thickened skin can make it hard to move the upper body."}
