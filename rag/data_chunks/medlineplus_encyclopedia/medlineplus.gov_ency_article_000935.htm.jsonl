These inner experiences often result in impulsive actions and chaotic relationships with other people.\nCauses\nThe cause of BPD is unknown. Genetic, family, and social factors are thought to play roles.\nRisk factors include:\nEither real or fear of abandonment in childhood or adolescence\nDisrupted family life\nPoor communication in the family\nSexual, physical, or emotional abuse\nBPD occurs equally in men and women, though women tend to seek treatment more often than men. Symptoms may get better in or after middle age.\nSymptoms\nPeople with BPD lack confidence in how they view themselves and how they are judged by others. As a result, their interests and values can change rapidly. They also tend to view things and people in terms of extremes, such as either all good or all bad. Their views of other people can change quickly."}
