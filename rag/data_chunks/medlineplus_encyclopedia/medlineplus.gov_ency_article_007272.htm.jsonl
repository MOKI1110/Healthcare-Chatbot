Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSerotonin syndrome\nSerotonin syndrome\nSerotonin syndrome (SS) is a potentially life-threatening drug reaction. It causes the body to have too much serotonin, a chemical produced by some nerve cells.\nCauses\nSS most often occurs when two or more medicines or drugs that affect the body's level of serotonin are taken together at the same time. The medicines cause too much serotonin to be released or to remain in the brain area.\nFor example, you can develop this syndrome if you take\nmigraine\nmedicines called triptans together with antidepressants called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), or selective serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SSNRIs).\nCommon SSRIs include:\nCitalopram (Celexa)\nEscitalopram (Lexapro)\nFluoxetine (Prozac)\nParoxetine (Paxil)\nSertraline (Zoloft)\nSSNRIs include:\nDesvenlafaxine (Pristiq)\nDuloxetine (Cymbalta)\nLevomilnacipran (Fetzima)\nMilnacipran (Savella)\nVenlafaxine (Effexor)\nCommon triptans include:\nAlmotriptan (Axert)\nEletriptan (Relpax)\nFrovatriptan (Frova)\nNaratriptan (Amerge)\nRizatriptan (Maxalt)\nSumatriptan (Im"}

It tells you about the potential risk of SS. However, do not stop taking your medicine. Talk to your health care provider about your concerns first.\nSS is more likely to occur when you first start taking or increase the dose of the medicine..\nOlder antidepressants called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) can also cause SS when combined with the medicines described above, as well as meperidine (Demerol, a painkiller), fentanyl, dextromethorphan (cough medicine), and others.\nStreet drugs, such as methamphetamine or other\namphetamines\n,\ncocaine\n, opiates, ecstasy,\nLSD\n, and others have also been associated with SS.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms occur within minutes to hours of taking medicines that can cause SS, and may include:\nAgitation or restlessness\nAbnormal eye movements\nDiarrhea\nFast heartbeat and high blood pressure\nHallucinations\nIncreased body temperature\nLoss of coordination\nNausea and"}

Untreated, SS can be deadly. With treatment, symptoms usually go away in less than 24 hours. Permanent organ damage may result, even with treatment.\nPossible Complications\nUncontrolled muscle spasms can cause severe muscle breakdown. The products produced when the muscles break down are released into the blood and eventually go through the kidneys. This can cause severe kidney damage if not recognized and treated properly.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider right away if you have symptoms of SS.\nPrevention\nAlways tell your providers which medicines you take."}
