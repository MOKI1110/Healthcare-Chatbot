The virus is found in their urine and feces, but it does not make the animal sick.\nIt is believed that humans can get sick with this virus if they breathe in contaminated dust from mice nests or droppings. You may come in contact with such dust when cleaning homes, sheds, or other enclosed areas that have been empty for a long time.\nHantavirus does not seem to spread from human to human.\nSymptoms\nThe early symptoms of hantavirus disease are similar to the flu and include:\nChills\nFever\nMuscle aches\nPeople with hantavirus may begin to feel better for a very short time. But within 1 to 2 days, it becomes hard to breathe. The disease gets worse quickly. Symptoms include:\nDry cough\nGeneral ill feeling (\nmalaise\n)\nHeadache\nNausea and vomiting\nShortness of breath\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

This may reveal:\nAbnormal lung sounds as a result of inflammation\nKidney failure\nLow blood pressure (\nhypotension\n)\nLow blood oxygen levels, which cause the skin to turn a blue color (\ncyanosis\n)\nThe following tests may be done:\nBlood tests to check for signs of hantavirus (presence of antibodies to the virus)\nComplete blood count\n(CBC) with\nwhite blood cell differential\nComprehensive metabolic panel\n(includes kidney and liver function tests)\nUrinalysis\nX-ray of the chest\nCT scan of the chest\nTreatment\nPeople with hantavirus are admitted to the hospital, often to the intensive care unit (ICU).\nTreatments include:\nOxygen\nBreathing tube or breathing machine (mechanical ventilation) in severe cases\nSpecial machines to add oxygen to the blood\nOther supportive care to treat symptoms\nThere are no antivirals that work against hantavirus.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHantavirus is a serious infection that gets worse quickly. Lung failure can occur and may lead to death."}

Clear out potential nesting sites and clean your kitchen.\nIf you must work in an area where contact with rodent urine or feces is possible, follow these recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC):\nWhen opening an unused cabin, shed, or other building, open all the doors and windows, leave the building, and allow the space to air out for 30 minutes.\nReturn to the building and spray the surfaces, carpet, and other areas with a disinfectant. Leave the building for another 30 minutes.\nSpray mouse nests and droppings with a 10% solution of chlorine bleach or similar disinfectant. Allow it to sit for 30 minutes. Using rubber gloves, place the materials in plastic bags. Seal the bags and throw them in the trash or an incinerator. Dispose of gloves and cleaning materials in the same way.\nWash all potentially contaminated hard surfaces with a bleach or disinfectant solution. Avoid vacuuming until the area has been thoroughly decontaminated."}
