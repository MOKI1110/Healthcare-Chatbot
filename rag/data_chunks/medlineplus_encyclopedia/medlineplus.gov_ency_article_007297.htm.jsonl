It can lead to other health problems, including diabetes, heart disease, and some cancers.\nCauses\nTaking in more calories than your body uses can lead to obesity. This is because your body stores unused calories as fat. Obesity can be caused by:\nEating more food than your body can use\nDrinking too much alcohol\nNot getting enough exercise\nMany people with obesity who lose large amounts of weight and gain it back think it is their fault. They blame themselves for not having the willpower to keep the weight off. Many people regain more weight than they lost.\nToday, we know that biology is a big reason why some people cannot keep the weight off. Some people who live in the same place and eat the same foods develop obesity, while others do not. Our bodies have a complex system to keep our weight at a healthy level."}

It affects what we eat, when we eat, and how much we eat.\nWe may feel that we are surrounded by things that make it easy to overeat and hard to stay active.\nMany people feel they do not have time to plan and make healthy meals.\nMany people do not have ready access to healthy foods making it difficult to plan and make healthy meals.\nMore people today work desk jobs compared to more active jobs in the past.\nPeople with little free time may have less time to exercise.\nThe term eating disorder means a group of medical conditions that have an unhealthy focus on eating, dieting, losing or gaining weight, and body image."}

Your provider can help you apply this information to your own health risks.\nFor example, the BMI at which the risk of heart and other illnesses goes up is 25 kg/m\n2\nin non-Hispanic Whites.

Even modest weight loss can improve your health. You may need a lot of support from family and friends.\nYour main goal should be to learn new,\nhealthy ways of eating\nand make them part of your daily routine.\nMany people find it hard to change their eating\nhabits and behaviors\n.

Your dietitian can teach you about:\nHealthy food choices at home and in\nrestaurants\nHealthy snacks\nReading\nnutrition labels\nand\nhealthy grocery shopping\nNew ways to prepare food\nPortion sizes\nSweetened drinks\nExtreme diets (fewer than 1,100 calories per day) are not thought to be safe or to work very well.
