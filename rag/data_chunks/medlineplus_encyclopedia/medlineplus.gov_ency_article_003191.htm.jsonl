It affects a specific location, such as the left side of the face, right arm, or even a small area such as the tongue. Speech, vision, and hearing problems are also considered focal neurological deficits.\nThe type, location, and severity of the problem can indicate which area of the brain or nervous system is affected.\nIn contrast, a non-focal problem is not specific to a certain area of the brain."}
