Bone marrow is the soft tissue inside bones that generates all blood components including white blood cells. Acute means the cancer develops quickly and myeloid refers to the type of white blood cells that become cancerous.\nBoth\nadults\nand children can get acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This article is about AML in children.\nCauses\nIn children, AML is rare.\nAML involves cells in the bone marrow that usually become certain types of white blood cells. These leukemia cells build up in the bone marrow and blood, leaving no space for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and\nplatelets\nto form. Because there are not enough healthy cells to do their jobs, children with AML are more likely to have:\nAnemia\n(low level of red blood cells)\nIncreased risk for bleeding and bruising\nInfections\nMost of the time, the cause of AML is unknown."}

This process uses high doses of chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy to treat the leukemia followed by transfusion of bone marrow from a compatible donor.\nSupportive care includes red blood cell and platelet (a blood element that helps to stop bleeding) transfusions.\nYour child's treatment team will explain the different options to you. You will want to take notes. Be sure to ask questions if you don't understand something.\nSupport Groups\nHaving a child with cancer can make you feel very alone.
