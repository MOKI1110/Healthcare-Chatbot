They look like the legs of a spider (arachnid).\nConsiderations\nLong, slender fingers can be normal and not associated with any medical problems. In some cases, however, \"spider fingers\" can be a sign of an underlying disorder.\nCauses\nCauses may include:\nHomocystinuria\nMarfan syndrome\nOther rare genetic disorders\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nSome children are born with arachnodactyly. It may become more evident over time. Talk to your health care provider if your child has long, slender fingers and you are concerned that an underlying condition may exist.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nThe provider will perform a physical exam. You will be asked questions about the medical history. This includes:\nWhen did you first notice the fingers being shaped like this?\nIs there any family history of early death? Is there any family history of known hereditary disorders?\nWhat other symptoms are present?"}
