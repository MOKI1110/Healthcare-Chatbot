Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAlanine transaminase (ALT) blood test\nAlanine transaminase (ALT) blood test\nThe alanine transaminase (ALT) blood test measures the level of the\nenzyme\nALT in the blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nALT is an enzyme found in a high level in the liver. An enzyme is a protein that causes a specific chemical change in the body.\nInjury to the liver results in release of ALT into the blood.\nThis test is mainly done along with other tests (such as\nAST\n,\nALP\n, and\nbilirubin\n) to diagnose and monitor\nliver disease\n.\nNormal Results\nThe normal range is 4 to 36 U/L (0.07 to 0.60  µkat/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples."}

Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn increased ALT level is often a sign of liver disease. Liver disease is even more likely when the levels of substances checked by other\nliver blood tests\nhave also increased.\nAn increased ALT level may be due to any of the following:\nScarring of the liver (\ncirrhosis\n)\nDeath of liver tissue\nSwollen and inflamed liver (\nhepatitis\n)\nToo much iron in the body (\nhemochromatosis\n)\nToo much fat in the liver (fatty liver)\nLack of blood flow to the liver (\nliver ischemia\n)\nLiver tumor or cancer\nUse of medicines and drugs that are toxic to the liver (such as alcohol or acetaminophen)\nMononucleosis\n(\"mono\")\nSwollen and inflamed pancreas (pancreatitis)\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
