Common causes of a weakened immune system include HIV/AIDS and having had an organ transplant (especially heart transplant).\nPrimary lymphoma of the brain may be linked to\nEpstein-Barr virus\n(EBV), especially in people with HIV/AIDS. EBV is the virus that causes\nmononucleosis\n.\nPrimary brain lymphoma is more common in people ages 45 to 70. The rate of primary brain lymphoma is rising."}

When treated with chemotherapy, half of the patients will be in remission 10 years after being diagnosed. Survival may improve with autologous stem cell transplant.\nPossible Complications\nPossible complications include:\nChemotherapy side effects, including low blood counts\nRadiation side effects, including confusion, headaches, nervous system (neurologic) problems, and tissue death\nReturn (recurrence) of the lymphoma\nAlternative Names\nBrain lymphoma; Cerebral lymphoma; Primary lymphoma of the central nervous system; PCNSL; Lymphoma - B-cell lymphoma, brain\nImages\nBrain\nMRI of the brain\nReferences\nNational Cancer Institute website.
