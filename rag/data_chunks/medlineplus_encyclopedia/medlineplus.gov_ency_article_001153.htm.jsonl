Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEsophagitis\nEsophagitis\nEsophagitis is a condition in which the lining of the esophagus becomes swollen, inflamed, or irritated. The esophagus is the tube that leads from your mouth to the stomach. It is also called the food pipe.\nCauses\nEsophagitis is often caused by stomach fluid that flows back into the food pipe. The fluid contains acid, which irritates the esophageal lining. This problem is called\ngastroesophageal reflux\n(GERD). An\nautoimmune and allergic disorder\ncalled eosinophilic esophagitis also causes this condition.\nThe following increase your risk for esophagitis:\nAlcohol use\nCigarette smoking\nSurgery or radiation to the chest (for example, treatment for lung cancer)\nTaking certain medicines such as alendronate, doxycycline, ibandronate, risedronate, tetracycline, potassium tablets, and vitamin C, without drinking plenty of water\nVomiting\nLying down after eating a large meal\nObesity\nPeople who have a weakened immune system may develop infections. Infections may lead to swelling of the food pipe."}

Infection may be due to:\nFungi or yeast (most often Candida)\nViruses, such as herpes or\ncytomegalovirus\nSymptoms\nThe infection or irritation may cause the food pipe to become inflamed. Sores called ulcers may form.\nSymptoms may include:\nCough\nDifficulty swallowing\nPainful swallowing\nHeartburn\n(acid reflux)\nHoarseness\nSore throat\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider may recommend the following tests:\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy\n(EGD), removing a piece of tissue from the food pipe for examination (\nbiopsy\n).\nUpper GI series\n(barium swallow x-ray).\npH testing. This test monitors for acid coming from the stomach into the esophagus. It can diagnose acid reflux as a cause of esophagitis.\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the cause."}

Common treatment options are:\nMedicines that reduce stomach acid in case of reflux disease\nAntibiotics, antifungals, and antivirals to treat different infections\nMedicines and diet changes to treat eosinophilic esophagitis\nMedicines to coat the lining of the food pipe to treat damage related to pills\nYou should stop taking medicines that damage the lining of the esophagus. Take your pills with plenty of water. Avoid lying down immediately after taking the pill.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost of the time, the disorders that cause swelling and inflammation of the food pipe, respond to treatment.\nPossible Complications\nIf not treated, this condition may cause severe discomfort. Scarring (stricture) of the food pipe may develop. This can cause swallowing problems.\nA condition called\nBarrett esophagus\n(BE) can develop after years of GERD."}
