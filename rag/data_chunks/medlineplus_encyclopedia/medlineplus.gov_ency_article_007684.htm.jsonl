It is used to treat adults who aren't healthy enough for regular valve surgery.\nThe aorta is a large artery that carries blood from your heart to the rest of your body. Blood flows out of your heart and into the aorta through a valve. This valve is called the aortic valve. It opens up so blood can flow out. It then closes, keeping blood from flowing backwards.\nAn aortic valve that does not open fully will restrict blood flow. This is called aortic stenosis. If there is also a leak that lets blood go back across the aortic valve, it is called aortic regurgitation. Most aortic valves are replaced because they restrict flow forward through the aorta to the brain and body.\nDescription\nThe procedure will be done in a hospital. It will take about 2 to 4 hours.\nBefore your TAVR procedure, you may receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n."}

It will take about 2 to 4 hours.\nBefore your TAVR procedure, you may receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n. This will put you in a pain-free sleep. Most often, the procedure is done with you heavily sedated. You are not completely asleep but you do not feel pain. This is called moderate sedation.\nIf general anesthesia is used, you will have a tube put down your throat connected to a machine to help you breathe. This is generally removed after the procedure. If moderate sedation is used, no breathing tube is needed.\nThe cardiologist will make a cut (incision) in an artery in your groin or in your chest near your breast bone.\nIf you don't already have a pacemaker, the cardiologist may put one in. You will wear it for 48 hours after the surgery. A pacemaker helps your heart beat in a regular rhythm.\nThe cardiologist will thread a thin tube called a catheter through the artery to your heart and aortic valve.\nA small balloon on the end of the catheter will be expanded in your aortic valve."}

This is called the valvuloplasty.\nThe cardiologist will then guide a new aortic valve over the catheter and balloon and place it in your aortic valve. A biological valve is used for TAVR.\nThe new valve will be opened inside the old valve. It will do the work of the old valve.\nThe cardiologist will remove the catheter and close the cut with stitches and a dressing.\nYou do not need to be on a heart-lung machine for this procedure.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nTAVR is used for people with severe aortic stenosis who aren't healthy enough to have\nopen chest surgery to replace a valve\n.\nIn adults, aortic stenosis is most often due to calcium deposits that narrow the valve."}

This generally affects older people.\nTAVR may be done for these reasons:\nYou are having major heart symptoms, such as chest pain (angina), shortness of breath, fainting spells (syncope), or heart failure.\nTests show that changes in your aortic valve are beginning to seriously harm how well your heart works.\nYou can't have regular valve surgery because it would put your health at risk. (Note: Studies are being performed to see whether more patients could be helped by the TAVR procedure.)\nThis procedure has many benefits. There is less pain, blood loss, and risk of infection."}

If untreated, these infections may spread to your heart or new heart valve.\nFor the 2-week period before surgery, you may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot."}

Ask your provider for help.\nAlways let your cardiologist know if you have a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or any other illness in the time leading up to your procedure.\nOn the day before your procedure, shower and shampoo well.
