Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPlatelet count\nPlatelet count\nA platelet count is a lab test to measure how many platelets you have in your blood. Platelets are particles in the blood that help the blood clot. They are smaller than red or white blood cells.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample is needed\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nMost of the time you do not need to take special steps before this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe number of platelets in your blood can be affected by many diseases. Platelets may be counted to monitor or diagnose diseases, or to look for the cause of too much bleeding or clotting.\nNormal Results\nThe normal number of platelets in the blood is 150,000 to 400,000 platelets per microliter (mcL) or 150 to 400 Ã 10\n9\n/L.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens."}

Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your health care provider about your test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nLOW PLATELET COUNT\nA low platelet count is below 150,000 (150 Ã 10\n9\n/L). If your platelet count is below 50,000 (50 Ã 10\n9\n/L), your risk for bleeding is higher. Even every day activities can cause bleeding.\nA lower-than-normal platelet count is called\nthrombocytopenia\n. Low platelet count can be divided into 3 main causes:\nNot enough platelets are being made in the bone marrow\nPlatelets are being destroyed in the bloodstream\nPlatelets are being destroyed in the spleen or liver\nThree of the more common causes of this problem are:\nCancer treatments, such as\nchemotherapy\nor\nradiation\nMedicines\nAutoimmune disorders\n, in which the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue, such as platelets\nIf your platelet count is low, talk to your provider about how to prevent bleeding and what to do if you are bleeding.\nHIGH PLATELET COUNT\nA high platelet count is 400,000 (400 Ã 10\n9\n/L) or"}

It means your body is making too many platelets. Causes may include:\nIron deficiency\nAfter certain infections, major surgery or trauma\nCancer\nCertain medicines\nBone marrow disease called myeloproliferative neoplasm (which includes\npolycythemia vera\n)\nSpleen removal (splenectomy)\nSome people with high platelet counts may be at risk for forming\nblood clots\nor even bleeding too much if the platelet count is extremely high. Blood clots can lead to serious medical problems.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other."}
