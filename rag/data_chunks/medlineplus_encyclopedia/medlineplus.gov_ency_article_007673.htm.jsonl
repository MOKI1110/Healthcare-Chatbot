This can be a lump, sore, or an area of skin that is not normal. It may also be a skin cancer.\nSkin lesion removal is a procedure to remove the lesion.\nDescription\nMost lesion removal procedures are easily done in your health care provider's office or an outpatient medical office. You may need to see your primary care provider, a skin specialist (dermatologist), or a surgeon.\nWhich procedure you have depends on the location, size, and type of lesion. The removed lesion is usually sent to the lab where it is examined under a microscope.\nYou may receive some type of numbing medicine (anesthetic) before the procedure.\nThe different types of skin removal techniques are described below.\nSHAVE EXCISION\nThis technique is used for skin lesions that rise above the skin or are in the upper layer of skin.\nYour provider uses a small blade to remove the outermost layers of skin after the area is made numb."}

The area removed includes all or part of the lesion.\nYou usually do not need stitches. At the end of the procedure, medicine is applied to the area to stop any bleeding. Or the area may be treated with cautery to seal blood vessels shut. Neither of these will hurt.\nSIMPLE SCISSOR EXCISION\nThis technique is also used for skin lesions that rise above the skin or are in the upper layer of skin..\nYour provider will grab the skin lesion with small forceps and lightly pull up. Small, curved scissors will be used to carefully cut around and under the lesion. A curette (an instrument used to clean or scrape skin) maybe used to cut any remaining parts of the lesion.\nYou will rarely need stitches. At the end of the procedure, medicine is applied to the area to stop any bleeding. Or the area may be treated with cautery to seal blood vessels shut.\nSKIN EXCISION - FULL THICKNESS\nThis technique involves removing a skin lesion in the deeper levels of the skin down to the fatty layer under the skin."}

A small amount of normal tissue surrounding the lesion may be removed to ensure it is clear of any possible cancer cells (clear margins). It is more likely to be done when there is a concern about a skin cancer.\nMost often, an area the shape of an ellipse (like an American football) is removed, as this makes it easier to close with stitches.\nThe entire lesion is removed, going as deep as the fat, if needed, to get the whole area. A margin of about 3 to 4 millimeters (mm) or more surrounding the tumor may also be removed to ensure clear margins.\nThe area is closed with stitches. If a large area is removed, a skin graft or flap of normal skin may be used to replace the skin that was removed.\nCURETTAGE AND ELECTRODESICCATION\nThis procedure involves scraping or scooping out a skin lesion."}

A technique that uses high frequency electrical current, called electrodesiccation, may be used before or after.\nIt may be used for superficial lesions that do not need a full thickness excision.\nLASER EXCISION\nA laser is a light beam that can be focused on a very small area and can treat very specific types of cells. The laser heats the cells in the area being treated until they \"burst.\" There are several types of lasers. Each laser has specific uses.\nLaser excision\ncan remove:\nBenign or pre-malignant skin lesions\nWarts\nMoles\nSunspots\nHair\nSmall blood vessels in the skin\nTattoos\nCRYOTHERAPY\nCryotherapy\nis a method of super-freezing tissue in order to destroy it. It is most commonly used to destroy or remove warts, actinic keratoses, seborrheic keratoses, and molluscum contagiosum.\nCryotherapy is done using either a cotton swab that has been dipped into liquid nitrogen, with a spray canister containing liquid nitrogen, or with or a probe that has liquid nitrogen flowing through it."}

The procedure usually takes less than a minute.\nThe freezing may cause some discomfort. Your provider may apply a numbing medicine to the area first. After the procedure, the treated area may blister and the destroyed lesion will peel away.\nMOHS SURGERY\nMohs surgery\nis a way to treat and cure certain skin cancers. Surgeons trained in the Mohs procedure can do this surgery. It is a skin-sparing technique that allows skin cancer to be removed with less damage to the healthy skin around it.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nIt may be done to improve a person's appearance, or if the lesion is causing irritation or discomfort.\nYour provider may recommend having a lesion removed if you have:\nBenign growths\nWarts\nMoles\nSkin tags\nSeborrheic keratosis\nActinic keratosis\nSquamous cell carcinoma\nBowen disease\nBasal cell carcinoma\nMolluscum contagiosum\nMelanoma\nOther skin conditions\nRisks\nRisks of a skin excision may include:\nInfection\nScar (keloids)\nBleeding\nChanges in skin color\nPoor wound healing\nN"}
