Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSialogram\nSialogram\nA sialogram is an\nx-ray\nof the salivary ducts and glands.\nThe salivary glands are located on each side of the head, in the cheeks just in front of the ears, and under the jaw. They release saliva into the mouth.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is performed in a hospital radiology department or a radiology facility. The test is done by an x-ray technician. A radiologist interprets the results. You may be given a medicine to make you calm before the procedure.\nYou will be asked to lie on your back on the x-ray table. An x-ray is taken before the contrast material is injected to check for blockages that might prevent the contrast material from entering the ducts.\nA catheter (a small flexible tube) is inserted through your mouth and into the duct of the salivary gland. A special dye (contrast medium) is then injected into the duct. This allows the duct to show up on the x-ray. X-rays will be taken from several positions. The sialogram may be performed along with a\nCT scan\n.\nYou may be given lemon juice to help you produce saliva."}

The x-rays are then repeated to examine the drainage of the saliva into the mouth.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nTell the health care provider if you are:\nPregnant\nAllergic to x-ray contrast material or any iodine substance\nAllergic to any medicines\nYou must sign a consent form. You will need to rinse your mouth with germ-killing (antiseptic) solution before the procedure.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel some discomfort or pressure when the contrast material is injected into the ducts. The contrast material may taste unpleasant.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA sialogram may be done when your provider thinks you might have a disorder of the salivary ducts or glands.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may suggest:\nNarrowing of the salivary ducts\nSalivary gland infection\nor inflammation\nSalivary duct stones\nSalivary duct tumor\nRisks\nThere is low radiation exposure. X-rays are monitored and regulated to provide the minimum amount of radiation exposure needed to produce the image."}
