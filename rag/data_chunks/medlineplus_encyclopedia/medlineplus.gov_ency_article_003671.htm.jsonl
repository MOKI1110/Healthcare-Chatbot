Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase test\nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase test\nGlucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) is a protein that helps red blood cells work properly. The G6PD test looks at the amount (activity) of this substance in red blood cells.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is usually necessary.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour health care provider may recommend this test if you have signs of\nG6PD deficiency\n. This means you do not have enough G6PD activity.\nToo little G6PD activity leads to the destruction of red blood cells. This process is called\nhemolysis\n."}

This means you do not have enough G6PD activity.\nToo little G6PD activity leads to the destruction of red blood cells. This process is called\nhemolysis\n. When this process is actively occurring, it is called a hemolytic episode.\nHemolytic episodes can be triggered by infections, certain foods (such as fava beans),  and certain medicines, including the following medicines. This list does not include all possible medicines:\nMedicines used to reduce fever\nNitrofurantoin\nPhenacetin\nPrimaquine\nSulfonamides\nThiazide diuretics\nQuinidine\nNormal Results\nNormal values vary and depend upon the laboratory used.  Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results mean you have a G6PD deficiency. This can cause\nhemolytic anemia\nin certain conditions.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
