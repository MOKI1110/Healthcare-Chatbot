Some primary brain tumors are related to other syndromes or can run in a family. They can be:\nNot cancerous (benign)\nInvasive (spread to nearby areas)\nCancerous (malignant)\nBrain tumors are classified based on:\nThe exact site of the tumor\nThe type of tissue involved\nWhether it is cancerous\nBrain tumors can directly kill brain cells. They can also damage cells by pushing on other parts of the brain. This leads to swelling and increased pressure inside the skull.\nTumors can occur at any age. Many tumors are more common at a certain age. In general, brain tumors in children are very rare.\nCOMMON TUMOR TYPES\nAstrocytomas\nare usually noncancerous, slow-growing tumors. They most often develop in children ages 5 to 8."}

In general, brain tumors in children are very rare.\nCOMMON TUMOR TYPES\nAstrocytomas\nare usually noncancerous, slow-growing tumors. They most often develop in children ages 5 to 8. Also called low-grade gliomas, these are the most common brain tumors in children.\nMedulloblastomas\nare the most common type of childhood brain cancer. Most medulloblastomas occur before age 10.\nEpendymomas\nare a type of childhood brain tumor that can be benign or malignant. Therapy to control the tumor is based on the location and type of ependymoma.\nBrainstem gliomas\nare very rare tumors that occur almost only in children. The average age at which they develop in children is about age 6.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may be subtle and slowly become worse, or they may occur very quickly.\nHeadaches are often the most common symptom. But only very rarely do children with headaches have a tumor."}

But only very rarely do children with headaches have a tumor. Headache patterns that may occur with brain tumors include:\nHeadaches that are worse when waking up in the morning and go away within a few hours\nHeadaches that get worse with coughing or exercise, or with a change in body position\nHeadaches that occur while sleeping and with at least one other symptom such as vomiting or confusion\nSometimes, the only symptoms of brain tumors are mental changes, which may include:\nChanges in personality and behavior\nUnable to concentrate\nIncreased sleep\nMemory loss\nProblems with reasoning\nOther possible symptoms are:\nSeizures\nUnexplained frequent vomiting\nGradual loss of movement or feeling in an arm or leg\nHearing loss with or without dizziness\nSpeech difficulty\nUnexpected vision problem (if it occurs with a headache), including vision loss (peripheral vision) in one or both eyes, or double vision\nProblems with balance\nWeakness or numbness\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

The goals of treatment may be to cure the tumor, relieve symptoms, and improve brain function or the child's comfort.\nSurgery is needed for most primary brain tumors. Some tumors may be completely removed."}

In cases where the tumor can't be removed, surgery may help reduce pressure and relieve symptoms.\nChemotherapy\nor\nradiation therapy\nmay be used for certain tumors.\nThe following are treatments for specific types of tumors:\nAstrocytoma: Surgery to remove the tumor is the main treatment. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy may also be needed.\nBrainstem gliomas: Surgery may not be possible because of the tumor's location deep in the brain. Radiation is used to shrink the tumor and prolong life. Sometimes\ntargeted chemotherapy\ncan be used.\nEpendymomas: Treatment includes surgery. Radiation and chemotherapy may be necessary.\nMedulloblastomas: Surgery alone does not cure this type of tumor."}
