Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nThoracic spine x-ray\nThoracic spine x-ray\nA thoracic spine x-ray is an x-ray of the 12 chest (thoracic) bones (vertebrae) of the spine. The vertebrae are separated by flat pads of cartilage called disks that provide a cushion between the bones.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is done in a hospital radiology department or in your health care provider's office. You will lie on the x-ray table in different positions. If the x-ray is checking for an injury, care will be taken to prevent further injury.\nThe x-ray machine will be moved over the thoracic area of the spine. You will hold your breath as the picture is taken so that the picture will not be blurry. Usually, 2 or 3 x-ray views are needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nTell your provider if you are pregnant. Also tell your provider if you have had surgery in your chest, abdomen, or pelvis.\nRemove all jewelry.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test causes no discomfort."}

X-rays are monitored and regulated to provide the minimum amount of radiation exposure needed to produce the image. Most experts feel that the risk is low compared with the benefits.\nPregnant women and children are more sensitive to the risks of x-rays.\nConsiderations\nThe x-ray will not detect problems in the muscles, nerves, and other soft tissues, because these problems cannot be seen well on an x-ray.\nAlternative Names\nVertebral radiography; X-ray - spine; Thoracic x-ray; Spine x-ray; Thoracic spine films; Back films\nImages\nSkeletal spine\nVertebra, thoracic (mid back)\nVertebral column\nIntervertebral disk\nAnterior skeletal anatomy\nReferences\nPreston-Suni K, Kaji AH.
