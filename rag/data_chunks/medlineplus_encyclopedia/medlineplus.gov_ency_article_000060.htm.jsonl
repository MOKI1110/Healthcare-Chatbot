The skull provides good protection for the brain. However, a severe impact or blow can cause the skull to break. It may be accompanied by a\nconcussion\nor other injury to the brain.\nThe brain can be affected directly by damage to the nervous system tissue and bleeding. The brain can also be affected by bleeding under the skull."}

The brain can also be affected by bleeding under the skull. This can compress the underlying brain tissue.\nA simple fracture is a break in the bone without damage to the skin.\nA linear skull fracture is a break in a cranial bone resembling a thin line, without splintering, depression, or distortion of bone.\nA depressed skull fracture is a break in a cranial bone (or \"crushed\" portion of skull) with depression of the bone in toward the brain.\nA compound fracture involves a break in, or loss of, skin and splintering of the bone.\nCauses\nCauses of skull fracture can include:\nHead trauma\nFalls, automobile accidents, physical assault, and sports\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nBleeding from wound, ears, nose, or around eyes\nBruising\nbehind the ears or under the eyes\nChanges in pupils (\nsizes unequal\n, not reactive to light)\nConfusion\nConvulsions (\nseizures\n)\nDifficulties with balance\nDrainage of clear or bloody fluid from ears or nose\nDrowsiness\nHeadache\nLoss of consciousness (unresponsiveness)\nNausea and vomiting\nRestlessness\n, irritability\nSlurred s"}

A bump or bruise may take up to 24 hours to develop.\nFirst Aid\nTake the following steps if you think someone has a skull fracture:\nCheck the airways, breathing, and circulation. If necessary, begin rescue breathing and CPR.\nAvoid moving the person (unless absolutely necessary) until medical help arrives. Have someone call 911 or the local emergency number for medical assistance.\nIf the person must be moved, take care to stabilize the head and neck. Place your hands on both sides of the head and under the shoulders. Do not allow the head to bend forward or backward, or to twist or turn.\nCarefully check the site of injury, but do not probe in or around the site with a foreign object."}

It can be hard to know if the skull is fractured or depressed (dented in) at the site of injury.\nIf there is bleeding, apply firm pressure with a clean cloth over a broad area to control blood loss, but do not apply pressure directly onto a suspected skull fracture.\nIf blood soaks through, do not remove the original cloth. Instead, apply more cloths on top, and continue to apply pressure.\nIf the person is vomiting, stabilize the head and neck, and carefully turn the victim to the side to prevent choking on vomit.\nIf the person is conscious and experiencing any of the previously listed symptoms, transport to the nearest emergency medical facility (even if the person does not think medical help is needed).\nDO NOT\nFollow these precautions:\nDo not move the person unless absolutely necessary."}
