Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\n5'-nucleotidase\n5'-nucleotidase\n5'-nucleotidase (5'-NT) is an enzyme (a type of protein) produced by the liver. A test can be done to measure the amount of this protein in your blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nBlood is drawn from a vein\n. You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour health care provider may tell you to stop taking some medicines that could interfere with the test. Medicines that may affect results include:\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol)\nHalothane\nIsoniazid\nMethyldopa\nNitrofurantoin\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order this test if you have blood test results that may be due to a liver problem. It is used mostly to tell if the blood test results are due to liver damage or skeletal muscle damage.\nNormal Results\nThe normal value is 2 to 15 IU/L.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs."}
