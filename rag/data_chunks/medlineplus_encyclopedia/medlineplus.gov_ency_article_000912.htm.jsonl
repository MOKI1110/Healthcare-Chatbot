Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFibrocystic breasts\nFibrocystic breasts\nFibrocystic breasts are painful, lumpy breasts. Formerly called fibrocystic breast disease, this common condition is, in fact, not a disease. Many women experience these normal breast changes, usually around their period.\nCauses\nFibrocystic breast changes\noccur when thickening of breast tissue (fibrosis) and fluid-filled cysts\ndevelop in one or both breasts. It is thought that hormones made in the ovaries\nduring menstruation can trigger these breast changes. This may make your\nbreasts feel swollen, lumpy, or painful before or during your period each\nmonth.\nMore than half of women\nhave this condition at some time during their life. It is most common between\nthe ages of 30 and 50. It is rare in women after menopause unless they are\ntaking estrogen. Fibrocystic breast changes do not change your risk for breast\ncancer.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms are more often worse right before your menstrual period. They tend to get better after your period starts.\nIf you have heavy, irregular periods, your symptoms may be worse."}

They tend to get better after your period starts.\nIf you have heavy, irregular periods, your symptoms may be worse. If you take birth control pills, you may have fewer symptoms. In most cases, symptoms get better after menopause.\nSymptoms may include:\nPain or discomfort in both breasts that may come and go with your period, but may also last through the whole month\nBreasts that feel full, swollen, or heavy\nPain or discomfort under the arms\nBreast lumps that change in size with the menstrual period\nYou may have a lump in the same area of the breast that becomes larger before each period and returns to its original size afterward. This type of lump moves when it is pushed with your fingers. It does not feel stuck or fixed to the tissue around it. This type of lump is common with fibrocystic breasts.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you. This will include a breast exam. Tell your provider if you have noticed any breast changes.\nMammography\nis performed to screen women to detect early breast cancer when it is more likely to be cured."}

Tell your provider if you have noticed any breast changes.\nMammography\nis performed to screen women to detect early breast cancer when it is more likely to be cured. The recommendations of different expert organizations can differ.\nMammography is generally recommended for all women starting at age 40, repeated every 1 to 2 years.\nWomen with a family history of breast cancer should work with their provider to assess their risk of breast cancer. In some situations, additional testing may be considered.\nMammograms have clear benefit for health by finding work best at finding early stage breast cancer in women ages 40 to 74. It is important to note that all women, including those with dense breasts, should be screened starting at age 40. It is unclear if mammograms benefit women ages 75 and older.\nFor women under 35, a\nbreast ultrasound\nmay be used to look more closely at breast tissue. You may need further tests if a lump was found during a breast exam or your imaging result was abnormal.\nIf the lump appears to be a cyst, your provider may aspirate the lump with a needle, which confirms the lump was a cyst and sometimes may improve the symptoms."}

For other types of lumps, additional imaging may be done. If these exams are normal, but your provider still has concerns about a lump, a\nbiopsy\nmay be performed.\nTreatment\nWomen who have no symptoms or only mild symptoms do not need treatment.\nYour provider may recommend the following self-care measures:\nTake over-the-counter medicine, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain\nApply heat or ice on the breast\nWear a well-fitting supportive bra, such as a sports bra\nSome women believe that eating less fat, caffeine, or chocolate helps with their symptoms. There is no clear evidence that these measures help large numbers of women.\nVitamin E, thiamine, magnesium, and evening primrose oil are not harmful in most cases. Studies have not shown these to be helpful. Talk with your provider before taking any medicine or supplement.\nFor more severe symptoms, your provider may prescribe hormones, such as\nbirth control pills\nor other medicine. Take the medicine exactly as instructed."}

However, a lump that stays the same throughout your menstrual cycle is considered suspicious. In this case, your provider may recommend a core needle biopsy. In this test, a small amount of tissue is removed from the lump and examined under a microscope.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf your breast exams and mammograms are normal, you do not need to worry about your symptoms. Fibrocystic breast changes do not generally increase your risk for breast cancer. However, if you have a family history of breast cancer and fibrocystic changes, there is a small increase in the risk."}
