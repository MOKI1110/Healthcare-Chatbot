It is also called tinea capitis.\nRelated ringworm infections may be found:\nIn a man's beard\nIn the groin (\njock itch\n)\nBetween the toes (\nathlete's foot\n)\nOther places on the skin\nCauses\nFungi are germs that can live on the dead tissue of the hair, nails, and outer skin layers. Ringworm of the scalp is caused by mold-like fungi called dermatophytes.\nThe fungi grow well in warm, moist areas. A tinea infection is more likely if you:\nHave minor skin or scalp injuries\nDo not bathe or wash your hair often\nHave wet skin for a long time (such as from sweating)\nRingworm can spread quickly. It most often affects children and goes away at puberty. However, it can occur at any age.\nYou can catch ringworm if you come into direct contact with an area of ringworm on someone else's body. You can also get it if you touch items such as combs, hats, or clothing that have been used by someone with ringworm."}

You will need to take the medicine for 4 to 8 weeks.\nSteps you can do at home include:\nKeeping your scalp clean.\nWashing with a medicated shampoo, such as one that contains ketoconazole or selenium sulfide. Shampooing may slow or stop the spread of infection, but it does not get rid of ringworm.\nOther family members and pets should be examined and treated, if necessary.\nOther children in the home may want to use the shampoo 2 to 3 times a week for about 6 weeks.\nAdults only need to wash with the shampoo if they have signs of tinea capitis or ringworm.\nOnce the shampoo has been started:\nWash towels in hot, soapy water and dry them using the hottest heat recommended on the care label. This should be done each time the towels are used by someone who is infected.\nSoak combs and brushes for 1 hour a day in a mixture of 1 part bleach to 10 parts water."}
