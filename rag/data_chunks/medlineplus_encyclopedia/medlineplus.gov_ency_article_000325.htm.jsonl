Most of the time, a small tumor (gastrinoma) in the pancreas or small intestine is the source of the extra gastrin in the blood.\nCauses\nZollinger-Ellison syndrome is caused by tumors called gastrinomas. These growths are most often found in the head of the pancreas and the upper small intestine. High levels of gastrin cause production of too much stomach acid.\nGastrinomas may occur as single tumors or several tumors. One half to two thirds of single gastrinomas are cancerous (malignant) tumors. These tumors often spread to the liver and nearby lymph nodes.\nMany people with gastrinomas have several tumors as part of a condition called\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia type I\n(MEN I)."}

These tumors often spread to the liver and nearby lymph nodes.\nMany people with gastrinomas have several tumors as part of a condition called\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia type I\n(MEN I). Tumors may develop in the pituitary gland (brain) and parathyroid gland (neck) as well as in the pancreas.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nAbdominal pain\nDiarrhea\nVomiting blood\n(sometimes)\nSevere esophageal reflux (\nGERD\n) symptoms\nSigns include ulcers in the stomach and small intestine.\nExams and Tests\nTests include:\nAbdominal CT scan\nCalcium infusion test\nEndoscopic ultrasound\nExploratory surgery\nGastrin blood level\nOctreotide scan\nSecretin stimulation test\nTreatment\nMedicines called proton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, lansoprazole, and others) are used for treating this problem. These medicines reduce acid production by the stomach. This helps the ulcers in the stomach and small intestine heal. These medicines also relieve abdominal pain and diarrhea.\nSurgery to remove a single gastrinoma may be done if the tumors have not spread to other organs."}

Surgery on the stomach (gastrectomy) to control acid production is rarely needed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe cure rate is low, even when it is found early and the tumor is removed. However, gastrinomas grow slowly. People with this condition may live for many years after the tumor is found. Acid-suppressing medicines work well to control the symptoms.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nFailure to locate the tumor during surgery\nIntestinal bleeding or hole (perforation) from ulcers in the stomach or\nduodenum\nSevere diarrhea and\nweight loss\nSpread of the tumor to other organs\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have severe abdominal pain that does not go away, especially if it occurs with diarrhea.\nAlternative Names\nZ-E syndrome; Gastrinoma; ZES\nImages\nEndocrine glands\nReferences\nDe Herder WW, Feelders RA, Hofland J.
