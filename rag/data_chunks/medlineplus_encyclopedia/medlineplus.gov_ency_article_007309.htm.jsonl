Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBilirubin encephalopathy\nBilirubin encephalopathy\nBilirubin encephalopathy is a rare neurological condition that occurs in some\nnewborns with severe jaundice\n.\nCauses\nBilirubin encephalopathy (BE) is caused by very high levels of bilirubin. Bilirubin is a yellow pigment that is created as the body gets rid of old red blood cells. High levels of bilirubin in the body can cause the skin to look yellow (jaundice).\nIf the level of bilirubin is very high or a baby is very ill, the substance will move out of the blood and collect in the brain tissue if it is not bound to albumin (protein) in the blood. This can lead to problems such as brain damage and hearing loss. The term \"kernicterus\" refers to the yellow staining caused by bilirubin. This is seen in parts of the brain on autopsy.\nThis condition most often develops in the first week of life, but may be seen up until the third week. Some newborns with\nRh hemolytic disease\nare at high risk for severe jaundice that can lead to this condition."}

Rarely, BE can develop in seemingly healthy babies.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms depend on the stage of BE. Not all babies with kernicterus on autopsy have had definite symptoms.\nEarly stage:\nExtreme jaundice\nAbsent startle reflex\nPoor feeding or sucking\nExtreme sleepiness (lethargy) and low muscle tone (hypotonia)\nMiddle stage:\nHigh-pitched cry\nIrritability\nMay have arched back with neck hyperextended backwards, high muscle tone (hypertonia)\nPoor feeding\nLate stage:\nStupor or coma\nNo feeding\nShrill cry\nMuscle rigidity, markedly arched back with neck hyperextended backwards\nSeizures\nExams and Tests\nA blood test will show a high bilirubin level (greater than 20 to 25 mg/dL). However, there is not a direct link between bilirubin level and degree of injury.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}

Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on how old the baby is (in hours) and whether the baby has any risk factors (such as prematurity). It may include:\nLight therapy (phototherapy)\nExchange transfusions (removing the child's blood and replacing it with fresh donor blood or plasma)\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nBE  is a serious condition. Many infants with late-stage nervous system complications die.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nPermanent brain damage\nHearing loss\nDeath\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nGet medical help right away if your baby has signs of this condition.\nPrevention\nTreating jaundice or conditions that may lead to it can help prevent this problem. Infants with the first signs of jaundice have bilirubin level measured within 24 hours."}

Infants with the first signs of jaundice have bilirubin level measured within 24 hours. If the level is high, the infant should be screened for diseases that involve the destruction of red blood cells (hemolysis).\nAll newborns have a follow-up appointment within 2 to 3 days after leaving the hospital. This is very important for late preterm or early term babies (born more than 2 to 3 weeks before their due date).\nAlternative Names\nBilirubin-induced neurologic dysfunction (BIND); Kernicterus\nPatient Instructions\nNewborn jaundice - discharge\nImages\nKernicterus\nReferences\nHamati AI, Felker MV.
