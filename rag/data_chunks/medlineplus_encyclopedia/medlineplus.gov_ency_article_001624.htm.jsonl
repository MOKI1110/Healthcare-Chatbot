The nerves themselves are healthy.\nPeople who have this problem often have\nprogressive supranuclear palsy\n(PSP). This is a disorder that affects the way the brain controls movement, including eye movement.\nOther disorders that have been associated with this condition include:\nInflammation of the brain (\nencephalitis\n)\nDisease that causes areas deep in the brain, just above the spinal cord, to shrink (\nolivopontocerebellar atrophy\n)\nDisease of the nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord that control voluntary muscle movement (for example,\namyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n)\nCondition that also causes malabsorption disorder of the small intestine as well as other symptoms (\nWhipple disease\n)\nSymptoms\nPeople with supranuclear ophthalmoplegia are unable to move their eyes at will i"}
