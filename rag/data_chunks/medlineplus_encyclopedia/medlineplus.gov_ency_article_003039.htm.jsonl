People with night blindness often have trouble seeing stars on a clear night or walking through a dark room, such as a movie theater.\nThese problems are often worse just after a person is in a brightly lit environment. Milder cases may just have a harder time adapting to darkness.\nCauses\nThe causes of night blindness fall into 2 categories: treatable and nontreatable.\nTreatable causes:\nCataracts\nNearsightedness\nUse of certain medicines\nVitamin A deficiency\n(rare)\nNontreatable causes:\nBirth defects, particularly congenital stationary night blindness\nRetinitis pigmentosa\nHome Care\nTake safety measures to prevent accidents in areas of low light. Avoid driving a car at night, unless you get your eye doctor's approval.\nVitamin A supplements may be helpful if you have a vitamin A deficiency."}

Ask your health care provider how much you should take, because it is possible to take too much.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIt is important to have a complete eye exam to determine the cause, which may be treatable. Contact your eye doctor if symptoms of night blindness persist or significantly affect your life.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nYour provider will examine you and your eyes."}

The goal of the medical exam is to determine if the problem can be corrected (for example, with new glasses or\ncataract removal\n), or if the problem is due to something that is not treatable.\nThe provider may ask you questions, including:\nHow severe is the night blindness?\nWhen did your symptoms start?\nDid it occur suddenly or gradually?\nDoes it happen all the time?\nDoes using corrective lenses improve night vision?\nHave you ever had eye surgery?\nWhat medicines do you use?\nHow is your diet?\nHave you recently injured your eyes or head?\nDo you have a family history of\ndiabetes\n?\nDo you have other vision changes?\nWhat other symptoms do you have?\nDo you have unusual stress, anxiety, or a fear of the dark?\nThe eye exam will include:\nColor vision testing\nPupil light reflex\nRefraction\nRetinal exam\nSlit lamp examination\nVisual acuity\nOther tests may be done:\nElectroretinogram\n(ERG)\nVisual field\nAlternative Names\nNyctanopia; Nyctalopia; Night blindness\nImages\nExternal and internal eye anatomy\nR"}
