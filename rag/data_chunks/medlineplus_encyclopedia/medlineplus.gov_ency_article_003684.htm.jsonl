Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTSH test\nTSH test\nA TSH test measures the amount of thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) in your blood. TSH is produced by the pituitary gland. It prompts the thyroid gland to make and release thyroid hormones into the blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed. Other thyroid tests that may be done at the same time include:\nT3 test\n(free or total)\nT4 test\n(free or total)\nAnti-TPO\n(antibodies against thyroid peroxidase)\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no preparation needed for this test. Ask your health care provider about any medicines you are taking that may affect the test results. Do not stop taking any medicines without first asking your provider.\nMedicines you may need to stop for a short time include:\nAmiodarone\nDopamine\nLithium\nPotassium iodide\nPrednisone or other glucocorticoid medicines\nThe vitamin biotin (B7) can affect the results of the TSH test. If you take biotin, talk to your provider before you have any thyroid function tests.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain."}

If you take biotin, talk to your provider before you have any thyroid function tests.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider will order this test if you have symptoms or signs of an\noveractive\nor\nunderactive\nthyroid gland. It is also used to monitor treatment of these conditions.\nYour provider may also check your TSH level if you are planning to get pregnant.\nNormal Results\nNormal values range from 0.5 to 5 microunits per milliliter ( µU/mL).\nTSH values can vary during the day. It is best to have the test early in the morning. Experts do not fully agree on what the upper number should be when diagnosing thyroid disorders. Some labs will use a higher normal range limit for older people (even as high as 7  µU/mL).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

A low TSH may be expected.\nYou have a history of certain types of thyroid cancer. A TSH value below the normal range may be best to prevent the thyroid cancer from coming back.\nA woman is pregnant. The normal range for TSH is different for women who are pregnant. Your provider may suggest that you take thyroid hormone, even if your TSH is in the normal range.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA higher-than-normal TSH level is most often due to an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism)."}
