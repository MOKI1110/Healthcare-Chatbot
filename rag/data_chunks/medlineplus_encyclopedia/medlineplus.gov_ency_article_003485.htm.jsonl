Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nChloride test - blood\nChloride test - blood\nChloride is a type of\nelectrolyte\n. It works with other electrolytes such as potassium, sodium, and carbon dioxide (CO2). These substances help keep the proper balance of body fluids and maintain the body's acid-base balance.\nThis article is about the laboratory test used to measure the amount of chloride in the fluid portion (serum) of the blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is\ndrawn from a vein\nlocated on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nMany medicines can interfere with blood test results.\nYour health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test.\nDO NOT stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou may have this test if you have signs that your body's fluid level or acid-base balance is disturbed.\nThis test is most often ordered with other blood tests, such as a basic or comprehensive metabolic panel.\nNormal Results"}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nThe example above shows the common measurement range for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA greater-than-normal level of chloride is called hyperchloremia. It may be due to:\nAddison disease\nCarbonic anhydrase inhibitors (used to treat glaucoma)\nDiarrhea\nEthylene glycol poisoning\nKetoacidosis\nKidney disease\nLactic acidosis\nMetabolic acidosis\nMethanol poisoning\nRenal tubular acidosis - distal\nRenal tubular acidosis - proximal\nRespiratory alkalosis\n(compensated)\nSalicylate toxicity (such as aspirin overdose)\nUreteral diversion\nA lower-than-normal level of chloride is called hypochloremia."}
