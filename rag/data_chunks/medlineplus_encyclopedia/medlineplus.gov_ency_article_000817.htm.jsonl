This term usually refers to heartburn, cramps,\nbelly pain\n, or diarrhea that can occur after they eat foods such as:\nCorn products\nCow's milk and dairy products (usually due to\nlactose intolerance\n)\nWheat and other grains that contain gluten (gluten intolerance or\nceliac disease\n)\nA true food allergy is much less common.\nThe immune system normally protects the body against harmful substances, such as bacteria and viruses. It also reacts to foreign substances called\nallergens\n. These are usually harmless, and in most people, do not cause a problem.\nIn a person with a food allergy, the immune response is oversensitive. When it recognizes an allergen, the immune system launches a response. Chemicals such as histamines are released. These chemicals cause allergy symptoms.\nAny food can cause an allergic reaction."}

The most common food allergies are to:\nEggs (mostly in children)\nFish (older children and adults)\nMilk (people of all ages)\nPeanuts (people of all ages)\nShellfish such as shrimp, crab, and lobster (people of all ages)\nSoy (mostly in children)\nTree nuts (people of all ages)\nWheat (people of all ages)\nIn rare cases, food additives, such as dyes, thickeners, or preservatives can cause a food allergy or intolerance reaction.\nSome people have an oral allergy. This is an allergy type syndrome that affects the mouth and tongue after they eat certain fresh fruits and vegetables:\nMelons, apples, peaches, pineapple, and other foods contain proteins that are similar to certain pollen proteins.\nThe reaction most often occurs when you eat the raw form of the foods. How severe the reaction is depends on how much of the food you eat."}

If the food is cooked, there is no reaction.\nUnlike true food allergies, people with the oral allergy syndrome rarely develop severe allergic reactions such as anaphylaxis.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms usually begin within 2 hours after eating. Sometimes, the symptoms begin a longer time after eating the food.\nKey symptoms of a food allergy include\nhives\n, a hoarse voice, and wheezing.\nOther symptoms that may occur include:\nSwelling (\nangioedema\n), especially of the eyelids, face, lips, and tongue\nTrouble swallowing or breathing due to swelling in the throat\nItching of the mouth, throat, eyes, skin, or any other area\nDizziness, lightheadedness,\nfainting\n, or feelings of impending doom\nNasal congestion, runny nose\nStomach cramps\n, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting\nSymptoms of mouth (oral) allergy syndrome:\nItchy lips, tongue, and throat\nSwollen lips (sometimes)\nSevere allergic reactions can happen immediately or within two hours after eating.

In addition to the above symptoms, you may have\nlow blood pressure\nand shortness of breath due to narrowed airways.\nExams and Tests\nBlood or skin tests are sometimes used to confirm that you have an allergy. A double-blind food challenge is one way to diagnose true food allergies. During this test, you and your health care provider will not know what you are eating. This is not commonly done.\nWith elimination diets, you avoid the suspected food until your symptoms disappear. Then you start eating the foods again to see if you develop a reaction. This is only done for food sensitivities or mild reactions. If a food has caused severe symptoms in the past, this should not be attempted.\nIn provocation (challenge) testing, you eat a small amount of the suspected food under medical supervision. This type of test may cause severe allergic reactions. Challenge testing should only be done by a trained provider."}

Typically, this test is done when there is a question about whether there is a food allergy or not.\nNever try to cause a reaction or reintroduce a food on your own. These tests should only be done under the guidance of a provider, especially if your first reaction was severe.\nTreatment\nIf you suspect that you or your child has a food allergy, see an allergy specialist (allergist).\nTreatment may involve any of the following:\nAvoiding the food (this is the most effective treatment).\nDesensitization, during which you eat a small amount of the food each day. This must be done under an allergist's guidance.\nOmalizumab (Xolair), an injection every 2 or 4 weeks to decrease sensitivity to food allergies.\nOther treatments, including allergy shots and probiotics, have not been proven to help with food allergies."}

The symptoms will likely go away in a brief time. Antihistamines may relieve the discomfort. Soothing skin creams may also provide some relief.\nIf you develop any type of serious or whole-body reaction (even hives) after eating a food, you should learn how to use injectable or intranasal epinephrine."}

Providers now suggest introducing peanut-containing foods to infants, which may prevent peanut allergy. There is also evidence that introducing eggs by 12 months of age can prevent egg allergy.\nOnce an allergy has developed, carefully avoiding the offending food usually prevents further problems.\nAlternative Names\nAllergy to food; Food allergy - peanuts; Food allergy - soy; Food allergy - fish; Food allergy - shellfish; Food allergy - eggs; Food allergy - milk\nImages\nmyPlate\nAnaphylaxis\nFood allergies\nRead food labels\nAntibodies\nReferences\nBird JA, Burks AW.
