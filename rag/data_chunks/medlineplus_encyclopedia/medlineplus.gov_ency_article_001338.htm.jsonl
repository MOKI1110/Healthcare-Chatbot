Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSporotrichosis\nSporotrichosis\nSporotrichosis is a long-term (\nchronic\n) skin infection that is caused by a fungus called\nSporothrix schenckii\n.\nCauses\nSporothrix schenckii\nis found in plants. Infection commonly occurs when the skin is broken while handling plant material such as rosebushes, briars, or dirt that contains a lot of mulch.\nSporotrichosis can be a job-related disease for people who work with plants, such as farmers, horticulturists, rose gardeners, and plant nursery workers. Widespread (disseminated) sporotrichosis can develop in people with a weakened immune system when they inhale dust filled with spores of the fungus.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include a small, painless, red lump that develops at the site of infection. As time passes, this lump will turn into an\nulcer\n(sore). The lump may develop up to 3 months after an injury.\nMost sores are on the hands and forearms because these areas are commonly injured when handling plants.\nThe fungus follows the channels in your body's lymph system."}

Small ulcers appear as lines on the skin as the infection moves up an arm or leg. These sores do not heal unless they are treated, and they may last for years. The sores may sometimes drain small amounts of pus.\nBody-wide (\nsystemic\n) sporotrichosis can cause lung and breathing problems, bone infection, arthritis, and infection of the nervous system.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms. The examination will show the typical sores caused by the fungus. Sometimes, a small sample of affected tissue is removed, examined under a microscope, and tested in a lab to identify the fungus.\nTreatment\nThe skin infection is often treated with an antifungal medicine called itraconazole. It is taken by mouth and continued for 2 to 4 weeks after the skin sores have cleared. You may have to take the medicine for 3 to 6 months."}

A medicine called terbinafine may be used instead of itraconazole.\nInfections that have spread or affect the entire body are often treated with amphotericin B, or sometimes itraconazole. Therapy for systemic disease can last up to 12 months.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWith treatment, full recovery is likely. Disseminated sporotrichosis is more difficult to treat and requires several months of therapy. Disseminated sporotrichosis can be life threatening for people with a  weakened immune system.\nPossible Complications\nPeople with a healthy immune system may have:\nDiscomfort\nSecondary skin infections (such as staph or strep)\nPeople with a\nweakened immune system\nmay develop:\nArthritis\nBone infection\nComplications from medicines -- amphotericin B can have serious side effects, including kidney damage and changes in blood chemistries\nLung and breathing problems (such as\npneumonia\n)\nBrain infection (\nmeningitis\n)\nWidespread (disseminated) disease\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your"}
