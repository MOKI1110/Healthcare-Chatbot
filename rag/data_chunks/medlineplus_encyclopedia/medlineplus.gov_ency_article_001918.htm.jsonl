Because radiation is most harmful to quickly growing cells, radiation therapy damages cancer cells more than normal cells. This prevents the cancer cells from growing and dividing, and leads to cell death.\nRadiation therapy is used to fight many types of cancer and to treat some benign diseases. Sometimes, radiation is the only treatment needed."}

Sometimes, radiation is the only treatment needed. It may also be used in combination with other therapies such as surgery or chemotherapy to:\nShrink a tumor as much as possible before surgery\nHelp prevent the cancer from coming back after surgery or chemotherapy\nRelieve symptoms caused by a tumor, such as pain, pressure, or bleeding\nTreat cancers that cannot be removed with surgery\nTreat cancers instead of using surgery\nTYPES OF RADIATION THERAPY\nDifferent types of radiation therapy include external, internal, and intraoperative.\nEXTERNAL RADIATION THERAPY\nExternal radiation is the most common form. This method carefully aims high-powered radiation or particles directly at the tumor from outside of the body. Newer methods provide more effective treatment with less tissue damage. These include:\nIntensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT)\n3D Conformal Radiotherapy (3DCRT)\nElectron Beam Therapy\nImage-guided radiotherapy (IGRT)\nStereotactic radiotherapy\n(radiosurgery)\nProton therapy\nis another kind of radiation used to treat cancer."}

Rather than using radiation to destroy cancer cells, proton therapy uses a beam of special particles called protons. Because it causes less damage to healthy tissue, proton therapy is often used for cancers that are very close to critical parts of the body. It is only used for certain types of cancer.\nINTERNAL RADIATION THERAPY\nInternal beam radiation is placed inside your body.\nOne method uses radioactive seeds that are placed directly into or near the tumor. This method is called\nbrachytherapy\n, and is used to treat\nprostate cancer\n. It is used less often to treat breast, cervical, lung, skin, and other cancers.\nAnother method involves receiving a specific radioactive liquid that emits radiation, called a radio nucleotide. This liquid radiation can be given in a drink with a pill, or through an IV. Liquid radiation travels throughout your body, seeking out and killing cancer cells."}

This liquid radiation can be given in a drink with a pill, or through an IV. Liquid radiation travels throughout your body, seeking out and killing cancer cells. Thyroid cancer and some metastatic cancers such as prostate can be treated using liquid radiation.\nINTRAOPERTIVE RADIATION THERAPY (IORT)\nThis type of radiation is usually used during surgery to remove a tumor. Right after the tumor is removed and before the surgeon closes the incision, radiation is delivered to the site where the tumor used to be. IORT is generally used for tumors that have not spread and microscopic tumor cells may remain after the larger tumor is removed.\nCompared with external radiation, advantages of IORT may include:\nOnly the tumor area is targeted so there is less harm to healthy tissue\nOnly a single dose of radiation is given\nDelivers a smaller dose of radiation\nSIDE EFFECTS OF RADIATION THERAPY\nRadiation therapy can also damage or kill healthy cells. The death of healthy cells can lead to side effects.\nThese side effects depend on the dose of radiation, and how often you have the therapy."}
