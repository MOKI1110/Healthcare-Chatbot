The yellow coloring comes from bilirubin, a byproduct of old red blood cells. Jaundice can be a symptom of several health problems.\nCauses\nA small number of red blood cells in your body die each day, and are replaced by new ones. The liver removes the old blood cells. This creates bilirubin. The liver helps break down bilirubin so that it can be removed by the body through the stool.\nJaundice can occur when too much bilirubin builds up in the body.\nJaundice can occur if:\nToo many red blood cells are dying or breaking down and going to the liver.\nThe liver is overloaded or damaged.\nThe bilirubin from the liver is unable to move normally into the digestive tract.\nJaundice is often a sign of a problem with the liver, gallbladder, or pancreas."}
