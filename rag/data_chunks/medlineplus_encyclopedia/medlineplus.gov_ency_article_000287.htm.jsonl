It produces the hormones insulin and glucagon. It also produces chemicals called enzymes needed to digest food.\nMost of the time, the enzymes are active only after they reach the small intestine.\nIf these enzymes become active inside the pancreas, they can digest the tissue of the pancreas. This causes swelling, bleeding, and damage to the organ and its blood vessels.\nThis problem is called acute pancreatitis.\nAcute pancreatitis affects men more often than women. Certain diseases, surgeries, and habits make you more likely to develop this condition.\nAlcohol use is responsible for up to 70% of cases in the United States. About 5 to 8 drinks per day for 5 or more years can damage the pancreas.\nGallstones are the next most common cause. When the gallstones travel out of the gallbladder into the bile ducts, they may block the opening that drains bile and enzymes."}

When the gallstones travel out of the gallbladder into the bile ducts, they may block the opening that drains bile and enzymes. The bile and enzymes \"back up\" into the pancreas and cause swelling.\nGenetics may be a factor in some cases. Sometimes, the cause is not known.\nOther conditions that have been linked to pancreatitis are:\nAutoimmune problems (when the immune system attacks the body)\nDamage to the bile ducts or pancreas during surgery\nHigh blood levels of a fat called\ntriglycerides\n-- most often above 1,000 mg/dL\nInjury to the pancreas from an accident\nOther causes include:\nAfter certain procedures used to diagnose gallbladder and pancreas problems (\nendoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography\n, ERCP) or ultrasound guided biopsy\nCystic fibrosis\nOveractive parathyroid gland\nReye syndrome\nUse of certain medicines (especially estrogens, corticosteroids, sulfonamides, thiazides, and azathioprine)\nCertain infections, such as mumps, that involve the pancreas\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom of pancreatitis is pain felt in the upper left side or middle of the abdomen."}

However, feeding the digestive tract is an important treatment for pancreatitis, therefore a feeding tube may be put into the stomach or intestine until you can eat by mouth again.\nA tube may be inserted through the nose or mouth to remove the contents of the stomach. This may be done if vomiting and severe pain do not improve. The tube will stay in for 1 to 2 days to 1 to 2 weeks.\nTreating the condition that caused the problem can prevent repeated attacks.\nIn some cases, therapy is needed to:\nDrain\nfluid that has collected in or around the pancreas\nRemove\ngallstones\nRelieve blockages of the pancreatic duct\nIn the most severe cases, surgery is needed to remove damaged, dead or infected pancreatic tissue.\nAvoid smoking, alcoholic drinks, and fatty foods after the attack has improved.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost cases go away in a week or less."}
