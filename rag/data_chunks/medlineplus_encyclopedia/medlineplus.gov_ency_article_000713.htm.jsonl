Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSubdural hematoma\nSubdural hematoma\nA subdural hematoma is a collection of blood between the covering of the brain (dura) and the surface of the brain.\nCauses\nA subdural hematoma is most often the result of a severe head injury. This type of subdural hematoma is among the deadliest of all head injuries. The bleeding fills the brain area very rapidly, compressing brain tissue. This often results in brain injury and may lead to death.\nWith any subdural hematoma, tiny veins between the surface of the brain and its outer covering (the dura) stretch and tear, allowing blood to collect. In older adults, the veins are often already stretched because of brain shrinkage (atrophy) and are more easily injured.\nchronic subdural hematoma\nis more often seen in older adults. This type of subdural hematoma may be due to blood that persists after an acute injury or the result of slowly leaking blood."}

These can occur after a minor head injury and may go unnoticed for many days.\nSome subdural hematomas occur without cause (spontaneously).\nThe following increase the risk for a subdural hematoma:\nMedicines that thin the blood (such as warfarin or aspirin)\nLong-term alcohol use\nMedical conditions that make your blood clot poorly\nRepeated head injury, such as from falls\nVery young or very old age\nIn infants and young children, a subdural hematoma may occur after child abuse and are commonly seen in a condition called\nshaken baby syndrome\n.\nSymptoms\nDepending on the size of the hematoma and where it presses on the brain, any of the following symptoms may occur:\nDrowsiness, confusion, or coma\nDecreased memory\nProblem speaking or\nswallowing\nProblems with balance or walking\nHeadache\nSeizures\nor loss of consciousness\nNausea and vomiting\nWeakness or numbness of arms, legs, face\nVision problems\nBehavioral changes or\npsychosis\nIn infants, symptoms may include:\nBulging fontanelles\n(the soft spots"}

Do not delay. Older adults should receive medical care if they show signs of memory problems or mental decline, even if they don't seem to have an injury.\nYour health care provider will ask about your medical history.

This may involve drilling a small hole in the skull to drain any blood and relieve pressure on the brain. Large hematomas or solid blood clots may need to be removed through a procedure called a\ncraniotomy\n, which creates a larger opening in the skull.\nMedicines that may be used depend on the type of subdural hematoma, how severe the symptoms are, and how much brain damage has occurred. Medicines may include:\nDiuretics (often given intravenously) and corticosteroids to reduce swelling\nAnti-seizure medicines to control or prevent seizures\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook depends on the type and location of head injury, the size of the blood collection, and how soon treatment is started.\nAcute subdural hematomas have high rates of death and brain injury. Chronic subdural hematomas have better outcomes in most cases. Symptoms often go away after the blood collection is drained."}
