Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBleeding time\nBleeding time\nBleeding time is a medical test that  measures how fast small blood vessels in the skin stop bleeding.\nBecause it is difficult to perform correctly, it is rarely used today.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood pressure cuff is inflated around your upper arm. While the cuff is on your arm, your health care provider makes two small cuts on the lower arm using a special device. They are just deep enough to cause a tiny amount of bleeding.\nThe blood pressure cuff is immediately deflated. Blotting paper is touched to the cuts every 30 seconds until the bleeding stops. The provider records the time it takes for the cuts to stop bleeding.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nCertain medicines can change blood test results.\nTell your provider about all the medicines you take.\nYour provider will tell you if you need to temporarily stop taking any medicines before you have this test."}

This may include dextran and aspirin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).\nDo not stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe tiny cuts are very shallow, and can be made with a small lancet or with a special instrument with a spring that makes a very shallow cut. Most people say it feels like a skin scratch.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test helps diagnose\nbleeding problems\n.\nNormal Results\nBleeding normally stops within 1 to 9 minutes.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nLonger-than-normal bleeding time may be due to:\nBlood vessel defect\nPlatelet aggregation defect\n(clumping problem with platelets, which are parts of the blood that helps the blood clot)\nThrombocytopenia\n(low platelet count)\nRisks\nThere is a very slight risk of infection where the skin is cut.\nImages\nBlood clot test\nReferences\nPai M, Moffat KA.
