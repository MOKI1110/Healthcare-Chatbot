All cartilage has a thin layer of tissue around it called the perichondrium. This covering helps provide nutrients to the cartilage.\nThe most common type of bacteria that causes perichondritis infection is\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n.\nPerichondritis is usually caused by an injury to the ear due to:\nEar surgery\nEar piercing (especially piercing of the cartilage)\nContact sports\nTrauma to the side of the head\nEar piercing through the cartilage is probably the major risk factor today. Surgery, burns, and acupuncture also increase the risk for infection.\nPerichondritis can lead to chondritis, which is an infection of the cartilage itself. This can cause severe damage to the ear structure.\nSymptoms\nA painful, swollen, red ear is the most common symptom."}

This can cause severe damage to the ear structure.\nSymptoms\nA painful, swollen, red ear is the most common symptom. At first, the infection will look like a skin infection, but it quickly worsens and involves the perichondrium.\nThe redness usually surrounds an area of injury, such as a cut or scrape. There may also be fever. In more severe cases, fluid will drain from the wound.\nExams and Tests\nThe diagnosis is based on the medical history and examination of the ear. If there is a history of trauma to the ear and the ear is red and very tender, then perichondritis is diagnosed. There may be a change in the normal shape of the ear. The ear may look swollen.\nTreatment\nTreatment consists of antibiotics, either by mouth or directly into the bloodstream through an\nintravenous\n(IV) line. Antibiotics can be given for 10 days to several weeks. If there is a trapped collection of pus, you may need surgery. The surgery is done to drain this fluid and remove any dead skin and cartilage.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well a person does depends on how quickly the infection is diagnosed and treated."}

If antibiotics are taken early, full recovery is expected. If the infection involves the ear cartilage, more involved treatment is needed.\nPossible Complications\nIf the infection spreads to the ear cartilage, part of the ear tissue may die and need to be surgically removed. If this occurs, plastic surgery may be needed to restore the ear to its normal shape.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIf you have any trauma to your ear (a scratch, blow, or piercing) and then develop pain and redness over the stiff part of the outer ear, contact your health care provider. You may need to take antibiotics.\nPrevention\nAvoid piercing your ear through the cartilage. Piercing the ear lobe is a better option. The popularity of cartilage piercing has led to a significant increase in the number of perichondritis and chondritis infections.\nReferences\nHaddad J. External otitis (otitis externa).
