Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nDermatomyositis\nDermatomyositis\nDermatomyositis is a disease that involves muscle inflammation and a skin rash.\nPolymyositis\nis a similar inflammatory condition that also involves muscle weakness, swelling, tenderness, and tissue damage but no skin rash. Both are part of a larger group of diseases called myopathies, more specifically inflammatory myopathies.\nCauses\nThe cause of dermatomyositis is unknown. Experts think it may be due to a viral infection of the muscles or a problem with the body's immune system. It may also occur in people who have cancer in the abdomen, lung, or other parts of the body.\nAnyone can develop this condition. It most often occurs in children age 5 to 15 and adults age 40 to 60. It affects women more often than men.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nMuscle weakness\n, stiffness, or soreness\nPurple color to the upper eyelids\nPurple-red skin rash\nShortness of breath\nDifficulty swallowing\nThe muscle weakness may come on suddenly or develop slowly over weeks or months."}

You may have trouble raising your arms over your head, getting up from a sitting position, and climbing stairs.\nThe rash may appear on your face, knuckles, neck, shoulders, upper chest, and back.\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will do a physical exam. Tests may include:\nBloods test to check levels of muscle enzymes called creatine phosphokinase and\naldolase\nBlood tests for autoimmune diseases\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG)\nElectromyography\n(EMG)\nMagnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI)\nMuscle biopsy\nSkin biopsy\nScreening tests for cancer\nChest x-ray\nand\nCT scan of the chest\nLung function tests\nSwallowing study\nMyositis specific and associated autoantibodies\nTreatment\nThe initial treatment is the use of corticosteroid medicines. The dose of medicine is slowly tapered off as muscle strength improves. This takes about 4 to 6 weeks. You may stay on a low dose of a corticosteroid medicine after that.\nMedicines to suppress the immune system may be used to replace the corticosteroids."}

Many people with this condition must take a medicine called prednisone for the rest of their lives.\nIf a tumor is causing the condition, the muscle weakness and rash may get better when the tumor is removed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIt is important to be followed by a health care provider when you have dermatomyositis."}
