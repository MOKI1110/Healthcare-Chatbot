The medical name of this condition is hypomagnesemia.\nCauses\nEvery organ in the body, especially the heart, muscles, and kidneys, needs the mineral magnesium. It also contributes to the makeup of teeth and bones. Magnesium is needed for many functions in the body. This includes the physical and chemical processes in the body that convert or use energy (\nmetabolism\n).\nWhen the level of magnesium in the body drops below normal, symptoms may develop due to low magnesium.\nCommon causes of low magnesium include:\nAlcohol use\nBurns that affect a large area of the body\nChronic\ndiarrhea\nExcessive urination (polyuria), such as in uncontrolled\ndiabetes\nand during recovery from\nacute kidney injury\nHyperaldosteronism\n(disorder in which the adrenal gland releases too much of the hormone aldosterone into the blood)\nKidney tubule disorders\nMalabsorption\nsyndromes, such as\nceliac disease\nand inflammatory bowel disease\nMalnutrit"}
