Before the test is done, you may be given a medicine to prevent pain or to calm you (sedative).\nThe biopsy may be done through the abdominal wall:\nYou will lie on your back with your right hand under your head. You need to stay as still as you can.\nThe health care provider will find the correct spot for the biopsy needle to be inserted into the liver. This is often done by using ultrasound.\nThe skin is cleaned, and numbing medicine is injected into the area using a small needle.\nA small cut is made, and the biopsy needle is inserted.\nYou will be told to hold your breath while the biopsy is taken. This is to reduce the chance of damage to the lung or liver.\nThe needle is removed quickly.\nPressure will be applied to stop the bleeding."}

This is to reduce the chance of damage to the lung or liver.\nThe needle is removed quickly.\nPressure will be applied to stop the bleeding. A bandage is placed over the insertion site.\nThe procedure can also be done by inserting a needle into your liver by moving it through the jugular vein.\nIf the procedure is performed this way, you will lie on your back.\nX-rays\nwill be used to guide the provider to the vein.\nA special needle and catheter (thin tube) is used to take the biopsy sample.\nA liver biopsy can also be done during certain surgeries or during an internal ultrasound called an endoscopic ultrasound (EUS).\nIf you receive sedation for this test, you will need someone to drive you home. You should not drive, operate machinery, or make important or legal decisions for 24 hours after sedation.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nTell your provider about:\nBleeding problems\nMedicine allergies\nMedicines you are taking including herbs, supplements, medicines, or drugs you bought without a prescription\nWhether you are pregnant\nYou must sign a consent form. Blood tests are sometimes done to test your blood's ability to clot."}

Your child's provider will tell you what you can do to prepare your child for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will feel a stinging pain when the anesthetic is injected. The biopsy needle may feel like deep pressure and dull pain. Some people feel this pain in the shoulder.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe biopsy helps diagnose many\nliver diseases\n. The procedure also helps assess the stage (early, advanced) of liver disease. Liver biopsies are now done less often because noninvasive tests may be enough to assess for liver damage."}
