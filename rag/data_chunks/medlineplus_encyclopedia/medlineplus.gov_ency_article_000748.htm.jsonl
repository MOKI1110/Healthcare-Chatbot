It usually occurs in people who have had untreated syphilis for many years. Syphilis is a bacterial infection that is most often spread through sexual contact. Today, neurosyphilis is very rare.\nWith neurosyphilis, the syphilis bacteria attack the brain and nervous system. General paresis often begins about 10 to 30 years after the initial syphilis infection.\nSymptoms\nSyphilis infection can damage many different nerves of the brain. With general paresis, symptoms are usually those of\ndementia\nand may include:\nMemory problems\nLanguage problems, such as saying or writing words incorrectly\nDecreased mental function, such as problems thinking and with judgment\nMood changes\nPersonality changes, such as delusions,\nhallucinations\n, irritability, inappropriate behavior\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history."}

During the exam, your provider may check your nervous system function. Mental function tests will also be done.\nTests that may be ordered to detect syphilis in the body include:\nCSF-VDRL\nFTA-ABS\nTests of the nervous system may include:\nHead CT scan\nand\nMRI\nNerve conduction tests\nSpinal tap\n(lumbar puncture)\nTreatment\nThe goals of treatment are to cure the infection and slow the disorder and prevent further damage. Your provider will prescribe penicillin or other antibiotics to treat the infection. Treatment will likely continue until the infection has completely cleared.\nTreating the infection will reduce new nerve damage. But it will not cure damage that has already occurred.\nTreatment of symptoms is needed for existing nervous system damage.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWithout treatment, a person can become disabled."}

People with late syphilis infections are more likely to develop other infections and diseases.\nPossible Complications\nComplications of this condition include:\nInability to communicate or interact with others\nInjury due to\nseizures\nor falls\nInability to care for yourself\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you know you have been exposed to syphilis or another sexually transmitted infection in the past, and have not been treated.\nContact your provider if you have nervous system problems (such as trouble thinking), especially if you know you have been infected with syphilis.\nGo to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have seizures.\nPrevention\nTreating primary syphilis and secondary syphilis infections will prevent general paresis.\nPracticing safer sex\n, such as limiting partners and using protection, may reduce the risk of getting infected with syphilis."}
