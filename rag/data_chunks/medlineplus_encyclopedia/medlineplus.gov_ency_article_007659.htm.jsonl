A different meningococcal vaccine is available that can help protect against serogroups A, C, W, and Y.\nMeningococcal disease\ncan cause meningitis (infection of the lining of the brain and spinal cord) and infections of the blood. Even when it is treated, meningococcal disease kills 10 to 15 infected people out of 100. And of those who survive, about 10 to 20 out of every 100 will suffer disabilities such as hearing loss, brain damage, kidney damage, loss of limbs, nervous system problems, or severe scars from skin grafts.\nMeningococcal disease is rare and has declined in the United States since the 1990s."}
