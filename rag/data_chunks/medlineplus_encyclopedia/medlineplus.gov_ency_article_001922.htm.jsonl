They often occur in response to unmet needs or desires. Tantrums are more likely to occur in toddlers and preschool-age children. Older children who cannot express their needs or control their emotions when they are frustrated can also have temper tantrums, but much less often.\nInformation\nTemper tantrums (acting-out behaviors) are natural during early childhood. It's normal for children to want to be independent as they learn they are separate people from their parents.\nThis desire for control often shows up as saying \"no\" often and having tantrums. Tantrums are worsened by the fact that the child may not have the vocabulary to express their feelings.\nTantrums usually begin in children 12 months to age 3, and can occur at least once a day. Children ages 3 to 5 years continue to have tantrums, although less often. After age 5, tantrums rarely occur."}

Being tired, hungry, or sick, can make tantrums worse or more frequent.\nWHEN YOUR CHILD HAS A TANTRUM\nWhen your child has a temper tantrum, it is important that you stay calm. It helps to remember that tantrums are normal. They are not your fault. You are not a bad parent, and your son or daughter is not a bad child. Shouting at or hitting your child will only make the situation worse. A quiet, peaceful response and atmosphere, without \"giving in\" or breaking the rules that you set, reduces stress and makes both of you feel better.\nYou can also try gentle distraction, switching to activities your child enjoys, or making a funny face. If your child has a tantrum away from home, lead your child to a quiet place, such as the car or a restroom. Keep your child safe until the tantrum has ended.\nTemper tantrums are an attention-seeking behavior. One strategy to minimize the length and severity of the tantrum is to ignore the behavior."}

Keep your child safe until the tantrum has ended.\nTemper tantrums are an attention-seeking behavior. One strategy to minimize the length and severity of the tantrum is to ignore the behavior. If your child is safe and not being destructive, going to another room in the house may shorten the episode because now the drama has no audience. Your child may follow and continue the tantrum. If so, do not talk or react until the behavior stops. Then, calmly discuss the issue and offer alternatives without giving in to your child's demand.\nPREVENTING TEMPER TANTRUMS\nMake sure that your child eats and sleeps at their usual times. If your child no longer takes a nap, ensure that they still have some quiet time. Lying down for 15 to 20 minutes or resting while you read stories together at regular times of the day can help prevent tantrums.\nOther methods to prevent tantrums include:\nUse an upbeat tone when asking your child to do something. Make it sound like an invitation, not an order. For example, \"If you put your mittens and hat on, we will be able to go to your play group.\"\nDon't battle over unimportant things like which shoes your child wears."}

Safety is what matters, such as not touching a hot stove, keeping the car seat buckled, and not playing in the street.\nOffer choices when possible. For example, let your child pick what clothes to wear and what stories to read. A child who feels independent in many areas will be more likely to follow rules when it is a must. Do not offer a choice if one does not truly exist.\nWHEN TO SEEK HELP\nIf temper tantrums are getting worse and you do not think you can manage them, seek the advice of your health care provider."}
