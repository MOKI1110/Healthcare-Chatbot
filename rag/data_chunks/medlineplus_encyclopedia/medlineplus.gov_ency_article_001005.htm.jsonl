Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nUveitis\nUveitis\nUveitis is swelling and inflammation of the\nuvea\n. The uvea is the middle layer of the wall of the eye. The uvea supplies blood for the iris at the front of the eye and the\nretina\nin the back of the eye.\nCauses\nUveitis can be caused by\nautoimmune disorders\n. These diseases occur when the body's immune system attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake. Examples are:\nAnkylosing spondylitis\nBehcet disease\nPsoriasis\nReactive arthritis\nRheumatoid arthritis\nSarcoidosis\nUlcerative colitis\nUveitis can also be caused by infections such as:\nAIDS\nCytomegalovirus (\nCMV) retinitis\nHerpes zoster infection\nHistoplasmosis\nKawasaki disease\nSyphilis\nToxoplasmosis\nExposure to toxins or injury can also cause uveitis. In many cases, the cause is unknown.\nOften the inflammation is limited to only part of the uvea. The most common form of uveitis involves inflammation of the iris, in the front part of the eye. In this case, the condition is called iritis. In most cases, it occurs in healthy people. The disorder may affect only one eye."}

In this case, the condition is called iritis. In most cases, it occurs in healthy people. The disorder may affect only one eye. It is most common in young and middle-aged people.\nPosterior uveitis affects the back part of the eye. It involves primarily the choroid. This is the layer of blood vessels and connective tissue in the middle layer of the eye. This type of uveitis is called choroiditis. If the retina is also involved, it is called chorioretinitis.\nAnother form of uveitis is pars planitis. Inflammation occurs in the area called the pars plana, which is located between the iris and the choroid. Pars planitis most often occurs in young men. It is generally not associated with any other disease. However, it may be linked to Crohn disease and possibly multiple sclerosis.\nSymptoms\nUveitis can affect one or both eyes. Symptoms depend on which part of the uvea is inflamed."}

However, it may be linked to Crohn disease and possibly multiple sclerosis.\nSymptoms\nUveitis can affect one or both eyes. Symptoms depend on which part of the uvea is inflamed. Symptoms may develop rapidly and can include:\nBlurred vision\nDark, floating spots in the vision\nEye pain\nRedness of the eye\nSensitivity to light\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will take a complete medical history and do an eye exam. Lab tests may be done to rule out infection or a weak immune system.\nIf you are over age 25 and have pars planitis, your provider will suggest a brain and spine MRI. This will check for multiple sclerosis.\nTreatment\nIritis and irido-cyclitis (anterior uveitis) are most often mild. Treatment may involve:\nDark glasses\nEye drops that dilate the pupil to relieve pain\nSteroid eye drops\nPars planitis is often treated with steroid eye drops. Other medicines, including steroids taken by mouth, may be used to help suppress the immune system and reduce inflammation.\nPosterior uveitis treatment depends on the underlying cause."}

You may also be given powerful anti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids. Sometimes certain types of immune-suppressant medicines are used to treat severe uveitis.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWith proper treatment, most attacks of anterior uveitis go away in a few days to weeks. However, the problem often returns.\nPosterior uveitis may last from months to years."}
