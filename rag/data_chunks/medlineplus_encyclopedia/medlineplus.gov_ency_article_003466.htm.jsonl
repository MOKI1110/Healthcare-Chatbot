The test is often used to diagnose\ndiabetes\n.\nTests to screen for diabetes during pregnancy\nare similar, but are done differently.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe most common glucose tolerance test is the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT).\nBefore the test begins, when you have had nothing to eat or drink for at least 8 hours, a sample of blood will be taken.\nYou will then be asked to drink a liquid containing a certain amount of glucose (usually 75 grams). Your blood will be taken again every 30 to 60 minutes after you drink the solution.\nThe test may take up to 3 hours.\nA similar test is the intravenous (IV) glucose tolerance test (IGTT). It is rarely used, and is never used to diagnose diabetes. In one version of the IGTT, glucose is injected into your vein for 3 minutes."}

It is rarely used, and is never used to diagnose diabetes. In one version of the IGTT, glucose is injected into your vein for 3 minutes. Blood insulin levels are measured before the injection, and again at 1 and 3 minutes after the injection. The timing may vary. This IGTT is almost always used for research purposes only.\nA similar test is used in the diagnosis of growth hormone excess (\nacromegaly\n) when both glucose and growth hormone are measured after the glucose drink is consumed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nMake sure you eat normally for several days before the test.\nDo not eat or drink anything for at least 8 hours before the test. You cannot eat during the test.\nAsk your health care provider if any of the medicines you take can affect the test results.\nHow the Test will Feel\nDrinking the glucose solution is similar to drinking very sweet soda.\nSerious side effects from this test are very uncommon. With the blood test, some people feel nauseated, sweaty, lightheaded, or may even feel short of breath or faint after drinking the glucose."}

With the blood test, some people feel nauseated, sweaty, lightheaded, or may even feel short of breath or faint after drinking the glucose. Tell your provider if you have a history of these symptoms related to blood tests or medical procedures.\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nGlucose is the sugar the body uses for energy. People with untreated diabetes have high blood glucose levels.\nMost often, the first tests used to diagnose diabetes in people who are not pregnant are:\nFasting blood glucose level: diabetes is diagnosed if it is 126 mg/dL (7 mmol/L) or higher, on 2 different tests, done when in a person is in their usual state of health\nHemoglobin A1C test: diabetes is diagnosed if the test result is 6.5% or higher\nGlucose tolerance tests are also used to diagnose diabetes."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA glucose level that is higher than normal may mean you have pre-diabetes or diabetes:\nA 2-hour value of 140 to 199 mg/dL (7.8 and 11.1 mmol/L) is called impaired glucose tolerance. Your provider may call this pre-diabetes. It means you are at increased risk of developing diabetes over time.\nAny glucose level of 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) or higher means you have diabetes.\nSerious stress to the body, such as from trauma, stroke, heart attack, or surgery, can raise your blood glucose level. Vigorous exercise can lower your blood glucose level over hours but may immediately increase blood glucose.\nSome medicines can raise or lower your blood glucose level."}
