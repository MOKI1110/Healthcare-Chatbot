It is usually highest in the evening. Other factors that may affect body temperature are:\nA woman's menstrual cycle. In the second part of this cycle, her temperature may go up by 1 degree Fahrenheit or more.\nPhysical activity, strong emotion, eating, heavy clothing, medicines, high room temperature, and high humidity can all increase body temperature.\nFever is an important part of the body's defense against infection.

Although a fever signals that a battle might be going on in the body, the fever is fighting for, not against the person.\nBrain damage from a fever generally will not occur unless the fever is over 107.6 °F (42 °C). Untreated fevers caused by infection will seldom go over 105 °F (40.6 °C) unless the child is overdressed or in a hot place.\nFebrile seizures\ndo occur in some children.

Remember, the goal is to lower, not eliminate, the fever.\nWhen trying to lower a fever:\nDo not bundle up someone who has chills.\nRemove excess clothing or blankets. The room should be comfortable, not too hot or cool. Try one layer of lightweight clothing, and one lightweight blanket for sleep. If the room is hot or stuffy, a fan may help.\nA lukewarm bath or sponge bath may help cool someone with a fever. This is effective after medicine is given -- otherwise the temperature might bounce right back up.\nDo not use cold baths, ice, or alcohol rubs."}

These cool the skin, but often make the situation worse by causing shivering, which raises the core body temperature.\nHere are some guidelines for taking medicine to lower a fever:\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help reduce fever in children and adults. Sometimes health care providers advise you to use both types of medicine.\nTake acetaminophen every 4 to 6 hours. It works by turning down the brain's thermostat.\nTake ibuprofen every 6 to 8 hours. Do not use ibuprofen in children 6 months or younger.\nAspirin is very effective for treating fever in adults. Do not give aspirin to a child unless your child's provider tells you to.\nKnow how much you or your child weighs. Then check the instructions on the package to find the correct dose.\nIn children 3 months or younger, contact your child's provider first before giving medicines.\nEating and drinking:\nEveryone, particularly children, should drink plenty of fluids."}
