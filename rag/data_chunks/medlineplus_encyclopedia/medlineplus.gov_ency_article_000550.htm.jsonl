Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFactor V deficiency\nFactor V deficiency\nFactor V deficiency is a\nbleeding disorder\nthat is passed down through families. It affects the ability of the blood to clot.\nCauses\nWhen you bleed, a series of reactions take place in the body that helps blood clots form. This process is called the coagulation cascade. It involves as many as 20 different special proteins called coagulation, or clotting, factors. You may have a higher chance of excess bleeding if one or more of these factors are missing or are not functioning like they should.\nFactor V deficiency is caused by a lack of factor V. When certain blood clotting factors are low or missing, your blood does not clot properly.\nFactor V deficiency is rare."}

In the inherited form of factor V deficiency, a family history of a bleeding disorder is a risk factor.\nSymptoms\nExcessive bleeding with menstrual periods and after childbirth often occurs."}
