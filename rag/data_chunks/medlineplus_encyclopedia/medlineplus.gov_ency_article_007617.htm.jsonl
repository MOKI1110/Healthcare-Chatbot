You may not be able to get an erection at all. Or, you may lose the erection during intercourse before you are ready. Erection problems do not usually affect your sex drive.\nErection problems are common. Almost all adult men have trouble getting or keeping an erection at one time or another. Often the problem goes away with little or no treatment. But for some men, it can be an ongoing problem. This is called erectile dysfunction (ED).\nIf you have trouble getting or keeping an erection more than 25% of the time, you should see your health care provider.\nCauses\nTo get an erection, your brain, nerves, hormones, and blood vessels all need to work together. If something gets in the way of these normal functions, it can lead to erection problems.\nAn erection problem is usually not \"all in your head.\" In fact, most erection problems have a physical cause."}
