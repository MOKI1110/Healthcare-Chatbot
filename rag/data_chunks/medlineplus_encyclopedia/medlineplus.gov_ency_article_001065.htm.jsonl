Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nInjury - kidney and ureter\nInjury - kidney and ureter\nInjury to the kidney and ureter is damage to the organs of the upper urinary tract.\nCauses\nThe kidneys are located in the flank at either side of the spine. The flank is the back of the upper abdomen. They are protected by the spine, lower rib cage, and strong muscles of the back. This location protects the kidneys from many outside forces. The kidneys are also surrounded by a layer of fat. The fat helps to cushion them.\nThe kidneys have a large blood supply. Any injury to them, can lead to severe bleeding."}
