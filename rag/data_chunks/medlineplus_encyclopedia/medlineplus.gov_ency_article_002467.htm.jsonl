The basic structure of protein is a chain of\namino acids\n.\nYou need protein in your diet to help your body repair cells and make new ones. Protein is also important for growth and development in children, teens, and pregnant women.\nFood Sources\nThe protein in food is broken down into parts called amino acids during digestion. The human body needs a number of amino acids in large enough amounts to maintain good health.\nAmino acids are found in animal sources such as meats, milk, fish, and eggs. They are also found in plant sources such as soy, beans, legumes, nut butters, and some grains (such as wheat germ and quinoa). You do not need to eat animal products to get all the protein you need in your diet.\nAmino acids are classified into three groups:\nEssential\nNonessential\nConditional\nEssential amino acids\ncannot be made by the body. They must be supplied by food. They do not need to be eaten at every meal."}

The balance over the whole day is more important.\nNonessential amino acids\nare made by the body from essential amino acids or in the normal breakdown of proteins.\nConditional amino acids\nare needed in times of illness and stress.\nRecommendations\nThe amount of protein you need in your diet will depend on your overall calorie needs. The daily recommended intake of protein for healthy adults is 10% to 35% of your total calorie needs. One gram of protein supplies 4 calories. Therefore, a person on a 2000 calorie diet could eat 100 grams of protein, or 400 calories from protein, which would supply 20% of their total daily calories.\nOne ounce (30 grams) of most protein-rich foods contains 7 grams of protein."}

Some healthy sources of animal protein include:\nTurkey or chicken with the skin removed, or bison (also called buffalo meat)\nLean cuts of beef or pork, such as round, top sirloin, or tenderloin (trim away any visible fat)\nFish or shellfish\nOther good sources of protein include:\nPinto beans, black beans, kidney beans, lentils, split peas, or garbanzo beans\nNuts and seeds, including almonds, hazelnuts, mixed nuts, peanuts, peanut butter, sunflower seeds, or walnuts (Nuts are high in fat so be mindful of portion sizes."}
