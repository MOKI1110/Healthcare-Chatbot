Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRetinoblastoma\nRetinoblastoma\nRetinoblastoma is a rare eye tumor that usually occurs in children. It is a malignant (cancerous) tumor of the part of the eye called the retina.\nCauses\nRetinoblastoma is caused by a mutation in a gene that controls how cells divide. As a result, cells grow out of control and become cancerous.\nIn about half the cases, this mutation develops in a child whose family has never had eye cancer. In other cases, the mutation occurs in several family members. If the mutation runs in the family, there is a 50% chance that an affected person's children will also have the mutation. These children will therefore have a high risk of developing retinoblastoma themselves.\nThe cancer most often affects children younger than 7 years old. It is most commonly diagnosed in children 1 to 2 years old.\nSymptoms\nOne or both eyes may be affected.\nThe pupil of the eye may appear white or have white spots. A white glow in the eye is often seen in photographs taken with a flash."}

A white glow in the eye is often seen in photographs taken with a flash. Instead of the typical \"red eye\" from the flash, the pupil may appear white or distorted.\nOther symptoms may include:\nCrossed eyes  (\nstrabismus\n)\nDouble vision\nEyes that do not align\nEye pain and redness\nPoor vision\nDiffering\niris\ncolors in each eye\nIf the cancer has spread, bone pain and other symptoms may occur.\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a complete physical exam, including an eye exam. The following tests may be done:\nCT scan of the head\nEye exam with dilation of the pupil\nMRI of the head\nUltrasound of the eye\n(head and eye echoencephalogram)\nTreatment\nTreatment options depend on the size and location of the tumor:\nSmall tumors may be treated by\nlaser surgery\nor cryotherapy (freezing).\nRadiation is used for both a tumor that is within the eye and for larger tumors.\nChemotherapy\nmay be needed if the tumor has spread beyond the eye.\nThe eye may need to be removed (a procedure called enucleation) if the tumor does not respond to other treatments."}

In some cases, it may be the first treatment.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf the cancer has not spread beyond the eye, almost all people can be cured. A cure, however, may require aggressive treatment and even removal of the eye in order to be successful.\nIf the cancer has spread beyond the eye, the likelihood of a cure is lower and depends on how the tumor has spread.\nPossible Complications\nBlindness can occur in the affected eye. The tumor can spread to the eye socket through the optic nerve. It may also spread to the brain, lungs, and bones.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if signs or symptoms of retinoblastoma are present, especially if your child's eyes look abnormal or appear abnormal in photographs.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling can help families understand the risk for retinoblastoma."}
