In some cases, the sympathetic nervous system plays an important role in the pain. Another theory is that CRPS is caused by a triggering of the immune response, which leads to the inflammatory symptoms of redness, warmth, and swelling in the affected area.\nCRPS has two forms:\nCRPS 1 is a chronic nerve disorder that occurs most often in the arms or legs after a minor injury.\nCRPS 2 is caused by an injury to a nerve.\nCRPS is thought to result from damage to the nervous system. This includes the nerves that control the blood vessels and sweat glands.\nThe damaged nerves are no longer able to properly control blood flow, feeling (sensation), and temperature to the affected area."}

The condition can sometimes appear without obvious injury to the affected limb.\nThis condition is more common in people ages 40 to 60, but younger people can develop it, too.\nSymptoms\nThe key symptom is pain that:\nIs intense and often burning and is much stronger than would be expected for the type of injury that occurred.\nGets worse, rather than better over time.\nBegins at the point of injury, but may spread to the whole limb, or to the arm or leg on the opposite side of the body.\nIn most cases, CRPS has three stages. But, CRPS does not always follow this pattern. Some people develop severe symptoms right away."}
