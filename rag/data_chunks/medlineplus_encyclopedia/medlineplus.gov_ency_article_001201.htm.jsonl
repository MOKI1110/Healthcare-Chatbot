Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHartnup disorder\nHartnup disorder\nHartnup disorder is  a genetic condition in which there is a defect in the transport of certain\namino acids\n(such as\ntryptophan\nand histidine) by the small intestine and kidneys.\nCauses\nHartnup disorder is a metabolic condition involving amino acids. It is an inherited condition. This condition occurs due to non-working copies of the\nSLC6A19\ngene. A child must inherit a copy of the variant gene from both parents to be seriously affected.\nThe condition most often appears between ages 3 to 9 years.\nSymptoms\nMost people show no symptoms. If symptoms do occur, they most often appear in childhood and may include:\nDiarrhea\nMood changes\nNervous system (neurologic) problems, such as abnormal muscle tone and uncoordinated movements\nRed, scaly\nskin rash\n, usually when skin is exposed to sunlight\nSensitivity to light (photosensitivity)\nShort stature\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will order a urine test to check for high levels of neutral amino acids."}

The levels of other amino acids may be normal.\nYour provider can test for the gene that causes this condition. Biochemical tests may also be ordered.\nTreatment\nTreatments include:\nAvoiding sun exposure by wearing protective clothing and using a sunscreen with a protection factor of  15 or higher\nEating a high-protein diet\nTaking supplements containing nicotinamide\nUndergoing mental health treatment, such as taking antidepressants or mood stabilizers, if mood swings or other mental health problems occur\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people with this disorder can expect to live a normal life with no disability. Rarely, there have been reports of severe nervous system disease and even deaths in families with this disorder.\nPossible Complications\nIn most cases, there are no complications. Complications when they occur may include:\nChanges in skin color that are permanent\nMental health problems\nRash\nUncoordinated movements\nNervous system symptoms can most often be reversed."}

However, in rare cases they can be severe or life threatening.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of this condition, especially if you have a family history of Hartnup disorder. Genetic counseling is recommended if you have a personal or family history of this condition and are planning a pregnancy.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling prior to marriage and conception may help prevent some cases. Eating a high-protein diet may prevent amino acid deficiencies that cause symptoms.\nReferences\nKliegman RM, St. Geme JW, Blum NJ, et al. Defects in metabolism of amino acids.
