Never give these to a child under age 3, because they can cause choking.\nUse a vaporizer or take a steamy shower to increase moisture in the air to help soothe a dry throat. If you use a humidifier, make sure it is properly cleaned and maintained.\nDrink plenty of fluids. Liquids help thin the mucus in your throat making it easier to cough it up.\nDo not smoke, and stay away from secondhand smoke.\nMedicines you can buy on your own include:\nGuaifenesin helps break up mucus. Follow package instructions on how much to take. Do not take more than the recommended amount."}

Drink lots of fluids if you take this medicine.\nDecongestants help clear a runny nose and relieve postnasal drip. Check with your provider before taking decongestants if you have high blood pressure.\nTalk to your child's provider before you give children ages 6 years or younger an over-the-counter cough medicine, even if it is labeled for children. These medicines likely do not work for children, and can have serious side effects.\nIf you have seasonal allergies, such as hay fever:\nStay indoors during days or times of the day (usually the morning) when airborne allergens are high.\nKeep windows closed and use an air conditioner.\nDo not use fans that draw in air from outdoors.\nShower and change your clothes after being outside.\nIf you have allergies year-round, cover your pillows and mattress with dust mite covers, use an air purifier, and avoid pets with fur and other triggers.\nTreat the underlying cause (per above) as directed by your provider.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCal"}
