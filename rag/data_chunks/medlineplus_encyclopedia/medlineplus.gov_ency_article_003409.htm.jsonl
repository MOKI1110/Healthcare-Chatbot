A tiny drop of blood is collected onto a piece of filter paper and allowed to dry. The dried blood sample is sent to a lab for analysis.\nThe blood sample is examined for increased levels of immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT). This is a protein produced by the pancreas that is linked to CF.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe brief feeling of discomfort will probably cause your baby to cry.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nCystic fibrosis is a disease that is usually passed down through families. CF causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs and parts of the digestive tract."}

CF causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs and parts of the digestive tract. It can lead to breathing and digestive problems.\nChildren with CF who are diagnosed early in life and start treatment at a young age may have better nutrition, growth, and lung function. This screening test helps health care providers identify children with CF before they have symptoms.\nSome states include this test in the routine newborn screening tests that are done before the baby leaves the hospital.\nIf you live in a state that does not perform routine CF screening, your provider will explain whether testing is needed.\nOther tests that look for genetic changes known to cause CF may also be used to screen for CF.\nNormal Results\nIf the test result is negative, the child likely does not have CF. If the test result is negative but the baby has symptoms of CF, further testing will likely be done.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal (positive) result suggests that your child may have CF. But it is important to remember that a positive screening test does not diagnose CF."}

If your child's test is positive, more tests will be done to confirm the possibility of CF.\nSweat chloride test\nis the standard diagnostic test for CF. A high salt level in the person's sweat is a sign of the disease.\nGenetic testing may also be done.\nNot all children with a positive result have CF.\nRisks\nRisks associated with the test include:\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAnxiety over false positive results\nFalse reassurance over false negative results\nAlternative Names\nCystic fibrosis screening - neonatal; Immunoreactive trypsinogen; IRT test; CF - screening\nImages\nInfant blood sample\nReferences\nEgan ME, Schechter MS, Voynow JA.
