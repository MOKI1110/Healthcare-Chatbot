Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nErythropoietin test\nErythropoietin test\nThe erythropoietin test measures the amount of a hormone called erythropoietin (EPO) in blood.\nThe hormone tells stem cells in the bone marrow to make more red blood cells. EPO is made by cells in the kidney. These cells release more EPO when the blood oxygen level is low.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test may be used to help determine the cause of anemia, polycythemia (high red blood cell count) or other bone marrow disorders.\nA change in red blood cells will affect the release of EPO."}

For example, people with anemia have too few red blood cells, so more EPO is produced.\nNormal Results\nThe normal range is 2.6 to 18.5 milliunits per milliliter (mU/mL).\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test result.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIncreased EPO level may be due to secondary polycythemia. This is an overproduction of red blood cells that occurs in response to an event such as low blood oxygen level."}
