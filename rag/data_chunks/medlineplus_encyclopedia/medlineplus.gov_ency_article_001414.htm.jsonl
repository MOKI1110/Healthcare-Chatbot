When an aneurysm occurs in a blood vessel of the brain, it is called an intracranial aneurysm. These usually occur around or under the part of the brain called the cerebrum and, when this is true, are called a cerebral aneurysm.\nCauses\nAneurysms\naround the brain occur when there is a weakened area in the wall of a blood vessel. An aneurysm may be present from birth (congenital). Or, it may develop later in life.\nThere are many types of brain aneurysms. The most common type is called a berry aneurysm. This type can vary in size from a few millimeters (mm) to over a centimeter (cm). Giant berry aneurysms can be bigger than 2.5 cm or 1 inch (in). These are more common in adults."}

This type can vary in size from a few millimeters (mm) to over a centimeter (cm). Giant berry aneurysms can be bigger than 2.5 cm or 1 inch (in). These are more common in adults. Berry aneurysms, especially when there is more than one, are sometimes passed down through families.\nWatch this video about:\nCerebral aneurysm\nOther types of cerebral aneurysms involve widening of an entire blood vessel (fusiform aneurysms). Aneurysms can occur in any blood vessel that supplies the brain. Hardening of arteries (\natherosclerosis\n), trauma, and infection can all injure the blood vessel wall and cause cerebral aneurysms.\nBrain aneurysms are relatively common. One in 50 people has a brain aneurysm, but only a small number of these aneurysms cause symptoms or rupture.\nRisk factors include:\nFamily history of cerebral aneurysms\nMedical problems such as\npolycystic kidney disease\n,\ncoarctation of the aorta\n, and\nendocarditis\nHigh blood pressure, smoking, alcohol, and cocaine, methamphetamine, or amphetamine drug use\nSymptoms\nA person may have an aneurysm without having any symptoms."}

This kind of aneurysm may be found when an MRI or CT scan of the brain is done for another reason.\nA brain aneurysm may begin to leak a small amount of blood. This may cause a severe\nheadache\nthat a person may describe as \"the worst headache of my life.\" It may be called a thunderclap or sentinel headache. This means the headache could be a warning sign of a future rupture that may occur days to weeks after the headache first started.\nSymptoms may also occur if the aneurysm pushes on nearby structures in the brain or breaks open (ruptures) and causes bleeding into the brain.\nSymptoms depend on the location of the aneurysm, whether it breaks open, and what part of the brain it is pushing on. Symptoms may include:\nDouble vision\nLoss of vision\nHeadaches\nEye pain\nNeck pain\nStiff neck\nRinging in the ears\nA sudden, severe headache is one symptom of an aneurysm that has ruptured."}

Sometimes people are too ill to have surgery, or it may be too dangerous to treat the aneurysm because of its location.\nA ruptured aneurysm is an emergency that needs to be treated right away. Treatment may involve:\nBeing admitted to a hospital's intensive care unit (ICU)\nComplete bed rest and activity restrictions\nDrainage of blood from the brain area (cerebral ventricular drainage)\nMedicines to prevent seizures\nMedicines to control headaches and blood pressure\nMedicines to prevent vasospasm, which is a constriction of the arteries of your brain, leading to decreased blood flow\nOnce the aneurysm is repaired, treatment may be needed to prevent a stroke from a blood vessel spasm.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well you do depends on many things."}

Controlling risk factors for atherosclerosis may reduce the likelihood of some types of aneurysms.\nPeople who are known to have an aneurysm may need regular visits with their provider to make sure the aneurysm is not changing size or shape.\nIf unruptured aneurysms are discovered in time, they can be treated before causing problems or monitored with regular imaging (usually yearly).\nThe decision to repair an unruptured cerebral aneurysm is based on the size and location of the aneurysm, and the person's age and general health.\nAlternative Names\nAneurysm - cerebral; Cerebral aneurysm; Aneurysm - intracranial\nPatient Instructions\nBrain aneurysm repair - discharge\nHeadache - what to ask your doctor\nImages\nCerebral aneurysm\nCerebral aneurysm\nReferences\nAmerican Stroke Association websi"}
