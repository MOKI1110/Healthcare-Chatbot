After the body uses what it needs of these vitamins, leftover amounts leave the body through the urine.\nThe body stores vitamin B12 in the liver. It can store a few years' worth of the needed amount.\nFunction\nVitamin B12, like the other B vitamins, is important for protein\nmetabolism\n. It helps in the formation of red blood cells and in the maintenance of the\nnervous system\n.\nFood Sources\nVitamin B12 is naturally found in animal foods such as fish, meat, poultry, eggs, milk, and milk products. Vitamin B12 is not present in plant foods unless fortified. Fortified breakfast cereals are a readily available source of vitamin B12.
