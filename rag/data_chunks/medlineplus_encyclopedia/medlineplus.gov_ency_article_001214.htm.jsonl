Diabetes can be caused by too little insulin, resistance to the action of insulin, or both.\nTo understand diabetes, it is important to first understand the normal process by which food is broken down and used by the body for energy. Several things happen when food is digested and absorbed:\nA sugar called glucose enters the bloodstream. Glucose is a source of fuel for the body.\nAn organ in the upper abdomen, below and behind the stomach, called the pancreas makes insulin. The role of insulin is to move glucose from the bloodstream into muscle, fat, and other cells, where it can be stored or used as fuel.\nPeople with diabetes have high blood sugar because their body cannot move sugar from the blood into muscle and fat cells to be burned or stored for energy, or because their liver makes too much glucose and releases it into the blood."}

This is because:\nTheir pancreas does not make enough insulin\nTheir cells do not respond to insulin normally (also called insulin resistance)\nBoth of the above\nThere are two major types of diabetes. The causes and risk factors are different for each type:\nType 1 diabetes\nis less common, accounting for 5% to 10% of people with diabetes in the United States. It can occur at any age, but it is most often diagnosed in children, teens, or young adults. In this disease, the body makes little or no insulin. This is because the pancreas cells that make insulin are damaged by an immune process and stop working. Daily injections of insulin are needed. The exact cause of the immune process is unknown.\nType 2 diabetes\nis more common, accounting for 90% to 95% of people with diabetes in the United States. It most often occurs in adulthood, but because of high obesity rates, children and teens are now being diagnosed with this disease. Some people with type 2 diabetes do not know they have it."}

With type 2 diabetes, the body is resistant to insulin and doesn't use insulin as well as it should. Not all people with type 2 diabetes are overweight or obese.\nThere are other causes of diabetes, and some people cannot be classified as type 1 or type 2. Examples include LADA (latent autoimmune diabetes in adults, a variant of type 1 diabetes), MODY (maturity-onset diabetes of the young), and diabetes due to other illnesses.\nGestational diabetes\nis diagnosed when high blood sugar develops at any time during pregnancy in a woman who does not already have diabetes.\nIf your parent, brother, or sister has diabetes, you are more likely to develop the disease.\nSymptoms\nA high blood sugar level can cause several symptoms, including:\nBlurry vision\nExcess thirst\nFatigue\nFrequent urination\nHunger\nWeight loss\nBecause type 2 diabetes develops slowly, some people with high blood sugar have no symptoms.\nSymptoms of type 1 diabetes typically develop over a short period, usually weeks to months."}
