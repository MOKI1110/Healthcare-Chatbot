It counteracts the effects of the acetaminophen. Without it, deadly liver failure may occur. Several doses may be required until the blood level drops to a safer value.\nIf there are signs of a severe opioid overdose, the antidote naloxone will be given.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well a person does, depends on the amount of medicine swallowed and how quickly the treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery. If breathing has been depressed for a long period before treatment, brain injury may occur.\nIf an antidote can be given, recovery from an\nacute\noverdose often occurs within 24 to 48 hours. Recovery takes longer, if the liver is affected, and the person may not fully recover.\nAlternative Names\nTylenol #3 overdose; Phenaphen with codeine overdose; Tylenol with codeine overdose\nReferences\nAronson JK.
