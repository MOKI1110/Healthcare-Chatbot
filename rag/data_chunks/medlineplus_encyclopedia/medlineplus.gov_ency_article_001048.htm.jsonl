This is more likely to happen if the sound continues for a long time.\nExamples of sound intensity are:\n90 dB -- a large truck 5 yards (4.5 meters) away (motorcycles, snowmobiles, and similar engines range from 85 to 90 dB)\n100 dB -- some rock concerts\n120 dB -- a jackhammer about 3 feet (1 meter) away\n130 dB -- a jet engine from 100 feet (30 meters) away\nA general rule of thumb is that if you need to shout to be heard, the sound is in the range that can damage hearing.\nSome jobs carry a high risk for\nhearing loss\n, such as:\nAirline ground maintenance\nConstruction\nFarming\nJobs involving loud music or machinery\nMili"}

Both the length of exposure and decibel level are considered. If the sound is at or greater than the maximum levels recommended, you need to take steps to protect your hearing.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom is partial or complete hearing loss. The hearing loss will likely get worse over time with continued exposure.\nNoise in the ear (\ntinnitus\n) may accompany hearing loss.\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam will not show any specific changes in most cases. Tests that may be done include:\nAudiology/audiometry\nCT scan of the head\nMRI of the brain\nTreatment\nThe hearing loss is very often permanent. The goals of treatment are to:\nPrevent further hearing loss\nImprove communication with any remaining hearing\nDevelop coping skills (such as lip reading)\nYou may need to\nlearn to live with hearing loss\n."}
