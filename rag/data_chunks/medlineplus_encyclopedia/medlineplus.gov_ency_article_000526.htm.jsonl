Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCystitis - acute\nCystitis - acute\nAcute cystitis is an infection of the bladder or lower urinary tract. Acute means that the infection begins suddenly.\nCauses\nCystitis is caused by germs, most often bacteria. These germs enter the urethra and then the bladder and can cause an infection. The infection commonly develops in the bladder. It can also spread to the kidneys.\nMost of the time, your body can get rid of these bacteria when you urinate. But, the bacteria can stick to the wall of the urethra or bladder, or grow so fast that some stay in the bladder.\nWomen tend to get infections more often than men. This happens because their urethra is shorter and closer to the anus. Women are more likely to get an infection after sexual intercourse."}

Most of the time, your health care provider can diagnose cystitis using a urinalysis.\nUrine culture --\nA clean catch urine sample\nmay be needed. This test is done to identify the bacteria in the urine and decide on the correct antibiotic. This is often not needed to start treatment of cystitis.\nTreatment\nAntibiotics can be taken by mouth. These are most often given to stop the infection from spreading to the kidneys.\nFor a simple bladder infection, you will take antibiotics for 1 to 5 days (women) or 7 to 14 days (men)."}
