You may also need more and more alcohol to feel drunk. Stopping suddenly may cause\nwithdrawal symptoms\n.\nCauses\nNo one knows what causes problems with alcohol. Health experts think that it may be a combination of a person's:\nGenes\nEnvironment\nPsychology, such as being impulsive or having low self-esteem\nLong-term risks of drinking an excessive amount of alcohol are more likely if:\nYou are a man who has more than 2 drinks per day, or 15 or more drinks a week, or often has 5 or more drinks at a time\nYou are a woman who has more than 1 drink per day, or 8 or more drinks a week, or often has 4 or more drinks at a time\nOne drink is defined as 12 ounces or 360 milliliters (mL) of beer (5% alcohol content), 5 ounces or 150 mL of wine (12% alcohol content), or a 1.5-ounce or 45-mL shot of liquor (80 proof, or 40% alcohol content).\nIf you have a parent with alcohol use disorder, you are more at risk for alcohol problems"}

This is called abstinence. Having strong social and family support can help make it easier to quit drinking.\nSome people are able to just cut back on their drinking. So even if you do not totally give up alcohol, you may be able to\ndrink less\n. This can improve your health and relationships with others. It can also help you perform better at work or school.\nHowever, many people who drink too much find they can't just cut back. Abstinence may be the only way to manage a drinking problem.\nDECIDING TO QUIT\nLike many people with an alcohol problem, you may not recognize that your drinking has gotten out of your control. An important first step is to be aware of\nhow much you drink\n. It also helps to understand the\nhealth risks of alcohol\n.\nIf you\ndecide to quit drinking\n, talk with your provider."}

Treatment involves helping you realize how much your alcohol use is harming your life and the lives of those around you.\nDepending on how much and how long you have been drinking, you may be at risk for alcohol withdrawal. Withdrawal can be very uncomfortable and even life threatening. If you have been drinking a lot, you should cut back or stop drinking only under the care of a provider. Talk with your provider about\nhow to stop using alcohol\n.\nLONG-TERM SUPPORT\nAlcohol recovery or support programs can help you stop drinking completely. These programs usually offer:\nEducation about alcohol use and its effects\nCounseling and therapy to discuss how to control your thoughts and behaviors\nPhysical health care\nFor the best chance of success, you should live with people who support your efforts to avoid alcohol. Some programs offer housing options for people with alcohol problems."}

This is called medication-assisted treatment (MAT). While MAT doesn't work for everyone, it is another option in treating the disorder. These medicines are often used for MAT.\nAcamprosate helps reduce cravings and dependence on alcohol in people who have recently stopped drinking.\nDisulfiram should only be used after you stop drinking. It causes a very bad reaction when you drink, which helps prevent you from drinking.\nNaltrexone blocks pleasurable feelings of intoxication, which may help you cut back or stop drinking.\nIt's a common misconception that taking medicine to treat alcohol use disorder is trading one addiction for another.

If you have a mood disorder, it may become more noticeable when you stop drinking. Your provider will treat any mental disorders in addition to your alcohol treatment.\nDrinking significantly may also cause depression and anxiety. You need to stop drinking for at least a month to see if these symptoms get better and do not need further treatment.\nSupport Groups\nSupport groups\nhelp many people who are dealing with alcohol use. Talk to your provider about a support group that might be right for you.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well a person does depends on whether they can successfully cut back or stop drinking.\nIt may take several tries to stop drinking for good.
