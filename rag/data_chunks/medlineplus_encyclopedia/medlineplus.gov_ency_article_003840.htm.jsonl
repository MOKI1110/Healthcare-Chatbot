The skin is tested to look for skin conditions or diseases. A skin biopsy can help your health care provider diagnose or rule out problems such as skin cancer or\npsoriasis\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nMost procedures can be done in your provider's office or an outpatient medical office. There are several ways to do a skin biopsy. Which procedure you have depends on the location, size, and type of lesion. A lesion is an abnormal area of the skin. This can be a lump, sore, or an area of skin color that is not normal.\nBefore a biopsy, your provider will numb the area of skin so you don't feel anything. The different types of skin biopsies are described below.\nSHAVE BIOPSY\nYour provider uses a small blade or razor to remove or scrape the outermost layers of skin.\nAll or part of the lesion is removed.\nYou will not need stitches."}

This procedure will leave a small indented area in your skin.\nThis type of biopsy is often done when a skin cancer is suspected, or a rash that seems to be limited to the top layer of skin.\nPUNCH BIOPSY\nYour provider uses a cookie cutter-like skin punch tool to remove deeper layers of skin. The area removed is about the shape and size of a pencil eraser.\nIf an infection or immune disorder is suspected, your provider may perform more than one biopsy. One of the biopsies is examined under the microscope, the other is sent to the lab for testing such as for germs (\nskin culture\n) and certain chemicals.\nIt includes all or part of the lesion. You may have stitches to close the area.\nThis type of biopsy is often done to diagnose\nrashes\n.\nEXCISIONAL BIOPSY\nYour provider uses a surgical knife (scalpel) to remove the entire lesion."}

If the whole skin lesion was not removed at the time of biopsy, you and your provider may decide to completely remove it.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nOnce the biopsy confirms the diagnosis, your provider will start a treatment plan. A few of the skin problems that may be diagnosed are:\nPsoriasis\nor dermatitis\nInfection from bacteria or fungus\nMelanoma\nBasal cell skin cancer\nSquamous cell skin cancer\nRisks\nRisks of a skin biopsy may include:\nInfection\nScar or\nkeloids\nYou will bleed slightly during the procedure.\nConsiderations\nYou will go home with a bandage over the area.
