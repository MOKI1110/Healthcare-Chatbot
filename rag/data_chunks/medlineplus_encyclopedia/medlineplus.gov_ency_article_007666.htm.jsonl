Symptoms include fever,\njoint pain\n, rash, and red eyes (\nconjunctivitis\n).\nCauses\nThe Zika virus is named after the Zika forest in Uganda, where the virus was first discovered in 1947.\nHOW ZIKA CAN SPREAD\nMosquitoes spread the Zika virus from person to person.\nMosquitoes acquire the virus when they feed on infected people. They then spread the virus when they bite other people.\nThe mosquitoes that spread Zika are the same type that spread\ndengue fever\nand\nchikungunya virus\n."}

They then spread the virus when they bite other people.\nThe mosquitoes that spread Zika are the same type that spread\ndengue fever\nand\nchikungunya virus\n. These mosquitoes usually feed during the day.\nZika can be passed from a mother to her baby.\nThis can happen in the uterus or at the time of birth.\nZika has not been found to spread through breastfeeding.\nThe virus can be spread through sex.\nPeople with Zika can spread the disease to their sex partners before symptoms begin, while they have symptoms, or even after symptoms end.\nThe virus can also be passed during sex by people with Zika who never develop symptoms.\nNo one knows how long Zika remains in sperm and vaginal fluids, or how long it can be spread during sex.\nThe virus remains in semen longer than in other body fluids (blood, urine, vaginal fluids).\nZika can also be spread through:\nBlood transfusion\nExposure in a laboratory\nWHERE ZIKA IS FOUND\nBefore 2015, the virus was found mainly in Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Pacific Islands."}

In May 2015, the virus was discovered for the first time in Brazil.\nIt spread to many territories, states, and countries in:\nCaribbean Islands\nCentral America\nMexico\nSouth America\nPacific Islands\nAfrica\nThe virus was confirmed in Puerto Rico, American Samoa, and United States Virgin Islands.\nThe disease has been found in travelers coming to the United States from affected areas.\nCases in the US have been diagnosed in Florida and Texas. Since 2019, there have been no confirmed Zika virus disease cases reported in the United States.\nTo find the most up-to-date information on area where Zika may be found, please see the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) page\nZika Travel Information\n.\nSymptoms\nOnly about 1 in 5 people infected with Zika virus will have symptoms. This means that you can have Zika and not know it.\nSymptoms tend to occur 2 to 7 days after being bitten by an infected mosquito."}

You also may be tested for other viruses spread by mosquitoes, such as dengue and chikungunya.\nTreatment\nThere is no treatment for Zika. Like the flu virus, it has to run its course. You can take steps to help relieve symptoms:\nDrink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.\nGet plenty of rest.\nTake acetaminophen (Tylenol) to relieve pain and fever.\nDo not take aspirin, ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), or any other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) until your provider confirms that you do not have dengue."}

These medicines can cause bleeding in people with dengue.\nPossible Complications\nA Zika infection during pregnancy can cause a rare condition called\nmicrocephaly\n. It occurs when the brain does not grow as it should in the womb or after birth and causes babies to be born with a smaller-than-normal head.\nIntense research is currently being done to understand how the virus may spread from mothers to unborn babies and how the virus may affect babies.\nSome people infected with Zika have later developed\nGuillain-BarrÃ© syndrome\n. It is unclear why this may occur.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of Zika.

The best way to avoid getting the virus is to avoid getting bitten by mosquitoes.\nThe CDC recommends that all people traveling to areas where Zika is present take steps to protect themselves from mosquito bites.\nCover up with long sleeves, long pants, socks, and a hat.\nUse clothing coated with permethrin.\nUse insect repellent with DEET, picaridin, IR3535, oil of lemon eucalyptus, or para-menthane-diol. When using sunscreen, apply insect repellent after you apply sunscreen.\nSleep in a room with air conditioning or with windows with screens."}

This will help ensure you don't spread Zika to mosquitoes in your area.\nThe CDC makes these recommendations for women who are pregnant:\nDo not travel to any area where the Zika virus occurs.\nIf you must travel to one of these areas, talk to your provider first and strictly follow steps to prevent mosquito bites during your trip.\nIf you are pregnant and have traveled to an area where Zika is present, tell your provider.\nIf you travel to an area with Zika, you should be tested for Zika within 2 weeks of returning home, whether or not you have symptoms.\nIf you live in an area with Zika, you should talk with your provider throughout your pregnancy."}
