Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSinus MRI scan\nSinus MRI scan\nA magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the sinuses creates detailed pictures of the air-filled spaces inside the skull.\nThese spaces are called the sinuses. The test is noninvasive.\nMRI uses powerful magnets and radio waves instead of radiation. Signals from the magnetic field bounce off your body and are sent to a computer. There, they are turned into images. Different types of tissues send back different signals.\nSingle MRI images are called slices. The images can be stored on a computer or printed on film. One exam produces dozens or sometimes hundreds of images.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou may be asked to wear a hospital gown or clothing without metal snaps or zippers (such as sweatpants and a t-shirt). Certain types of metal can cause blurry images.\nYou will lie on a narrow table, which slides into a tunnel-shaped scanner.\nSmall devices, called coils, are placed around the head. These devices help improve the quality of the images.\nSome exams require a special dye (contrast)."}

These devices help improve the quality of the images.\nSome exams require a special dye (contrast). The dye is usually given before the test through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. The dye helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly.\nDuring the MRI, the person who operates the machine will watch you from another room. The test most often lasts 30 minutes, but may take longer.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nBefore the test, tell the radiologist or technician if you have kidney problems. This may affect whether you can have IV contrast.\nIf you fear confined spaces (have claustrophobia), tell your health care provider before the exam. You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious. Your provider may also recommend an \"open\" MRI, in which the machine is not as close to the body.\nThe strong magnetic fields created during an MRI can interfere with pacemakers and other implants. People with most cardiac pacemakers cannot have an MRI and should not enter an MRI area. Some newer pacemakers are made that are safe with MRI."}

You will need to confirm with your provider if your pacemaker is safe in an MRI.\nYou may not be able to have an MRI if you have any of the following metallic objects in your body:\nBrain aneurysm clips\nCertain types of artificial heart valves\nHeart defibrillator or pacemaker\nInner ear (cochlear) implants\nRecently placed artificial joints\nCertain types of vascular stents\nPain pumps\nTell your provider if you have one of these devices when scheduling the test, so the exact type of metal can be determined.\nBefore an MRI, sheet metal workers or people who may have been exposed to small metal fragments should receive a skull x-ray. This is to check for metal in the eyes.\nBecause the MRI contains a magnet, metal-containing objects such as pens, pocketknives, and eyeglasses may fly across the room."}

Some people may become anxious inside the scanner. If you have problems lying still or are very nervous, you may be given medicine to help you feel calm (sedative). Too much movement can blur MRI images and cause errors.\nThe table may be hard or cold. You can ask for a blanket or pillow. The machine produces loud thumping and humming noises when turned on. You can wear ear plugs to help reduce the noise.\nAn intercom in the room lets you speak to the person operating the scanner at any time."}

After an MRI scan, you can go back your normal diet, activity, and medicines.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test provides detailed pictures of the sinuses. Your provider may order this test if you have:\nAbnormal nasal drainage\nAn abnormal finding on an x-ray or\nnasal endoscopy\nBirth defect of the sinuses\nLoss of smell\nNasal airway blockage that does not get better with treatment\nRepeated bloody noses (\nepistaxis\n)\nSigns of injury to the sinus area\nUnexplained headaches\nUnexplained sinus pain that does not get better with treatment\nYour provider may also order this test to:\nDetermine if nasal polyps have spread beyond the nose area\nEvaluate an infection or abscess\nIdentify a mass or tumor, including cancer\nPlan sinus surgery or monitor your progress after surgery\nNormal Results\nResults are considered normal if the organs and structures being examined are"}

No side effects from MRI have been reported. The most common type of contrast (dye) used is gadolinium. It is very safe. Allergic reactions to this dye rarely occur. The person operating the machine will monitor your heart rate and breathing.\nVery rarely, people with kidney failure or chronic kidney disease can develop a serious reaction to the contrast (dye)."}

If you have kidney problems, it is important to tell the MRI technologist and your provider before you get this dye.\nSinus MRI is usually not recommended for acute trauma situations, because traction and life-support equipment cannot safely enter the scanner area and the exam can take quite a bit of time.\nPeople have been harmed in MRI machines when they did not remove metal objects from their clothes or when metal objects were left in the room by others.\nConsiderations\nTests that may be done instead of a sinus MRI include:\nCT scan of the sinuses\nX-ray of the sinuses\nA CT scan may be preferred in emergency cases, since it is faster and often available in the emergency room.\nNote:\nMRI is not as effective as CT in defining the anatomy of the sinuses, and therefore is not typically used for suspected acute sinusitis.\nAlternative Names\nMRI of the sinuses; Magnetic resonance imaging - sinuses; Maxillary sinus MRI\nReferences\nKhan M, Zinreich J, Aygun N.
