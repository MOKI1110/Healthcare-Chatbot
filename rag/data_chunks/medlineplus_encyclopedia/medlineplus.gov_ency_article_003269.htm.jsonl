They may have features of both sexes or not be fully developed. The characteristics of the child's genitals may not match their internal sex organs or their genetic sex.\nThis condition is also called uncertain genitalia or atypical genitalia.\nAmbiguous genitalia is common in children with\ndifferences of sex development\n(DSD).\nConsiderations\nThe genetic sex of a child is determined at conception. The mother's egg cell contains an X\nchromosome\n, while the father's sperm cell contains either an X or a Y chromosome. These X and Y chromosomes determine the child's genetic sex.\nNormally, an infant inherits 1 pair of sex chromosomes, 1 X from the mother and 1 X or 1 Y from the father. A baby who inherits the X chromosome from the father has 2 X chromosomes and is a genetic female."}

A baby who inherits the X chromosome from the father has 2 X chromosomes and is a genetic female. A baby who inherits the Y chromosome from the father has 1 X and 1 Y chromosome and is a genetic male.\nThe male and female reproductive organs and genitals both come from the same tissue in the fetus. Ambiguous genitalia can develop if the process that causes this fetal tissue to become \"male\" or \"female\" is disrupted. This means the external genitals do look clearly male or female or may have characteristics of both. The physical appearance of people with this condition can vary widely. Very rarely, the physical appearance may be fully developed as the opposite of the genetic sex."}

The physical appearance of people with this condition can vary widely. Very rarely, the physical appearance may be fully developed as the opposite of the genetic sex. For example, a genetic male may have developed the appearance of a female.\nIn most cases, ambiguous genitalia in genetic females (infants with 2 X chromosomes) has the following features:\nAn enlarged clitoris that looks like a small\npenis\n.\nThe urethral opening (where urine comes out) can be anywhere along, above, or below the surface of the clitoris.\nThe labia may be fused and look like a\nscrotum\n.\nThe infant may be thought to be a male with\nundescended testicles\n.\nSometimes a lump of tissue is felt within the fused labia, further making it look like a scrotum with\ntesticles\n.\nIn a genetic male (1 X and 1 Y chromosome), ambiguous genitalia most often include the following features:\nA small penis (less than 2 to 3 centimeters, or 3/4 to 1 1/4 inches) that looks like an enlarged clitoris (the clitoris of a newborn female is normally somewhat enlarged at birth).\nThe urethral opening may be anywhere along, above, or below the penis (\nhypospadias\n)."}

However, its treatment has short- and long-term consequences. For this reason, a team of health care professionals with expertise in DSD will work together to understand and treat the child and support the family. This team may include neonatologists, geneticists, endocrinologists, and psychiatrists or social workers. The specific treatment will depend on the specific cause of the ambiguous genitalia.\nCauses\nCauses for ambiguous genitalia include:\n46,XX disorder of sex development (DSD) and 46,XY DSD. The genitalia are of one sex, but some physical characteristics of the other sex are present.\nOvotesticular DSD."}
