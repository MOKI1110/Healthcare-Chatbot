This uses medicines that keep you asleep and pain-free.\nFor a breast reduction, the surgeon removes some of the breast tissue and skin. Your nipples may be moved higher to reposition them for cosmetic reasons.\nIn the most common procedure:\nThe surgeon makes three surgical cuts (incisions) around the areola (the dark area around your nipples), from the areola down to the crease under your breast, and across the lower crease of your breast.\nExtra fat, skin, and breast tissue are removed. The nipple and areola are moved to a higher position. Often the areola is made smaller.\nThe surgeon closes the cuts with stitches to reshape the breast."}

You may need to wear a special supportive bra for a few months for comfort and to help with healing.\nScars are permanent. They will be more visible for the first year, but will then fade. The surgeon will make every effort to place the surgical cuts so that scars are hidden. Cuts are usually made on the underside of the breast and around the areola. Most of the time, the scars should not be noticeable, even in low-cut clothing. Your surgeon will give you instructions on how to care for your scars.\nAlternative Names\nReduction mammoplasty; Macromastia - reduction\nPatient Instructions\nCosmetic breast surgery - discharge\nImages\nMammoplasty\nReferences\nAmerican Board of Cosmetic Surgery website.
