The size of the affected blood vessels helps to determine the names of these conditions and how the disorder causes disease.\nCauses\nNecrotizing vasculitis may be the primary condition such as in people with\npolyarteritis nodosa\nor\ngranulomatosis with ANCA associated vasculitis\n(formerly called Wegener granulomatosis). In other cases, the vasculitis may occur as part of another disorder, such as systemic lupus erythematosus or hepatitis C.\nThe cause of the inflammation is unknown. It is likely related to\nautoimmune\nfactors. The wall of the blood vessel may scar and thicken or die (become\nnecrotic\n). The blood vessel may close, interrupting blood flow to the tissues it supplies. The lack of blood flow will cause the tissues to die. Sometimes the blood vessel may break and bleed (rupture).\nNecrotizing vasculitis may affect blood vessels in any part of the body."}

Therefore, it can cause problems in the skin, brain, lungs, intestines, kidney, brain, joints or any other organ.\nSymptoms\nFever, chills, fatigue, arthritis, or weight loss may be the only symptoms at first. However, symptoms may be in almost any part of the body.\nSkin:\nRed or purple colored bumps on the legs, hands or other parts of the body\nBluish color to the fingers and toes\nSigns of tissue death due to lack of oxygen such as pain, redness, and ulcers that do not heal\nMuscles and joints:\nJoint pain\nLeg pain\nMuscle weakness\nBrain and nervous system:\nPain,\nnumbness\n, tingling in an arm, leg, or other body area\nWeakness of an arm, leg, or other body area\nPupils that are different sizes\nEyelid drooping\nSwallowing difficulty\nSpeech impairment\nMovement difficulty\nLungs and respiratory tract:\nCough\nShortness of breath\nSinus congestion and pain\nCoughing up blood or bleeding from the nose\nOther symptoms include:\nAbdominal pain\nBlood in the urine\nor\nstools\nHoarseness or changing voice\nChest"}

These include azathioprine, methotrexate, and mycophenolate. These medicines are often used along with corticosteroids. This combination makes it possible to control the disease with a lower dose of corticosteroids.\nFor severe disease, cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) has been used for many years. However, rituximab (Rituxan) is equally effective and is less toxic.\nRecently, tocilizumab (Actemra) was shown to be effective for giant cell arteritis so the dose of corticosteroids could be reduced.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nNecrotizing vasculitis can be serious and life-threatening disease. The outcome depends on the location of the vasculitis and the severity of tissue damage. Complications may occur from the disease and from the medicines."}
