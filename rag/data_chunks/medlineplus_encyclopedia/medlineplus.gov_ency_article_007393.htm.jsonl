Fatty deposits can build up inside the arteries and block blood flow.\nstent\nis a small, metal mesh tube that keeps the artery open after angioplasty.\nAngioplasty and stent placement are two ways to open\nblocked peripheral arteries.\nDescription\nAngioplasty uses a medical \"balloon\" to widen blocked arteries. The balloon presses against the inside wall of the artery to open the space and improve blood flow. A metal stent is often placed across the artery wall to keep the artery from narrowing again.\nTo treat a blockage, angioplasty can be done in the following locations:\nAorta, the main artery that comes from your heart\nArtery in your hip or pelvis\nArtery in your thigh\nArtery behind your knee\nArtery in your lower leg\nBefore the procedure:\nYou will be given medicine to help you relax."}

You will be awake, but sleepy.\nYou may also be given blood-thinning medicine to keep a\nblood clot\nfrom forming.\nYou will lie down on your back on a padded operating table. Your surgeon will inject some numbing medicine into the area that will be treated, so that you do not feel pain. This is called local anesthesia.\nYour surgeon will then place a tiny needle into the blood vessel in your groin. A tiny flexible wire will be inserted through this needle.\nYour surgeon will be able to see your artery with live x-ray pictures. Dye will be injected into your body to show blood flow through your arteries."}

Dye will be injected into your body to show blood flow through your arteries. The dye will make it easier to see the blocked area.\nYour surgeon will guide a thin tube called a catheter through your artery to the blocked area.\nNext, your surgeon will pass a guide wire through the catheter to the blockage.\nThe surgeon will push another catheter with a very small balloon on the end over the guide wire and into the blocked area.\nThe balloon is then filled with contrast fluid to inflate the balloon. This opens the blocked vessel and restores blood flow through your artery.\nA stent may also be placed in the blocked area. The stent is inserted at the same time as the balloon catheter. It expands when the balloon is blown up. The stent is left in place to help keep the artery open. The balloon and all the wires are then removed.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nSymptoms of a blocked peripheral artery are pain, achiness, or heaviness in your leg that starts or gets worse when you walk.\nYou may not need this procedure if you can still do most of your everyday activities."}
