Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAcute coronary syndrome\nAcute coronary syndrome\nAcute coronary syndrome is a term for a group of conditions that suddenly stop or severely reduce blood from flowing to the heart muscle. When blood cannot flow to the heart muscle, the heart muscle can become damaged.\nHeart attack\nand\nunstable angina\nare both acute coronary syndromes (ACS).\nCauses\nA fatty substance called plaque can build up in the arteries that bring oxygen-rich blood to your heart. Plaque is made up of cholesterol, fat, cells, and other substances.\nPlaque can block blood flow in two ways:\nIt can cause an artery to become so narrow over time that it becomes blocked enough to cause symptoms.\nThe plaque tears suddenly and a blood clot forms around it, severely narrowing or blocking the artery.\nMany\nrisk factors for heart disease\nmay lead to an ACS.\nSymptoms\nThe most common symptom of ACS is chest pain. The chest pain may come on quickly, come and go, or get worse with exercise or rest."}

The chest pain may come on quickly, come and go, or get worse with exercise or rest. Other symptoms can include:\nPain in the shoulder, arm, neck, jaw, back, or belly area\nDiscomfort that feels like tightness, squeezing, crushing, burning, choking, or aching\nDiscomfort that occurs at rest and does not easily go away when you take medicine\nShortness of breath\nAnxiety\nNausea\nSweating\nFeeling dizzy or lightheaded\nFast or irregular heartbeat\nWomen and older people often experience these other symptoms, although chest pain is common for them as well.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will do an exam, listen to your chest with a stethoscope, and ask about your medical history.\nTests for ACS include:\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG) -- An ECG is usually the first test your provider will run. It measures your heart's electrical activity. During the test, you will have small pads taped to your chest and other areas of your body.\nBlood test -- Some blood tests help show the cause of chest pain and see if you are at a high risk for a heart attack."}

A\ntroponin blood test\ncan show if the cells in your heart have been damaged. This test can confirm you are having a heart attack.\nEchocardiogram\n-- This test uses sound waves to look at your heart. It shows if your heart has been damaged and can find some types of heart problems.\nCoronary angiography\nmay be done right away or when you are more stable. This test:\nUses a special dye and x-rays to see how blood flows through your heart\nCan help your provider decide which treatments you need next\nOther tests to look at your heart that may be done while you are in the hospital include:\nExercise stress test\nNuclear stress test\nStress echocardiography\nTreatment\nYour provider may use medicines, surgery, or other procedures to treat your symptoms and restore blood flow to your heart. Your treatment depends on your condition and the amount of blockage in your arteries."}

Your treatment depends on your condition and the amount of blockage in your arteries. Your treatment may include:\nMedicine -- Your provider may give you one or more types of medicine, including aspirin, beta blockers, statins, blood thinners, clot dissolving medicines (thrombolytics), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or nitroglycerin. These medicines may help prevent or break up a blood clot, treat high blood pressure or angina, relieve chest pain, and stabilize your heart.\nAngioplasty\n-- This procedure opens the clogged artery using a long, thin tube called a catheter. The tube is placed in the artery and the provider inserts a small deflated balloon. The balloon is inflated inside the artery to open it up."}

If you have symptoms of an ACS, call 911 or the local emergency number quickly.\nDo not:\nTry to drive yourself to the hospital.\nWait - If you are having a heart attack, you are at greatest risk for sudden death in the early hours.\nPrevention\nThere is a lot you can do to help prevent ACS.\nEat a heart-healthy diet\n. Have plenty of fruits, veggies, whole grains, and lean meats. Try to limit foods high in cholesterol and saturated fats, since too much of these substances can clog your arteries.\nGet exercise."}
