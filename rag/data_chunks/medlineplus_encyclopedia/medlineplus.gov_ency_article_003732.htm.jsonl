A brushing of the intestine lining can also be taken.\nThe sample is sent to a laboratory. There it is sliced, stained, and placed on a microscope slide to be examined.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will need to have an EGD or enteroscopy procedure for the sample to be taken. Prepare for this procedure in the way your health care provider recommends.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou are not involved in the test once the sample is taken.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order this test to look for an infection or other disease of the small intestine."}

In most cases, this test is done only when a diagnosis could not be made using stool and blood tests.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means that there were no indicators of disease when the sample was examined under the microscope.\nThe small intestine normally contains certain healthy bacteria and yeast. Their presence is not a sign of disease.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result may mean that certain microorganisms, such as the parasites giardia or strongyloides were seen in the tissue sample. It may also mean that there were changes in the structure (anatomy) of the tissue.\nThe biopsy may also reveal evidence of celiac disease, Whipple disease or Crohn disease.\nRisks\nThere are no risks associated with a laboratory culture."}
