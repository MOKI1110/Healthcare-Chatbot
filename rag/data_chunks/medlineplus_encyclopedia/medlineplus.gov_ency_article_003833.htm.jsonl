Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBone scan\nBone scan\nA bone scan is an imaging test used to diagnose bone diseases and find out how severe they are.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA bone scan involves injecting a very small amount of radioactive material (radiotracer) into a vein. This substance travels through your blood to your bones and organs. As it wears off, it gives off a bit of radiation. This radiation is detected by a camera that slowly scans your body. The camera takes pictures of how much radiotracer collects in your bones.\nIf a bone scan is done to see if you have a bone infection, images may be taken shortly after the radioactive material is injected and again 3 to 4 hours later, when it has collected in your bones. This process is called a 3-phase bone scan.\nTo evaluate whether\ncancer\nhas spread to the bone (\nmetastatic\nbone disease), images are taken only after the 3- to 4-hour delay.\nThe scanning part of the test will last about 1 hour. The scanner's camera may move above and around you."}

The scanner's camera may move above and around you. You may need to change positions.\nYou will probably be asked to drink extra water after you receive the radiotracer to help flush the material from your bladder.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou must remove jewelry and other metal objects. You may be asked to wear a hospital gown.\nTell your health care provider if you are or may be pregnant.\nDo not take any medicine with bismuth in it, such as Pepto-Bismol, for 4 days before the test.\nFollow any other instructions you are given.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThere is a small amount of pain when the needle is inserted. During the scan, there is no pain. You must remain still during the scan. Your technician will tell you when to change positions.\nYou may experience some discomfort due to lying still for a long period.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA bone scan can be used to:\nDiagnose a\nbone tumor\nor cancer.\nDetermine if a cancer that began elsewhere in your body has spread to your bones."}

Hot spots are areas where there is an increased collection of the radioactive material."}

Hot spots are areas where there is an increased collection of the radioactive material. Cold spots are areas that have taken up less of the radioactive material.\nBone scan findings must be compared with other imaging studies, such as x-rays or\nCT scans\n, in addition to clinical information. Your provider will discuss any abnormal findings with you.\nRisks\nIf you are pregnant or nursing, the test may be postponed to prevent exposing your baby to radiation. If you must have the test while breastfeeding, some providers recommend you should pump and throw away the breast milk for the next 3 days. Check with your provider about what is best for you.\nThe amount of radiation injected into your vein is very small. All radiation is gone from your body within 2 to 3 days. The radiotracer that is used exposes you to a very small amount of radiation."}
