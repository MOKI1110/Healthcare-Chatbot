Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFactor V assay\nFactor V assay\nThe factor V assay is a blood test to measure the activity of factor V. This is one of the proteins in the body that helps the blood clot.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is used to find the cause of too much bleeding (decreased blood clotting). This decreased clotting may be caused by an abnormally low level of factor V.\nNormal Results\nThe value is normally 50% to 200% of the lab control or reference value.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different lab. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples."}

Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nDecreased factor V activity may be related to:\nFactor V deficiency\n(a bleeding disorder that affects the ability of blood to clot). It can rarely be due to an inherited condition associated with a variant gene.\nDisorder in which the proteins that regulate blood clotting become overactive (\ndisseminated intravascular coagulation\n).\nLiver disease\n(such as\ncirrhosis\n).\nAbnormal breakdown of blood clots (\nsecondary fibrinolysis\n).\nA rare autoimmune condition where the body forms antibodies that affect factor V levels.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other."}

The risk of excessive bleeding is slightly greater than for people without bleeding problems.\nAlternative Names\nLabile factor; Proaccelerin; Ac-globulin\nReferences\nGailani D, Benjamin FT, Wheeler AP.
