The most common type is called adenocarcinoma. It starts from one of the cell types found in the lining of the stomach.\nAdenocarcinoma is a common cancer of the digestive tract. It is less common in the stomach in the United States, compared to Asia. It is diagnosed much more often in people in eastern Asia, parts of South America, and eastern and central Europe.\nThe number of people in the United States who develop this cancer has decreased over time."}

Experts think this decrease may be in part because people are eating less salted, cured, and smoked foods.\nYou are more likely to be diagnosed with gastric cancer if you:\nHave a diet low in fruits and vegetables\nHave a family history of gastric cancer\nHave an infection of the stomach by a bacteria called\nHelicobacter pylori\n(H pylori)\nHad a polyp (abnormal growth) larger than 2 centimeters in your stomach\nHave inflammation and swelling of the stomach for a long time (chronic atrophic\ngastritis\n)\nHave\npernicious anemia\n(low number of red blood cells from intestines not properly absorbing vitamin B12)\nSmoke\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of stomach cancer may include any of the following:\nAbdominal fullness or pain, which may occur after a small meal\nDark stools\nDifficulty swallowing, which becomes worse over time\nExcessive belching\nGeneral decline in health\nLoss of appetite\nNausea\nVomiting blood\nWeakness or fatigue\nWeight loss\nExams and Tests\nThe diagnosis is often delayed because there may be no sy"}

And many of the symptoms do not specifically point to the stomach. So, people often self-treat symptoms that gastric cancer has in common with other, less serious, disorders (bloating, gas, heartburn, and fullness).\nTests that can help diagnose gastric cancer include:\nComplete blood count\n(CBC) to check for\nanemia.\nEsophagogastroduodenoscopy\n(EGD) with\nbiopsy\nto examine the esophagus and the stomach tissue. EGD involves putting a small camera down the esophagus (food tube) to look at the inside of the stomach.\nStool test\nto check for blood in the stools.\nTreatment\nSurgery to remove the stomach (\ngastrectomy\n) before the cancer has spread is the standard treatment that can cure adenocarcinoma of the stomach. Chemotherapy may be given before and after surgery to improve outcomes.\nFor people who cannot have surgery, chemotherapy or radiation may improve symptoms and may prolong survival, but will not cure the cancer."}

For some people, a surgical bypass procedure may relieve symptoms.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\ncancer support group\n. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nYour outlook varies based on how much the cancer has spread by the time of diagnosis. Tumors in the lower stomach are cured more often than those in the upper stomach. The chance of a cure also depends on how far the tumor has invaded the stomach wall and whether lymph nodes are involved.\nWhen the tumor has spread outside the stomach, a cure is less likely."}

When a cure is not possible, the goal of treatment is to improve symptoms and prolong life.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you develop symptoms of gastric cancer.\nPrevention\nScreening programs are successful in detecting disease in the early stages in parts of the world where the risk for stomach cancer is much higher than in the United States. The value of screening in the United States and other countries with much lower rates of stomach cancer is not clear.\nThe following may help reduce your risk for stomach cancer:\nDo not smoke.\nEat a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables.\nTake medicines to treat\nreflux disease\n(heartburn), if you have it.\nTake antibiotics if you are diagnosed with\nH pylori\ninfection.\nAlternative Names\nCancer - stomach; Gastric cancer; Gastric carcinoma; Adenocarcinoma of the stomach\nImages\nDigestive system\nStomach cancer, x-ray\nStomach\nReferences\nKu GY, Ilson DH.
