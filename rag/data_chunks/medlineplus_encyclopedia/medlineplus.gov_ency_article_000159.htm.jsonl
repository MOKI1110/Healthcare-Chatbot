Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCoronary artery spasm\nCoronary artery spasm\nThe coronary arteries supply blood and oxygen to the heart. Coronary artery spasm is a brief, sudden narrowing of one of these arteries.\nCauses\nCoronary artery spasm often occurs in coronary arteries that have not become hardened due to plaque buildup. However, it also can occur in arteries with plaque buildup.\nThese spasms are due to a squeezing of muscles in the artery wall. They most often occur in just one area of the artery. The coronary artery may appear normal during testing, but it does not function normally at other times.\nAbout 2% of people with\nangina\n(chest pain and pressure) have coronary artery spasm.\nCoronary artery spasm occurs most commonly in people who smoke or who have\nhigh cholesterol\nor\nhigh blood pressure\n."}

It may occur without cause, or it may be triggered by:\nAlcohol withdrawal\nEmotional\nstress\nExposure to cold\nMedicines that cause narrowing of the blood vessels (\nvasoconstriction\n)\nStimulant drugs, such as amphetamines and cocaine\nCocaine use and cigarette smoking can cause severe spasms of the arteries. This causes the heart to work harder. In many people, coronary artery spasm may occur without any other heart risk factors (such as smoking, diabetes, high blood pressure, and high cholesterol).\nSymptoms\nSpasm may be \"silent\" (without symptoms) or it may result in chest pain or angina. If the spasm lasts long enough, it may even cause a\nheart attack\n.\nThe main symptom is a type of chest pain called angina. Typically, the chest pain feels like tightness, heavy pressure, squeezing, or a crushing feeling. It may spread to the:\nArm (most often the left)\nBack\nJaw\nNeck\nShoulder\nSome people say the pain feels like gas or indigestion. It is most often severe."}

A medicine called nitroglycerin (NTG) can relieve an episode of pain.\nYour health care provider may prescribe other medicines to prevent chest pain. You may need long term treatment with a type of medicine called a calcium channel blocker or a long-acting nitrate.\nBeta-blockers are another type of medicine that is used with other coronary artery problems."}

The pain may be due to a heart attack. Rest and nitroglycerin often do not completely relieve the pain of a heart attack.\nA heart attack is a medical emergency. If you have symptoms of a heart attack, seek medical help right away.\nPrevention\nTake steps to reduce your risk of developing heart disease. Some studies have shown that making a few lifestyle changes can reduce your risk for heart disease. Lifestyle changes can also help prevent some angina attacks."}
