A corneal transplant is surgery to replace the cornea with tissue from a donor. It is one of the most common transplants done.\nDescription\nYou will most likely be awake during the transplant. You will get medicine to relax you. Local anesthesia (numbing medicine) will be injected around your eye to block pain and prevent eye movement during the surgery.\nThe tissue for your corneal transplant will come from a person (donor) who has recently died."}

The donated cornea is processed and tested by a local eye bank to make sure it is safe for use in your surgery.\nFor years, the most common type of corneal transplant was called penetrating keratoplasty.\nIt is still a frequently performed operation.\nDuring this procedure, your surgeon will remove a small round piece of your cornea.\nThe donated tissue will then be sewn into the opening of your cornea.\nA newer technique is called lamellar keratoplasty.\nIn this procedure, only the inner or outer layers of the cornea are replaced, rather than all the layers, as in penetrating keratoplasty.\nThere are several different lamellar techniques. They differ mostly on which layer is replaced and how the donor tissue is prepared.\nAll lamellar procedures lead to faster recovery and fewer complications.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nA corneal transplant is recommended for people who have:\nVision problems caused by thinning of the cornea, most often due to\nkeratoconus\n."}

(A transplant may be considered when less invasive treatments are not an option.)\nScarring of the cornea from severe infections or injuries\nVision loss caused by cloudiness of the cornea, most often due to\nFuchs dystrophy\nRisks\nThe body may reject the transplanted tissue. This occurs in about 1 out of 3 patients in the first 5 years. Rejection can sometimes be controlled with steroid eye drops. There have rare cases of graft rejection reported soon after COVID-19 vaccination.\nOther risks for a corneal transplant are:\nBleeding\nCataracts\nInfection of the eye\nGlaucoma\n(high pressure in the eye that can cause vision loss)\nLoss of vision\nScarring of the eye\nSwelling of the cornea\nBefore the Procedure\nTell your surgeon and health care provider about any medical conditions you may have, including allergies."}

Also tell your provider what medicines you are taking, even medicines, supplements, and herbs you bought without a prescription.\nYou may need to limit medicines that make it hard for your blood to clot (blood thinners) for 10 days before the surgery. Some of these are aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and warfarin (Coumadin).\nAsk your surgeon which of your other daily medicines, such as water pills, insulin or pills for diabetes, you should take on the morning of your surgery.\nYou will need to stop eating and drinking most fluids after midnight the night before your surgery. Most surgeons will let you have water, apple juice, and plain coffee or tea (without cream or sugar) up to 2 hours before surgery. Do not drink alcohol 24 hours before or after surgery.\nOn the day of your surgery, wear loose, comfortable clothing. Do not wear any jewelry."}

Do not put creams, lotions, or makeup on your face or around your eyes.\nYou will need to have someone drive you home after your surgery.\nNote: These are general guidelines. Your surgeon may give you other instructions.\nAfter the Procedure\nYou will go home on the same day as your surgery. Your surgeon will give you an eye patch to wear for about 1 to 4 days.\nYour surgeon will prescribe eye drops to help your eye heal and prevent infection and rejection.\nYour surgeon will remove the stitches at a follow-up visit. Some stitches may  stay in place for as long as a year, or they might not be removed at all.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nFull recovery of eyesight may take up to a year. This is because it takes time for the swelling to go down. Most people who have a successful corneal transplant will have good vision for many years. If you have other eye problems, you may still have vision loss from those conditions.\nYou may need glasses or contact lenses to achieve the best vision."}
