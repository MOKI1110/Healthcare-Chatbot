It is also known as Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura (HSP).\nCauses\nIgA vasculitis is caused by an abnormal response of the immune system. The result is inflammation in the microscopic blood vessels in the skin. Blood vessels in the joints, kidneys, or the intestines may also be affected. It is unclear why this occurs.\nThe syndrome is mostly seen in children between ages 3 and 15 years, but it may be seen in adults. It is more common in boys than in girls. Many people who develop this disease had an upper respiratory infection in the weeks before.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms and features of IgA vasculitis may include:\nPurple spots on the skin (\npurpura\n). This occurs in nearly all children with the condition."}

The physical exam will show skin sores (purpura, lesions) and joint tenderness.\nTests may include:\nUrinalysis\nshould be done in all cases.\nComplete blood count. The platelet should be normal.\nCoagulation tests: these should be normal.\nSkin biopsy\n, especially in adults.\nBlood tests to look for other causes of blood vessel inflammation, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, ANCA-associated vasculitis or hepatitis.\nIn adults, a kidney biopsy should be done.\nImaging tests of the abdomen if pain is present.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment. Most cases go away on their own. Joint pain may improve with NSAIDs such as naproxen."}

Most cases go away on their own. Joint pain may improve with NSAIDs such as naproxen. If symptoms do not go away, you may be prescribed a corticosteroid medicine such as prednisone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe disease most often gets better on its own. Two thirds of children with IgA vasculitis have only one episode. One third of children have more episodes. People should have close medical follow-up for 6 months after episodes to look for signs of kidney disease. Adults have a greater risk of developing chronic kidney disease.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nBleeding inside the body\nBlocking of the intestine (in children)\nKidney problems (in rare cases)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nYou develop symptoms of IgA vasculitis, and they last for more than a few days.\nYou have colored urine or\nlow urine output\nafter an episode.\nAlternative Names\nImmunoglobulin A vasculitis; Leukocytoclastic vasculitis; Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura; HSP; IgA vasculitis - Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein purpura\nImages\nHenoch-Schonlein purpura on the lower legs\nHe"}
