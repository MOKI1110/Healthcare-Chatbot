After scales have disappeared, shampoos can be reduced to twice weekly. Be sure to rinse off all shampoo.\nBrush your child's hair with a clean, soft brush after each shampoo and several times during the day. Wash the brush with soap and water each day to remove any scales and scalp oil.\nIf scales do not easily loosen and wash off, apply mineral oil to your baby's scalp and wrap warm, wet cloths around the head for up to an hour before shampooing. Then, shampoo. Remember that your baby loses heat through the scalp. If you use warm, wet cloths with the mineral oil, check often to be sure that the cloths have not become cold."}
