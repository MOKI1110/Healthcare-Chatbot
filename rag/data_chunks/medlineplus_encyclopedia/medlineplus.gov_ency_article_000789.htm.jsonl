It helps you move your arm, wrist, and hand.\nCauses\nDamage to one nerve, such as the ulnar nerve, is called\nmononeuropathy\n. Mononeuropathy means there is damage to a single nerve. Diseases affecting the entire body (systemic disorders) can also cause isolated nerve damage.\nCauses of mononeuropathy include:\nAn illness in the whole body that damages a single nerve\nDirect injury to the nerve\nLong-term pressure on the nerve\nPressure on the nerve caused by swelling or injury of nearby body structures\nUlnar neuropathy is also common in those with\ndiabetes\n.\nUlnar neuropathy occurs when there is damage to the ulnar nerve. This nerve travels down the arm to the wrist, hand, and ring and little fingers. It passes just under the surface of the skin near the elbow."}

This nerve travels down the arm to the wrist, hand, and ring and little fingers. It passes just under the surface of the skin near the elbow. So, bumping the nerve there causes the pain and tingling of hitting your funny bone.\nWhen the nerve is compressed in the elbow, a problem called cubital tunnel syndrome may result. The ulnar nerve can also get compressed in the wrist and less often, at other parts of the arm.\nWhen damage destroys the nerve covering (\nmyelin sheath\n) or part of the nerve itself, nerve signaling is slowed or prevented."}

When the nerve fibers themselves (axons) are injured, this may cause a more severe problem.\nDamage to the ulnar nerve can be caused by:\nLong-term pressure on the elbow or base of the palm\nAn elbow\nfracture\nor\ndislocation\nKeeping the elbow bent for a long time or repeated elbow bending, such as with repetitive movements at work, or cigarette smoking\nIn some cases, no cause can be found.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nAbnormal sensations in the little finger and part of the ring finger, usually on the palm side\nWeakness\n, loss of coordination of the fingers\nClaw-like deformity of the hand and wrist\nPain,\nnumbness\n, decreased sensation, tingling, or burning sensation in the areas controlled by the nerve\nPain or numbness may awaken you from sleep. Activities such as tennis or golf may make the condition worse.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms and medical history."}

You may be asked what you were doing before the symptoms started.\nTests that may be needed include:\nBlood tests\nImaging tests, such as\nMRI\nto view the nerve and nearby structures\nNerve conduction tests\nto check how fast nerve signals travel\nElectromyography\n(EMG) to check the health of the ulnar nerve and the muscles it controls\nNerve biopsy\nto examine a piece of nerve tissue (rarely needed)\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to allow you to use your hand and arm as much as possible. Your provider will find and treat the cause, if possible. Sometimes, no treatment is needed and you will get better on your own.\nIf medicines are needed, they may include:\nOver-the-counter or prescription medicines  (such as gabapentin and pregabalin)\nCorticosteroid injections around the nerve to reduce swelling and pressure\nYour provider will likely suggest self-care measures. These may include:\nA supportive splint at either the wrist or elbow to help prevent further injury and relieve the symptoms."}

Also, avoid bumping or leaning on the elbow.\nPhysical therapy exercises to help maintain muscle strength in the arm.\nOccupational therapy or counseling to suggest changes in the workplace may be needed.\nSurgery to relieve pressure on the nerve may help if the symptoms get worse, or if there is evidence that the nerve isn't improving with conservative treatment.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf the cause of the nerve dysfunction can be found and successfully treated, there is a good chance of a full recovery."}

Avoid prolonged or repeated elbow bending.
