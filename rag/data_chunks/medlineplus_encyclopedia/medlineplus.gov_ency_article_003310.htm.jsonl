There are 8 bones in the skull itself and 14 bones in the face area. They join together to form a solid, bony cavity that protects and supports the brain. The areas where the bones join together are called the sutures.\nThe bones are not joined together firmly at birth. This allows the head to change shape to help it pass through the birth canal. The sutures get minerals added to them over time and harden, firmly joining the skull bones together.\nIn an infant, the space where 2 sutures join forms a membrane-covered \"soft spot\" called a fontanelle (fontanel). The fontanelles allow for growth of the brain and skull during an infant's first year.\nThere are normally several fontanelles on a newborn's skull. They are located mainly at the top, back, and sides of the head."}

They are located mainly at the top, back, and sides of the head. Like the sutures, fontanelles harden over time and become closed, solid bony areas.\nThe fontanelle in the back of the head (posterior fontanelle) most often closes by age 1 to 2 months.\nThe fontanelle at the top of the head (\nanterior\nfontanelle) most often closes within 7 to 19 months.\nThe fontanelles should feel firm and very slightly curved inward to the touch. A tense or bulging fontanelle occurs when fluid builds up in the brain or the brain swells, causing increased pressure inside the skull.\nWhen the infant is crying, lying down, or vomiting, the fontanelles may look like they are bulging. However, they should return to normal when the infant is in a calm, head-up position.\nCauses\nReasons a child may have bulging fontanelles include:\nEncephalitis\n. Swelling (inflammation) of the brain, most often due to infections.\nHydrocephalus\n. A buildup of fluid inside the skull.\nIncreased intracranial pressure.\nMeningitis\n."}
