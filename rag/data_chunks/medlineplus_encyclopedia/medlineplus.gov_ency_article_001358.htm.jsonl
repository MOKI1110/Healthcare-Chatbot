Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSydenham chorea\nSydenham chorea\nSydenham chorea is a movement disorder that occurs after infection with specific bacteria called group A streptococcus.\nCauses\nSydenham chorea is caused by an infection with bacteria called group A streptococcus. This is the bacteria that causes\nrheumatic fever\n(RF) and\nstrep throat\n. Group A streptococcus bacteria can trigger an immune response that reacts with a part of the brain called the basal ganglia to cause this disorder. The basal ganglia are a set of structures deep in the brain. They help control movement, posture, and speech.\nSydenham chorea is a major sign of acute RF. The person may currently or recently have had the disease. Sydenham chorea may be the only sign of RF in some people.\nSydenham chorea occurs most often in girls before puberty, but may be seen in boys.\nSymptoms\nSydenham chorea mainly involves jerky, uncontrollable and purposeless movements of the hands, arms, shoulder, face, legs, and trunk. These movements look like twitches, and disappear during sleep."}

These include:\nThroat swab\nAnti-DNAse B blood test\nAntistreptolysin O (ASO) blood test\nFurther testing may include:\nBlood tests such as\nESR\n,\nCBC\nMRI\nor\nCT scan of the brain\nTreatment\nAntibiotics are used to kill the Group A streptococcus bacteria. Your provider may also prescribe antibiotics to prevent future RF infections."}

Your provider may also prescribe antibiotics to prevent future RF infections. This is called preventive antibiotics, or antibiotic prophylaxis.\nSevere movement or emotional symptoms may need to be treated with medicines.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSydenham chorea usually clears up in a few months. In rare cases, an unusual form of Sydenham chorea may begin later in life.\nPossible Complications\nNo complications are expected.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your child develops uncontrollable or jerky movements, especially if your child has recently had a sore throat.\nPrevention\nPay careful attention to your children's complaints of sore throats and get early treatment to prevent acute RF. If there is a family history of RF, be watchful, because your children may be more likely to develop this infection.\nAlternative Names\nSt. Vitus dance; Chorea minor; Rheumatic chorea; Rheumatic fever - Sydenham chorea; Strep throat - Sydenham chorea; Streptococcal - Sydenham chorea; Streptococcus - Sydenham chorea\nReferences\nJankovic J."}
