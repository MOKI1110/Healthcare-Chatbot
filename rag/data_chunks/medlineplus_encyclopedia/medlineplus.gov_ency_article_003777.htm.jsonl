It is used to look at organs in the abdomen, including the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and kidneys. The blood vessels that lead to some of these organs, such as the inferior vena cava and aorta, can also be examined with ultrasound.\nHow the Test is Performed\nAn ultrasound machine makes images of organs and structures inside the body. The machine sends out high-frequency sound waves that reflect off body structures. A computer receives these waves and uses them to create a picture. Unlike with\nx-rays\nor\nCT scans\n, this test does not expose you to ionizing radiation.\nYou will be lying down for the procedure. A clear, water-based conducting gel is applied to the skin over the abdomen. This helps with the transmission of the sound waves. A handheld probe called a transducer is then moved over the abdomen.\nYou may need to change position so that the health care provider can look at different areas."}

You may also need to hold your breath for short periods during the exam.\nMost of the time, the test takes less than 30 minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nHow you will prepare for the test depends on the problem. You will likely be asked not to eat or drink for several hours before the exam. Your health care provider will go over what you need to do.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThere is little discomfort. The conducting gel may feel a little cold and wet."}
