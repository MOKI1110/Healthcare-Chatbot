Have a plan for how to respond if it does.\nTry to exercise regularly.\nLook for activities that make you happy.\nTalk to someone you trust about how you're feeling.\nSurround yourself with people who are caring and positive.\nAvoid alcohol and illegal drugs. These can make your mood worse over time and impair your judgment.\nMedicines are often effective for PDD, though they sometimes do not work as well as they do for major depression and may take longer to work.\nDo not stop taking your medicine on your own, even if you feel better or have side effects. Always contact your provider first.\nWhen it's time to stop your medicine, your provider will instruct you on how to slowly reduce the dose instead of stopping suddenly.\nPeople with PDD may also be helped by some type of talk therapy. Talk therapy is a good place to talk about feelings and thoughts, and to learn ways to deal with them. It can also help to understand how your PDD has affected your life and to cope more effectively."}
