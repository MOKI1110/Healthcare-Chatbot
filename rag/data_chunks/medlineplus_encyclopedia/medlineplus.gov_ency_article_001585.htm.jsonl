Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBowlegs\nBowlegs\nBowlegs is a condition in which the knees stay wide apart when a person stands with the feet and ankles together. It is considered normal in children under 18 months.\nCauses\nInfants are born bowlegged because of their folded position in the mother's womb. Bowed legs begin to straighten once the child starts to walk and the legs begin to bear weight (about 12 to 18 months old).\nBy around age 3, the child can most often stand with the ankles apart and the knees just touching. If the bowed legs are still present, the child is called bowlegged.\nBowlegs may be caused by illnesses, such as:\nAbnormal bone development\nBlount disease\nFractures that do not heal correctly\nLead or fluoride poisoning\nRickets\n, which is caused by a lack of\nvitamin D\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nKnees that do not touch when standing with feet together (ankles touching)\nBowing of legs is same on both sides of the body (symmetrical)\nBowed legs continue beyond age 3\nExams and Tests\nA health care provider can often diagnose bowlegs by looking at the child."}

The distance between the knees is measured while the child is lying on the back.\nBlood tests may be needed to check for rickets.\nX-rays\nmay be needed if:\nThe child is 3 years old or older.\nThe bowing is getting worse.\nBowing is not the same on both sides.\nOther test results suggest disease.\nTreatment\nNo treatment is recommended for bowlegs unless the condition is extreme. The child should be seen by the provider at least every 6 months.\nSpecial shoes, braces, or casts can be tried if the condition is severe or the child also has another disease."}

It is unclear how well these work.\nAt times, surgery is done to correct the deformity in an adolescent with severe bowlegs.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn many cases the outcome is good, and there is most often no problem walking.\nPossible Complications\nBowlegs that does not go away and is not treated may lead to arthritis in the knees or hips over time.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your child shows ongoing or worsening bowed legs after age 3.\nPrevention\nThere is no known way to prevent bowlegs, other than to avoid rickets. Make sure your child is exposed to sunlight and gets the proper amount of vitamin D in their diet.\nAlternative Names\nGenu varum\nReferences\nSheffer BW.
