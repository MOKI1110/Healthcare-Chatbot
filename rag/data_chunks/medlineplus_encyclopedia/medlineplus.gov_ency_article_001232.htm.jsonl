They are caused by repeated pressure or friction at the spot where the corn or callus develops.\nCauses\nCorns and calluses are caused by pressure or friction on skin. A corn is thickened skin on the top or side of a toe. Most of the time it is caused by bad-fitting shoes. A callus is thickened skin on your hands or the soles of your feet.\nThe thickening of the skin is a protective reaction. For example, farmers and rowers get calluses on their hands that prevent blisters from forming."}

For example, farmers and rowers get calluses on their hands that prevent blisters from forming. People with\nbunions\noften develop a callus over the bunion because it rubs against the shoe.\nCorns and calluses may be painful but are not serious problems for most people.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nSkin is thick and hardened.\nSkin may be flaky and dry.\nHardened, thick skin areas are found on hands, feet, or other areas that may be rubbed or pressed.\nThe affected areas can be painful and may bleed.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will make the diagnosis after looking at your skin. In most cases, tests are not needed.\nTreatment\nPreventing friction is often the only treatment needed.\nTo treat corns:\nIf poor fitting shoes are causing the corn, changing to shoes with a better fit will help get rid of the problem most of the time.\nProtect the corn with a doughnut-shaped corn pad while it is healing. You can buy these at most drug stores.\nTo treat calluses:\nCalluses often occur due to excess pressure placed on the skin because of another problem such as bunions or hammertoes."}

Proper treatment of any underlying condition should prevent the calluses from returning.\nWear gloves to protect your hands during activities that cause friction (such as gardening and weight lifting) to help prevent calluses.\nIf an infection or ulcer occurs in an area of a callus or corn, the tissue may need to be removed by a provider. You may need to take antibiotics.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nCorns and calluses are rarely serious. They should improve with proper treatment and not cause long-term problems.\nPossible Complications\nComplications of corns and calluses are rare. People with\ndiabetes\nor problems with the nerves in their toes are prone to ulcers and infections and should regularly examine their feet to identify any problems right away."}
