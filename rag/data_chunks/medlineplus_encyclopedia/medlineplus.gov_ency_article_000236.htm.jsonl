It makes and releases enzymes into the intestines that help the body digest and absorb food, especially fats. The pancreas also makes and releases insulin and glucagon. These are hormones that help the body control blood sugar levels.\nThere are different types of pancreatic cancers. The type depends on the cell in which the cancer develops. Examples include:\nAdenocarcinoma, the most common type of pancreatic cancer\nOther more rare types include\nglucagonoma\n,\ninsulinoma\n,\nislet cell tumor\n,\nVIPoma\nThe exact cause of pancreatic cancer is unknown. It is more common in people who:\nAre obese\nHave a diet high in fat and low in fruits and vegetables\nHave diabetes\nHave long-term exposure to certain chemicals\nHave long-term inflammation of the pancreas (\nchronic pancreatitis\n)\nSmoke\nThe risk for pancreatic cancer increases with age."}

Family history of the disease also slightly increases the chance of developing this cancer.\nSymptoms\nA tumor (cancer) in the pancreas may grow without any symptoms at first. This means the cancer is often advanced when it is first found.\nSymptoms of pancreatic cancer include:\nDiarrhea\nDark urine and clay-colored stools\nFatigue\nand weakness\nSudden increase in blood sugar level (diabetes)\nJaundice\n(a yellow color in the skin, mucous membranes, or white part of the eyes) and itching of the skin\nLoss of appetite and weight loss\nNausea and vomiting\nPain or discomfort in the upper part of the belly or abdomen\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.\nBlood tests that may be ordered include:\nComplete blood count (\nCBC\n)\nLiver function tests\nSerum bilirubin\nImaging tests that may be ordered include:\nCT scan of the abdomen\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (\nERCP\n)\nEndoscopic ultrasound\nMRI of the abdomen\nDiagnosis of pancre"}

This is called staging. Staging helps guide treatment and gives you an idea of what to expect.\nTreatment\nTreatment for adenocarcinoma depends on the stage of the tumor.\nSurgery\nmay be done if the tumor has not spread or has spread very little. Along with surgery,\nchemotherapy\nor\nradiation therapy\nor both may be used before or after surgery. A small number of people can be cured with this treatment approach.\nWhen the tumor has not spread out of the pancreas but cannot be surgically removed, chemotherapy and radiation therapy together may be recommended.\nWhen the tumor has spread (metastasized) to other organs such as the liver, chemotherapy alone is usually used.\nWith advanced cancer, the goal of treatment is to manage pain and other symptoms."}

For example, if the tube that carries bile (bile duct) is blocked by the pancreatic tumor, a procedure to place a tiny metal tube (stent) may be done to open the blockage. This can help relieve jaundice and itching of the skin.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\ncancer support group\n. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSome people with pancreatic cancer that can be surgically removed are cured. But in most people, the tumor has spread and cannot be completely removed at the time of diagnosis.\nChemotherapy and radiation are often given after surgery to increase the cure rate (this is called adjuvant therapy). For pancreatic cancer that cannot be removed completely with surgery or cancer that has spread beyond the pancreas, a cure is not possible."}
