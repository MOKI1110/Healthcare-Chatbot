In infants, it can be damaged just before or at the time of delivery.\nMost of the time, the cause is unknown. But a difficult delivery, with or without the use of an instrument called forceps, may lead to this condition.\nSome factors that can increase the risk of birth trauma (injury) include:\nLarge baby size (may be seen if the mother has\ndiabetes\n)\nLong pregnancy or labor\nMost of the time, these factors do not lead to facial nerve palsy or birth trauma.\nUse of epidural anesthesia and medicines to induce labor and contractions indicate more difficult deliveries, which are at greater risk of complications such as nerve injury.\nSymptoms\nThe most common form of facial nerve palsy due to birth trauma involv"}

This part controls the muscles around the lips. The muscle weakness is mainly noticeable when the infant cries.\nThe newborn infant may have the following symptoms:\nEyelid may not close on affected side\nLower face (below eyes) appears uneven during crying\nMouth does not move down the same way on both sides while crying\nNo movement (paralysis) on the affected side of the face (from the forehead to the chin in severe cases)\nIn some cases, other cranial nerves may be affected as well.\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam is usually all that is needed to diagnose this condition. In rare cases, a\nnerve conduction test\nis needed."}

This test can pinpoint the exact location of the nerve injury.\nBrain imaging tests are not needed unless your infant's health care provider thinks there is another problem (such as a congenital brain injury or infection).\nTreatment\nIn most cases, the infant will be closely monitored to see if the paralysis goes away on its own.\nIf the baby's eye does not close all the way, an eyepad and eyedrops will be used to protect the eye.\nSurgery may be needed to relieve pressure on the nerve.\nInfants with permanent paralysis need special therapy.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe condition usually goes away on its own in a few months.\nPossible Complications\nIn some cases, the muscles on the affected side of the face become permanently paralyzed.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nYour provider will usually diagnose this condition while the infant is in the hospital. Mild cases involving just the lower lip may not be noticed at birth."}

A parent, grandparent, or other person may notice the problem later.\nIf the movement of your infant's mouth looks different on each side when they cry, you should make an appointment with your child's provider.\nPrevention\nThere is no guaranteed way to prevent pressure injuries in the unborn child. The proper use of forceps and improved childbirth methods have reduced the rate of facial nerve palsy.\nAlternative Names\nSeventh cranial nerve palsy due to birth trauma; Facial palsy - birth trauma; Facial palsy - neonate; Facial palsy - infant\nReferences\nBalest AL, Riley MM, O' Donnell B, Zarit JS.
