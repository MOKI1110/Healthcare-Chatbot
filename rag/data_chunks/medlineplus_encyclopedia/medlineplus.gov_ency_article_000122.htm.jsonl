Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLung cancer - small cell\nLung cancer - small cell\nSmall cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a fast-growing type of\nlung cancer\n. It spreads much more quickly than\nnon-small cell lung cancer\n.\nThere are two types of SCLC:\nSmall cell carcinoma (oat cell cancer)\nCombined small cell carcinoma\nMost SCLCs are of the oat cell type.\nCauses\nAbout 15% of all lung cancer cases are SCLC. Small cell lung cancer is slightly more common in men than women.\nAlmost all cases of SCLC are due to cigarette smoking. SCLC is very rare in people who have never smoked.\nSCLC is the most aggressive form of lung cancer. It usually starts in the breathing tubes (bronchi) in the center of the chest. Although the cancer cells are small, they grow very quickly and create large tumors."}

These tumors often spread rapidly (metastasize) to other parts of the body, including the brain, liver, and bone.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of SCLC include:\nBloody sputum\n(phlegm)\nChest pain\nCough\nLoss of appetite\nShortness of breath\nWeight loss\nWheezing\nOther symptoms that may occur with this disease, especially in the late stages, include:\nFacial swelling\nFever\nHoarseness or changing voice\nSwallowing difficulty\nWeakness\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history. You will be asked whether you smoke, and if so, how much and for how long.\nWhen listening to your chest with a stethoscope, your provider may hear fluid around the lungs or areas where the lung has partially\ncollapsed\n."}

This is called a biopsy. There are several ways to do a biopsy:\nBronchoscopy\ncombined with\nbiopsy\nCT scan-directed needle biopsy\nEndoscopic esophageal or bronchial ultrasound with biopsy\nMediastinoscopy with biopsy\nOpen lung biopsy\nPleural biopsy\nVideo-assisted thoracoscopy\nUsually, if a biopsy shows cancer, more imaging tests are done to find out the stage of the cancer.

SCLC is classified as either:\nLimited -- Cancer is only in the chest and can be treated with radiation therapy.\nExtensive -- Cancer has spread outside the area that can be covered by radiation therapy.\nTreatment\nBecause SCLC spreads quickly throughout the body, treatment will include cancer-killing drugs (\nchemotherapy\n), which are usually given through a vein (by IV).\nTreatment with chemotherapy and immunotherapy, and possibly\nradiation\n, may be done for people with SCLC that has spread throughout the body (extensive)."}

This can occur even when there are no symptoms or other signs of cancer in the brain. As a result, some people with smaller cancers, or who had a good response in their first round of chemotherapy, may receive radiation therapy to the brain."}

If you are having trouble quitting, talk with your provider. There are many methods to help you quit, from\nsupport groups\nto\nprescription medicines\n.
