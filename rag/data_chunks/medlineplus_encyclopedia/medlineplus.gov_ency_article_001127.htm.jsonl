Bilirubin is a substance made by the liver.\nCauses\nAn enzyme converts bilirubin into a form that can easily be removed from the body. Crigler-Najjar syndrome occurs when this enzyme does not work correctly. Without this enzyme, bilirubin can build up in the body and lead to:\nJaundice (yellow discoloration of skin and eyes)\nDamage to the brain, muscles, and nerves\nType I Crigler-Najjar is the form of the disease that starts early in life. Type II Crigler-Najjar syndrome may start later in life.\nThe syndrome runs in families (inherited). A child must receive a copy of the variant gene from both parents to develop the severe form of the condition."}

A child must receive a copy of the variant gene from both parents to develop the severe form of the condition. Parents who are carriers (with just one variant gene) have about one half the enzyme activity of a normal adult, but do not have symptoms.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nConfusion\nand changes in thinking\nYellow skin (jaundice) and yellow in the whites of the eyes (icterus), which begin a few days after birth and get worse over time\nLethargy\nPoor feeding\nVomiting\nExams and Tests\nTests of liver function include:\nConjugated (bound) bilirubin\nTotal bilirubin level\nUnconjugated (unbound) bilirubin in blood.\nEnzyme assay\nLiver biopsy\nTreatment\nLight treatment (phototherapy) is needed throughout a person's life. In infants, this is done using bilirubin lights (bili or 'blue' lights). Phototherapy does not work as well after age 4, because thickened skin blocks the light.\nA liver transplant can be done in some people with type I disease.\nBlood transfusions may help control the amount of bilirubin in blood."}

Calcium compounds are sometimes used to remove bilirubin in the gut.\nThe drug phenobarbitol is sometimes used to treat type II Crigler-Najjar syndrome.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMilder forms of the disease (type II) do not cause liver damage or changes in thinking during childhood. People who are affected with a mild form still have jaundice, but they have fewer symptoms and less organ damage.\nInfants with the severe form of the disease (type I) may continue to have jaundice into adulthood, and may need daily treatment. If not treated, this severe form of the disease will lead to death in childhood.\nPeople with this condition who reach adulthood will develop brain damage due to jaundice (\nkernicterus\n), even with regular treatment."}
