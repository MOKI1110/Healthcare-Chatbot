There are three main types of carbohydrates found in foods: sugars, starches, and\nfiber\n.\nPeople with diabetes often need to\ncount the amount of carbohydrates\nthey eat to ensure a consistent supply throughout the day as well as to help choose mealtime doses of insulin.\nFunction\nYour body needs all three forms of carbohydrates to function properly.\nSugars and most starches are broken down by the body into glucose, which then circulates in the blood to be used as energy.\nFiber is the part of food that is not broken down by the body. There are two types of fiber.\nInsoluble fiber\nadds bulk to your stools so you stay regular.\nSoluble fiber\nhelps lower cholesterol levels and can help improve blood glucose control."}

There are two types of fiber.\nInsoluble fiber\nadds bulk to your stools so you stay regular.\nSoluble fiber\nhelps lower cholesterol levels and can help improve blood glucose control. Both types of fiber can help you to feel full and stay at a healthy weight.\nFood Sources\nMany foods contain one or more types of carbohydrates.\nSUGARS\nSugars, or simple carbohydrates, occur naturally in these nutrient-rich foods:\nFruits\nMilk and milk products\nSome foods have added sugar. Many packaged and refined foods contain added sugar. These include:\nCandy\nCookies, cakes, and pastries\nRegular (non-diet) carbonated beverages, such as soda\nHeavy syrups, such as those added to canned fruit\nRefined grains with added sugar provide calories, but they lack vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Because they lack nutrients, these foods provide \"empty calories\" and can lead to weight gain. Try to minimize your intake of foods with added sugars.\nSTARCHES\nStarches are also called complex carbohydrates."}

These nutrient-rich foods are high in starch (many are also high in fiber):\nCanned and dried beans, such as kidney beans, black beans, pinto beans, black-eyed peas, split peas, and garbanzo beans\nStarchy vegetables, such as potatoes, corn, green peas, and parsnips\nWhole grains, such as brown rice, oats, barley, and quinoa\nRefined grains, such as those found in pastries, white bread, crackers, and white rice also contain starch."}

However, they lack B vitamins and other important nutrients unless they are marked \"enriched.\" Foods made with refined or \"white\" flour also contain less fiber and protein than whole-grain products and do not help you feel as satisfied.\nFIBER\nHigh-fiber foods include:\nWhole grains, such as whole wheat and brown rice as well as whole-grain breads, cereals, and crackers\nBeans and legumes, such as black beans, kidney beans, and garbanzo beans\nVegetables, such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, corn, and potato with the skin\nFruits, such as raspberries, pears, apples, and figs\nNuts and seeds\nMost processed and refined foods, enriched or not, are low in fiber.\nSide Effects\nEating too many carbohydrates in the form of processed, starchy, or sugary foods can increase your total calorie intake, which can lead to\nweight gain\n. It can also lead you to not consume enough fat and protein.\nSeverely restricting carbohydrates can cause ketosis."}

It can also lead you to not consume enough fat and protein.\nSeverely restricting carbohydrates can cause ketosis. This is when the body uses fat for energy because there are not enough carbohydrates from food for the body to use for energy.\nRecommendations\nIt is best to get most of your carbohydrates from whole grains, dairy, fruits, and vegetables rather than refined grains. In addition to calories, whole grain foods provide vitamins, minerals, and fiber.\nBy making smart food choices, you can get the full range of healthy carbohydrates and plenty of nutrients:\nChoose a variety of foods including whole grains, fruits and vegetables, beans and legumes, and low-fat or non-fat dairy products.\nRead labels on canned, packaged, and frozen foods to avoid added sugar, salt, and fat.\nMake at least half of your grain servings per day from whole grains.\nChoose whole fruits and 100% fruit juices with no added sugar. Make at least half of your daily fruit servings from whole fruits.\nLimit sweets, sugar-sweetened beverages, and alcohol."}
