Common sugars include:\nGlucose\nFructose\nGalactose\nSucrose (common table sugar)\nLactose (the sugar found naturally in milk)\nMaltose (a product of starch digestion)\nSugars are found naturally in milk products (lactose) and fruits (fructose). Most of the sugar in the American diet is from sugars added to food products.\nFunction\nSome of the functions of sugars include:\nProvide sweet flavor when added to food.\nMaintain freshness and food quality.\nAct as a preservative in jams and jellies.\nEnhance flavor in processed meats.\nProvide fermentation for breads and pickles.\nAdd bulk to ice cream and body to carbonated sodas.\nMany foods with added sugars often add calories without other nutrients. These foods and drinks are often called \"empty\" calories. By contrast, foods containing natural sugars (such as fruit) also include vitamins, minerals, and fiber.\nMost people know that there is a lot of added sugar in regular soda."}

By contrast, foods containing natural sugars (such as fruit) also include vitamins, minerals, and fiber.\nMost people know that there is a lot of added sugar in regular soda. However, popular \"vitamin-type\" waters, sports drinks, coffee drinks, and energy drinks also may contain a lot of added sugar.\nFood Sources\nSome sweeteners are made by processing sugar compounds. Others occur naturally.\nSucrose (table sugar):\nSucrose\noccurs naturally in many foods, and it is commonly added to commercially processed items. It is a disaccharide, which is made of 2 simpler monosaccharides -- glucose and fructose. Sucrose includes raw sugar, granulated sugar, brown sugar, confectioner's sugar, and turbinado sugar. Table sugar is made from sugar cane or sugar beets.\nRaw sugar is granulated, solid, or coarse. It is brown in color. Raw sugar is the solid part left when the liquid from the juice of the sugar cane evaporates.\nBrown sugar is made from sugar crystals that come from molasses syrup."}

It is brown in color. Raw sugar is the solid part left when the liquid from the juice of the sugar cane evaporates.\nBrown sugar is made from sugar crystals that come from molasses syrup. Brown sugar can also be made by adding molasses back to white granulated sugar.\nConfectioner's sugar (also known as powdered sugar) is finely ground sucrose.\nTurbinado sugar is a less refined sugar that still retains some of its molasses.\nRaw and brown sugars are no healthier than granulated white sugar.\nOther commonly used sugars:\nFructose (fruit sugar)\nis the naturally occurring sugar in all fruits. It is also called levulose, or fruit sugar.\nHoney\nis a combination of fructose, glucose, and water. It is produced by bees.\nHigh fructose corn syrup (HFCS)\nand\ncorn syrup\nare made from corn. Sugar and HFCS have almost the same level of sweetness. HFCS is often used in soft drinks, baked goods, and some canned products.\nDextrose\nis chemically identical to glucose. It is commonly used for medical purposes such as in IV hydration and parenteral nutrition products.\nInvert sugar\nis a natural form of sugar that is used to help keep candies and baked items sweet."}

It is commonly used for medical purposes such as in IV hydration and parenteral nutrition products.\nInvert sugar\nis a natural form of sugar that is used to help keep candies and baked items sweet. Honey is an invert sugar.\nSugar alcohols:\nSugar alcohols\ninclude\nmannitol, sorbitol, and xylitol.\nThese sweeteners are used as an ingredient in many food products that are labeled \"sugar-free\", \"diabetic\", or \"low carb\". These sweeteners are absorbed by the body at a much slower rate than sugar. They also have about one half of the calories of sugar. They should not be confused with sugar substitutes that are calorie free. Sugar alcohols may cause stomach cramps and diarrhea in some people.\nErythritol\nis a naturally occurring sugar alcohol found in fruit and fermented foods. It is 60% to 80% as sweet as table sugar but has fewer calories. Also, it does not result in as much of a rise in blood sugar after meals or cause tooth decay. Unlike other sugar alcohols, it does not cause stomach upset. Erythritol is used in many foods marketed to people with diabetes, and it is a main ingredient added to Stevia and monk-fruit sweetener products."}

Erythritol is used in many foods marketed to people with diabetes, and it is a main ingredient added to Stevia and monk-fruit sweetener products. A recent study linked consuming erythritol to a mildly increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events such as heart attack, stroke, and death. More research is needed to understand the implications of this study and possible long-term adverse effects of using erythritol and other no- and low-calorie and artificial sweeteners.\nOther types of natural sugars:\nAgave nectar\nis a highly processed type of sugar from the\nAgave tequiliana\n(tequila) plant. Agave nectar is about 1.5 times sweeter than regular sugar. It has about 60 calories per tablespoon compared to 40 calories for the same amount of table sugar. Agave nectar is not healthier than honey, sugar, HFCS, or any other type of sweetener.\nGlucose\nis found in fruits in small amounts. It is also a syrup made from cornstarch.\nLactose\n(milk sugar) is the\ncarbohydrate\nthat is in milk. It is made up of glucose and galactose.\nMaltose\n(malt sugar) is produced during fermentation."}

It is made up of sucrose, fructose, and glucose.\nMolasses\nis taken from the residue of sugar cane processing.\nStevia sweeteners\nare high intensity extracts derived from the stevia plant that are recognized as safe by the FDA. Stevia is 200 to 300 times sweeter than sugar.\nMonk fruit sweeteners\nare made from the juice of the monk fruit. They have zero calories per serving and are 150 to 200 times sweeter than sugar.\nSide Effects\nTable sugar provides calories and no other nutrients. Sweeteners with calories can lead to\ntooth decay\n.\nLarge amounts of sugar-containing foods can contribute to excess weight gain in children and adults."}

It contains 16 calories per teaspoon or 16 calories per 4 grams and can be used in moderation.\nThe American Heart Association (AHA) recommends limiting the amount of added sugars in your diet. The recommendation extends to all types of added sugars.\nWomen should get no more than 100 calories per day from added sugar (about 6 teaspoons or 24 grams of sugar).\nMen should get no more than 150 calories per day from added sugar (about 9 teaspoons or 36 grams of sugar).\nThe United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Dietary Guidelines for Americans also recommends limiting added sugars to no more than 10% of your calories per day."}

It is important to have a balanced diet.\nThe American Diabetes Association nutrition guidelines state that you do not need to avoid all sugar and foods with sugar if you have diabetes.
