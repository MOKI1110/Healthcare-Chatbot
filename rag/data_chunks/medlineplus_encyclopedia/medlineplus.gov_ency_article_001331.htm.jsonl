Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTrichomoniasis\nTrichomoniasis\nTrichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by the parasite\nTrichomonas vaginalis.\nCauses\nTrichomoniasis (trich) is found worldwide. In the United States, most cases occur in women between ages 16 and 35 years.\nTrichomonas vaginalis\nis spread through sexual contact with an infected partner, either  through penis-to-vagina intercourse or vulva-to-vulva contact. The parasite cannot survive in the mouth or rectum.\nThe disease can affect both men and women, but the symptoms differ."}

The parasite cannot survive in the mouth or rectum.\nThe disease can affect both men and women, but the symptoms differ. The infection usually does not cause symptoms in men and goes away on its own in a few weeks.\nSymptoms\nWomen may have these symptoms:\nDiscomfort with intercourse\nItching of the inner thighs\nVaginal discharge (thin, greenish-yellow, frothy or foamy)\nVaginal  or vulvar itching\n, or swelling of the labia\nVaginal odor (foul or strong smell)\nMen who have symptoms may have:\nBurning after urination or ejaculation\nItching of the urethra\nSlight discharge from the urethra\nOccasionally, some men with trichomoniasis may develop:\nSwelling and irritation in the prostate gland (\nprostatitis\n).\nSwelling in the epididymis (\nepididymitis\n), the tube that connects the testicle with the vas deferens. The vas deferens connects the testicles to the urethra.\nExams and Tests\nIn women, a pelvic examination shows red blotches on the vaginal wall or\ncervix\n. Examining the vaginal discharge under a microscope may show signs of inflammation or infection-causing germs in vaginal fluids."}

Examining the vaginal discharge under a microscope may show signs of inflammation or infection-causing germs in vaginal fluids. A\nPap test\nmay also diagnose the condition, but is not required for diagnosis.\nThe disease can be hard to diagnose in men. Men are treated if the infection is diagnosed in any of their sexual partners. They may also be treated if they keep having symptoms of urethral burning or itching, even after getting treatment for\ngonorrhea\nand\nchlamydia\n.\nTreatment\nAntibiotics, most often metronidazole (Flagyl) or tinidazole (Tindamax), are commonly used to cure the infection.\nDo not drink alcohol while taking the medicine and for 48 hours afterward. Doing so can cause:\nSevere nausea\nAbdominal pain\nVomiting\nAvoid sexual intercourse until you have finished treatment. Your sexual partners should be treated at the same time, even if they have no symptoms."}

If you have been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection (STI), you should be screened for other STIs.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWith proper treatment, you are likely to fully recover.\nPossible Complications\nLong-term infection may cause changes in the tissue on the cervix. These changes may be seen on a routine Pap smear. Treatment should be started and the Pap test should be repeated 3 to 6 months later.\nTreating trichomoniasis helps prevent it from spreading to sexual partners. Trichomoniasis is more common among people with HIV/AIDS.\nThis condition has been linked to premature  delivery in pregnant women."}

More research about trichomoniasis in pregnancy is still needed.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have any unusual vaginal discharge or irritation.\nAlso, call if you suspect that you have been exposed to the disease.\nPrevention\nPracticing safer sex\ncan help reduce the risk of sexually transmitted infections, including trichomoniasis.\nOther than total abstinence, condoms remain the best and most reliable protection against sexually transmitted infections. Condoms must be used consistently and correctly to be effective.\nAlternative Names\nTrichomonas vaginitis; STD - trichomonas vaginitis; STI - trichomonas vaginitis; Sexually transmitted infection - trichomonas vaginitis; Cervicitis - trichomonas vaginitis\nImages\nNormal uterine anatomy (cut section)\nReferences\nAbdallah M, Augenbraun MH, McCormack W.
