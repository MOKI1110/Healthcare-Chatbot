This is called long COVID.\nLong COVID can happen in people who had mild to severe disease or no symptoms at all during an active COVID-19 infection. Long COVID most often affects adults. It can also occur in children, although less often.\nOther names for long COVID include: long-haul COVID, chronic COVID, post-COVID conditions (PCC), and post-acute sequelae of SARS CoV-2 infection (PASC).\nCauses\nHealth experts are not sure exactly what causes long COVID. Some theories include:\nSARS-CoV-2 virus particles become active again in the body after the initial illness or one or more of the person's organs is taking longer to recover than the rest\nThe\nimmune system\nbecomes overactive, causing inflammation in the body\nThe overactive immune system makes antibodies that attack organs and tissues\nLong COVID health problems may be due to more than one of these factors."}

Some people have developed long COVID and never knew they had a COVID-19 infection.\nSymptoms\nA person who has symptoms that persist for 4 or more weeks after a case of COVID-19 is said to have long COVID.

People who had severe COVID-19 are more at risk for multi-organ effects. This increases the risk for a person to develop diabetes, heart conditions, or neurological problems compared to people who did not have COVID-19.\nSome long COVID symptoms, such as muscle weakness and PTSD  may result from having spent a long time in the hospital. These effects can occur from any illness that leads to being in bed for a long time and being on a breathing machine (intubated).\nLong COVID symptoms vary a lot and can be hard to figure out and manage.
