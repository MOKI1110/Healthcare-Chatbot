A healthy tear film on the eye is necessary for good vision.\nDry eyes develop when the eye is unable to maintain a healthy coating of tears.\nCauses\nDry eye syndrome commonly occurs in people who are otherwise healthy. It becomes more common with older age. This can occur due to hormonal changes that make your eyes produce fewer tears. Dry eye syndrome is sometimes caused or worsened by a condition called\nmeibomianitis\n, which changes the normal tear film.\nOther common causes of dry eyes include:\nDry environment or workplace (wind, air conditioning)\nSun exposure\nSmoking or second-hand smoke exposure\nCold or allergy medicines\nWearing contact lenses\nDry eye syndrome can also be caused by:\nHeat or chemical burns\nPrevious eye surgery\nUse of eye drops for other eye diseases\nAn uncommon\nautoimmune disorder\nin which the glands that produce tears are destroyed (\nSjÃ¶gren syndrome\n)\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nBlurred vision\nBurning, itc"}

Rest your eyes once in a while.\nClean eyelashes regularly and apply warm compresses.\nSome dry eye symptoms are due to sleeping with the eyes slightly open. Lubricating ointments work best for this problem. You should use them only in small amounts since they can blur your vision. It is best to use them before sleep.\nSurgery may be helpful if symptoms are because the eyelids are in an abnormal position.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people with dry eye syndrome have only discomfort, and no vision loss.\nPossible Complications\nIn severe cases, the clear covering on the eye (cornea) may become damaged or infected.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider right away if:\nYou have red or painful eyes.\nYou have flaking, discharge, or a sore on your eye or eyelid.\nYou have had an injury to your eye, or if you have a bulging eye or a drooping eyelid.\nYou have joint pain, swelling, or stiffness and a dry mouth along with dry eye symptoms.\nYour eyes do not get better with self-care"}
