Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHistoplasmosis\nHistoplasmosis\nHistoplasmosis is an infection that occurs from breathing in the\nspores\nof the fungus\nHistoplasma capsulatum\n.\nCauses\nHistoplasmosis occurs throughout the world. In the United States, it is most common in the southeastern, mid-Atlantic, and central states, especially in the Mississippi and Ohio River valleys.\nHistoplasma fungus grows as a mold in the soil. You may get sick when you breathe in spores produced by the fungus. Soil that contains bird or bat droppings may have larger amounts of this fungus. The threat is greatest after an old building is torn down, or in caves.\nThis infection can occur in people with a healthy immune system. Having a weakened immune system increases the risk of getting or reactivating this disease."}

Having a weakened immune system increases the risk of getting or reactivating this disease. Very young or very old people, or those with HIV/AIDS,\ncancer\n, or an organ transplant have more severe symptoms.\nPeople with long-term (chronic) lung disease (such as\nemphysema\nand\nbronchiectasis\n) are also at higher risk for a more severe infection.\nSymptoms\nMost people have no symptoms, or only have a mild, flu-like illness.\nIf symptoms do occur, they may include:\nFever and\nchills\nCough and\nchest pain\nthat gets worse when breathing in\nJoint pain\nMouth sores\nRed skin bumps, most often on the lower legs\nThe infection may be active for a short period of time, and then the symptoms go away. Sometimes, the lung infection may become chronic. Symptoms include:\nChest pain and shortness of breath\nCough, possibly coughing up blood\nFever and sweating\nIn a small number of people, especially in those with a weakened immune system, histoplasmosis spreads throughout the body. This is called disseminated histoplasmosis."}
