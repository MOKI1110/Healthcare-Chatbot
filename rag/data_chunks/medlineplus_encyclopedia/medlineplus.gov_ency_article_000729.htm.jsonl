Syphilis is a bacterial infection that is spread sexually.\nWhen syphilis is untreated, the bacteria may damage the spinal cord and\nperipheral\nnervous tissue. This leads to the symptoms of tabes dorsalis.\nTabes dorsalis is now very rare because syphilis is usually treated early in the disease.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of tabes dorsalis are caused by damage to the nervous system."}

Symptoms include any of the following:\nAbnormal sensations (\nparesthesia\n), often called lightning pains\nProblems walking due to nerve damage causing the person to walk with the legs far apart and feet slapping the ground\nLoss of coordination and reflexes\nJoint damage, especially to the knees\nMuscle weakness\nVision changes\nBladder control problems\nSexual function problems\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a\nphysical exam\n, focusing on the nervous system.\nIf syphilis infection is suspected, tests may include the following:\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF-VDRL) exam\nHead CT\n,\nspine CT\n, or\nMRI\nscans of the brain and spinal cord to rule out other diseases\nSerum VDRL\nor serum\nRPR\n(used as a screening test for syphilis infection)\nIf the serum VDRL or serum RPR test is positive, more tests are required to confirm the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nThe goals of treatment are to cure the infection and slow the disease."}

Treatment does not reverse existing nerve damage.\nMedicines likely to be given include:\nPenicillin or other antibiotics for a long time to make sure the infection goes away\nPainkillers to control pain\nSymptoms of existing nervous system damage need to be treated. People who are unable to eat, dress themselves, or take care of themselves may need help."}
