It is not cancerous.\nCauses\nA hepatic hemangioma is the most common type of liver mass that is not caused by cancer. It may be a birth defect.\nHepatic hemangiomas can occur at any time. They are most common in people in their 30s to 50s. Women get these masses more often than men. The masses are often bigger in size.\nBabies may develop a type of hepatic hemangioma called benign infantile hemangioendothelioma. This is also known as multinodular hepatic hemangiomatosis. This is a rare, noncancerous\ntumor\nthat has been linked to high rates of heart failure and death in infants. Infants are most often diagnosed by the time they are 6 months old.\nSymptoms\nSome hemangiomas may cause bleeding or interfere with organ function. Most do not produce symptoms. In rare cases, the hemangioma may rupture.\nExams and Tests\nIn most cases, the condition is not found until liver images are taken for some other reason."}

If the hemangioma ruptures, the only sign may be an enlarged liver.\nBabies with benign infantile hemangioendothelioma may have:\nA growth in the abdomen\nAnemia\nSigns of\nheart failure\nThe following tests may be performed:\nBlood tests\nCT scan of the liver\nHepatic angiogram\nMRI\nSingle-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT)\nUltrasound of the abdomen\nTreatment\nMost of these tumors are treated only if there is ongoing pain.\nTreatment for infantile hemangioendothelioma depends on the child's growth and development. The following treatments may be needed:\nInserting a material in a blood vessel of the liver to block it (embolization)\nTying off (ligating) a liver artery\nMedicines for heart failure\nSurgery to remove the tumor\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSurgery can cure a tumor in an infant if it is only in one lobe of the liver."}
