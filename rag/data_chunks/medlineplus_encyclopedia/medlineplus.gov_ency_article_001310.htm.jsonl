Tumors can be cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign).\nCauses\nIn general, tumors occur when cells divide and grow excessively in the body. Normally, the body controls cell growth and division. New cells are created to replace older ones or to perform new functions. Cells that are damaged or no longer needed die to make room for healthy replacements.\nIf the balance of cell growth and death is disturbed, a tumor may form.\nProblems with the body's immune system can lead to tumors. Tobacco causes more deaths from cancer than any other environmental substance."}

Tobacco causes more deaths from cancer than any other environmental substance. Other risk factors for cancer include:\nBenzene and other chemicals and toxins\nDrinking too much alcohol\nEnvironmental toxins, such as certain poisonous mushrooms and a type of poison that can grow on peanut plants (aflatoxins)\nExcessive sunlight exposure\nGenetic problems\nObesity\nRadiation exposure\nViruses\nTypes of tumors known to be caused by or linked with viruses are:\nBurkitt lymphoma (Epstein-Barr virus)\nCervical cancer\n(human papillomavirus, also called HPV)\nMost anal cancers (HPV)\nSome throat cancers, including soft palate, base of tongue and tonsils (HPV)\nSome vaginal, vulvar, and penile cancers (HPV)\nSome liver cancers (hepatitis B and hepatitis C viruses)\nKaposi sarcoma (human herpesvirus 8)\nAdult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (human T-lymphotropic virus-1)\nMerkel cell carcinoma (Merkel cell polyomavirus)\nNasopharyngeal cancer (Epstein-Barr virus)\nNon-Hodgkin lymphoma and Kaposi sarcoma (HIV)\nSome tumors are more common in one sex than the other."}

Some are more common among children or older adults. Others are related to diet, environment, and family history.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms depend on the type and location of the tumor. For example, lung tumors may cause coughing, shortness of breath, or chest pain. Tumors of the colon can cause weight loss, diarrhea, constipation, iron deficiency anemia, and blood in the stool.\nSome tumors may not cause any symptoms. Others, such as esophageal or pancreatic cancer, MAY NOT cause symptoms until the disease has reached an advanced stage.\nThe following symptoms may occur with tumors:\nFever or\nchills\nFatigue\nLoss of appetite\nNight sweats\nWeight loss\nPain\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider might see a tumor, such as skin or oral cancer. But most cancers can't be seen during an exam because they are deep inside the body.\nWhen a tumor is found, a piece of the tissue is removed and examined under a microscope. This is called a\nbiopsy\n."}

Depending on the location of the tumor, the biopsy may be a simple procedure or a serious operation.\nCT\nor\nMRI\nscan can help determine the exact location of the tumor and how far it has spread. Another imaging test called positron emission tomography (\nPET\n) is used to find certain tumor types.\nOther tests that may be done include:\nBlood tests\nBone marrow biopsy\n(most often for lymphoma or leukemia)\nChest x-ray\nComplete blood count (\nCBC\n)\nLiver function tests\nTreatment\nTreatment varies based on:\nType of tumor\nWhether it is cancer\nLocation of the tumor\nYou may not need treatment if the tumor is:\nNoncancerous (benign)\nIn a \"safe\" area where it will not cause symptoms or problems with the way an organ works\nSometimes benign tumors may be removed for cosmetic reasons or to improve symptoms."}

But a benign tumor can sometimes cause severe problems, such as in or near the brain.\nIf the tumor is cancerous, the outcome depends on the type and\nstage\nof the tumor at diagnosis. Some cancers can be cured. Some that are not curable can still be treated, and people can live for many years with the cancer. Still other tumors are quickly life threatening."}
