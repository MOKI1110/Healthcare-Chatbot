Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHead and face reconstruction\nHead and face reconstruction\nHead and face reconstruction is surgery to repair or reshape deformities of the head and face (craniofacial).\nDescription\nHow surgery for head and face deformities (craniofacial reconstruction) is done depends on the type and severity of deformity, and the person's condition. The medical term for this surgery is craniofacial reconstruction.\nSurgical repairs involve the skull (cranium), brain, nerves, eyes, and the bones and skin of the face. That is why sometimes a plastic surgeon (for skin and face) and a neurosurgeon (brain and nerves) work together. Head and neck surgeons also perform craniofacial reconstruction operations.\nThe surgery is done while you are deep asleep and pain-free (under\ngeneral anesthesia\n). The surgery may take 4 to 12 hours or more. Some of the bones of the face are cut and moved."}

The surgery may take 4 to 12 hours or more. Some of the bones of the face are cut and moved. During the surgery, tissues are moved and blood vessels and nerves are reconnected using microscopic surgery techniques.\nPieces of bone (\nbone grafts\n) may be taken from the pelvis, ribs, or skull to fill in spaces where bones of the face and head were moved. Small screws and plates made of titanium or a fixation device made of absorbable material may be used to hold the bones in place. Implants may also be used to help reshape the skull. The jaws may be wired together to hold the new bone positions in place. To cover the holes, flaps of tissue may be taken from the hand, buttocks, chest wall, or thigh.\nSometimes the surgery causes swelling of the face, mouth, or neck, which may last for weeks to months. This can block the airway. For this reason, you may need to have a temporary\ntracheostomy\n. This is a small hole that is made in your neck through which a tube (endotracheal tube) is placed in the airway (trachea)."}

If you do not have a complication, you will be able to leave the hospital usually within 1 week. More limited procedures may require shorter or no hospital stay. Complete healing may take 6 weeks or more. Swelling will improve over the following months.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nA much more normal appearance can be expected after surgery. Some people need to have follow-up procedures during the next 1 to 4 years.\nIt is important not to play contact sports for 2 to 6 months after surgery.\nPeople who have had a serious injury often need to work through the emotional issues of the trauma and the change in their appearance. Children and adults who have had a serious injury may have post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety disorders. Talking to a mental health professional or joining a support group can be helpful.\nParents of children with deformities of the face often feel guilty or ashamed, especially when the deformities are due to a genetic condition."}
