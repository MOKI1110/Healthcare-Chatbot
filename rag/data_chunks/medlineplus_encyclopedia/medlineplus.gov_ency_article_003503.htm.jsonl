Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCreatine phosphokinase test\nCreatine phosphokinase test\nCreatine phosphokinase (CPK) is an\nenzyme\nin the body. It is found mainly in the heart, brain, and skeletal muscle. This article discusses the test to measure the amount of CPK in the blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. This may be taken from a vein. The procedure is called a\nvenipuncture\n.\nThis test may be repeated over 2 or 3 days if you are a patient in the hospital.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed most of the time.\nTell your health care provider about any medicines you are taking.\nDrugs that can increase CPK measurements include the following:\nAlcohol\nAmphotericin B\nCertain anesthetics\nCocaine\nFibrate medicines\nStatins\nSteroids, such as dexamethasone\nThis list is not all-inclusive.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain when the needle is inserted to draw blood. Some people feel only a prick or stinging sensation."}

Some people feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nWhen the total CPK level is very high, it most often means there has been injury or stress to muscle tissue, the heart, or the brain.\nMuscle tissue injury is most likely. When a muscle is damaged, CPK leaks into the bloodstream. Finding which specific form of CPK is high helps determine which tissue has been damaged.\nThis test may be used to:\nDiagnose a\nheart attack\nEvaluate the cause of\nchest pain\nDetermine if or how badly a muscle is damaged\nDetect\ndermatomyositis\n,\npolymyositis\n, and other muscle diseases\nTell the difference between\nmalignant hyperthermia\nand postoperative infection\nThe pattern and timing of a rise or fall in CPK levels can be significant in making a diagnosis."}

This is particularly true if a heart attack is suspected.\nIn most cases, other tests are used instead of or with this test to diagnose a heart attack.\nNormal Results\nTotal CPK normal values:\n10 to 120 micrograms per liter (mcg/L)\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nHigh CPK levels may be seen in people who have:\nBrain injury or\nstroke\nConvulsions\nDelirium tremens\nDermatomyositis or polymyositis\nElectric shock\nHeart attack\nInflammation of the heart muscle (myocarditis)\nLung tissue death (pulmonary infarction)\nMuscular dystrophies\nMyopathy\nRhabdomyolysis\nTrauma\nOther conditions that may give abnormally high test results include:\nHypothyroidism\nHyperthyroidism\nPericarditis following a heart attack\nRisks\nRisks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting"}
