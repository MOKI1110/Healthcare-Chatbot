However, your primary care provider may also be involved if the problem could be due to a whole-body (systemic) disease.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nThe provider or eye doctor will examine your eyes and ask about your medical history. The two main questions will be if your vision is affected and if you have seen a spot on the front of your eye.\nOther questions may include:\nWhen did you first notice this?\nDoes it affect both eyes?\nDo you have trouble with your vision?\nIs it constant or intermittent?\nDo you wear contact lenses?\nIs there any history of injury to the eye?\nHas there been any discomfort?"}
