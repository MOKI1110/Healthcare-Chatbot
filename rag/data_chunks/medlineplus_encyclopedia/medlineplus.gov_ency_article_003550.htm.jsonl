Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHistocompatibility antigen test\nHistocompatibility antigen test\nA histocompatibility antigen blood test looks at proteins called human leukocyte antigens (HLAs). These are found on the surface of almost all cells in the human body. HLAs are found in large amounts on the surface of white blood cells. They help the immune system tell the difference between body tissue and substances that are not from your own body.\nHow the Test is Performed\nBlood is drawn from a vein\n. You may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou do not need to prepare for this test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe results from this test can be used to identify good matches for tissue grafts and organ transplants. These may include\nkidney transplant\nor\nbone marrow transplant\n.\nIt may also be used to:\nDiagnose certain autoimmune disorders."}

Drug-induced hypersensitivity is an example.\nDetermine relationships between children and parents when such relationships are in question.\nMonitor treatment with some medicines.\nNormal Results\nYou have a small set of HLAs that are passed down from your parents. Children, on average, will have half of their HLAs match half of their mother's and half of their HLAs match half of their father's.\nIt is unlikely that two unrelated people will have the same HLA makeup. However, identical twins may match each other.\nSome HLA types are more common in certain\nautoimmune diseases\n. For example,\nHLA-B27 antigen\nis found in many people (but not all) with\nankylosing spondylitis\nand\nReiter syndrome\n.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
