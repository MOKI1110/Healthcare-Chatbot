They may not be admitted to a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), but they are still at risk for more problems than full-term babies.\nHealth conditions in the mother, such as diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease, may contribute to preterm labor. Often, the cause of preterm labor is unknown."}

The mother may be moved to a center that is set up to care for premature infants in a NICU.\nAfter birth, the baby is admitted to the NICU. The infant is placed under a warmer or in a clear, heated box called an incubator, which regulates the air temperature. Monitoring machines track the baby's breathing, heart rate, and level of oxygen in the blood.\nA premature infant's organs are not fully developed. The infant needs special care in a nursery until the organs have developed enough to keep the baby alive without medical support. This may take weeks to months.\nInfants usually cannot coordinate sucking and swallowing before 34 weeks gestation. A premature baby may have a small, soft feeding tube placed through the nose or mouth into the stomach. In very premature or sick infants, nutrition may be given through a vein until the baby is stable enough to receive all nutrition through the stomach.\nIf the infant has breathing problems:\nA tube may be placed into their windpipe (trachea)."}

Or they may receive only extra oxygen.\nOxygen may be given by ventilator, CPAP, nasal prongs, or an oxygen hood over the baby's head.\nInfants need special nursery care until they are able to breathe without extra support, eat by mouth, and maintain body temperature and body weight. Very small infants may have other problems that complicate treatment and require a longer hospital stay.\nSupport Groups\nThere are many support groups for parents of premature babies.

Many premature infants have medical, developmental, or behavioral problems that continue into childhood or are permanent.
