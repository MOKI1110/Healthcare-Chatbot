This type of screening can find problems that can be treated before cancer develops or spreads. Regular screenings may reduce the risk for death and complications caused by colorectal cancer.\nInformation\nSCREENING TESTS\nThere are several ways to screen for colon cancer.\nStool test:\nPolyps in the colon and small cancers can cause small amounts of bleeding that cannot be seen with the naked eye. But blood can often be found in the stool.\nThis method checks your stool for blood.\nA common test used is the\nfecal immunochemical test\n(FIT). The\nfecal occult blood test\n(gFOBT) was commonly used in the past. Another stool test, commonly known as\nCologuard\nchecks for both blood and abnormal stool DNA (sDNA).\nSigmoidoscopy:\nThis test uses a small flexible scope to view the lower part of your colon."}

Another stool test, commonly known as\nCologuard\nchecks for both blood and abnormal stool DNA (sDNA).\nSigmoidoscopy:\nThis test uses a small flexible scope to view the lower part of your colon. Because the test only looks at the last one third of the large intestine (colon), it may miss some cancers or polyps that are higher in the large intestine.\nSigmoidoscopy\nand a stool test may be used together.\nColonoscopy:\ncolonoscopy\nis similar to a sigmoidoscopy, but the entire colon can be viewed.\nYour health care provider will give you the steps for cleansing your bowel. This is called bowel preparation.\nDuring a colonoscopy, you receive medicine to make you relaxed and sleepy.\nSometimes, CT scans are used as an alternative to a regular colonoscopy. This is called a\nvirtual colonoscopy\n(or CT colography).\nOther test:\nCapsule endoscopy\ninvolves swallowing a small, pill-sized camera that takes a video of the inside of your large intestine. The method is being studied, but it is not recommended for standard screening at this time.\nSCREENING FOR AVERAGE-RISK PEOPLE\nThere is not enough evidence to say that any one screening method is best."}

Colonoscopy is the most thorough but also has the highest risk. Talk to your provider about which test is right for you.\nAll adults should have a colon cancer screening test starting at age 45.\nThe most commonly recommended screening options for people with an average risk for colon cancer:\nColonoscopy every 10 years starting at age 45\nFIT every year (colonoscopy is needed if results are positive)\nFlexible sigmoidoscopy every 5 years or every 10 years plus stool testing with FIT done every year\nOther screening options include the following."}
