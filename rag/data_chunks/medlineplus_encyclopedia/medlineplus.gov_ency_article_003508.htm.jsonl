Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is used to measure the VIP level in the blood. A very high level is usually caused by a\nVIPoma\n. This is an extremely rare tumor that releases VIP.\nVIP is a substance found in cells throughout the body. The highest levels are normally found in cells in the nervous system and gut."}

This is an extremely rare tumor that releases VIP.\nVIP is a substance found in cells throughout the body. The highest levels are normally found in cells in the nervous system and gut. VIP has many functions, including relaxing certain muscles, triggering the release of hormones from the pancreas, gut, and hypothalamus, and increasing the amount of water and electrolytes secreted from the pancreas and gut.\nVIPomas produce and release VIP into the blood. This blood test checks the amount of VIP in the blood to see if a person has a VIPoma.\nOther blood tests including serum potassium may be done at the same time as the VIP test.\nNormal Results\nNormal values should be less than 75 pg/mL (22.2 pmol/L).\nPeople with VIP-secreting tumors usually have values 3 to 10 times above the normal range.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA higher-than-normal level, along with symptoms of watery diarrhea and flushing, may be a sign of a VIPoma.\nModerately elevated levels can be caused by other diseases of the gut, including irritation of the gut lining and decreased blood flow in the gut.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nVIPoma - vasoactive intestinal polypeptide test\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nÃberg K."}
