These cells produce\nmelanin\n, the substance that gives skin its color.\nSkin with too much melanin is called hyperpigmented skin.\nSkin with too little melanin is called hypopigmented. Skin with no melanin at all is called depigmented.\nPale\nskin areas are due to too little melanin or underactive melanocytes. Darker areas of skin (or an area that tans more easily) occurs when you have more melanin or overactive melanocytes.\nBronzing of the skin may sometimes be mistaken for a suntan. This skin discoloration often develops slowly, starting at the elbows, knuckles, and knees and spreading from there. Bronzing may also be seen on the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands."}
