Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCervical spine CT scan\nCervical spine CT scan\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the cervical spine makes cross-sectional pictures of the neck. It uses x-rays to create the images.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner.\nOnce you are inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you. Modern \"spiral\" scanners can perform the exam without stopping.\nA computer creates separate images of the body area, called slices. These images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, or printed on film. Three-dimensional models of the cervical spine can be created by adding the slices together.\nYou must be still during the exam. Movement can cause blurred images. You may need to hold your breath for short periods of time.\nThe scan takes 10 to 15 minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nSome exams use a special dye, called contrast that is put into your body before the test starts."}

Contrast helps certain areas show up better on the x-rays.\nContrast can be given in different ways:\nIt may be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm.\nIt may be given as an injection into the space around the spinal cord.\nIf contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.\nLet your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test to avoid this problem.\nBefore having the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes medicine metformin (Glucophage). You may need to take extra steps before the test if you take this drug.\nToo much weight can cause damage to the scanner's working parts. Find out if the CT machine has a weight limit if you weigh more than 300 pounds (135 kilograms).\nYou will wear a hospital gown during the study."}

You will need to take off all jewelry as metal can affect the CT images.\nHow the Test will Feel\nSome people may have discomfort from lying on the hard table.\nContrast given through an IV may cause a slight burning feeling, a metal taste in the mouth, and a warm flushing of the body. These feelings are normal and go away in a few seconds.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nCT makes detailed pictures of the body very quickly."}

Talk to your provider about this risk and how it weighs against the benefits of the test.\nSome people have allergies to contrast dye. Let your provider know if you have ever had an allergic reaction to injected contrast dye.\nThe most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. If a person with an iodine allergy is given this type of contrast,\nnausea or vomiting\n,\nsneezing\n,\nitching\n, or\nhives\nmay occur.\nIf you must have this type of contrast, you may get antihistamines (such as Benadryl) or steroids before the test.\nThe kidneys help remove iodine out of the body. People with kidney disease or\ndiabetes\nmay need to get extra fluids after the test to help flush the iodine out of the body.\nRarely, the dye may cause a life-threatening allergic response called\nanaphylaxis\n.
