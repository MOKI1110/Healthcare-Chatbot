Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCulture - duodenal tissue\nCulture - duodenal tissue\nA duodenal tissue culture is a laboratory exam to check a piece of tissue from the first part of the small intestine (duodenum). The test is to look for organisms that cause infection.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA piece of tissue from the first part of the small intestine is taken during an upper endoscopy (\nesophagogastroduodenoscopy\n, also called an EGD).\nThe sample is then sent to a lab. There it is placed in a special dish (culture media) that allows bacteria or viruses to grow. The sample is looked at under a microscope regularly to see if any organisms are growing.\nOrganisms that grow on the culture are identified.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThis is a test done in a lab. The sample is collected during an EGD and biopsy procedure."}

Ask your health care provider how to prepare for this procedure.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA culture of duodenal tissue is done to check for bacteria or viruses that may lead to certain illnesses and conditions.\nNormal Results\nNo harmful bacteria or viruses are found.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal finding means that harmful bacteria or a virus has been found in the tissue sample. Bacteria may include:\nCampylobacter\nHelicobacter pylori (H pylori)\nSalmonella\nRisks\nRisks of this test include:\nBleeding\nPerforation of (poking a hole in) the gastrointestinal tract by the scope\nInfection\nSome people may not be able to have this test because of other medical conditions.\nConsiderations\nOther tests are very often done to look for infection-causing organisms in duodenal tissue."}
