A blood test can be done to see how much of this protein you have in your blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nCertain medicines can change blood test results:\nTell your health care provider about all the medicines you take.\nYour provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test. This may include blood thinners.\nDo not stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou may need this test if you have an unexplained blood clot or a family history of blood clots. Protein S helps regulate blood clotting."}

This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou may need this test if you have an unexplained blood clot or a family history of blood clots. Protein S helps regulate blood clotting. A lack of this protein or a problem with the function of this protein may cause blood clots to form in veins abnormally.\nThe test is also used to screen relatives of people who are known to have\nprotein S deficiency\n.\nSometimes, this test is done to find the cause of repeated\nmiscarriages\n.\nNormal Results\nNormal values are 60% to 150% inhibition.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA lack (deficiency) of protein S can lead to excess clotting. These clots tend to form in veins, not arteries.  Sometimes the clotting can be in unusual areas such as the abdominal veins or the brain.\nA protein S deficiency may be inherited."}

It can also develop due to pregnancy or certain diseases, including:\nDisorder in which the proteins that regulate blood clotting become overactive (\ndisseminated intravascular coagulation\n)\nHIV/AIDS infection\nLiver disease\nLong-term antibiotic use\nWarfarin (Coumadin) use\nProtein S level rises with age, but this does not cause any health problems.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nReferences\nAnderson JA, Weitz JI.
