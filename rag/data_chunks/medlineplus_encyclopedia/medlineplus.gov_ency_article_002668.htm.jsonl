The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.\nA hospital stay may be needed for more doses of the medicines that reverse the effects of the drug. Complications, such as pneumonia, muscle damage from lying on a hard surface for a prolonged period of time, or brain damage from lack of oxygen may result in permanent disability. However, unless there are complications, long-term effects and death are rare.\nPeople who quickly receive medicine to reverse the effect of the opioid usually get better within 24 to 48 hours. However, children do not do as well.\nAlternative Names\nDiphenoxylate with atropine overdose; Atropine with diphenoxylate overdose\nImages\nDiarrhea\nReferences\nAronson JK. Atropine.
