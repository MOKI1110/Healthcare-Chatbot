This area is called the cul-de-sac.\nHow the Test is Performed\nFirst, you will have a pelvic exam. Then, the health care provider will hold the\ncervix\nwith an instrument and lift it slightly.\nA long, thin needle is inserted through the wall of the vagina (just below the uterus). A sample is taken of any fluid found in the space. The needle is pulled out.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked to walk or sit for a short time before the test is done.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may have an uncomfortable, cramping feeling."}

You will feel a brief, sharp pain as the needle is inserted.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis procedure is rarely done today because a transvaginal ultrasound can show fluid behind the uterus.\nIt may be done when:\nYou have pain in the lower abdomen and pelvis, and other tests suggest there is fluid in the area.\nYou may have a ruptured\nectopic pregnancy\nor\novarian cyst\n.\nYou have suffered blunt abdominal trauma.\nNormal Results\nNo fluid in the cul-de-sac, or a very small amount of clear fluid, is normal.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nFluid may still be present, even if not seen with this test. You may need other tests.\nA sample of fluid may be taken and tested for infection.\nIf blood is found in the fluid sample, you may need emergency surgery.\nRisks\nRisks include puncturing the uterine or bowel wall.\nConsiderations\nYou may need someone to take you home if you were given medicines to relax.\nImages\nFemale reproductive anatomy\nCuldocentesis\nCervix needle sample\nReferences\nBraen GR, Kiel J."}
