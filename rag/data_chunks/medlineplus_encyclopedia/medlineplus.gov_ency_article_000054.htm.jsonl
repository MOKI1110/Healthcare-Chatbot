Certain eye infections and other medical conditions, such as blood clots or\nglaucoma\n, may also need medical care right away. Since the eye is easily damaged, any of these conditions can lead to vision loss if untreated.\nConsiderations\nIt is important to get medical attention for eye or eyelid injuries and problems. Eye problems (such as a painful\nred eye\nor vision loss) that are not due to injury also need urgent medical attention.\nWatch this video about:\nCorneal injury\nCauses\nEye emergencies include any of the following:\nBLUNT TRAUMA\nBlunt trauma to the eye or face often causes bleeding under the skin that leaves a bruise called a \"black eye.\" The tissue around the eye turns black and blue, gradually becoming purple, green, and yellow over several days as the blood is absorbed. The abnormal color disappears within 2 weeks.\nSwelling of the eyelid and tissue around the eye may also occur."}

The abnormal color disappears within 2 weeks.\nSwelling of the eyelid and tissue around the eye may also occur. Sometimes, serious damage to the eye itself occurs from the pressure of a swollen eyelid or face.\nCertain types of skull fractures can cause bruising around the eyes, even without direct injury to the eye.\nCommon causes of blunt trauma include things like fists, tennis balls, and airbags.\nBlunt trauma can cause a\nhyphema\n, which is blood inside the front of the eye. The blood may block your view of the iris and pupil.\nPENETRATING TRAUMA\nPenetrating trauma may be caused by things such as knives, ice picks, sticks, nails, and gun shots.\nInjuries can be serious and usually require repair by a surgeon. Loss of the eye is not uncommon in serious injuries.\nForeign bodies thrown at high speed by machining, grinding, or hammering are other causes of penetrating trauma.\nCHEMICAL INJURY\nA chemical injury to the eye can be caused by a work-related accident. It can also be caused by common household products such as cleaning solutions, garden chemicals, solvents, or other types of chemicals."}

It can also be caused by common household products such as cleaning solutions, garden chemicals, solvents, or other types of chemicals. Fumes and aerosols can also cause chemical burns.\nThe cornea is the clear (transparent) tissue covering the front of the eye.\nWith acid burns, the haze on the cornea caused by the injury often clears and there is a good chance of recovery.\nAlkaline substances such as lime, lye, drain cleaners, and sodium hydroxide found in refrigeration equipment may cause permanent damage to the cornea.\nIt is important to flush out the eye with large amounts of clean water or salt water (saline). This kind of injury needs medical care right away.\nFOREIGN OBJECT IN THE EYE AND\nCORNEAL INJURIES\nThe cornea is the clear (transparent) tissue covering the front of the eye.\nDust, sand, and other debris can easily become embedded in the cornea without entering the eyeball."}

Always wash your hands with soap and water before touching the eye or eyelid.\nSMALL FOREIGN OBJECT ON THE EYE OR EYELID\nThe eye will often clear itself of tiny objects, like eyelashes and sand, through blinking and tearing. If not, don't rub the eye or squeeze the eyelids."}

If not, don't rub the eye or squeeze the eyelids. Here's how to examine someone else's eye:\nExamine the eye in a well-lighted area. Do not press on the eye.\nTo find the object, have the person look up and down, then from side to side.\nIf you cannot find the object, grasp the lower eyelid and gently pull it down to look under the lower eyelid. To look under the upper lid, ask the person to open both eyes and look down. Place a clean cotton swab on the outside of the upper lid. Grasp the eyelashes and gently fold the lid over the cotton swab.\nIf the object is on an eyelid, try to gently flush it out with clean water. If that does not work, try touching a second cotton swab to the object to remove it.\nIf the object is on the surface of the eye, try gently rinsing the eye with clean water. If available, use an eye dropper or a bottle of eye drops, such as artificial tears, positioned above the outer corner of the eye."}

Do not touch the eye itself with the dropper or bottle tip.\nA scratchy feeling or other minor discomfort may continue after removing eyelashes and other tiny objects. This should go away within a day or two. If discomfort or blurred vision continues, get medical help.\nOBJECT STUCK OR EMBEDDED IN THE EYE\nLeave the object in place. Do not try to remove the object. Do not touch it or apply any pressure to it.\nCalm and reassure the person.\nLoosely bandage both eyes. Covering both eyes helps prevent eye movement. If the object is large, place a clean paper cup or something similar over the injured eye and tape it in place. This prevents the object from being pressed on, which can injure the eye further.\nGet medical help right away. Do not delay.\nCHEMICAL IN THE EYE\nFlush with a gentle stream of cool tap water right away. Turn the person's head so the injured eye is down and to the side."}

Holding the eyelid open, allow running water from the faucet to flush the eye for 15 minutes.\nIf both eyes are affected, or if the chemicals are also on other parts of the body, have the person take a shower.\nIf the person is wearing contact lenses and the lenses did not flush out from the running water, have the person try to remove the contacts after the flushing.\nKeep flushing the eye with clean water or saline solution for at least 15 minutes.\nSeek medical help right away. Do not delay.\nEYE CUT, SCRATCH, OR BLOW TO THE EYE\nGently apply a clean cold compress to the eye to reduce swelling and help stop bleeding. Do not apply pressure to control bleeding.\nIf blood is pooling in the eye, cover both eyes with a clean cloth or sterile dressing.\nSeek medical help right away. Do not delay.\nEYELID CUTS\nCarefully wash the eyelid. If the cut is bleeding, apply gentle pressure with a clean, dry cloth until the bleeding stops. Do not press on the eyeball."}

It is usually safe to press on the bone around the eye.\nCover with a clean dressing.\nPlace a cold compress on the dressing to reduce pain and swelling.\nSeek medical help right away. Do not delay.\nDO NOT\nDo not press or rub an injured eye.\nDo not remove contact lenses unless rapid swelling is occurring, there is a chemical injury and the contacts did not come out with the water flush, or you cannot get prompt medical help.\nDo not attempt to remove a foreign body or any object that appears to be embedded (stuck) in any part of the eye.
