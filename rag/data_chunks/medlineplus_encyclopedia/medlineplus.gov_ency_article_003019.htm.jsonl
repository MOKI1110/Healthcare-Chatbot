It takes about 1 1/2 hours. A thin tube (catheter) is passed from the cavities of the head to the abdomen to drain the excess CSF. A pressure valve and an anti-siphon device ensure that just the right amount of fluid is drained.\nThe procedure is done as follows:\nAn area of hair on the head is shaved. This may be behind the ear or on the top or back of the head.\nThe surgeon makes a skin incision behind the ear. Another small surgical cut is made in the belly.\nA small hole is drilled in the skull. One end of the catheter is passed into a ventricle of the brain. This can be done with or without a computer as a guide. It can also be done with an endoscope that allows the surgeon to see inside the ventricle.\nA second catheter is placed under the skin behind the ear."}

It can also be done with an endoscope that allows the surgeon to see inside the ventricle.\nA second catheter is placed under the skin behind the ear. It is sent down the neck and chest, and usually into the belly area. Sometimes, it stops at the chest area. In the belly, the catheter is often placed using an endoscope. The surgeon may also make a few more small cuts, for instance in the neck or near the collarbone, to help pass the catheter under the skin.\nA valve is placed underneath the skin, usually behind the ear. The valve is connected to both catheters. When extra pressure builds up around the brain, the valve opens, and excess fluid drains through the catheter into the belly or chest area. This helps lower intracranial pressure. A reservoir on the valve allows for priming (pumping) of the valve and for collecting the CSF if needed.\nThe person is taken to a recovery area and then moved to a hospital room.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThis surgery is done when there is too much CSF in the brain and spinal cord. This is called hydrocephalus. It causes higher than normal pressure on the brain."}

This is called hydrocephalus. It causes higher than normal pressure on the brain. It can cause brain damage.\nChildren may be born with hydrocephalus. It can occur with other birth defects of the spinal column or brain. Hydrocephalus can also occur in older adults.\nShunt surgery should be done as soon as hydrocephalus is diagnosed. Alternative surgeries may be proposed. Your doctor can tell you more about these options.\nRisks\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:\nReactions to medicines or breathing problems\nBleeding\n, blood clots, or infection\nRisks of ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement are:\nBlood clot or bleeding in the brain\nBrain swelling\nHole in the intestines (bowel perforation), which can occur later after surgery\nLeakage of CSF under the skin\nInfection of the shunt, brain, or in the abdomen\nDamage to brain tissue\nSeizures\nThe shunt may stop working. If this happens, fluid will begin to build up in the brain again."}

Ask your provider for help\nquitting smoking\n.\nIf needed,\nprepare your home\nto make it easier to recover after surgery.\nAsk your surgeon if you need to arrange to have someone drive you home after your surgery.\nDuring the week before your surgery:\nYou may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners."}

Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\nLet your surgeon know about any illness you may have before your surgery. This includes\nCOVID-19\n, a\ncold\n,\nflu\n, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness. If you do get sick, your surgery may need to be postponed.\nOn the day of surgery:\nFollow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.\nTake the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\nFollow instructions on when to arrive at the hospital.

The health care team will closely monitor the person. Intravenous (IV) fluids, antibiotics, and pain medicines will be given if needed.\nFollow the surgeon's instructions about how to take care of the shunt at home. This may include taking medicine to prevent infection of the shunt.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nShunt placement is usually successful in reducing pressure in the brain.
