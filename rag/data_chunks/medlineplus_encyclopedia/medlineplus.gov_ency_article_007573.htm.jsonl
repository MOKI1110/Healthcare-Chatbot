It is done in the hospital. Before surgery, you will receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n. This will make you sleep and unable to feel pain.\nThe amount of tissue and the number of lymph nodes that are removed depend on how far the cancer has spread. There are 3 main types of neck dissection surgery:\nRadical neck dissection. All the tissue on the side of the neck from the jawbone to the collarbone is removed. The muscle, nerve, salivary gland, and major blood vessel in this area are all removed.\nModified radical neck dissection. This is the most common type of neck dissection. All lymph nodes are removed. Less neck tissue is taken out than with radical dissection. This surgery may also spare the nerves in the neck and, sometimes, the blood vessels or muscle.\nSelective neck dissection. If cancer has not spread far, fewer lymph nodes have to be removed."}

The muscle, nerve, and blood vessel in the neck may also be saved.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThe\nlymph system\ncarries white blood cells around the body to fight infection. Cancer cells in the mouth or throat can travel in the lymph fluid and get trapped in the lymph nodes. The lymph nodes are removed to prevent cancer from spreading to other parts of the body and to decide if any more treatment is needed.\nYour surgeon may recommend this procedure if:\nYou have cancer of the mouth, tongue, thyroid gland, or other areas of the throat or neck.\nCancer has spread to the lymph nodes.\nThe cancer could spread to other parts of the body.\nRisks\nRisks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:\nAllergic reactions to medicines\nBreathing problems\nBleeding\nInfection\nOther risks for this surgery are:\nNumbness in the skin and ear on the side of the surgery, which may be permanent\nDamage to the nerves of the cheek, lip, and tongue\nProblems lifting the shoulder and arm\nLimited neck movement\nDrooping"}
