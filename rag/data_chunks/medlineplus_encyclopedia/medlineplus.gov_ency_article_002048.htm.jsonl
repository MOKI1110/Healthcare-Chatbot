A person's appearance -- height, hair color, skin color, and eye color -- is influenced by genes. Other characteristics influenced by heredity are:\nLikelihood of getting certain diseases\nMental abilities\nNatural talents\nAn abnormal trait (variant) that is passed down through families (inherited) may:\nHave no effect on your health or well-being. For example, the trait might just cause a white patch of hair or an earlobe that is longer than normal.\nHave only a minor effect, such as\ncolor blindness\n.\nHave a major effect on your quality or length of life.\nFor most genetic conditions,\ngenetic counseling\nis advised for couples who want to become pregnant.\nInformation\nHuman beings have cells with 46\nchromosomes\n. These consist of 2 chromosomes that determine what sex they are (X and Y chromosomes), and 22 pairs of nonsex (autosomal) chromosomes."}

These consist of 2 chromosomes that determine what sex they are (X and Y chromosomes), and 22 pairs of nonsex (autosomal) chromosomes. Males are \"46,XY\" and females are \"46,XX.\" The chromosomes are made up of strands of genetic information called DNA. Each chromosome contains sections of DNA called genes. The genes carry the information needed by your body to make certain proteins.\nEach pair of chromosomes contains one chromosome from the mother and one from the father. Each chromosome in a pair carries basically the same information; that is, each chromosome pair has the same genes. Sometimes there are slight variations of these genes. These variations occur in less than 1% of the DNA sequence. The genes that have these variations are called alleles.\nSome of these variations can result in a gene that is not working properly. A variant gene may lead to an abnormal protein or an abnormal amount of a normal protein. In a pair of autosomal chromosomes, there are two copies of each gene, one from each parent. If one of these genes is abnormal, the other one may make enough protein so that no disease develops."}

In a pair of autosomal chromosomes, there are two copies of each gene, one from each parent. If one of these genes is abnormal, the other one may make enough protein so that no disease develops. When this happens, the variant gene is called recessive. Recessive genes are said to be inherited in either an autosomal recessive or X-linked pattern. If two copies of the variant gene are present, disease may develop.\nHowever, if only one variant gene is needed to produce a disease, it leads to a dominant hereditary condition. In the case of a dominant condition, if one variant gene is inherited from the mother or father, the child will likely show the disease.\nA person with one variant gene is called heterozygous for that gene. If a child receives a variant recessive disease gene from both parents, the child will show the disease and will be homozygous (or compound heterozygous) for that gene.\nGENETIC DISORDERS\nAlmost all diseases have a genetic component. However, the importance of that component varies."}

However, the importance of that component varies. Disorders in which genes play an important role (genetic diseases) can be classified as:\nSingle-gene variants\nChromosomal conditions\nMultifactorial\nA single-gene condition (also called Mendelian disorder) is caused by a variant in one particular gene. Many conditions caused by single gene variants are rare. But since there are many thousands of known single gene conditions, their combined impact is significant.\nSingle-gene conditions are characterized by how they are passed down in families. There are 6 basic patterns of single gene inheritance:\nAutosomal dominant\nAutosomal recessive\nX-linked dominant\nX-linked recessive\nY-linked inheritance\nMaternal (mitochondrial) inheritance\nThe observed effect of a gene (the appearance of a condition) is called the phenotype.\nIn autosomal dominant inheritance, the variations usually appear in every generation."}

Each time an affected parent, either male or female, has a child, that child has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease.\nPeople with one copy of a recessive disease gene are called carriers. Carriers usually don't have symptoms of the disease. But, the gene can often be found by sensitive laboratory tests.\nIn autosomal recessive inheritance, the parents of an affected individual may not show the disease (they are carriers). On average, the chance that carrier parents could have children who develop the disease is 25% with each pregnancy. Male and female children are equally likely to be affected. For a child to have symptoms of an autosomal recessive disorder, the child must receive the variant gene from both parents. Because most recessive disorders are rare, a child is at increased risk of a recessive disease if the parents are related."}

Because most recessive disorders are rare, a child is at increased risk of a recessive disease if the parents are related. Related individuals are more likely to have inherited the same rare gene from a common ancestor.\nIn X-linked recessive inheritance, the chance of being affected with the disease is much higher in males than females. Since the variant gene is carried on the X (female) chromosome, males do not transmit it to their sons (who will receive the Y chromosome from their fathers). However, they do transmit it to their daughters. In females, the presence of one normal X chromosome masks the effects of the X chromosome with the variant gene. So, almost all of the daughters of an affected man appear normal, but they are all carriers of the variant gene. Each time these daughters bear a son, there is a 50% chance the son will receive the variant gene.\nIn X-linked dominant inheritance, the variant gene appears in females, causing the associated condition, even if there is also a normal X chromosome present. Since males pass the Y chromosome to their sons, affected males will not have affected sons."}
