Ulcers are open sores that can result from untreated stasis dermatitis.\nCauses\nVenous insufficiency\nis a long-term (chronic) condition in which the veins have problems sending blood from the legs back to the heart. This may be due to damaged valves that are in the veins.\nSome people with venous insufficiency develop stasis dermatitis. Blood pools in the veins of the lower leg. Fluid and blood cells leak out of the veins into the skin and other tissues. This may lead to itching and inflammation that cause more skin changes. The skin may then break down to form open sores.\nSymptoms\nYou may have symptoms of venous insufficiency including:\nDull aching or heaviness in the leg\nPain that gets worse when you stand or walk\nSwelling in the leg\nAt first, the skin of the ankles and lower legs may look thin or tissue-like."}

You may slowly get brown coloring of the skin.\nThe skin may become irritated or crack if you scratch it. It may also become red or swollen, crusted, or weepy.\nOver time, some skin changes become permanent:\nThickening and hardening of the skin on the legs and ankles (lipodermatosclerosis)\nA bumpy or cobblestone appearance of the skin\nSkin turns dark brown\nSkin sores (\nulcers\n) may develop (called a venous ulcer or stasis ulcer). These most often form on the inside of the ankle.\nExams and Tests\nThe diagnosis is primarily based on the way the skin looks. Your health care provider may order tests to examine the blood flow in your legs.\nStasis dermatitis can also be related to heart problems or other conditions that cause leg swelling."}
