The outcome depends on how severe the immune system deficiency and the CMV infection are.\nPeople with AIDS may have a worse outcome than those with a weakened immune system due to another reason.\nCMV infection typically affects the entire body, even if only (GI) symptoms are present. How well a person does depends on how well the antiviral medicines work.\nPossible Complications\nThe medicines used to fight the virus may cause side effects. The type of side effect depends on the specific medicine used."}

Another medicine, foscarnet, may lead to kidney problems.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have symptoms of CMV gastroenteritis/colitis.\nPrevention\nThere is a high risk of CMV infection in people who receive an organ transplant from a CMV-positive donor. Taking the antiviral medicines ganciclovir (Cytovene) and valganciclovir (Valcyte) by mouth before the transplant can lower your chance of getting a new infection or reactivating an old infection.\nPeople with AIDS who are effectively treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy are much less likely to get a CMV infection.\nAlternative Names\nColitis - cytomegalovirus; Gastroenteritis - cytomegalovirus; Gastrointestinal CMV disease\nImages\nGastrointestinal anatomy\nStomach and stomach lining\nCMV (cytomegalovirus)\nReferences\nBritt WJ.
