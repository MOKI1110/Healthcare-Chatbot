Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPelvic CT scan\nPelvic CT scan\ncomputed tomography (CT) scan\nof the pelvis is an imaging method that uses\nx-rays\nto create cross-sectional pictures of the area between the hip bones. This part of the body is called the pelvic area.\nStructures inside and near the pelvis include the bladder, prostate and other male reproductive organs, female reproductive organs, lymph nodes, small intestine, colon, and pelvic bones.\nSingle CT images are called slices. The images are stored on a computer, viewed on a monitor, or printed on film. Three-dimensional models of the body area can be created by stacking the slices together.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will be asked to lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner.\nOnce you are inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you. You will not see the rotating x-ray beams.\nYou must be still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images."}

You will not see the rotating x-ray beams.\nYou must be still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time.\nThe scan should take less than 10 minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nCertain exams require a special dye. It is called contrast media. It has to be delivered into the body before the test starts. The contrast helps certain areas show up better on the x-rays.\nContrast can be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. Or you may be asked to drink a liquid form of contrast. If contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.\nLet your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test in order to safely receive this substance.\nBefore receiving the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes medicine metformin (Glucophage) because you may need to take extra precautions.\nBefore receiving the contrast, tell your provider if you have kidney problems."}

You may not be able to get IV contrast if this is the case.\nIf you weigh more than 300 pounds (136 kilograms), find out if the CT machine has a weight limit. Too much weight can damage the scanner's working parts or cause injury to the person.\nYou will be asked to remove jewelry and wear a hospital gown during the study.\nHow the Test will Feel\nSome people may have discomfort from lying on the hard table.\nContrast given through an IV may cause:\nSlight burning sensation\nMetallic taste in the mouth\nWarm flushing of the body\nThese sensations are normal and most often go away within a few seconds.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nCT rapidly creates detailed pictures of the body, including the pelvis and areas near the pelvis."}

Having many x-rays or CT scans over time may increase your risk of cancer. But the risk from any one scan is small. You and your provider should weigh this risk against the benefits of getting a correct diagnosis for a medical problem.\nSome people have allergies to contrast dye.

Those with kidney disease or diabetes may need to receive extra fluids after the test to help flush the iodine out of the body.\nIn rare cases, the dye causes a life-threatening allergic response called\nanaphylaxis\n. If you have any trouble breathing during the test, you should tell the scanner operator right away. Scanners come with an intercom and speakers, so the operator can hear you at all times.\nAlternative Names\nCAT scan - pelvis; Computed axial tomography scan - pelvis; Computed tomography scan - pelvis; CT scan - pelvis\nImages\nCT scan\nReferences\nBishoff JT, Rastinehad AR.
