Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAcute arterial occlusion - kidney\nAcute arterial occlusion - kidney\nAcute arterial occlusion of the kidney is a sudden, severe blockage of the artery that supplies blood to the kidney.\nCauses\nThe kidneys need a good blood supply. The main artery to the kidney is called the renal artery. Reduced blood flow through the\nrenal\nartery can hurt kidney function. A complete blockage of blood flow to the kidney can often result in permanent kidney failure.\nAcute arterial occlusion of the renal artery can occur after injury or trauma to the abdomen, side, or back. Blood clots that travel through the bloodstream (\nemboli\n) can lodge in the renal artery. Pieces of plaque from the walls of the arteries can come loose (on their own or during a medical procedure that affects an artery). This debris can block the main kidney artery or one of the smaller vessels.\nThe risk of renal artery blockages increases in people who have certain heart disorders, which make them likely to form blood clots."}

These include\nmitral stenosis\nand\natrial fibrillation\n.\nA narrowing of the renal artery is called\nrenal artery stenosis\n. This condition increases the risk of a sudden blockage.\nSymptoms\nYou may not have symptoms when one kidney does not function because the second kidney can filter the blood. However, high blood pressure (hypertension) may come on suddenly and be difficult to control.\nIf your other kidney is not working fully, blockage of the renal artery may cause symptoms of\nacute kidney failure\n. Other symptoms of acute arterial occlusion of the renal artery include:\nAbdominal pain\nAbrupt decrease in urine output\nBack pain\nBlood in the urine\nFlank pain\nor pain in the side\nSymptoms of high blood pressure such as headache, change in vision, and swelling\nNote: There may be no pain."}

Pain, if it is present, most often develops suddenly.\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will not be able to identify the problem with just an exam unless you have developed kidney failure.\nTests you may need include:\nDuplex Doppler ultrasound exam of the renal arteries to test blood flow\nMRI\nof the kidney arteries, which can show a lack of blood flow to the affected kidney\nRenal arteriography\nshows the exact location of the blockage\nUltrasound\nof the kidney to check kidney size\nTreatment\nSome people do not need treatment. Blood clots may get better on their own over time.\nYou may have treatment to open the artery if the blockage is discovered quickly or it is affecting your only working kidney."}

Treatment to open the artery may include:\nClot-dissolving medicines (thrombolytics)\nMedicines that prevent the blood from clotting (anticoagulants), such as warfarin (Coumadin)\nSurgical repair of the renal artery\nInsertion of a tube (catheter) into the renal artery to open the blockage\nYou may need temporary\ndialysis\nto treat acute kidney failure. Medicines to lower cholesterol may be needed if the blockage is due to clots from plaque buildup in the arteries.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nDamage caused by arterial occlusion may go away. However, in most cases, it is permanent.\nIf only one kidney is affected, the healthy kidney may take over filtering the blood and producing urine. If you have only one working kidney, arterial occlusion leads to acute kidney failure."}

The most important way to reduce your risk is to stop smoking.\nPeople at risk for developing blood clots may need to take anti-clotting medicines. Taking steps to control diseases related to atherosclerosis (hardening of the arteries) may reduce your risk.\nAlternative Names\nAcute renal arterial thrombosis; Renal artery embolism; Acute renal artery occlusion; Embolism - renal artery\nImages\nKidney anatomy\nKidney - blood and urine flow\nKidney blood supply\nReferences\nBellomo R."}
