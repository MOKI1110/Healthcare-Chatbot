Neuropathy means damage to a peripheral nerve.\nCauses\nMultiple mononeuropathy is due to damage to one or more peripheral nerves. These are the nerves outside the brain and spinal cord. It is a group of symptoms (syndrome), not a disease.\nHowever, certain diseases can cause the injury or nerve damage that leads to the symptoms of multiple mononeuropathy."}

These injuries may become severely damaged or infected because the pain nerves of the area are not signaling the injury.\nPeople with multiple mononeuropathy may be prone to new nerve injuries at pressure points such as the knees and elbows. They should avoid putting pressure on these areas, for example, by not leaning on the elbows, crossing the knees, or holding similar positions for long periods."}
