Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPleural fluid culture\nPleural fluid culture\nPleural fluid culture is a test that examines a sample of fluid that has been collected in the pleural space to see if you have an infection to help understand the cause of the buildup of fluid in this space. The pleural space is the area between the lining of the outside of the lungs (pleura) and the wall of the chest. When fluid collects in the pleural space, the condition is called\npleural effusion\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA procedure called\nthoracentesis\nis performed to get a sample of pleural fluid. The sample is sent to a laboratory and examined under a microscope for signs of infection. The sample is also placed in a special dish (culture) to support the growth of microorganisms. It is then watched to see if bacteria or any other germs grow. This can take several days.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed before the test."}

A chest x-ray will be performed before and after the thoracentesis procedure.\nDo not cough, breathe deeply, or move during the procedure to avoid injuring the lung.\nHow the Test will Feel\nFor thoracentesis, you sit on the edge of a chair or bed with your head and arms resting on a table. Your health care provider cleans the skin around the insertion site. Numbing medicine (anesthetic) is injected into the skin.\nA needle is placed through the skin and muscles of the chest wall into the pleural space. As fluid drains into a collection bottle, you may cough a bit. This is because your lung re-expands to fill the space where fluid had been."}
