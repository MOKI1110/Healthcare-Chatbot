The success of the treatment usually depends on the severity of your fears.\nBehavioral treatment is often tried first and may have long-lasting benefits:\nCognitive behavioral therapy helps you understand and change the thoughts that are causing your condition, as well as learn to recognize and replace panic-causing thoughts.\nSystematic desensitization or exposure therapy may be used. You are asked to relax, then imagine the situations that cause the anxiety, working from the least fearful to the most fearful. Gradual exposure to the real-life situation has also been used with success to help people overcome their fears.\nSocial skills training may involve social contact in a group therapy situation to practice social skills. Role playing and modeling are techniques used to help you become more comfortable relating to others in a social situation.\nCertain medicines, often also used to treat depression, may be very helpful for this disorder."}
