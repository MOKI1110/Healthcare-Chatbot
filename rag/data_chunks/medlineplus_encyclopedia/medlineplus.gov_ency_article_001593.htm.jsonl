The syndrome's name is based on the infant's cry, which is high-pitched and sounds like a cat.\nCauses\nCri du chat syndrome is rare. It is caused by a missing piece of chromosome 5.\nMost cases are believed to occur during the development of the egg or sperm. A small number of cases occur when a parent passes a different, rearranged form of the chromosome to their child.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nCry that is high-pitched and may sound like a cat\nDownward slant to the eyes\nEpicanthal folds\n, an extra fold of skin over the inner corner of the eye\nLow birth weight and slow growth\nLow-set or abnormally shaped ears\nHearing loss\nHeart defects\nIntellectual disability\nPartial webbing or fusing of fingers or toes\nCurvature of the spine (scoliosis)\nSingle line in the palm of the hand\nSkin tags just in front of the ear\nSlow or incomplete development of motor skills\nSmall head (\nmicrocephaly\n)\nSmall jaw (\nmicrognathia\n)\nWide-s"}

This may show:\nInguinal hernia\nDiastasis recti\n(separation of the muscles in the belly area)\nLow muscle tone\nCharacteristic facial features\nGenetic tests can show a missing part of chromosome 5. Skull x-ray may reveal any problems with the shape of the base of the skull.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment. Your provider will suggest ways to treat or manage the symptoms.\nParents of a child with this syndrome should have genetic counseling and testing to determine if one parent has a change in chromosome 5.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with Cri du chat syndrome and their families can be found at:\n5P- Society --\nfivepminus.org\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIntellectual disability is common.
