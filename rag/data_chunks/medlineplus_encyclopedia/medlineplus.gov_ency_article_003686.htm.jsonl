Taking the right amount of folic acid before and during pregnancy helps prevent neural tube defects, such as spina bifida.\nWomen who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant should take at least 600 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid every day. It may be provided by prenatal vitamins and certain foods, such as enriched bread, flour, and cereal. Some women may need to take more if they have a history of neural tube defects in earlier pregnancies. Ask your provider how much you should take.\nNormal Results\nThe normal range is 2.7 to 17.0 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) or 6.12 to 38.52 nanomoles per liter (nmol/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your test results.\nThe examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests."}

Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nLower-than-normal folic acid levels may indicate:\nPoor diet\nMalabsorption\nsyndrome (for example,\nceliac disease\n)\nMalnutrition\nThe test may also be done in cases of:\nAnemia\nthat may be due to folate deficiency\nMegaloblastic anemia -- a form of anemia which can be due to low folic acid or vitamin B12 levels\nRisks\nThere is very little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther slight risks from having blood drawn may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nFolate - test\nReferences\nAntony AC.
