Some women who have trouble getting pregnant may be given medicines to help them produce and release eggs.\nIf these medicines stimulate the ovaries too much, the ovaries can become very swollen. Fluid can leak into the belly and chest area. This is called OHSS."}

Fluid can leak into the belly and chest area. This is called OHSS. This occurs only after the eggs are released from the ovary (ovulation).\nYou may be more likely to get OHSS if:\nYou receive a shot of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG).\nYou get more than one dose of hCG after ovulation.\nYou become pregnant during this cycle.\nOHSS rarely occurs in women who only take fertility drugs by mouth.\nOHSS affects 3% to 6% of women who go through\nin vitro fertilization\n(IVF).\nOther risk factors for OHSS include:\nBeing younger than age 35\nHaving a very high estrogen level during fertility treatments\nDeveloping an unusually large number of ovarian follicles with your fertility treatment\nHaving\npolycystic ovarian syndrome\nLow body weight\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms of OHSS can range from mild to severe."}

Most women with the condition have mild symptoms such as:\nAbdominal bloating\nMild pain in the abdomen\nWeight gain\nIn rare cases, women can have more serious symptoms, including:\nRapid weight gain (more than 10 pounds or 4.5 kilograms in 3 to 5 days)\nSevere pain or swelling in the belly area\nDecreased urination\nShortness of breath\nNausea, vomiting, or diarrhea\nBlood clots\nExams and Tests\nIf you have a severe case of OHSS, your health care provider will need to monitor your symptoms carefully. You may be admitted to the hospital.\nYour weight and the size of your belly area (abdomen) will be measured. Tests that may be done include:\nAbdominal ultrasound\nor vaginal ultrasound\nChest x-ray\nComplete blood count\nElectrolytes panel\nLiver function test\nTests to measure urine output\nTreatment\nMild cases of OHSS usually don't need to be treated."}

The condition may actually be associated with a greater chance of becoming pregnant.\nThe following steps can help you ease your discomfort:\nGet plenty of rest with your legs raised. This helps your body release the fluid. However, light activity every now and then is better than complete bed rest, unless your provider tells you otherwise.\nDrink at least 10 to 12 glasses (about 1.5 to 2 liters) of fluid a day (especially drinks that contain\nelectrolytes\n).\nAvoid alcohol or caffeinated beverages (such as colas or coffee).\nAvoid intense exercise and sexual intercourse."}

These activities can cause ovarian discomfort and may cause ovarian cysts to rupture or leak, or cause the ovaries to twist and cut off blood flow (ovarian torsion).\nTake an over-the-counter pain reliever such as acetaminophen (Tylenol).\nYou should weigh yourself each day to make sure you are not putting on too much weight (2 or more pounds or about 1 kilogram or more a day).\nIf your provider diagnoses severe OHSS before transferring embryos in an IVF, they may decide to cancel the embryo transfer. The embryos are frozen and they wait for OHSS to resolve before scheduling a frozen embryo transfer cycle.\nIn the rare case that you develop severe OHSS, you will probably need to go to a hospital. Your provider will give you fluids through a vein (intravenous fluids). They will also remove fluids that have collected in your body, and monitor your condition.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost mild cases of OHSS will go away on their own after menstruation starts."}

If you have a more severe case, it can take several days for symptoms to improve.\nIf you become pregnant during OHSS, the symptoms may get worse and can take weeks to go away.\nPossible Complications\nIn rare cases, OHSS can lead to fatal complications. These can include:\nBlood clots\nKidney failure\nSevere electrolyte imbalance\nSevere fluid buildup in the abdomen or chest\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you experience any of the following symptoms:\nLess urine output\nDizziness\nExcessive weight gain, more than 2 pounds (1 kg) a day\nVery bad nausea (you cannot keep food or liquids down)\nSevere abdominal pain\nShortness of breath\nPrevention\nIf you are getting injections of fertility medicines, you will need to have regular blood tests and pelvic ultrasounds to make sure that your ovaries aren't over-responding.\nAlternative Names\nOHSS\nReferences\nCatherino WH.
