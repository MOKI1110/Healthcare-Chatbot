Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCataract - adult\nCataract - adult\nA cataract is a clouding of the lens of the eye.\nCauses\nThe lens of the eye is normally clear. It acts like the lens on a camera, focusing light as it passes to the back of the eye.\nUntil a person is around age 45, the shape of the lens is able to change. This allows the lens to focus on an object, whether it is close or far away.\nAs a person ages, proteins in the lens begin to break down. This makes the lens less flexible so that it is harder to focus on near objects. Over time, the lens becomes cloudy. What the eye sees may appear blurry at all distances. This condition is known as a cataract.\nFactors that may speed cataract formation are:\nDiabetes\nEye inflammation\nEye injury\nFamily history of cataracts\nLong-term use of corticosteroids (taken by mouth) or certain other medicines\nRadiation exposure\nSmoking\nSurgery for another eye problem\nToo much exposure to ultraviolet light (sunlight)\nSymptoms\nWatch this video about:\nCataract\nCataracts develop slowly and painlessly."}

Vision in the affected eye slowly gets worse.\nMild clouding of the lens often occurs after age 60. But it may not cause any vision problems.\nBy age 75, most people have cataracts that affect their vision.\nProblems with seeing may include:\nBeing sensitive to glare\nCloudy, fuzzy, foggy, or filmy vision\nDifficulty seeing at night or in dim light\nDouble vision\nLoss of color intensity\nProblems seeing shapes against a background or the difference between shades of colors\nSeeing halos around lights\nFrequent changes in eyeglass prescriptions\nCataracts lead to decreased vision, even in daylight. Most people with cataracts have similar changes in both eyes, though one eye may be worse than the other. Often there are only mild vision changes.\nExams and Tests\nstandard eye exam\nand\nslit-lamp examination\nare used to diagnose cataracts."}

Often there are only mild vision changes.\nExams and Tests\nstandard eye exam\nand\nslit-lamp examination\nare used to diagnose cataracts. Other tests are rarely needed, except to check for other causes of poor vision.\nTreatment\nFor an early cataract, the eye doctor (ophthalmologist) may recommend the following:\nChange in eyeglass prescription\nBetter lighting\nMagnifying lenses\nSunglasses\nAs vision gets worse, you may need to make changes around the home to avoid falls and injuries.\nThe only treatment for a cataract is\nsurgery\nto remove it. If a cataract is not making it hard for you to see, surgery is usually not needed. Cataracts usually do not harm the eye, so you can have surgery when you and your eye doctor decide it is right for you."}

Cataracts usually do not harm the eye, so you can have surgery when you and your eye doctor decide it is right for you. Surgery is usually recommended when you can't do normal activities such as driving, reading, or looking at computer or video screens, even with glasses.\nSome research found that having cataract surgery is associated with a lower risk of dementia but more research is needed to determine if this association was cause and effect.\nSome people may have other eye problems, such as\ndiabetic retinopathy\n, that can't be treated without first having cataract surgery.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nVision may not improve to 20/20 after cataract surgery if other eye diseases, such as\nmacular degeneration\n, are present. The eye doctor can often determine this in advance.\nPossible Complications\nEarly diagnosis and properly timed treatment are key to preventing permanent vision problems.\nAlthough rare, a cataract that goes on to an advanced stage (called a hypermature cataract) can begin to leak into other parts of the eye."}

Avoiding exposure to things that promote cataract formation can also help. For example, if you smoke, now is the time to\nquit\n. Also, when outdoors, wear sunglasses to protect your eyes from harmful UV rays.\nAlternative Names\nLens opacity; Age-related cataract; Vision loss - cataract\nPatient Instructions\nCataracts - what to ask your doctor\nImages\nEye\nSlit-lamp exam\nCataract - close-up of the eye\nCataract surgery - series\nReferences\nAmerican Academy of Ophthalmology Preferred Practice Pattern Cataract and Anterior Segment Committee.
