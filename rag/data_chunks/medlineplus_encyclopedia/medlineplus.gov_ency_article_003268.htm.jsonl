They are different from neonatal teeth, which grow in during the first 30 days after birth.\nConsiderations\nNatal teeth are uncommon. They most often develop on the lower gum, where the central incisor teeth will appear. They have little root structure. They are attached to the end of the gum by soft tissue and are often wobbly.\nNatal teeth are usually not well-formed, but they may cause irritation and injury to the infant's tongue when nursing. Natal teeth may also be uncomfortable for a nursing mother.\nNatal teeth are often removed shortly after birth while the\nnewborn infant\nis still in the hospital. This is done very often if the tooth is loose and the child runs a risk of \"breathing in\" the tooth.\nCauses\nMost of the time, natal teeth are not related to a medical condition."}

However, sometimes they may be associated with:\nEllis-van Creveld syndrome\nHallermann-Streiff syndrome\nCleft palate\nPierre-Robin syndrome\nSoto syndrome\nHome Care\nClean the natal teeth by gently wiping the gums and teeth with a clean, damp cloth. Examine the infant's gums and tongue often to make sure the teeth are not causing injury.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if an infant with natal teeth develops a sore tongue or mouth, or other symptoms.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nNatal teeth are most often discovered by the provider shortly after birth.\nDental x-rays\nmay be done in some cases. If there are signs of another condition that may be linked with natal teeth, exams and testing for that condition may need to be done.\nAlternative Names\nFetal teeth; Congenital teeth; Predeciduous teeth; Precocious teeth\nImages\nDevelopment of baby teeth\nReferences\nBall JW, Dains JE, Flynn JA, Solomon BS, Stewart RW.
