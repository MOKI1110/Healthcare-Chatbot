Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nArterial embolism\nArterial embolism\nArterial embolism refers to a clot (embolus) that has come from another part of the body and causes a sudden interruption of blood flow to an organ or body part.\nCauses\nAn \"embolus\" is a blood clot or a piece of atherosclerotic plaque that acts like a clot. The word \"emboli\" means there is more than one clot or piece of plaque. When the clot travels from the site where it formed to another location in the body, it is called an embolism.\nAn arterial\nembolism\nmay be caused by one or more clots. The clots can get stuck in an artery and block blood flow. The blockage starves tissues of blood and oxygen. This can result in damage or tissue death (\nnecrosis\n).\nArterial emboli often occur in the legs and feet. Emboli that occur in the brain cause a\nstroke\n. Ones that occur in the heart cause a\nheart attack\n."}

Emboli that occur in the brain cause a\nstroke\n. Ones that occur in the heart cause a\nheart attack\n. Other sites include the kidneys, intestines, and eyes.\nRisk factors for arterial embolism include:\nAbnormal heart rhythms such as\natrial fibrillation\nInjury or damage to an artery wall\nConditions that increase blood clotting\nAnother condition that poses a high risk for embolization (especially to the brain) is\nmitral stenosis\n. Endocarditis (infection of the inside of the heart) can also cause arterial emboli.\nA common source for an embolus is from areas of hardening (atherosclerosis causing plaque) in the aorta and other large blood vessels. These clots can break loose and flow down to the abdominal organs, legs and feet.\nParadoxical embolization can take place when a clot in a vein enters the right side of the heart and passes through a hole into the left side of the heart."}

The goals of treatment are to control symptoms and to improve the interrupted blood flow to the affected area of the body. The cause of the clot, if found, should be treated to prevent further problems.\nMedicines include:\nAnticoagulants (such as warfarin or heparin or one of the newer blood thinners such as apixaban, rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or dabigatran) can prevent new clots from forming\nAntiplatelet medicines (such as aspirin or clopidogrel) can prevent new clots from forming\nPainkillers given through a vein (by IV)\nThrombolytics (such as streptokinase or tissue-type plasminogen activator) can dissolve clots\nSome people need surgery."}
