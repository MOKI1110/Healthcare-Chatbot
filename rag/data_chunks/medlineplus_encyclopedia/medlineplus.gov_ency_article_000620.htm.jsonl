Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nGas gangrene\nGas gangrene\nGas gangrene is a potentially deadly form of tissue death (\ngangrene\n).\nCauses\nGas gangrene is most often caused by bacteria called\nClostridium perfringens.\nAlso, it can occasionally be caused caused by group A streptococcus,\nStaphylococcus aureus,\nand\nVibrio vulnificus\n.\nClostridium is found nearly everywhere. As the bacteria grow inside the body, they emit gas and harmful substances (toxins) that can damage body tissues, cells, and blood vessels.\nGas gangrene develops suddenly. It usually occurs at the site of trauma or a recent surgical wound. In some cases, it occurs without an irritating event. People most at risk for gas gangrene usually have blood vessel disease (\natherosclerosis\n, or hardening of the arteries),\ndiabetes\n, or\ncolon cancer\n.\nSymptoms\nGas gangrene causes very painful\nswelling\n. The skin turns pale to brownish-red. When the swollen area is pressed, gas can be felt (and sometimes  heard)  as a crackly sensation (crepitus). The edges of the infected area grow so quickly that changes can be seen over minutes."}

When the swollen area is pressed, gas can be felt (and sometimes  heard)  as a crackly sensation (crepitus). The edges of the infected area grow so quickly that changes can be seen over minutes. The area may be completely destroyed.\nSymptoms include:\nAir under the skin (\nsubcutaneous emphysema\n)\nBlisters filled with brown-red fluid\nDrainage from the tissues, foul-smelling brown-red or bloody fluid (\nserosanguineous\ndischarge)\nIncreased heart rate (\ntachycardia\n)\nModerate to high fever\nModerate to severe pain around a skin injury\nPale skin color, later becoming dusky and changing to dark red or purple\nSwelling that worsens around a skin injury\nSweating\nVesicle\nformation, combining into large blisters\nYellow color to the skin (\njaundice\n)\nIf the condition is not treated, the person can go into\nshock\nwith decreased blood pressure (\nhypotension\n),\nkidney failure\n, coma, and finally death.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

Amputation sometimes must be done before all test results are available.\nAntibiotics are also given. These medicines are given through a vein (intravenously). Pain medicines may also be prescribed.\nIn some cases,\nhyperbaric oxygen treatment\nmay be tried.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nGas gangrene usually begins suddenly and quickly gets worse."}

Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number, if you have symptoms of gas gangrene.\nPrevention\nClean any skin injury thoroughly. Watch for signs of infection (such as redness, pain, drainage, or swelling around a wound). See your provider promptly if these occur.\nAlternative Names\nTissue infection - clostridial; Gangrene - gas; Myonecrosis; Clostridial infection of tissues; Necrotizing soft tissue infection\nImages\nGas gangrene\nGas gangrene\nBacteria\nReferences\nOnderdonk AB, Garrett WS.
