It most often occurs because of a problem that leads to\nvitamin D\ndeficiency, which helps your body absorb calcium. Your body needs calcium to maintain the strength and hardness of your bones.\nIn children, the condition is called\nrickets\n.\nCauses\nA lack of the proper amount of calcium in the blood can lead to weak and soft bones. Low blood calcium can be caused by low vitamin D level in the blood.\nVitamin D is absorbed from food or produced by the skin when exposed to sunlight."}

More importantly, osteomalacia can look like weakening of the bones from\nosteoporosis\non bone density testing.\nIn some cases, a\nbone biopsy\nwill be done to see if bone softening is present.\nTreatment\nTreatment may involve vitamin D, calcium, and phosphorus supplements taken by mouth.
