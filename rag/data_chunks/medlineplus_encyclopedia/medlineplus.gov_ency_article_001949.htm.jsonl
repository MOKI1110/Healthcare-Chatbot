These steps can make sex safer but not 100% safe.\nInformation\nA sexually transmitted infection (STI) is an infection that can be spread to another person through sexual contact. STIs include:\nChlamydia\nGenital herpes\nGenital warts\nGonorrhea\nHepatitis\nHIV (human immunodeficiency virus)\nHPV\n(human papilloma virus)\nSyphilis\nSTIs are also called sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).\nThese infections are spread by direct contact with a sore on the genitals or mouth, body fluids, or sometimes the skin around the genital area.\nBefore having sex:\nGet to know your partner and discuss your sexual histories.\nDon't feel forced into having sex.\nDon't have sexual contact with anyone but your partner.\nYour sexual partner should be someone who you know does not have any STI."}

Before having sex with a new partner, each of you should get screened for STIs and share the test results with each other.\nIf you know you have an STI such as HIV or herpes, let any sexual partner know this before you have sex. Allow him or her to decide what to do. If you both agree to have sexual contact, use latex or polyurethane condoms.\nUse\ncondoms\nfor all vaginal, anal, and oral intercourse.\nThe condom should be in place from the beginning to the end of the sexual activity. Use it every time you have sex.\nKeep in mind that STIs can be spread by contact with skin areas around the genitals. A condom reduces but does not eliminate your risk of getting an STI.\nOther tips include:\nUse lubricants. They may help reduce the chance that a condom will break.\nUse only water-based lubricants."}

A condom reduces but does not eliminate your risk of getting an STI.\nOther tips include:\nUse lubricants. They may help reduce the chance that a condom will break.\nUse only water-based lubricants. Oil-based or petroleum-type lubricants can cause latex to weaken and tear.\nPolyurethane condoms are less likely to break than latex condoms, but they cost more.\nUsing condoms with nonoxynol-9 (a spermicide) may may irritate vaginal or penile tissue and thus increase the chance of HIV transmission.\nStay sober. Alcohol and drugs impair your judgment. When you are not sober, you might not choose your partner as carefully. You may also forget to use condoms, or use them incorrectly.\nGet tested regularly for STIs if you have new sexual partners. Many STIs have no symptoms, so you need to be tested often if there is any chance you have been exposed. You will have the best outcome and will be less likely to spread the infection if you are diagnosed early.\nConsider getting the\nHPV vaccine\nto keep from getting the human papillomavirus."}
