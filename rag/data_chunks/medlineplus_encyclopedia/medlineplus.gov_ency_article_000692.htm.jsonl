It  causes double vision and\neyelid drooping\n.\nCauses\nMononeuropathy\nmeans that only one nerve is damaged. This disorder affects the third cranial nerve in the skull. This is one of the cranial nerves that control eye movement and the pupil of the eye.\nThis type of damage may occur along with\ndiabetic peripheral neuropathy\n. Cranial mononeuropathy III is the most common cranial nerve disorder in people with diabetes."}

Cranial mononeuropathy III is the most common cranial nerve disorder in people with diabetes. It is due to damage to the small blood vessels that feed the nerve.\nCranial mononeuropathy III\ncan also occur in people who don't have diabetes.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nDouble vision\nDrooping of one eyelid (ptosis)\nPain around the eye and forehead\nChange in size of the pupil (\nanisocoria\n)\nNeuropathy often develops within 7 days of onset of pain.\nExams and Tests\nAn exam of the eyes will determine whether only the third nerve is affected or if other nerves have also been damaged. Signs may include:\nEyes that are not aligned\nPupil reaction that is often normal\nYour health care provider will do a complete exam to determine the possible effect on other parts of the nervous system."}
