Amino acids and proteins are the building blocks of life.\nWhen proteins are digested or broken down, amino acids are the result. The human body then uses amino acids to make proteins to help the body:\nBreak down food\nGrow\nRepair body tissue\nPerform many other body functions\nAmino acids can also be used as a source of energy by the body.\nAmino acids are classified into three groups:\nEssential amino acids\nNonessential amino acids\nConditionally essential amino acids\nESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS\nEssential amino acids cannot be made by the body. As a result, they must come from food.\nThe 9 essential amino acids are: histidine, isoleucine, leucine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine,\ntryptophan\n, and valine.\nNONESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS\nNonessential means that our bodies can produce the amino acid, even if we do not get it from the food we eat."}

Nonessential amino acids include: alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, proline, serine, and tyrosine.\nCONDITIONALLY ESSENTIAL AMINO ACIDS\nConditionally essential amino acids are usually not essential, except in times of illness and stress.\nConditionally essential amino acids include: arginine, cysteine, glutamine, tyrosine, glycine, proline, and serine.\nYou do not need to eat essential and nonessential amino acids at every meal, but getting a balance of them over the whole day is important. A diet based on a single plant item will not be adequate, but we no longer worry about pairing proteins (such as beans with rice) at a single meal. Instead we look at the adequacy of the diet overall throughout the day.\nImages\nAmino acids\nReferences\nDietzen DJ, Willrich MAV. Amino acids, peptides, and proteins.
