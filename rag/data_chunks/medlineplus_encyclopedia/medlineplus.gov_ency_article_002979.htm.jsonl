It may also be a complete split in the lip that goes all the way to the base of the nose.\nA cleft palate can be on one or both sides of the roof of the mouth. It may go the full length of the palate.\nYour child may have one or both of these conditions at birth.\nMost times, cleft lip repair is done when the child is 3 to 6 months old.\nFor cleft lip surgery, your child will have general anesthesia (asleep and not feeling pain). The surgeon will trim the tissues and sew the lip together. The stitches will be very small so that the scar is as small as possible. Most of the stitches will be absorbed into the tissue as the scar heals, so they will not have to be removed later.\nMost times, cleft palate repair is done when the child is older, between 9 months and 1 year old."}

This allows the palate to change as the baby grows. Doing the repair when the child is this age will help prevent further speech problems as the child develops.\nIn cleft palate repair, your child will have general anesthesia (asleep and not feeling pain). Tissue from the roof of the mouth may be moved over to cover the soft palate. Sometimes a child will need more than one surgery to close the palate.\nDuring these procedures, the surgeon may also need to repair the tip of your child's nose. This surgery is called\nrhinoplasty\n.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThis type of surgery is done to correct a physical defect caused by a cleft lip or cleft palate."}

Your child's nurse should show you\nhow to take care of the wound\n. You will need to clean it with soap and water or a special cleaning liquid, and keep it moist with ointment.\nUntil the wound heals, your child will be on a liquid diet. Your child will probably have to wear arm cuffs or splints to prevent picking at the wound. It is important for your child not to put hands or toys in their mouth.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost babies heal without problems. How your child will look after healing often depends on how serious the defect was. Your child might need another surgery to fix the scar from the surgery wound.\nA child who had a cleft palate repair may need to see a dentist or orthodontist. The teeth may need correcting as they come in.\nHearing problems are common in children with cleft lip or cleft palate."}
