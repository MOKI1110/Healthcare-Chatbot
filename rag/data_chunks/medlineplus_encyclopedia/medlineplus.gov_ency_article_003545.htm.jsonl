Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nQuantitative nephelometry test\nQuantitative nephelometry test\nQuantitative nephelometry is a lab test to quickly and accurately measure levels of certain proteins called immunoglobulins in the blood. Immunoglobulins are\nantibodies\nthat help fight infection.\nThis test specifically measures the immunoglobulins IgM, IgG, and IgA.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample is needed\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 hours before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test provides a rapid and accurate measurement of the amounts of the immunoglobulins IgM, IgG, and IgA.\nNormal Results\nNormal results for the three immunoglobulins are:\nIgG: 700 to 1500 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 7.0 to 15.0 grams per liter (g/L)\nIgM: 25 to 200 mg/dL, or 0.25 to 2.0 g/L\nIgA: 40 to 350 mg/dL, or 0.4 to 3.5 g/L\nThe examples above show the common measurements for these test results. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results."}

Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting\nor feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma\n(blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nQuantitative immunoglobulins\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nAbraham RS.
