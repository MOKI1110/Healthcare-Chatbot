Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFlu\nFlu\nThe flu (influenza) is a viral respiratory illness that causes fever, chills, runny nose, body aches, and cough. It spreads easily from person to person. The flu can cause moderate to severe symptoms. Most people recover fully. Children, older adults, and people with certain health conditions are at risk for severe illness and even death.\nCauses\nThe flu is caused by an influenza virus.\nMost people get the flu when they breathe in tiny airborne droplets from the coughs or sneezes of someone who has the flu. You can also catch the flu if you touch something with the virus on it, and then touch your mouth, nose, or eyes.\nPeople often confuse\ncolds\n, flu, and\nCOVID-19\n. They are different, but they do have some of the same symptoms. Most people get a cold several times a year. In contrast, people generally get the flu only once every few years. Cold symptoms tend to be more mild compared to the flu and COVID-19. The flu and COVID-19 share many symptoms, so it can be hard to tell them apart."}

Cold symptoms tend to be more mild compared to the flu and COVID-19. The flu and COVID-19 share many symptoms, so it can be hard to tell them apart. The best way to know is to get tested.\nCOVID-19 self-tests\nare available over-the-counter at most pharmacies. If needed, your health care provider can test you for the flu, COVID-19, and other respiratory infections.\nThe flu spreads easily. It can affect a large group of people in a very short amount of time. For example, students and co-workers often get sick within 2 or 3 weeks of the flu's arrival in a school or workplace.\nSometimes, you can get a virus that makes you throw up or have diarrhea. Some people call this the \"\nstomach flu\n.\" This is a misleading name because this virus is usually not the actual flu. The flu mostly affects your nose, throat, and lungs.\nWhile certain people are at a higher risk, anyone at any age can develop serious complications from the flu."}

You can start to feel sick about 1 to 7 days after you come in contact with the virus. Most of the time, symptoms appear within 2 to 3 days.\nThe first symptom is often a\nfever\nbetween 100 °F (37.8 °C) and 104 °F (40 °C) that comes on suddenly. An adult often has a lower fever than a child. But not everyone with the flu has a fever.\nOther common symptoms include:\nBody aches\nChills\nHeadache\nLack of energy\nCough\nRunny or stuffy nose\nSneezing\nSore throat\nNausea, vomiting\nand diarrhea (more common in children)\nFever usually goes away in 3 to 4 days but may last up to 8 days.

Sometimes, the fever comes back.\nSome people may not feel like eating.\nThe flu can make asthma, breathing problems, and other long-term (chronic) illnesses and conditions worse.\nExams and Tests\nMost people do not need to see a provider when they have flu symptoms. This is because most people are not at risk for a severe case of the flu.\nIf you are very sick with the flu, or you are at high risk for severe illness, you should contact your provider.\nThere is a test to detect the flu. It is done by swabbing the nose or throat. Most of the time, test results are available very fast. The test can help your\nprovider determine the best treatment\n.\nTreatment\nHOME CARE\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help lower fever and relieve aches. Providers sometimes suggest that you use both types of medicine. Aspirin can also reduce fever and aches, but it may have potential serious side effects, such as stomach bleeding."}
