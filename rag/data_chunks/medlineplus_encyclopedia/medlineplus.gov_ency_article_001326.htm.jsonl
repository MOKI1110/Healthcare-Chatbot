The fungus is often found growing on dead leaves, stored grain, compost piles, or in other decaying vegetation. It can also be found on marijuana leaves.\nAlthough most people are often exposed to aspergillus, infections caused by the fungus rarely occur in people who have a healthy immune system.\nThere are several forms of aspergillosis:\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is an allergic reaction to the fungus. This infection usually develops in people who already have lung problems such as asthma or cystic fibrosis.\nAspergilloma\nis a growth (fungus ball) that develops in an area of past lung disease or lung scarring such as\ntuberculosis\nor lung abscess.\nInvasive pulmonary aspergillosis is a serious infection with pneumonia. It can spread to other parts of the body. This infection occurs most often in people with a weakened immune system."}

It can spread to other parts of the body. This infection occurs most often in people with a weakened immune system. This can be from cancer, AIDS, leukemia, an organ transplant, chemotherapy, or other conditions or medicines that lower the number or function of white blood cells or weaken the immune system.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms depend on the type of infection.\nSymptoms of allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis may include:\nCough\nCoughing up blood or brownish mucus plugs\nFever\nGeneral ill feeling (malaise)\nWheezing\nWeight loss\nOther symptoms depend on the part of the body affected, and may include:\nBone pain\nChest pain\nChills\nDecreased urine output\nHeadaches\nIncreased phlegm production, which may be bloody\nShortness of breath\nSkin sores (lesions)\nVision problems\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about the symptoms.\nTests to diagnose aspergillus infection include:\nAspergillus antibody test\nChest x-ray\nComplete blood count\nCT scan\nGalactomannan (a sugar molecule shed from the fungus that is sometimes found in the blood)\nImmunoglobulin E (IgE) blood leve"}

In such a case, surgery and medicines are needed.\nInvasive aspergillosis is treated with several weeks of an antifungal medicine. It can be given by mouth or IV (into a vein).\nEndocarditis\ncaused by aspergillus is treated by surgically replacing the infected heart valves. Long-term antifungal medicines are also needed.\nAllergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis is treated with medicines that suppress the immune system (immunosuppressive medicines), such as prednisone, typically in conjunction with antifungals.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWith treatment, people with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis usually get better over time."}

It is common for the disease to come back (relapse) and need repeat treatment.\nIf invasive aspergillosis does not get better with treatment using medicine, it eventually leads to death. The outlook for invasive aspergillosis also depends on the person's underlying disease and immune system health.\nPossible Complications\nHealth problems from the disease or treatment include:\nAmphotericin B can cause kidney damage and unpleasant side effects such as fever and chills\nBronchiectasis\n(permanent scarring and enlargement of the small sacs in the lungs)\nInvasive lung disease can cause massive bleeding from the lung\nMucus plugs in the airways\nPermanent airway blockage\nRespiratory failure\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of aspergillosis or if you have a weakened immune system and develop a fever.\nPrevention\nPrecautions should be taken when using medicines that suppress the immune system.\nAlternative Names\nAspergillus infection\nImages\nAspergill"}
