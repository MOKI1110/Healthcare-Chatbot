After you receive these medicines, you will not be aware of what is happening around you.\nDescription\nMost times, a doctor called an anesthesiologist will give you the anesthesia. Sometimes, a certified registered nurse anesthetist will give you the anesthesia.\nAnesthesia often involves more than one medicine. Some medicines are given into your vein. You may be asked to breathe in (inhale) a special gas through a mask. Once you are asleep, the doctor may insert a tube into your windpipe (trachea) to help you breathe and protect your lungs.\nYou will be watched very closely while you are asleep."}

Once you are asleep, the doctor may insert a tube into your windpipe (trachea) to help you breathe and protect your lungs.\nYou will be watched very closely while you are asleep. Your blood pressure, pulse, and breathing will be monitored continuously.\nYou will not move, feel any pain, or have any memory of the procedure because of these medicines.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nGeneral anesthesia is a safe way to stay asleep and pain-free during procedures that would:\nBe too painful\nTake a long time\nAffect your ability to breathe\nMake you uncomfortable\nCause too much anxiety\nAs an alternative to general anesthesia, you may also be able to have\nmoderate or deep sedation\nor a regional anesthetic where part of your body is numb for your procedure. Sometimes, though, it is not enough to make you comfortable. Children may need general anesthesia for a medical or dental procedure to manage any pain or anxiety they may feel.\nRisks\nGeneral anesthesia is usually safe for healthy people."}
