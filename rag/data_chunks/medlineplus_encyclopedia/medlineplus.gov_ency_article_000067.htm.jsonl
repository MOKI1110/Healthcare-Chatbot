Areas in the upper airway that can be affected are the windpipe (trachea), voice box (larynx), or throat (pharynx).\nCauses\nThe airway can become narrowed or blocked due to many causes, including:\nAllergic reactions\nin which swelling of the trachea or throat in response to bee sting, peanuts, and tree nuts, or medicines such as antibiotics (such as penicillin), and ACE inhibitors (a medicine to treat high blood pressure)\nChemical burns\nand reactions\nEpiglottitis\n(infection of the structure separating the trachea from the esophagus)\nFire or burns from breathing in smoke\nForeign bodies, such as peanuts and other breathed-in foods, pieces of a balloon, buttons, coins, and small toys\nInfections of the upper airway area\nInjury to the upper airway area\nPeritonsillar abscess\n(collection of infected material near the tonsils)\nPoisoning from certain substances, such as strychnine\nRetropha"}
