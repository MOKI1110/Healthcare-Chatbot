Polysomnography is used to diagnose\nsleep disorders\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThere are two types of sleep:\nRapid eye movement (REM) sleep.  Most dreaming occurs during REM sleep. Under normal circumstances, your muscles, except for your eyes and breathing muscles, do not move during this stage of sleep.\nNon-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. NREM sleep is divided into three stages that can be detected by their specific brain wave patterns (EEG).\nREM sleep alternates with NREM sleep about every 90 minutes."}

NREM sleep is divided into three stages that can be detected by their specific brain wave patterns (EEG).\nREM sleep alternates with NREM sleep about every 90 minutes. A person with normal sleep most often has four to five cycles of REM and NREM sleep during a night.\nA sleep study measures your sleep cycles and stages by recording:\nAir flow in and out of your lungs as you breathe\nThe level of oxygen in your blood\nBody position\nBrain waves (EEG)\nBreathing effort and rate\nElectrical activity of muscles\nEye movement\nHeart rate\nPolysomnography can be done either at a sleep center or in your home.\nAT A SLEEP CENTER\nFull sleep studies are most often done at a special sleep center.\nYou will be asked to arrive about 2 hours before bedtime.\nYou will sleep in a bed at the center. Many sleep centers have comfortable bedrooms, similar to a hotel.\nThe test is most often done at night so that your normal sleep patterns can be studied. If you are a night shift worker, many centers can perform the test during your normal sleep hours.\nA sleep center technician will place electrodes on your chin, scalp, and the outer edge of your eyelids."}

You will have monitors to record your heart rate and breathing attached to your chest. These will remain in place while you sleep.\nThe electrodes record signals while you are awake (with your eyes closed) and during sleep. The test measures the amount of time it takes you to fall asleep and how long it takes you to enter REM sleep.\nA specially-trained technician will observe you while you sleep and note any changes in your breathing or heart rate.\nThe test will record the number of times that you either stop breathing or almost stop breathing.\nThere are also monitors to record your movements during sleep. Sometimes a video camera records your movements during sleep.\nAT HOME\nYou may be able to use a sleep study device in your home instead of at a sleep center to help diagnose sleep apnea. You either pick up the device at a sleep center or a trained therapist comes to your home to set it up."}

Many sleep centers may also have a mail-to-home option so that the device can be delivered to your doorstep.\nHome testing may be used when:\nYou are under the care of a sleep specialist.\nYour sleep specialist thinks you have obstructive sleep apnea.\nYou do not have other sleep disorders.\nYou do not have other serious health problems, such as heart disease or lung disease.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nWhether the test is at a sleep study center or at home, you prepare the same way. Unless directed to do so by your sleep specialist, do not take any sleep medicine and do not drink alcohol or caffeinated beverages before the test. They can interfere with your sleep.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test helps diagnose possible\nsleep disorders\n, including\nobstructive sleep apnea\n(OSA)."}
