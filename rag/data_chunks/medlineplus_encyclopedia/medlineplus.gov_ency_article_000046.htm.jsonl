Most drownings occur within a short distance of safety. Immediate action and first aid can prevent death.\nA person who is drowning usually can't shout for help. Be alert for signs of drowning.\nMost drownings in children younger than 1 year occur in the bathtub.\nIt may be possible to revive a drowning person, even after a long period under water, especially if the person is young and was in very cold water.\nSuspect an accident if you see someone in the water fully clothed. Watch for uneven swimming motions, which is a sign that the swimmer is getting tired."}

Toss it to the person, then pull them to shore.\nIf you are trained in rescuing people, do so right away only if you are sure it will not cause you harm.\nKeep in mind that people who have fallen through ice may not be able to grasp objects within their reach or hold on while being pulled to safety.\nIf the person's breathing has stopped, begin rescue breathing as soon as you can. This often means starting the rescue breathing process as soon as the rescuer can get to a flotation device such as a boat, raft, or surf board, or reaches water where it is shallow enough to stand.\nContinue to breathe for the person every few seconds while moving them to dry land. Once on land, give\nCPR\nas needed."}

Once on land, give\nCPR\nas needed. A person needs CPR if they are unconscious and you can't feel a pulse.\nAlways use caution when moving a person who is drowning. Neck injuries are uncommon in people who survive drowning unless they have been struck in the head or show other signs of injury, such as bleeding and cuts. However, neck and spine injuries may occur when a person dives into water that is too shallow. Because of this, the American Heart Association guidelines recommend against strictly immobilizing the spine unless there are obvious head injuries. Doing so can make it more difficult to perform rescue breathing on the victim. However, you should try to keep the person's head and neck stable and aligned with the body as much as possible during the rescue from the water and CPR. You can tape the head to a backboard or stretcher, or secure the neck by placing rolled towels or other objects around it.\nFollow these additional steps:\nGive first aid for any other serious injuries.\nKeep the person calm and still."}

Do not perform the Heimlich maneuver unless repeated attempts to position the airway and rescue breathing have failed, and you think the person's airway is blocked."}

Do not perform the Heimlich maneuver unless repeated attempts to position the airway and rescue breathing have failed, and you think the person's airway is blocked. Performing the Heimlich maneuver increases the chances that an unconscious person will vomit and then choke on the vomit.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if you can't rescue the drowning person without putting yourself in danger. If you are trained and able to rescue the person, do so, but always call for medical help as soon as possible.\nAll people who have experienced a non-fatal drowning should be checked by a health care provider. Even though the person may quickly seem OK at the scene, lung complications are common. Fluid and body chemical (electrolyte) imbalances may develop. Other traumatic injuries may be present, and irregular heart rhythms can occur.\nAll people who have experienced a non-fatal drowning and require any form of resuscitation, including rescue breathing alone, should be transported to the hospital for evaluation."}

This should be done even if the person appears alert with good breathing and a strong pulse.\nPrevention\nSome tips to help prevent non-fatal drowning are:\nDo not drink alcohol or use other drugs when swimming or boating. This includes certain prescription medicines.\nDo not leave any standing water in basins, buckets, ice chests, kiddie pools, or bathtubs, or in other areas where a young child can enter the water. Drowning can occur in any container of water.\nSecure toilet seat lids with a child safety device.\nBuild a fence around all pools and spas. Secure all the doors leading to the outside, and install pool and door alarms.\nCheck the pool right away, if your child is missing.\nNever allow children to swim alone or unsupervised regardless of their ability to swim.\nNever leave children alone for any period of time or let them leave your line of sight around any pool or body of water."}
