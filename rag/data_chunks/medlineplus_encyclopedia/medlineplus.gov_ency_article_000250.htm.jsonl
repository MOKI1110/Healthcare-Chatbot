It is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).\nCrohn disease\nis another form of IBD.\nCauses\nThe cause of ulcerative colitis is unknown. People with this condition have problems with their immune system. However, it is not clear if immune problems cause this illness. Stress and certain foods can trigger symptoms, but they do not cause ulcerative colitis.\nUlcerative colitis may affect any age group. The peaks in the age of onset occur at ages 15 to 30 and then again at ages 50 to 70.\nThe disease begins in the rectal area. It may stay in the rectum or spread to higher areas of the large intestine. However, the disease does not skip areas. It may involve the entire large intestine over time.\nRisk factors include a family history of ulcerative colitis or other autoimmune diseases, or Jewish ancestry.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms can be more or less severe. They may start slowly or suddenly."}

They may start slowly or suddenly. Half of people only have mild symptoms. Others have more severe attacks that occur more often. Many factors can lead to attacks.\nSymptoms may include:\nPain in the abdomen (belly area) and cramping.\nA gurgling or splashing sound heard over the intestine.\nBlood and possibly pus in the stools.\nDiarrhea, from only a few episodes to very often.\nFever.\nFeeling that you need to pass stools, even though your bowels are already empty (tenesmus). It may involve straining, pain, and cramping.\nWeight loss.\nChildren's growth may slow.\nOther symptoms that may occur with ulcerative colitis include the following:\nEye irritation\nJoint pain and swelling\nNausea and vomiting\nSkin lumps or ulcers\nExams and Tests\nColonoscopy with biopsy is most often used to diagnose ulcerative colitis."}

Some forms of the drug are taken by mouth. Others must be inserted into the rectum.\nMedicines to quiet the immune system.\nCorticosteroids such as prednisone. They may be taken by mouth during a flare-up or inserted into the rectum.\nImmunomodulators, medicines taken by mouth that affect the immune system, such as azathioprine and 6-MP.\nBiologic and small molecule medicines.\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) may help relieve mild pain.
