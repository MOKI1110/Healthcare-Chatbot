Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. The disorder results in large numbers of red blood cells being destroyed, which leads to anemia.\nCauses\nHemoglobin is made of two proteins:\nAlpha globin\nBeta globin\nThalassemia occurs when there is a variant in a gene that helps control production of one of these proteins.\nThere are two main types of thalassemia:\nAlpha thalassemia occurs when a gene or genes related to the alpha globin protein are missing or there is a variant.\nBeta thalassemia occurs when similar gene defects affect production of the beta globin protein.\nAlpha thalassemias occur most often in people from Southeast Asia, the Middle East, China, and in those of African descent.\nBeta thalassemias occur most often in people of Mediterranean origin."}

To a lesser extent, Chinese, other Asians, and African Americans can be affected.\nThere are many forms of thalassemia. Each type has many different subtypes. Both alpha and beta thalassemia include the following two forms:\nThalassemia major\nThalassemia minor\nYou must inherit the variant gene from both parents to develop thalassemia major.\nThalassemia minor occurs if you receive the variant gene from only one parent. People with this form of the disorder are carriers of the disease."}

Doing so can cause a high amount of iron to build up in the body, which can be harmful.\nPeople who receive a lot of blood transfusions need a treatment called chelation therapy. This is done to remove excess iron from the body.\nA bone marrow transplant may help treat the disease in some people, especially children.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSevere thalassemia can cause early death (between ages 20 and 30) due to heart failure."}

Getting regular blood transfusions and therapy to remove iron from the body helps improve the outcome.\nLess severe forms of thalassemia often do not shorten lifespan.\nYou may want to seek genetic counseling if you have a family history of the condition and are thinking of having children.\nPossible Complications\nUntreated, thalassemia major leads to heart failure and liver problems. It also makes a person more likely to develop infections.\nBlood transfusions can help control some symptoms, but carry a risk of side effects from too much iron.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nYou or your child has symptoms of thalassemia.\nYou are being treated for the disorder and new symptoms develop.\nAlternative Names\nMediterranean anemia; Cooley anemia; Beta thalassemia; Alpha thalassemia\nImages\nThalassemia major\nThalassemia minor\nReferences\nCappellini MD.
