The infection is also called hydatid disease.\nCauses\nHumans become infected when they swallow the tapeworm eggs in contaminated food. The eggs then form\ncysts\ninside the body. A cyst is a closed pocket or pouch. The cysts keep growing, which leads to symptoms.\nE granulosus\nis an infection caused by tapeworms found in dogs and livestock such as sheep, pigs, goats, and cattle. These tapeworms are around 2 to 7 mm long. The infection is called cystic echinococcosis (CE). It leads to growth of cysts mainly in the lungs and liver. Cysts can also be found in the heart, bones, and brain.\nE multilocularis\nis the infection caused by tapeworms found in dogs, cats, rodents, and foxes. These tapeworms are around 1 to 4 mm long. The infection is called alveolar echinococcosis (AE). It is a life-threatening condition because tumor-like growths form in the liver."}

Other organs, such as the lungs and brain can be affected.\nChildren or young adults are more prone to get the infection.\nEchinococcosis is common in:\nAfrica\nCentral Asia\nSouthern South America\nThe Mediterranean\nThe Middle East\nIn rare cases, the infection is seen in the United States. It has been reported in California, Arizona, New Mexico, and Utah.\nRisk factors include being exposed to:\nCattle\nDeer\nFeces of dogs, foxes, wolves, or coyotes\nPigs\nSheep\nCamels\nSymptoms\nCysts may produce no symptoms for 10 years or more.\nAs the disease advances and the cysts get larger, symptoms may include:\nPain in the upper right part of the abdomen (liver cyst)\nIncrease in size of the abdomen due to swelling (liver cyst)\nBloody sputum\n(lung cyst)\nChest pain\n(lung cyst)\nCough\n(lung cyst)\nSevere allergic reaction (\nanaphylaxis\n) when cysts break open\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a\nphysical exam\nand ask about the symptoms.\nIf the provider suspects CE or AE, tests that may be done"}

The contents of the cyst are removed (\naspirated\n) through the needle. Then medicine is sent through the needle to kill the tapeworm."}
