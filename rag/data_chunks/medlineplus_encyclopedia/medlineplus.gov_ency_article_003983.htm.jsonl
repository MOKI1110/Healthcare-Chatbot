Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nArtificial urinary sphincter\nArtificial urinary sphincter\nSphincters in the urinary system are muscles that allow your body to hold in urine. An inflatable artificial (man-made) sphincter is a medical device. This device keeps urine from leaking. It is used when your urinary sphincter no longer works well. When you need to urinate, the cuff of the artificial sphincter can be relaxed. This allows urine to flow out.\nOther procedures to treat urine leakage and incontinence include:\nTension-free vaginal tape\n(midurethral sling) and autologous sling (women)\nUrethral bulking with artificial material\n(men and women)\nRetropubic suspension\n(women)\nMale urethral sling (men)\nDescription\nThis procedure may be done while you are under:\nGeneral anesthesia\n. You will be asleep and unable to feel pain.\nSpinal anesthesia\n. You will be awake but will not be able to feel anything below your waist. You will be given medicines to help you relax.\nAn artificial sphincter has 3 parts:\nA cuff, which fits around your urethra."}

You will be awake but will not be able to feel anything below your waist. You will be given medicines to help you relax.\nAn artificial sphincter has 3 parts:\nA cuff, which fits around your urethra. The urethra is the tube that carries urine from your bladder to the outside of your body. When the cuff is inflated (full), the cuff closes off your urethra to stop urine flow or leakage.\nA balloon, which is placed under your belly muscles. It holds the same liquid as the cuff.\nA pump, which relaxes the cuff by moving fluid from the cuff to the balloon.\nA surgical cut will be made in one of these areas so that the cuff can be put in place:\nScrotum or perineum (men).\nLabia (women).\nLower belly (men and women). In some cases, this incision may not be necessary.\nThe pump can be placed in a man's scrotum. It can also be placed underneath the skin in a woman's lower belly or leg.\nOnce the artificial sphincter is in place, you will use the pump to empty (deflate) the cuff. Squeezing the pump moves fluid from the cuff to the balloon. When the cuff is empty, your urethra opens so that you can urinate."}

The cuff will re-inflate on its own in 90 seconds.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nArtificial urinary sphincter surgery is done to treat stress incontinence.\nStress incontinence\nis a leakage of urine, which occurs with activities such as walking, lifting, exercising, or even coughing or sneezing.\nThe procedure is recommended for men who have urine leakage with activity. This type of leakage can occur after prostate surgery. The artificial sphincter is advised when other treatments do not work.\nWomen who have urine leakage most often try other treatment options before having an artificial sphincter placed. It is rarely used to treat stress urinary incontinence in women in the United States.\nMost of the time, your doctor will recommend medicines and bladder retraining before surgery.\nRisks\nThis procedure is most often safe."}

This means you will still have urine leakage. Your body tissues need this time to heal.\nAbout 6 weeks after surgery, you will be taught how to use your pump to inflate your artificial sphincter.\nYou will need to carry a wallet card or wear medical identification. This tells health care providers you have an artificial sphincter. The sphincter must be turned off if you need to have a urinary catheter placed.\nWomen may need to change how they do some activities (such as bicycle riding), since the pump is placed in the labia.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nUrinary leakage decreases for many people who have this procedure. However, there may still be some leakage. Over time, some or all of the leakage may come back.\nThere may be a slow wearing away of the urethra tissue under the cuff. This tissue may become spongy."}
