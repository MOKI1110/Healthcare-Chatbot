Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCardiac intravascular ultrasound\nCardiac intravascular ultrasound\nIntravascular ultrasound (IVUS) is a diagnostic test. This test uses sound waves to see inside blood vessels. It is useful for evaluating the coronary arteries that supply the heart.\nDescription\nA tiny\nultrasound\nwand is attached to the top of a thin tube. This tube is called a catheter. The catheter is inserted into an artery in your groin area and moved up to the heart. It is different from conventional duplex ultrasound. Duplex ultrasound is done from the outside of your body by placing the ultrasound transducer on the skin.\nA computer measures how the sound waves reflect off blood vessels, and changes the sound waves into pictures. IVUS gives the health care provider a look at your coronary arteries from the inside-out.\nIVUS is almost always done during a procedure."}

IVUS gives the health care provider a look at your coronary arteries from the inside-out.\nIVUS is almost always done during a procedure. Reasons why it may be done include:\nGetting information about the heart or its blood vessels\nor to find out if you need heart surgery\nTreating some types of heart conditions\nAngiography gives a general look at the coronary arteries. However, it can't show the walls of the arteries. IVUS images show the artery walls and can reveal cholesterol and fat deposits (plaques). Buildup of these deposits can increase your risk for a heart attack.\nIVUS may help providers understand how\nstents\nbecome clogged. This is called stent restenosis.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nIVUS is commonly done to make sure a stent is correctly placed during angioplasty. It may also be done to determine where a stent should be placed.\nIVUS may also be used to:\nView the aorta and structure of the artery walls, which can show plaque buildup\nFind which blood vessel is involved in aortic dissection\nRisks\nThere is a slight risk for complications with angioplasty and cardiac catheterization."}
