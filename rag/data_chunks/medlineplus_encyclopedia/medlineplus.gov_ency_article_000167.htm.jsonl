This type of shock can cause many organs to stop working.\nCauses\nLosing more than 15 to 20 percent of the normal amount of blood in your body causes hypovolemic shock.\nBlood loss can be due to:\nBleeding from serious cuts\nBleeding from other injuries\nInternal bleeding, such as in the gastrointestinal tract\nThe amount of circulating blood in your body also may drop when you lose too much body fluid from other causes."}

In the meantime, follow these steps:\nKeep the person comfortable and warm (to avoid\nhypothermia\n).\nHave the person lie flat with the feet lifted about 12 inches (30 centimeters) to increase circulation. However, if the person has a head, neck, back, or leg injury, do not change the person's position unless they are in immediate danger.\nDo not give fluids by mouth.\nIf person is having an\nallergic reaction\n, treat the allergic reaction, if you know how.\nIf the person must be carried, try to keep them flat, with the head down and feet lifted. Stabilize the head and neck before moving a person with a suspected spinal injury.\nThe goal of hospital treatment is to replace blood and fluids."}

Call the local emergency number (such as 911) or take the person to the emergency room.\nPrevention\nPreventing shock is easier than trying to treat it once it happens. Quickly treating the cause will reduce the risk of developing severe shock. Early first aid can help control shock.\nAlternative Names\nShock - hypovolemic\nReferences\nAngus DC.
