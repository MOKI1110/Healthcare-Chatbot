In addition to the rash, shingles can cause fever, headache, chills, or upset stomach. Rarely, shingles can lead to complications such as pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or death.\nThe risk of shingles increases with age. The most common complication of shingles is long-term nerve pain called postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). PHN occurs in the areas where the shingles rash was and can last for months or years after the rash goes away."}

PHN occurs in the areas where the shingles rash was and can last for months or years after the rash goes away. The pain from PHN can be severe and debilitating.\nThe risk of PHN increases with age. An older adult with shingles is more likely to develop PHN and have longer lasting and more severe pain than a younger person.\nPeople with weakened immune systems also have a higher risk of getting shingles and complications from the disease.\nShingles is caused by varicella zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. After you have chickenpox, the virus stays in your body and can cause shingles later in life. Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another, but the virus that causes shingles can spread and cause chickenpox in someone who has never had chickenpox or has never received chickenpox vaccine.\nRecombinant shingles vaccine\nRecombinant shingles vaccine provides strong protection against shingles."}

By preventing shingles, recombinant shingles vaccine also protects against PHN and other complications.\nRecombinant shingles vaccine is recommended for:\nAdults 50 years and older\nAdults 19 years and older who have a weakened immune system because of disease or treatments\nShingles vaccine is given as a two-dose series. For most people, the second dose should be given 2 to 6 months after the first dose. Some people who have or will have a weakened immune system can get the second dose 1 to 2 months after the first dose. Ask your health care provider for guidance.\nPeople who have had shingles in the past and people who have received varicella (chickenpox) vaccine are recommended to get recombinant shingles vaccine. The vaccine is also recommended for people who have already gotten another type of shingles vaccine, the live shingles vaccine."}
