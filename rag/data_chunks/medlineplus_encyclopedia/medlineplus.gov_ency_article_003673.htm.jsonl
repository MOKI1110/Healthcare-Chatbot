It does this by testing how well they withstand swelling in a sugar (sucrose) solution.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no special preparation needed for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour health care provider may recommend this test if you have signs or symptoms of\nparoxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria\n(PNH) or\nhemolytic anemia\nof unknown cause. Hemolytic anemia is a condition in which red blood cells die before they should. PNH red blood cells are very likely to be harmed by the body's complement system. The complement system consists of proteins that move through the bloodstream."}

PNH red blood cells are very likely to be harmed by the body's complement system. The complement system consists of proteins that move through the bloodstream. These proteins work with the immune system.\nNormal Results\nA normal test result is called a negative result. A normal result shows that less than 5% of red blood cells break down when tested. This breakdown is called hemolysis.\nA negative test does not rule out PNH. False-negative results may occur if the fluid part of blood (serum) lacks complement.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA positive test result means the results are abnormal. In a positive test, more than 10% of red blood cells break down. It could indicate the person has PNH.\nCertain conditions can make the test results appear positive (called false positive). These conditions are autoimmune hemolytic anemias and leukemia.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken."}

Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting\nor feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma\n(blood buildup under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nSucrose hemolysis test; Hemolytic anemia sugar water hemolysis test; Paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria sugar water hemolysis test; PNH sugar water hemolysis test\nReferences\nAraten DJ, Brodsky RA.
