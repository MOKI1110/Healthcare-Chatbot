Your tongue may be swollen or pushed up to the top of your mouth.\nYou may need a\nCT scan\nof the head and neck.\nA sample of the fluid from the tissue may be sent to the lab to test for bacteria.\nTreatment\nIf the swelling blocks the airway, you need to get emergency medical help right away. A breathing tube may need to be placed through your mouth or nose and into the lungs to restore breathing. You may need to have surgery called a\ntracheostomy\nthat creates an opening through the neck into the windpipe.\nAntibiotics are given to fight the infection. They are most often given through a vein until symptoms go away. Antibiotics taken by mouth may be continued until tests show that the bacteria have gone away.\nDental treatment may be needed for tooth infections that cause Ludwig angina.\nSurgery may be needed to drain fluids that are causing the swelling.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nLudwig angina can be life threatening."}
