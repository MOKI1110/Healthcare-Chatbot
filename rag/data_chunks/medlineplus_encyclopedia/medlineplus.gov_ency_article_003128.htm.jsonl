In most cases, floating stools will go away without treatment.\nFloating stools alone are not a sign of an illness or other health problem.\nCauses\nMany things can cause floating stools. Most of the time, floating stools are due to what you eat. A change in your diet may cause an increase in gas. Increased gas in the stool allows it to float.\nFloating stools may also happen if you have a gastrointestinal infection.\nFloating, greasy stools that are foul smelling may be due to severe malabsorption, particularly if you are losing weight. Malabsorption means your body is not properly absorbing nutrients.\nMost floating stools are not caused by an increase in the fat content of the stool."}

Malabsorption means your body is not properly absorbing nutrients.\nMost floating stools are not caused by an increase in the fat content of the stool. However, in some conditions, such as long-term (chronic) pancreatitis, the fat content is increased.\nHome Care\nIf a change in diet has caused floating stools or other health problems, try to find which food is to blame. Avoiding this food may be helpful.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nTell your health care provider if you have changes in your stools or bowel movements. Contact your provider right away if you have bloody stools with weight loss, dizziness, and fever.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nYour provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions about your medical history and symptoms, such as:\nWhen did you first notice the floating stools?\nDoes it happen all the time or from time to time?\nWhat is your usual diet?\nDoes a change in your diet change your stools?\nDo you have other symptoms?\nAre the stools foul smelling?\nAre the stools an abnormal color (such as\npale or clay-colored stools\n)?\nA stool sample may be needed. Blood tests may be done."}
