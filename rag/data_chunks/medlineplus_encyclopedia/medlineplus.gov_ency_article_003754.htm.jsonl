This is the area around the opening of the uterus. The samples are sent to a lab. There, they are placed in a special dish (culture). They are then watched to see if bacteria, virus, or fungus grow. Further tests may be done to identify the specific organism and determine the best treatment.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nIn the 2 days before the procedure:\nDo not use creams or other medicines in the vagina.\nDo not douche. (You should never douche. Douching can cause infection of the vagina or uterus.)\nAvoid intercourse.\nEmpty your bladder and bowel.\nAt your provider's office, follow instructions for preparing for the vaginal exam.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will feel some pressure from the speculum."}
