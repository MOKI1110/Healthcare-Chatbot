It is also sometimes simply called colon cancer.\nIn the United States, colorectal cancer is one of the leading causes of deaths due to cancer. Early diagnosis can often lead to a complete cure.\nCauses\nNearly all colorectal cancers begin as\nnoncancerous (benign) lumps (polyps)\nin the lining of the colon and rectum. These can slowly develop into cancer.\nYou have a higher risk for colorectal cancer if you:\nAre age 45 or older\nDrink alcohol\nSmoke tobacco\nAre overweight or have\nobesity\nAre African American or of eastern European descent\nEat a lot of red or processed meats\nEat a\nlow-fiber and high-fat diet\nHave a diet low in fruits and vegetables\nHave colorectal polyps\nHave inflammatory bowel disease (\nCrohn disease\nor\nulcerative colitis\n)\nHave a family history of colorectal cancer\nSome inherited diseases also increase the risk of developing colorectal cancer."}

One of the most common is called Lynch syndrome.\nSymptoms\nMany cases of colon cancer have no symptoms. If there are symptoms, the following may indicate colon cancer:\nAbdominal pain and tenderness\nin the lower abdomen\nBlood in the stool\nDiarrhea\n, constipation, or other change in bowel habits\nNarrow stools\nWeight loss\nwith no known reason\nExams and Tests\nThrough\nscreening tests, colon cancer\ncan be detected before symptoms develop. This is when the cancer is most curable. Abnormal stool screening tests should be followed up with a colonoscopy, which can see the entire colon.\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and press on your belly area. The physical exam rarely shows any problems, although your provider may feel a lump (mass) in the abdomen."}

A rectal exam may reveal a mass in people with rectal cancer, but not colon cancer.\nBlood tests may be done for those diagnosed with colorectal cancer, including:\nComplete blood count\n(CBC) to check for anemia\nLiver function tests\nIf you are diagnosed with colorectal cancer, more tests will be done to see if the cancer has spread. This is called\nstaging\n.\nCT\nor\nMRI\nscans of the abdomen, pelvic area, or chest may be used to stage the cancer."}

Sometimes,\nPET\nscans are also used.\nStages of colorectal cancer are:\nStage 0: Cancer is only on the innermost layer of the lining of the intestine\nStage I: Cancer is in the inner layers of the colon\nStage II: Cancer has spread through the muscle wall of the colon\nStage III: Cancer has spread to the lymph nodes near the colon\nStage IV: Cancer spread to other organs, such as the liver or lungs\nBlood tests to detect tumor markers, such as\ncarcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)\nmay help your provider monitor your progress during and after treatment.\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on many things, including the stage of the cancer. Treatments may include:\nEndoscopic surgery (less invasive surgery using a lighted, flexible tube)\nSurgery\nChemotherapy\nRadiation therapy\n- used in some people with rectal cancer\nImmunotherapy\nTargeted therapy\nSURGERY\nStage 0 colon cancer may be treated by removing the tumor using endoscopic surgery (colonoscopy)."}

For stages I, II, and III cancer, more extensive surgery is needed to remove all or part of the colon and rectum that is cancerous. This surgery is called\ncolon resection\n(colectomy).\nCHEMOTHERAPY\nChemotherapy involves taking medicines that kill cancer cells. You may receive just one type of medicine or a combination of medicines.\nMost people with stage III colon cancer receive chemotherapy after surgery for 3 to 6 months. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy. Even though the tumor was removed, chemotherapy is given to treat any cancer cells that may remain and to lower risk of recurrence of cancer.\nChemotherapy is also used to improve symptoms and prolong survival in people with stage IV colon cancer.\nIMMUNOTHERAPY\nImmunotherapy involves taking medicines that increase the ability of your own immune system to destroy cancer cells. Immunotherapy has different side effects than chemotherapy."}

Immunotherapy has different side effects than chemotherapy. It is effective in only a small subset of people with colorectal cancer.\nRADIATION\nRadiation therapy involves using radiation to kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy is often used in the treatment of rectal cancer.\nTARGETED THERAPY\nTargeted treatment zeroes in on specific targets (molecules) in cancer cells. These targets play a role in how cancer cells grow and survive. Using these targets, the medicine disables the cancer cells so they cannot spread. Targeted therapy may be given as pills or may be injected into a vein.\nYou may have targeted therapy along with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation treatment.\nCANCER IN THE LIVER\nFor people with stage IV disease that has\nspread to the liver\n, treatment can be directed at the cancer tumors in the liver."}

Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWith treatment, stages 0, I, II, and III cancers often are cured, although higher stages of cancer are less likely to be cured. In most cases, stage IV cancer is not curable, but there are exceptions, including sometimes when the spread of the cancer is limited to the liver. In order for a person to be cured, treatment must get rid of all of the cancer. But there is a chance that the cancer will come back."}
