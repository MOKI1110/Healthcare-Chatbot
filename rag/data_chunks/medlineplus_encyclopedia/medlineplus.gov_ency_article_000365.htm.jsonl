Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHypercalcemia\nHypercalcemia\nHypercalcemia means you have too much calcium in  your blood.\nCauses\nParathyroid hormone (PTH) and Vitamin D help manage calcium balance in the body.\nPTH is made by the parathyroid glands. These are four small glands located in the neck behind the thyroid gland.\nVitamin D\nis obtained when the skin is exposed to sunlight, and from food sources or supplements.\nThe most common cause of high calcium blood level is excess PTH released by the parathyroid glands. This excess occurs due to:\nAn enlargement of one or more of the parathyroid glands.\nA growth on one of the glands. Most of the time, these growths are benign (not a cancer).\nCalcium blood level may also be high if your body is low on fluids or water.\nOther conditions can also cause hypercalcemia:\nCertain kinds of cancers, such as lung and breast cancer, or cancer that has spread to your organs.\nToo much vitamin D in your blood (hypervitaminosis D).\nBeing immobile in bed for many days or weeks (mostly in children).\nToo much calcium in your diet. This is called milk-alkali syndrome."}

This is called milk-alkali syndrome. It most often occurs when a person is taking more than 2000 milligrams of calcium bicarbonate supplements a day along with high doses of Vitamin D.\nOveractive thyroid gland\n.\nChronic kidney disease or kidney failure\n.\nMedicines such as thiazide diuretics (water pills) and lithium.\nSome infections or health problems such as, Paget disease, tuberculosis and sarcoidosis.\nAn inherited condition that affects the body's ability to manage calcium.\nMen and women of all ages can have a high blood calcium level. However, it is most common in women over age 50 (after menopause). In most cases, this is due to an overactive parathyroid gland.\nSymptoms\nThe condition is most often diagnosed at an early stage using routine blood tests. Most people have no symptoms.\nSymptoms due to high calcium level may vary, depending on the cause and how long the problem  has been  present."}
