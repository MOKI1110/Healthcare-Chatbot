Typically, the test looks for 14 different HPV types. HPV type 16 and HPV type 18 are most closely associated with cervical cancer.\nHow the Test Is Performed\nThe HPV test may be done during a\nPap test\n. If they are done together, it is called \"co-testing.\"\nYou lie on a table and place your feet in footrests. Your health care provider inserts an instrument (called a speculum) into the vagina to open it slightly. This allows the provider to see the cervix. Cells are gently collected from the cervix area. The cervix is the lower part of the womb (uterus) that opens at the top of the vagina. The sample of cells is sent to a lab for examination.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is required for an HPV test."}

If you're getting a Pap test at the same time, it is recommended that you do NOT do the following in the 24 hours before the test:\nDouche (douching should never be done)\nHave intercourse\nUse tampons\nFor your comfort, you may want to empty your bladder just before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe exam may cause some discomfort. Some people say it feels like menstrual cramps.\nYou may also feel some pressure during the exam.\nYou may bleed a bit after the test.\nWhy the Test Is Performed\nHigh-risk types of HPV can lead to cervical cancer. The HPV test is done to determine if you are infected with one of these high-risk types.\nYour provider may order an HPV test:\nIf you have a certain type of abnormal Pap test result.\nAlong with a Pap smear to screen people age 30 and older for cervical cancer.\nInstead of a Pap smear to screen people age 30 and older for cervical cancer."}

(Note: Some experts suggest this approach for those age 25 and older.)\nThe HPV test results help your provider decide if further testing or treatment is needed.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means you do not have a high-risk type of HPV. You may be asked to return in 3 or 5 years for repeat testing.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result means you have one or more high-risk types of HPV.\nIf HPV types 16 or 18 are detected, your provider will likely recommend\ncolposcopy\n. This is a procedure in which the cervix is magnified with a binocular-like instrument. Small biopsies (tissue samples) are often taken during this procedure to look for evidence of a precancerous change or cancer.\nIf the test is positive for one or more of the other high-risk HPV types, repeat testing in one year may be recommended."}
