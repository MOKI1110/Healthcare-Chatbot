Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nParoxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH)\nParoxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH)\nParoxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH) is a rare blood disorder in which the body's immune system produces\nantibodies\nthat destroy red blood cells. It occurs when the person is exposed to cold temperatures.\nCauses\nPCH only occurs in the cold, and affects mainly the hands and feet. Antibodies attach (bind) to red blood cells. This allows other proteins in the blood (called complement) to also latch on. The antibodies destroy the red blood cells as they move through the body. As the cells are destroyed, hemoglobin, the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen, is released into the blood and passed in the urine.\nPCH has been linked to secondary syphilis, tertiary syphilis, and other viral or bacterial infections."}
