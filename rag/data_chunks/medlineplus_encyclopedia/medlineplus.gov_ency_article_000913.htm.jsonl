There are two main types of breast cancer:\nDuctal carcinoma starts in the tubes (ducts) that carry milk from the breast to the nipple. Most breast cancers are of this type.\nLobular carcinoma starts in the parts of the breast, called lobules, which produce milk.\nIn rare cases, other kinds of breast cancer can start in other areas of the breast.\nCauses\nBreast cancer risk factors\nare things that increase the chance that you could develop breast cancer:\nSome risk factors you can control, such as drinking alcohol. Others, such as age and family history, you cannot control.\nThe more risk factors you have, the more your risk increases. But, it does not mean you will develop cancer."}

Others, such as age and family history, you cannot control.\nThe more risk factors you have, the more your risk increases. But, it does not mean you will develop cancer. Most women who develop breast cancer do not have known risk factors or a family history.\nUnderstanding your risk factors can help you take steps to lower your risk.\nSome women are at higher risk for breast cancer because of certain genetic changes or variants that may be passed down from their parents.\nGenes known as BRCA1 or BRCA2 are responsible for most cases of inherited breast cancers.\nA screening tool with questions about your and your family's medical history can help your health care provider determine whether you are at risk for carrying these genes.\nIf you may be at high risk due to a known variant gene such as\nBRCA1 or BRCA2, a blood test\ncan show if you carry the genes.\nCertain other genes may lead to an increased risk of breast cancer.\nBreast implants, using antiperspirants, and wearing underwire bras do not increase the risk for breast cancer."}

There is also no evidence of a direct link between breast cancer and pesticides.\nSymptoms\nEarly breast cancer often does not cause symptoms. This is why regular breast cancer screening is important, so cancers that don't have symptoms may be found earlier.\nAs the cancer grows, symptoms may include:\nBreast lump\nor lump in the armpit that is hard, has uneven edges, and usually does not hurt.\nChange in the size, shape, or feel of the breast or nipple. For example, you may have redness, dimpling, or puckering that looks like the skin of an orange.\nFluid from the nipple. Fluid may be bloody, clear to yellow, green, or look like pus.\nIn men, breast cancer symptoms\ninclude breast lump, breast pain, and breast tenderness.\nSymptoms of advanced breast cancer may include:\nBone pain\nShortness of breath\nSwelling of the\nlymph nodes in the armpit\n(next to the breast with cancer)\nWeight loss\nExams and Tests\nYour provider will ask about your symptoms and risk factors."}

It also gives you an idea of what to expect in the future.\nBreast cancer stages\nrange from 0 to IV. The higher the stage, the more advanced the cancer.\nTreatment\nTreatment is based on many factors, including:\nThe type of breast cancer\nThe stage of the cancer (staging is a tool your providers use to find out how advanced the cancer is)\nWhether the cancer is sensitive to certain hormones, mainly estrogen and progesterone\nWhether the cancer overproduces (overexpresses) the HER2/neu protein\nTests on the tumor's genes to see if you would benefit from chemotherapy\nCancer treatments may include:\nHormone therapy\n.\nChemotherapy\n, which uses medicines to kill cancer cells.\nRadiation therapy\n, which is used to destroy cancerous tissue.\nSurgery to remove cancerous tissue: A\nlumpectomy\nremoves the breast lump.

It blocks certain hormones that fuel cancer growth. Other targeted therapy medicines are not related to hormones.\nCancer treatment can be local or systemic:\nLocal treatments involve only the area of disease. Radiation and surgery are forms of local treatment. They are most effective when the cancer has not spread outside the breast.\nSystemic treatments affect the entire body. Chemotherapy and hormonal therapy are types of systemic treatment.\nMost women receive a combination of treatments. For women with stage I, II, or III breast cancer, the main goal is to treat the cancer and prevent it from returning (recurring). For women with stage IV cancer, the goal is to improve symptoms and help them live longer."}
