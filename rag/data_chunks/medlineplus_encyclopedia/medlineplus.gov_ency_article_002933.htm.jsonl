The thyroid gland is a butterfly-shaped gland located inside the front of the lower neck.\nThe thyroid gland is part of the hormone (\nendocrine\n) system. It helps your body regulate your\nmetabolism\n.\nDescription\nDepending on the reason you are having your thyroid gland removed, the type of thyroidectomy you have will be either a:\nTotal thyroidectomy, which removes the entire gland\nSubtotal or partial thyroidectomy, which removes part of the thyroid gland\nYou will have\ngeneral anesthesia\n(asleep and pain-free) for this surgery. In rare cases, the surgery is done with local anesthesia and medicine to relax you."}

In rare cases, the surgery is done with local anesthesia and medicine to relax you. You will be awake, but pain-free.\nDuring the surgery:\nThe surgeon makes a horizontal cut in the front of your lower neck just above the collar bones.\nAll or part of the gland is removed through the cut.\nThe surgeon is careful not to damage the blood vessels and nerves in your neck.\nA small tube (catheter) may be placed into the area to help drain blood and other fluids that build up. The drain will be removed in 1 or 2 days.\nThe cuts are closed with sutures (stitches).\nSurgery to remove your whole thyroid may take 2 to 3 hours."}

This can cause a temporary low level of calcium in your blood (\nhypocalcemia\n).\nToo much thyroid hormone (\nthyroid storm\n). If you have an overactive thyroid gland, you will be treated with medicine.\nBefore the Procedure\nTell your surgeon or nurse if:\nYou are or could be pregnant\nYou are taking any medicines, including drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\nDuring the weeks before your surgery:\nYou may need to have tests that show exactly where the abnormal thyroid growth is located. This will help your surgeon find the growth during surgery. You may have a\nCT scan\n,\nultrasound\n, or other imaging tests.\nYour provider may also do a\nfine needle aspiration\nto find out if the growth is noncancerous or cancerous."}

These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\nFill any prescriptions for pain medicine and calcium you will need after surgery.\nIf you smoke,\ntry to stop\n."}
