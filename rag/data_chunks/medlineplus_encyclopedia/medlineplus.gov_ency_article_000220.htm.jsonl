Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBile duct stricture\nBile duct stricture\nA bile duct stricture is an abnormal narrowing, most often of the common bile duct. This is a tube that moves\nbile\nfrom the liver to the small intestine. Bile is a substance that helps with digestion.\nCauses\nA bile duct stricture is often caused by injury to the bile ducts during surgery. For example, it may occur after surgery to remove the gallbladder.\nOther causes of this condition include:\nCancer of the bile duct, liver or pancreas\nDamage and scarring due to a\ngallstone in the bile duct\nDamage or scarring after gallbladder removal\nPancreatitis\nPrimary sclerosing cholangitis\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nAbdominal pain\non the upper right side of belly\nChills\nFever\nItching\nGeneral feeling of discomfort\nLoss of appetite\nJaundice\nNausea and vomiting\nPale or clay-colored stools\nExams and Tests\nThe following tests can help diagnose this condition:\nEndoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)\nPercutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram\n(PTC)\nMagnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP)\nEndoscopic ultrasound (EU"}

This will allow bile to flow from the liver into the intestine.\nThis may involve:\nSurgery\nEndoscopic or percutaneous dilation of the stricture or insertion of stents through the stricture\nIf surgery is done, the stricture is removed. The common bile duct will be rejoined with the small intestine.\nIn some cases, a tiny metal or plastic mesh tube (\nstent\n) is placed across the bile duct stricture to keep it open.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nTreatment is successful most of the time."}

Long-term success depends on the cause of the stricture.\nPossible Complications\nInflammation and narrowing of the biliary duct may return in some people. There is a risk for infection above the narrowed area. Strictures that remain for a long period can lead to liver damage (\ncirrhosis\n).\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if symptoms recur after pancreatitis,\ncholecystectomy\n, or other biliary surgery.\nAlternative Names\nBile duct stricture; Biliary stricture\nImages\nBile pathway\nReferences\nDudeja V, Ferrantella A, Fong Y.
