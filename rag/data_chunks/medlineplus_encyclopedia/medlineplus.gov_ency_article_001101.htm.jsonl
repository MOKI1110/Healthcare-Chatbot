The heart can beat too fast (tachycardia), too slow (bradycardia), or irregularly.\nAn arrhythmia can be harmless, a sign of other heart problems, or an immediate danger to your health.\nCauses\nNormally, your heart works as a pump that brings blood to the lungs and the rest of the body.\nTo help this happen, your heart has an electrical system that makes sure it contracts (squeezes) in an orderly way.\nThe electrical impulse that signals your heart to contract begins in an area of the heart called the sinoatrial node (also called the sinus node or SA node)."}

This is your heart's natural pacemaker.\nThe signal leaves the SA node and travels through the heart along a set electrical pathway.\nDifferent nerve messages signal your heart to beat slower or faster.\nArrhythmias are caused by problems with the heart's electrical conduction system.\nAbnormal extra signals may occur.\nElectrical signals may be blocked or slowed.\nElectrical signals travel in new or different pathways through the heart.\nSome common causes of abnormal heartbeats are:\nAbnormal levels of potassium, magnesium, or other substances in the body\nHeart attack, or a damaged heart muscle from a past heart attack\nHeart disease that is present at birth (congenital)\nHeart failure or an enlarged heart\nOveractive thyroid gland\nWatch this video about:\nArrhythmias\nArrhythmias may also be caused by some substances or drugs, including:\nAlcohol or stimulant drugs\nCertain medicines\nCigarette smoking (nicotine)\nSome of the more common abnormal heart rhythms are:\nAtrial fibrillation or flutter\nAtr"}
