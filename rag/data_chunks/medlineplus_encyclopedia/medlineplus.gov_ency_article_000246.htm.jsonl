It can occur after a bacterial infection or a parasitic infection (giardiasis) of the intestines. This is called postinfectious IBS. There may also be other triggers, including stress.\nThe intestine is connected to the brain by hormone and nerve signals that go back and forth between the bowel and the brain. These signals affect bowel function and symptoms. The nerves can become more active during stress. This can cause the intestines to be more sensitive and contract more.\nIBS can occur at any age. Often, it begins in the teen years or early adulthood. It is twice as common in women as in men.\nIt is less likely to begin in people above 50 years of age.\nAbout  10% to 15% of people in the United States have symptoms of IBS."}

It is twice as common in women as in men.\nIt is less likely to begin in people above 50 years of age.\nAbout  10% to 15% of people in the United States have symptoms of IBS. It is the most common intestinal problem that causes people to be referred to a bowel specialist (gastroenterologist).\nSymptoms\nIBS symptoms vary from person to person, and range from mild to severe. Most people have mild symptoms. You are said to have IBS when symptoms are present for at least 3 days a month for a period of 3 months or more.\nThe main symptoms include:\nAbdominal pain and cramps\nGas\nFullness\nBloating\nChange in bowel habits. You can  have either diarrhea (IBS-D), or constipation (IBS-C).\nPain and other symptoms will often be reduced or go away after a bowel movement. Symptoms may flare up when there is a change in the frequency of your bowel movements.\nPeople with IBS may go back and forth between having constipation and diarrhea or have or mostly have one or the other.\nIf you have IBS with diarrhea, you will have frequent, loose, watery stools."}

You may have an urgent need to have a bowel movement, which may be hard to control.\nIf you have IBS with constipation, you will have a hard time passing stool, as well as fewer bowel movements. You may need to strain with a bowel movement and have cramps. Often, only a small amount or no stool at all will pass.\nThe symptoms may get worse for a few weeks or a month, and then decrease for a while. In other cases, symptoms are present most of the time.\nYou may also lose your appetite if you have IBS. However, blood in stools and unintentional weight loss are not a part of IBS.\nExams and Tests\nThere is no test to diagnose IBS. Most of the time, your health care provider can diagnose IBS based on your symptoms."}
