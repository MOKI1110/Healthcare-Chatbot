It can also be caused by fungi or other germs. In children, the\nlong bones\nof the arms or legs are most often involved.\nWhen a child has osteomyelitis:\nBacteria or other germs may spread to the bone from infected skin, muscles, or tendons next to the bone. This may occur under a skin sore.\nThe infection can start in another part of the body and spread through the blood to the bone.\nThe infection can be caused by an injury that breaks the skin and bone (open\nfracture\n). Bacteria can enter the skin and infect the bone.\nThe infection can also start after bone surgery."}

Bacteria can enter the skin and infect the bone.\nThe infection can also start after bone surgery. This is more likely if the surgery is done after an injury, or if metal rods or plates are placed in the bone.\nOther risk factors include:\nPremature birth or delivery complications in newborns\nDiabetes\nPoor blood supply\nRecent injury\nSickle cell disease\nInfection due to a foreign body\nPressure ulcers\nHuman bites\nor\nanimal bites\nWeakened immune system\nSymptoms\nOsteomyelitis symptoms include:\nBone pain\nExcessive sweating\nFever and chills\nGeneral discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (\nmalaise\n)\nLocal\nswelling\n, redness, and warmth\nPain at the infection site\nSwelling of the ankles, feet, and legs\nRefusing to walk (when leg bones are involved)\nInfants with osteomyelitis may not have a fever or other signs of illness."}

They might avoid moving the infected limb due to pain.\nExams and Tests\nYour child's health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms your child is having.\nTests that your child's provider may order include:\nBlood cultures\nBone biopsy\n(the sample is cultured and examined under a microscope)\nBone scan\nBone x-ray\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nC-reactive protein (CRP)\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)\nMRI\nof the bone\nNeedle aspiration\nof the area of the affected bones\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to stop the infection and reduce damage to the bone and surrounding tissues.\nAntibiotics are given to destroy the bacteria causing the infection:\nYour child may receive more than one antibiotic at a time.\nAntibiotics are taken for at least 4 to 6 weeks, often\nat home through an IV\n(intravenously, meaning through a vein)."}

At some point, your child's provider may switch the medicine to antibiotic pills.\nSurgery may be needed to remove dead bone tissue if the child has an infection that does not go away.\nIf there are metal plates near the infection, they may need to be removed.\nThe open space left by the removed bone tissue may be filled with\nbone graft\nor packing material. This promotes the growth of new bone tissue.\nIf your child was treated in the hospital for osteomyelitis, be sure to follow your provider's instructions on how to care for your child at home.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWith treatment, the outcome for acute osteomyelitis is usually good.\nThe outlook is worse for those with long-term (\nchronic\n) osteomyelitis."}
