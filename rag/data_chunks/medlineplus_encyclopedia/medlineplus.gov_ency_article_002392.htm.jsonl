During the first year of life, it is common for babies to take 1 to 4 naps a day, each lasting 30 minutes to 2 hours.\nWhen putting an infant to bed, make the bedtime routine consistent and pleasant.\nGive the last nighttime feeding shortly before putting the baby to bed. Never put your baby to bed with a bottle, as it can cause\nbaby bottle tooth decay\n.\nSpend quiet time with your child by rocking, walking, or simple cuddling.\nPut your child in bed before they are deeply asleep. This will teach your child to go to sleep on their own.\nYour baby may cry when you lay them in their bed, because they fear being away from you. This is called\nseparation anxiety\n. Simply go in, speak in a calm voice, and rub your baby's back or head. Don't take your baby out of the bed. Once they have calmed down, leave the room. Your child will soon learn that you are simply in another room.\nIf your baby awakens in the night for feeding, don't turn on the lights.\nKeep the room dark and quiet."}

If you maintain this routine, your baby will become used to it and go to sleep on their own.\nBy age 9 months, if not sooner, most infants are able to sleep for at least 8 to 10 hours without needing a nighttime feeding. Infants will still wake up during the night. However, over time, your infant will learn to self-soothe and fall back asleep.\nSleeping with a baby younger than 12 months of age may increase the risk for SIDS.\nYOUR TODDLER (1 TO 3 YEARS) AND SLEEP:\nA toddler will most often sleep for 11 to 14 hours a day.

Give your child a warning when it is almost time for lights-out and sleep.\nA stuffed animal or special blanket may give your child some security after the lights are turned out.\nBefore you turn out the light, ask if your child needs anything else.
