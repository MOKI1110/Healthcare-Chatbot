Most skin cancers are basal cell cancer.\nOther common types of skin cancer are:\nSquamous cell cancer\nMelanoma\nCauses\nThe top layer of the skin is called the epidermis. The bottom layer of the epidermis is the basal cell layer. With basal cancer, cells in this layer are the ones that become cancerous. Most basal cell cancers occur on skin that is regularly exposed to sunlight or other ultraviolet radiation.\nThis type of skin cancer is most common in people over age 50. But it can also occur in younger people who have had extensive sun exposure. Basal cell cancer is almost always slow-growing."}

This is called a\nskin biopsy\n. The sample is sent to a lab for examination under a microscope.\nA skin biopsy must be done to confirm basal cell cancer or other skin cancers."}

The diagnosis cannot be based only on the appearance of your skin.\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the size, depth, and location of the skin cancer and your overall health. Each treatment has its risks and benefits. You and your provider can discuss the treatment that's right for you.\nTreatment may involve any of the following:\nExcision: Cutting out the skin cancer and stitching the skin together\nCurettage and electrodessication: Scraping away cancer cells and using electricity to kill any that remain; used to treat cancers that are not large or deep; often curettage is used alone without electrodessication\nCryosurgery\n: Freezing the cancer cells, which kills them; used to treat cancers that are not large or deep\nMedicine: Skin creams that have medicine; used to treat cancers that are not large or deep\nMohs surgery\n: Removing a layer of skin and looking at it immediately under a microscope, then removing additional layers of skin until there are no signs of the cancer; usually used for"}

But all agree it's important to know your own skin and to contact your provider if you notice anything unusual.\nThe best way to prevent skin cancer is to\nreduce your exposure to sunlight\n. Always use sunscreen:\nApply sunscreen with sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 30, even when you are going outdoors for a short time.\nApply a large amount of sunscreen on all exposed areas, including ears and feet.\nLook for sunscreen that blocks both UVA and UVB light.\nUse a water-resistant sunscreen.\nApply sunscreen at least 30 minutes before going out."}

Follow package instructions about how often to reapply. Be sure to reapply after swimming or sweating.\nUse sunscreen in winter and on cloudy days too.\nOther measures to help you avoid too much sun exposure:\nUltraviolet light is most intense between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. Try to avoid the sun during these hours.\nProtect your skin by wearing wide-brim hats, long-sleeve shirts, long skirts, or pants. You can also buy sun-protective clothing.\nAvoid surfaces that reflect light more, such as water, sand, concrete, and areas that are painted white.\nThe higher the altitude, the faster your skin burns.\nDo not use sun lamps and tanning beds (salons)."}
