It involves inflammation of the tissues covering the brain and spinal cord caused by this bacterial infection.  These tissues are called the meninges.\nCauses\nSyphilitic meningitis is a form of\nneurosyphilis\n. This condition is a life-threatening complication of syphilis infection. Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection.\nSyphilitic meningitis is similar to meningitis caused by other germs (organisms), but it doesn't develop as quickly.\nRisks for syphilitic meningitis include a past infection with syphilis or other sexually transmitted illnesses such as\ngonorrhea\n. Syphilis infections are mainly spread through sex with an infected person."}

Treating the infection helps prevent new nerve damage and may reduce symptoms. Treatment does not reverse existing damage.\nMedicines likely to be given include:\nPenicillin or other antibiotics (such as tetracycline or erythromycin) for a long time to make sure the infection goes away."}
