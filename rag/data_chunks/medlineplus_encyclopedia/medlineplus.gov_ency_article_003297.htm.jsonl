Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSpasticity\nSpasticity\nSpasticity is stiff or rigid muscles. It may also be called unusual tightness or increased muscle tone. Reflexes (for example, a knee-jerk reflex) are stronger or exaggerated. The condition can interfere with walking, movement, speech, and many other activities of daily living.\nConsiderations\nSpasticity is often caused by damage to the part of the brain that is involved in movements under your control. It may also occur from damage to the nerves in the spinal cord.\nSymptoms of spasticity include:\nAbnormal posture\nLimited, slow movements\nCarrying the shoulder, arm, wrist, and finger at an abnormal angle because of muscle tightness\nExaggerated deep tendon reflexes (the knee-jerk or other reflexes)\nRepetitive jerky motions (clonus), especially when you are touched or moved\nScissoring (crossing of the legs as the tips of scissors would close)\nPain or deformity of the affected area of the body\nSpasticity may also affect speech. Severe, long-term spasticity may lead to\ncontracture\nof muscles."}

This can reduce range of motion or leave the joints bent.\nCauses\nSpasticity may be caused by any of the following:\nBrain damage caused by lack of oxygen, as can occur in\nnear drowning\nor near suffocation\nCerebral palsy\n(a group of disorders due to brain injury at birth)\nCervical spinal stenosis\nHead injury\nInfections of brain or spinal cord (Lyme disease, syphilis, HIV, tuberculosis)\nMultiple sclerosis\nNeurodegenerative illness (illnesses that damage the brain and nervous system over time)\nPhenylketonuria\n(a disorder in which the body can't break down the amino acid phenylalanine)\nSpinal cord injury\nStroke\nTumors in brain or spinal cord\nToxins (for example, nitrous oxide or laughing gas)\nVitamin or mineral deficiency (vitamin B12, vitamin E, copper)\nThis list does not include all conditions that can cause spasticity.\nHome Care\nExercise, including muscle stretching, can help make symptoms less severe."}

Physical therapy is also helpful.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if:\nThe spasticity gets worse\nYou notice deformity of the affected areas\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nYour provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms, including:\nWhen was it first noticed?\nHow long has it lasted?\nIs it always present?\nHow severe is it?\nWhich muscles are affected?\nWhat makes it better?\nWhat makes it worse?\nWhat other symptoms are present?\nAfter determining the cause of your spasticity, your provider may refer you to a physical therapist. Physical therapy involves different exercises, including muscle stretching and strengthening exercises. Physical therapy exercises can be taught to parents who can then help their child do them at home.\nOther treatments may include:\nMedicines to treat spasticity."}
