For this test:\nDo not eat or drink anything (other than sips of water) for 8 to 14 hours before your test."}

For this test:\nDo not eat or drink anything (other than sips of water) for 8 to 14 hours before your test. (You also cannot eat during the test.)\nYou will be asked to drink a liquid that contains 100 grams (g) of glucose.\nYou will have blood drawn before you drink the liquid, and again 3 more times every 60 minutes after you drink it. Each time, your blood glucose level will be checked.\nAllow at least 3 hours for this test.\nONE-STEP TESTING\nFor this test:\nDo not eat or drink anything (other than sips of water) for 8 to 14 hours before your test. (You also cannot eat during the test.)\nYou will be asked to drink a liquid that contains 75 grams of glucose.\nYou will have blood drawn before you drink the liquid, and again 2 more times every 60 minutes after you drink it. Each time, your blood glucose level will be checked.\nAllow at least 2 hours for this test.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nFor either the two-step test or one-step test, eat your normal food in the days before your test."}

Ask your health care provider if any of the medicines you take can affect your test results.\nHow the Test will Feel\nMost women do not have side effects from the glucose tolerance test. Drinking the glucose solution is similar to drinking a very sweet soda. Some women may feel nauseated, sweaty, or lightheaded after they drink the glucose solution. Serious side effects from this test are very uncommon.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test checks for\ngestational diabetes\n. Most pregnant women have a glucose screening test between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. The test may be done earlier if you have a high glucose level in your urine during your routine prenatal visits, or if you have a high risk for diabetes.\nWomen who have a low risk for diabetes may not need to have the screening test."}

To be low-risk, all of these statements must be true:\nYou have never had a test that showed your blood glucose was higher than normal.\nYour ethnic group has a low risk for diabetes.\nYou do not have any first-degree relatives (parent, sibling, or child) with diabetes.\nYou are younger than 25 years old and have a normal weight.\nYou have not had any bad outcomes during an earlier pregnancy.\nNormal Results\nTWO-STEP TESTING\nMost of the time, a normal result for the glucose screening test is a blood sugar that is equal to or less than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) 1 hour after drinking the glucose solution. A normal result means you do not have gestational diabetes.\nNote: mg/dL means milligrams per deciliter and mmol/L means millimoles per liter. These are two ways to indicate how much glucose is in the blood.\nIf your blood glucose is higher than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L), the next step is the oral glucose tolerance test. This test will show if you have gestational diabetes."}
