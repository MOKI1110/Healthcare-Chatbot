As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called\nacidosis\n).\nCauses\nWhen the body performs its normal functions, it produces acid. If this acid is not removed or neutralized, the blood will become too acidic. This can lead to\nelectrolyte\nimbalances in the blood. It can also cause problems with normal function of some cells.\nThe kidneys help control the body's acid level by removing acid from the blood and excreting it into the urine. Acidic substances in the body are neutralized by alkaline substances, mainly bicarbonate.\nProximal renal tubular acidosis (type II RTA) occurs when bicarbonate is not properly reabsorbed by the kidney's filtering system.\nType II RTA is less common than type I RTA. Type I is also called\ndistal renal tubular acidosis\n."}
