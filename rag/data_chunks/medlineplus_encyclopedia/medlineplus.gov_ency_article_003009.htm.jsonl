Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBone marrow transplant\nBone marrow transplant\nA bone marrow transplant is a procedure to replace damaged or diseased bone marrow with healthy bone marrow stem cells.\nBone marrow is the soft, fatty tissue inside your breastbone (sternum) and pelvic bones. Your bone marrow produces blood cells. Stem cells in your bone marrow give rise to all of your different blood cells.\nDescription\nBefore the transplant,\nchemotherapy\n,\nradiation\n, or both may be given. This may be done in two ways:\nAblative (myeloablative) treatment\n-- High-dose chemotherapy, radiation, or both are given to kill any cancer cells. This also kills all healthy bone marrow that remains and allows new stem cells to grow in the bone marrow.\nReduced intensity treatment, also called a mini transplant\n-- Lower doses of chemotherapy and radiation are given before a transplant. This allows older people, and those with other health problems to have a transplant.\nThere are four kinds of bone marrow transplants:\nAutologous bone marrow transplant\n-- The term auto means self."}

This allows older people, and those with other health problems to have a transplant.\nThere are four kinds of bone marrow transplants:\nAutologous bone marrow transplant\n-- The term auto means self. Stem cells are removed from you before you receive high-dose chemotherapy or radiation treatment. The stem cells are stored in a freezer. After high-dose chemotherapy or radiation treatments, your stem cells are put back in your body to make normal blood cells. This is called a rescue transplant.\nAllogeneic bone marrow transplant\n-- The term allo means other. Stem cells are removed from another person, called a donor. Most times, the donor's genes must at least partly match your genes. Special tests are done to see if a donor is a good match for you. A brother or sister is most likely to be a good match. Sometimes parents, children, and other relatives are good matches. Donors who are not related to you, yet still match, may be found through national bone marrow registries.\nUmbilical cord blood transplant\n-- This is a type of allogeneic transplant. Stem cells are removed from a newborn baby's umbilical cord right after birth."}

Stem cells are removed from a newborn baby's umbilical cord right after birth. The stem cells are frozen and stored until they are needed for a transplant. Umbilical cord blood cells are very immature so there is less of a need for perfect matching. Due to the smaller number of stem cells, blood counts take much longer to recover.\nHaploidentical transplant\n-- This is a type of allogeneic transplant, in which the donor is not completely matched with the recipient. A haploidentical transplant may be from a family member. Children are always a half-match for their parents, and parents are a half-match for their children. Siblings have a 50% chance of being a half-match for each other. Special treatments are performed to decrease the chance of complications due to the incomplete match.\nA stem cell transplant is usually done after chemotherapy and radiation is completed. The stem cells are delivered into your bloodstream, usually through a tube called a central venous catheter. The process is similar to getting a blood transfusion."}

The stem cells travel through the blood into the bone marrow.\nDonor stem cells can be collected in two ways:\nBone marrow harvest\n-- This minor surgery is done under\ngeneral anesthesia\n. This means the donor will be asleep and pain-free during the procedure. Some of the donor's bone marrow is removed from the back of both hip bones. The amount of marrow removed depends on the weight of the person who is receiving it. This method is rarely performed today.\nLeukapheresis\n-- First, the donor is given several days of shots to help stem cells move from the bone marrow into the blood. During leukapheresis, blood is removed from the donor through an IV line. The part of white blood cells that contains stem cells is then separated in a machine and removed to be later given to the recipient."}

The red blood cells are returned to the donor.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nA bone marrow transplant replaces bone marrow that is either not working properly or has been destroyed (ablated) by chemotherapy or radiation. For many cancers, the donor's white blood cells may attack any remaining cancer cells, which are seen as foreign, similar to when white cells attack bacteria or viruses when fighting an infection.\nYour health care provider may recommend a bone marrow transplant if you have:\nCertain cancers, such as\nleukemia\n, lymphoma, myelodysplasia, or\nmultiple myeloma\n.\nA disease that affects the production of bone marrow cells, such as\naplastic anemia\n, congenital\nneutropenia\n, severe immune system illnesses,\nsickle cell anemia\n, or\nthalassemia\n.\nRisks\nA bone marrow transplant may cause the following symptoms:\nChest pain\nDrop in blood pressure\nFever, chills, flushing\nHeadache\nHives\nNausea\nPain\nShortness of breath\nStrange taste in the mouth\nPossible complications of a bone marrow t"}
