Your health care provider will do a mental health assessment to find out about the person's behavior and symptoms. A psychiatrist may be consulted to confirm the diagnosis.\nTo be diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder, you must have psychotic symptoms and a mood disorder. In addition, you must have psychotic symptoms during a period of normal mood for at least 2 weeks.\nThe combination of psychotic and mood symptoms in schizoaffective disorder can be seen in other illnesses, such as\nbipolar disorder\n. Extreme disturbance in mood is an important part of schizoaffective disorder.\nBefore diagnosing schizoaffective disorder, your provider will check for medical and medicine-related conditions. Other mental disorders that cause psychotic or mood symptoms must also be ruled out.

Group therapy can help with social isolation.\nSupport and work training may be helpful for work skills, relationships, money management, and living situations.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPeople with schizoaffective disorder have a greater chance of going back to their previous level of function than do people with most other psychotic disorders.
