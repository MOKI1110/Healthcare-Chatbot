Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCardiac ablation procedures\nCardiac ablation procedures\nCardiac ablation is a procedure that is used to scar small areas in your heart that may be involved in your\nheart rhythm problems\n. This can prevent the abnormal electrical signals or rhythms from moving through your heart.\nDuring the procedure, small wires called electrodes are placed inside your heart to measure your heart's electrical activity. When the source of the problem is found, the tissue causing the problem is destroyed.\nDescription\nThere are two methods for performing cardiac ablation:\nRadiofrequency ablation uses heat energy to eliminate the problem area.\nCryoablation uses very cold temperatures.\nThe type of procedure you have will depend on what kind of abnormal heart rhythm you have.\nCardiac ablation procedures are done in a hospital laboratory by a team of trained staff. This includes cardiologists (heart doctors), technicians, and nurses."}

This includes cardiologists (heart doctors), technicians, and nurses. The setting is safe and controlled so your risk is as low as possible.\nYou will be given medicine (a sedative) before the procedure to help you relax.\nThe skin on your neck, arm, or groin will be cleaned well and made numb with an anesthetic.\nNext, the cardiologist will make a small cut in the skin.\nA small, flexible tube (catheter) will be inserted through this cut into one of the blood vessels in the area. The cardiologist will use live x-ray images to carefully guide the catheter up into your heart.\nSometimes more than one catheter is needed.\nOnce the catheter is in place, your cardiologist will place small electrodes in different areas of your heart.\nThese electrodes are connected to monitors that allow the cardiologist to tell what area in your heart is causing problems with your heart rhythm."}

In most cases, there are one or more specific areas.\nOnce the source of the problem has been found, one of the catheter lines is used to send electrical (or sometimes cold) energy to the problem area.\nThis creates a small scar that causes the heart rhythm problem to stop.\nCatheter ablation is a long procedure. It can last 4 or more hours. During the procedure your heart will be monitored closely. A health care team member may ask you if you are having symptoms at different times during the procedure. Symptoms you may feel are:\nA brief burning when medicines are injected\nfaster or stronger heartbeat\nLightheadedness\nBurning when the electrical energy is used\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nCardiac ablation is used to treat certain heart rhythm problems that medicines are not controlling."}
