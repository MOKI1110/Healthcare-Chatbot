The seeds may give off high or low amounts of radiation.\nDescription\nBrachytherapy takes 30 minutes or more, depending on the type of therapy you have. Before the procedure, you will be given medicine so that you do not feel pain. You may receive:\nA sedative to make you drowsy and numbing medicine on your perineum. This is the area between the anus and scrotum.\nAnesthesia: With\nspinal anesthesia\n, you will be drowsy but awake, and numb below the waist. With\ngeneral anesthesia\n, you will be asleep and pain free.\nAfter you receive anesthesia:\nThe doctor places an\nultrasound\nprobe into your rectum to view the area. The probe is like a camera connected to a video monitor in the room. A\ncatheter\n(tube) may be placed in your bladder to drain urine.\nThe doctor uses ultrasound or a\nCT scan\nto plan and then place the seeds that deliver radiation into your prostate."}

The seeds are placed with needles or special applicators through your perineum.\nPlacing the seeds may hurt a little (if you are awake).\nTypes of brachytherapy:\nLow-dose rate brachytherapy is the most common type of treatment. The seeds stay inside your prostate and put out a small amount of radiation for several months. You go about your normal routine with the seeds in place.\nHigh-dose rate brachytherapy lasts about 30 minutes. Your doctor inserts the radioactive material into the prostate. The doctor may use a computerized robot to do this. The radioactive material is removed right away after treatment. This method often requires 2 treatments spaced 1 week apart.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nBrachytherapy is often used for men with prostate cancer that is found early and is slow-growing. Brachytherapy has fewer complications and side effects than standard radiation therapy or surgery."}

These include medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\nBefore this procedure:\nYou may need to have ultrasounds,\nx-rays\n, or CT scans to prepare for the procedure.\nSeveral days before the procedure, you may be told to stop taking medicines that make it hard for your blood to clot."}

Your provider can help.\nOn the day of the procedure:\nYou will likely be asked not to drink or eat anything for several hours before the procedure.\nTake the medicines you've been told to take with a small sip of water.\nYou will be told when to arrive at the hospital. Be sure to arrive on time.\nAfter the Procedure\nYou may be sleepy and have mild pain and tenderness after the procedure.\nAfter an outpatient procedure, you can go home as soon as the anesthesia wears off. In rare cases, you will need to spend 1 to 2 days in the hospital."}

In rare cases, you will need to spend 1 to 2 days in the hospital. If you stay in the hospital, your visitors will need to follow special radiation safety precautions.\nIf you have a permanent implant, your provider may tell you to limit the amount of time you spend around children and women who are pregnant. After a few weeks to months, the radiation is gone and will not cause any harm. Because of this, there is no need to take out the seeds.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost men with small, slow-growing prostate cancer remain cancer-free or their cancer is in good control for many years after this treatment. Urinary and rectal symptoms may last for months or years.\nAlternative Names\nImplant therapy - prostate cancer; Radioactive seed placement; Internal radiation therapy - prostate; High dose radiation (HDR)\nPatient Instructions\nProstate brachytherapy - discharge\nReferences\nNational Cancer Institute website.
