It is performed in a surgeon's office, a hospital, or an outpatient surgery center. Complex procedures may require a short hospital stay. The procedure often takes 1 to 3 hours. It may take longer.\nWith local anesthesia, the nose and the area around it are numbed. You will probably be lightly sedated, but awake during the surgery (relaxed and not feeling pain). General anesthesia allows you to sleep through the operation.\nThe surgery is usually done through a cut (incision) made inside the nostrils. In some cases, the cut is made from outside, around the base of the nose. This type of cut is often used to perform work on the tip of the nose or if you need a revision surgery. If the nose needs to be narrowed, the incision may extend around the nostrils."}

This type of cut is often used to perform work on the tip of the nose or if you need a revision surgery. If the nose needs to be narrowed, the incision may extend around the nostrils. Small incisions may be made on the inside of the nose to break, and reshape the bone.\nA splint (metal or plastic) may be placed on the outside of the nose. This helps maintain the new shape of the bone when the surgery is finished. Soft plastic splints or nasal packs also may be placed in the nostrils. This helps keep the dividing cartilage wall between the air passages (septum) stable.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nRhinoplasty is one of the most common plastic surgery procedures. It can be used to:\nReduce the size of the nose\nChange the shape of the tip or the nasal bridge\nNarrow the opening of the nostrils\nChange the angle between the nose and the upper lip\nCorrect a birth defect or injury\nHelp relieve nasal breathing problems\nNose surgery is considered elective when it is done for cosmetic reasons. In these cases, the purpose is to change the shape of the nose to one that the person finds more desirable."}

In these cases, the purpose is to change the shape of the nose to one that the person finds more desirable. Many surgeons prefer to perform cosmetic nose surgery after the nasal bone has finished growing. This is around age 15 to 16 for girls and a bit later for boys.\nRisks\nRisks for anesthesia and surgery in general are:\nReactions to medicines, problems breathing\nBleeding, infection, or bruising\nRisks for this procedure include:\nLoss of support of the nose\nContour deformities of the nose\nWorsening of breathing through the nose\nNeed for further surgery\nAfter surgery, tiny blood vessels that have burst may appear as tiny red spots on the skin surface. These are usually minor, but are permanent. There are no visible scars if the rhinoplasty is performed from inside the nose. If the procedure narrows flared nostrils, there may be small scars at the base of the nose that are not often visible.\nIn rare cases, a revision procedure is needed to fix a minor deformity.\nBefore the Procedure\nYour surgeon may give you instructions to follow before your surgery."}

Headaches are common.\nThe nasal packing, if present, is usually removed in 3 to 5 days, after which you will feel more comfortable.\nThe splint and cast may be left in place for 1 to 2 weeks.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nFull recovery takes a year, but most swelling will have improved by 2 to 3 months.\nHealing is a slow and gradual process. The tip of the nose may have some swelling and numbness for several months but will improve with time."}
