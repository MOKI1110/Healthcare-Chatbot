It is a type of eczema.\nOther forms of dermatitis include:\nContact dermatitis\nDyshidrotic eczema\nNummular eczema\nSeborrheic dermatitis\nCauses\nAtopic dermatitis is due to a\nreaction\nin the skin. The reaction leads to ongoing itching, swelling and redness. People with atopic dermatitis may be more sensitive because their skin lacks specific proteins that maintain the skin's barrier to water.\nAtopic dermatitis is most common in infants. It may start as early as age 2 to 6 months. Many people outgrow it by early adulthood.\nPeople with atopic dermatitis often have\nasthma\nor seasonal allergies. There is often a family history of allergies such as asthma, hay fever, or eczema. People with atopic dermatitis often test positive for allergy skin tests."}

The rash is often itchy and forms blisters that ooze and crust over.\nIn older children and adults, the rash is more often seen on the inside of the knees and elbow. It can also appear on the neck, hands, and feet.\nIn adults, the rash may be limited to the hands, eyelids, or genitals.\nRashes may occur anywhere on the body during a bad outbreak.\nIntense itching is common. Itching may start even before the rash appears. Atopic dermatitis is often called the \"itch that rashes\" because the itching starts, and then the skin rash follows as a result of scratching.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will look at your skin and do a physical exam."}

Wear light gloves during sleep if nighttime scratching is a problem.\nKeep your skin moist by using lotions, creams, or ointments (such as petroleum jelly) 2 to 3 times a day."}

A humidifier to keep home air moist will also help.\nAvoid things that make symptoms worse, such as:\nFoods, such as eggs, that may cause an allergic reaction in a very young child (always talk to your provider first)\nIrritants, such as wool and lanolin\nStrong soaps or detergents, as well as chemicals and solvents\nSudden changes in body temperature and stress, which may cause sweating\nTriggers that cause allergy symptoms\nWhen washing or bathing:\nExpose your skin to water for as short a time as possible.

You can often buy these medicines without a prescription.\nAtopic dermatitis is usually treated with medicines placed directly on the skin or scalp. These are called topical medicines:\nYou will probably be prescribed a mild corticosteroid cream or ointment at first (such as hydrocortisone). You may need a stronger medicine if this does not work.\nMedicines called topical immunomodulators (TIMs) may be prescribed for anyone over 2 years old. Ask your provider about concerns over a possible cancer risk with the use of these medicines.\nCreams or ointments that contain coal tar or anthralin may be used for thickened areas.\nBarrier repair creams containing ceramides may be used.\nWet-wrap treatment with topical corticosteroids may help regulate the condition."}
