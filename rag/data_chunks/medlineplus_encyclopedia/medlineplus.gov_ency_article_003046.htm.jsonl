Related conditions include:\nOtitis media\nSwimmer's ear\nMalignant otitis externa\nConsiderations\nThe symptoms of an ear infection may include:\nEar pain\nFever\nFussiness\nIncreased crying\nIrritability\nMany children will have minor hearing loss during or right after an ear infection. Most of the time, the problem goes away. Lasting hearing loss is rare, but the risk increases with the number of infections.\nCauses\nThe eustachian tube runs from the middle part of each ear to the back of the throat. This tube drains fluid that is made in the middle ear. If the eustachian tube becomes blocked, fluid can build up. This may lead to pressure behind the eardrum or an\near infection\n.\nEar pain in adults is less likely to be from an ear infection. Pain that you feel in the ear may be coming from another place, such as your teeth, the joint in your jaw (\ntemporomandibular joint\n), or your throat."}
