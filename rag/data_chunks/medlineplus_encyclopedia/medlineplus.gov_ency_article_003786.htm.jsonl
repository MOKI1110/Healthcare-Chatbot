Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHead CT scan\nHead CT scan\nA head\ncomputed tomography\n(CT) scan uses many x-rays to create pictures of the head, including the skull, brain, eye sockets, and sinuses.\nHow the Test is Performed\nHead CT is done in the hospital or radiology center.\nYou lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner.\nWhile inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you.\nA computer creates separate images of the body area, called slices. These images can be:\nStored\nViewed on a monitor\nPrinted on film\nSaved to a disk\nThree-dimensional models of the head area can be created by stacking the slices together.\nYou must be still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods.\nA complete scan usually takes only 30 seconds to a few minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nCertain CT exams require a special dye, called contrast material. It is delivered into the body before the test starts."}

It is delivered into the body before the test starts. Contrast helps certain areas show up better on x-rays.\nContrast can be given through a vein (\nIV\n) in your hand or forearm. If contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.\nLet your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test in order to safely receive it.\nBefore receiving the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes medicine metformin (Glucophage). You may need to take extra precautions. Also let your provider know if you have any kidney function problems as the IV contrast can worsen this problem.\nIf you weigh more than 300 pounds (136 kilograms), find out if the CT machine has a weight limit. Some machines do.\nYou will be asked to remove jewelry and may need to wear a hospital gown during the study.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe x-rays produced by the CT scan are painless."}

Having many x-rays or CT scans over time may increase your risk for cancer. However, the risk from any one scan is small. You and your provider should weigh this risk against the benefits of getting a correct diagnosis for a medical problem.\nSome people have allergies to contrast dye."}
