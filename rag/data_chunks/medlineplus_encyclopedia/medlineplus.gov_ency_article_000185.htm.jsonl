Many of these occur during or after a\nheart attack\n(myocardial infarction). These complications include:\nA large section of heart muscle that no longer moves well or does not move at all\nBreaking open (rupture) of the heart muscle due to damage from the heart attack\nDangerous heart rhythms, such as\nventricular tachycardia\n,\nventricular fibrillation\n, or\nsupraventricular tachycardia\nPressure on the heart due to a buildup of fluid around it (pericardial tamponade)\nTear or rupture of the muscles or tendons that support the heart valves, especially the mitral valve\nTear or rupture of the wall (septum) between the left and right ventricles (lower heart chambers)\nVery slow heart rhythm (bradycardia) or problem with the electrical system of the heart (heart block)\nCardiogenic shock occurs when the heart is unable to supply as much bloo"}

It can happen even if there hasn't been a heart attack. For example, if one of these problems listed above occurs and your heart function drops suddenly. Or if a valve becomes obstructed or if a combination of problems occurs.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nChest pain or pressure\nComa\nDecreased urination\nFast breathing\nFast pulse\nHeavy sweating\n, moist skin\nLightheadedness\nLoss of alertness and ability to concentrate\nRestlessness,\nagitation\n,\nconfusion\nShortness of breath\nSkin that feels cool to the touch\nPale skin color or blotchy skin\nWeak (thready) pulse\nExams and Tests\nAn exam will show:\nLow blood pressure (most often less than 90 mmHg systolic [the first number])\nBlood pressure that drops more than 10 points when you stand up after lying down (orthostatic hypotension)\nWeak (thready) pulse\nCold and clammy skin\nTo diagnose cardiogenic shock, a catheter (tube) may be placed in the lung artery (\nright heart catheterization\n)."}

You will need to stay in the hospital, most often in the Intensive or Coronary Care Unit (ICU). The goal of treatment is to find and treat the cause of shock to save your life.\nYou may need medicines to increase blood pressure and improve heart function, including:\nDobutamine\nDopamine\nEpinephrine\nLevosimendan\nMilrinone\nNorepinephrine\nVasopressin\nThese medicines may help in the short-term."}
