The problem is passed down through families. It causes swelling, particularly of the face and airways, and intestines (causing severe abdominal pain).\nCauses\nAngioedema is swelling that is similar to\nhives\n, but the swelling is under the skin instead of on the surface. Angioedema typically is not itchy while hives are very itchy.\nHereditary angioedema (HAE) is caused by a low level or improper function of a protein called the C1 inhibitor. It affects the blood vessels. An HAE attack can result in rapid swelling of the hands, feet, limbs, face, intestinal tract, larynx (voicebox), or trachea (windpipe).\nAttacks of swelling can become more severe in late childhood and adolescence.\nThere is usually a family history of the condition."}

But relatives may be unaware of previous cases, which may have been reported as an unexpected, sudden, and premature death of a parent, aunt, uncle, or grandparent.\nDental procedures, sickness (including colds and the flu), and surgery may trigger HAE attacks.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nAirway blockage\n-- involves throat swelling and sudden hoarseness\nRepeat episodes of abdominal cramping without obvious cause\nSwelling\nin the hands, arms, legs, lips, eyes, tongue, throat, or genitals\nSwelling of the intestines -- can be severe and lead to abdominal cramping, vomiting, dehydration, diarrhea, pain, and occasionally\nshock\nA non-itchy, red rash\nExams and Tests\nBlood tests:\nC1 inhibitor function\nC1 inhibitor level\nComplement component 4\n(may only be abnormal during an episode)\nTreatment\nAntihistamines, corticosteroids and other treatments used for idiopathic angioedema and hives (urticaria) do not work well for HAE."}

Epinephrine could be used in life-threatening reactions, although it is unlikely to stop the swelling. There are a number of newer FDA-approved treatments for HAE.\nSome are given through a vein (IV) and can be used at home. Others are given as an injection under the skin by the person. Another is given by mouth. Some of these medicines are used regularly to prevent attacks and others are used emergently when an attack occurs to prevent it from getting worse. The choice of which agent may be based on the age of the person, personal preference, and where the symptoms occur.\nBefore these newer medicines became available, androgen medicines such as danazol, were used to reduce the frequency and severity of attacks. These medicines help the body make more C1 inhibitor. However, many women have serious side effects from these medicines."}

They can also not be used in children.\nOnce an attack occurs, treatment includes fast administration of specific medicines that stop the attack from worsening and supportive care such as pain relief and fluids given through a vein by an intravenous (IV) line.\nHelicobacter pylori\n, a type of bacteria found in the stomach, can trigger abdominal attacks. Antibiotics to treat the bacteria help decrease abdominal attacks.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with HAE condition and their families can be found at:\nNational Organization for Rare Disorders --\nrarediseases.org/rare-diseases/hereditary-angioedema\nUS Hereditary Angioedema Association --\nwww.haea.org\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHAE can be life threatening and, despite new treatments, airway swelling can still lead to death."}

How well a person does depends on the specific symptoms.\nPossible Complications\nSwelling of the airways may be deadly.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact or visit your health care provider if you are considering having children and have a family history of this condition. Also call if you have symptoms of HAE.\nSwelling of the airway is a life-threatening emergency. If you are having difficulty breathing due to swelling, seek immediate medical attention.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling may be helpful for prospective parents with a family history of HAE.\nAlternative Names\nQuincke disease; HAE - Hereditary angioedema; Kallikrein inhibitor - HAE; Bradykinin receptor antagonist - HAE; C1-inhibitors - HAE; Hives - HAE\nImages\nAntibodies\nReferences\nCraig T, Zuraw B, Longhurst H, et al, eds.
