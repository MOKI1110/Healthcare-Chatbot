The test is often done in the ultrasound or radiology department of a hospital. It also can be done in a clinic.\nThe test is done in this way:\nYou lie down with your neck on a pillow or other soft support. Your neck is stretched slightly.\nThe ultrasound technician applies a water-based gel on your neck to help transmit the sound waves.\nNext, the technician moves a wand, called a transducer, back and forth on the skin of your neck. The transducer gives off sound waves. The sound waves go through your body and bounce off the area being studied (in this case, the thyroid gland)."}

The transducer gives off sound waves. The sound waves go through your body and bounce off the area being studied (in this case, the thyroid gland). A computer looks at the pattern that the sound waves create when bouncing back, and creates an image from them.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou should feel very little discomfort with this test. The gel may be cold.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA thyroid ultrasound is usually done when a physical exam shows any of these findings:\nYou have a growth on your thyroid gland, called a\nthyroid nodule\n.\nThe thyroid feels big or irregular, called a\ngoiter\n.\nYou have abnormal lymph nodes near your thyroid.\nUltrasound is also often used to guide the needle in biopsies of:\nThyroid nodules or the thyroid gland\n-- In this test, a needle draws out a small amount of tissue from the nodule or thyroid gland."}

Thyroid ultrasounds are becoming better and predicting whether a thyroid nodule is benign or is a cancer. Many thyroid ultrasound reports will now give each nodule a score and discuss the characteristics of the nodule that caused the score."}
