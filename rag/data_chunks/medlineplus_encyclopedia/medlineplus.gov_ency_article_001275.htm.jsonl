A small telescope will be passed through the urethra into the bladder. A laser or other device will be used to break up the stones and the pieces will be removed. Some stones may need to be removed using open surgery.\nMedicines are rarely used to dissolve the stones.\nCauses of bladder stones should be treated. Most commonly, bladder stones are seen with\nBPH\nor blockage at the base of the bladder. You may need\nsurgery to remove the inside part of the prostate\nor to repair the bladder.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost bladder stones pass on their own or can be removed. They do not cause permanent damage to the bladder. They may come back if the cause is not corrected.\nLeft untreated, stones may cause repeated UTIs."}
