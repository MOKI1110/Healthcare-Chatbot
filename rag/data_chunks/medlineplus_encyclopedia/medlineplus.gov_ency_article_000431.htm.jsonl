It is a long-term disease. It can also affect other organs.\nCauses\nThe cause of RA is not known. It is an autoimmune disease. This means the immune system of the body mistakenly attacks healthy tissue.\nRA can occur at any age, but is more common in middle age. Women get RA more often than men.\nInfection, genes, and hormone changes may be linked to RA. Smoking and the gut microbiome are linked to the risk of developing the disease.\nIt is less common than\nosteoarthritis\n(OA) which is a joint condition that occurs in many people due to wear and tear on the joints as they age.\nSymptoms\nMost of the time, RA affects joints on both sides of the body equally. Fingers, wrists, knees, feet, elbows, ankles, hips and shoulders are the most commonly affected. The lower spine is usually not affected by RA.\nThe disease often begins slowly."}

Early symptoms may include:\nMinor joint pain\nStiffness\nFatigue\nJoint symptoms may include:\nMorning stiffness, which lasts more than 1 hour, is common.\nJoints may feel warm, tender, and stiff when not used for an hour.\nJoint pain is often felt in the same joint on both sides of the body.\nJoints are often swollen.\nOver time, joints may lose their range of motion and may become deformed.\nOther symptoms include:\nChest pain when taking a breath (\npleurisy\n)\nDry eyes and mouth (\nSjÃ¶gren syndrome\n)\nEye burning, itching, and discharge\nNodules\nunder the skin (most often a sign of more severe disease)\nNumbness, tingling\n, or burning in the hands and feet\nSleep difficulties\nThe diagnosis of RA is made when:\nYou have pain and swelling in 1 or more joints.\nPain and swelling have been present for longer than 6 weeks.\nYou have a positive test for rheumatoid factor or anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibody.\nYou have an elevated\nerythrocytesedimentation rate\n(ESR) or\nC-reactive protein"}

Most people with RA will have some abnormal test results. However, some people will have normal results for all tests.\nTwo lab tests that are positive in most people and often help in the diagnosis are:\nRheumatoid factor\nAnti-CCP antibody\nThese tests are positive in most patients with RA. The anti-CCP antibody test is more specific for RA.\nOther tests that may be done include:\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nMetabolic panel and serum uric acid\nCRP\nESR\nAntinuclear antibody\nTests for\nhepatitis\nJoint x-rays\nJoint ultrasound or\nMRI\nJoint fluid analysis\nTreatment\nRA most often requires long-term treatment by an expert in arthritis called a rheumatologist."}

This will slow joint destruction and prevent deformities. The activity of the RA should be checked at regular visits to make sure the disease is under control. The goal of treatment is to stop the progression of the RA.\nMEDICINES\nAnti-inflammatory medicines: These include aspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, naproxen and celecoxib.\nThese medicines work very well to reduce joint swelling and inflammation, but they can have long-term side effects."}

They are prescribed along with rest, strengthening exercise, and anti-inflammatory drugs.\nMethotrexate is the most commonly used DMARD for RA. Leflunomide and hydroxychloroquine may also be used.\nSulfasalazine is a medicine that is often combined with methotrexate and hydroxychloroquine (triple therapy).\nIt may be weeks or months before you see any benefit from these medicines.\nThese medicines may have serious side effects, so you will need frequent blood tests and other monitoring when taking them.\nAntimalarial medicines -- This group of medicines includes hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil).

Therefore, they should be taken only for a short time and in low doses when possible.\nBiologic DMARD agents -- These medicines are designed to affect parts of the immune system that play a role in the disease process of RA.\nThey may be given when other medicines, usually methotrexate, have not worked. Biologic medicines are often added to methotrexate. However, because they are very expensive, insurance approval is generally required.\nMost of them are given either under the skin or into a vein. There are now many different types of biologic agents.\nBiologic and synthetic agents can be very helpful in treating RA."}

A balanced nutritious diet is recommended. It may be helpful to eat foods rich in fish oils (omega-3 fatty acids). Smoking cigarettes should be stopped. Excessive alcohol should also be avoided.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with RA and their families can be found by taking part in an arthritis support group.\nSome people may benefit from taking part in an\narthritis support group\n.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWhether your RA progresses or not depends on the severity of your symptoms and your response to treatment.

Complications may include:\nDamage to the lung tissue.\nIncreased risk of\nhardening of the arteries\n, leading to cardiovascular disease.\nSpinal injury when the neck bones become damaged.\nInflammation of the blood vessels (rheumatoid vasculitis), which can lead to skin, nerve, heart, and brain problems.\nSwelling and inflammation of the outer lining of the heart (\npericarditis\n) and of the heart muscle (\nmyocarditis\n), which can lead to\ncongestive heart failure\n.\nHowever, these complications can be avoided with proper treatment.
