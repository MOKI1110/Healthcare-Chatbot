These proteins thicken in cold temperatures.\nCauses\nCryoglobulins are\nantibodies\n. It is not yet known why they become solid or gel-like at low temperatures in the laboratory. In the body, these antibodies can form immune complexes that can cause inflammation and block blood vessels. This is called cryoglobulinemic vasculitis. This may lead to problems ranging from skin rashes to kidney failure.\nCryoglobulinemia is part of a group of diseases that cause damage and inflammation of the blood vessels throughout the body (vasculitis). There are three main types of this condition."}

There are three main types of this condition. They are grouped based on the type of antibody that is produced:\nType I\nType II\nType III\nType I cryoglobulinemia is most often related to cancer of the blood or immune systems.\nTypes II and III are also referred to as mixed cryoglobulinemia\n.\nTypes II and III are most often found in people who have a long-lasting (chronic) inflammatory condition, such as an\nautoimmune disease\nor\nhepatitis C\n. Most people with the type II form of cryoglobulinemia have a chronic hepatitis C infection.\nOther conditions that may be related to cryoglobulinemia include:\nLeukemia\nMultiple myeloma\nPrimary macroglobulinemia\nRheumatoid arthritis\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\nSymptoms\nSymptoms will vary, depending on the type of disorder you have and the organs that are involved. Symptoms may include:\nBreathing problems\nFatigue\nGlomerulonephritis\n(kidney inflammation)\nJoint pain\nMuscle pain\nPurpura\nRaynaud phenomenon\nSkin death\nSkin ulcers\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will do a physical exam."}

It is important that the lab that performs the test is familiar with the process.)\nLiver function tests\n-- may be high if hepatitis C is present.\nRheumatoid factor\n-- positive in types II and III.\nSkin\nbiopsy\n-- may show inflammation in blood vessels, vasculitis.\nProtein electrophoresis - blood\n-- may show an abnormal antibody protein.\nUrinalysis -- may show\nblood in the urine\nif the kidneys are affected.\nHepatitis B and hepatitis C testing.\nOther tests may include:\nAngiogram\nChest x-ray\nESR\nHepatitis C test\nNerve conduction tests, if the person has numbness or weakness in the arms or legs\nTreatment\nMIXED CRYOGLOBULINEMIA (TYPES II AND III)\nMild or moderate forms of cryoglobulinemia can of"}

As hepatitis C goes away, the cryoglobulins will disappear in about one half of all people over the next 12 months. Your provider will continue to monitor the cryoglobulins after treatment.\nSevere cryoglobulinemia vasculitis involves vital organs or large areas of skin. It is treated with corticosteroids and other medicines that suppress the immune system.\nRituximab is an effective drug and has fewer risks than other medicines.\nCyclophosphamide is used in life-threatening conditions where rituximab is not working or available. This medicine was used more often in the past.\nA treatment called plasmapheresis is also used. In this procedure, blood plasma is taken out of blood circulation and abnormal cryoglobulin antibody proteins are removed."}

Treatment is directed against the abnormal cancer cells that produce the cryoglobulin.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost of the time, mixed cryoglobulinemia does not lead to death. Outlook can be poor if the kidneys are affected.\nPossible Complications\nComplications include:\nBleeding in the digestive tract (rare)\nHeart disease (rare)\nSkin infections or ulcers\nKidney failure\nLiver failure\nSkin death\nDeath\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nYou develop symptoms of cryoglobulinemia.\nYou have hepatitis C and develop symptoms of cryoglobulinemia.\nYou have cryoglobulinemia and develop new or worsening symptoms.\nPrevention\nThere is no known prevention for the condition.\nStaying away from cold temperatures may prevent some symptoms.\nTesting and treatment for hepatitis C infection will reduce your risk."}
