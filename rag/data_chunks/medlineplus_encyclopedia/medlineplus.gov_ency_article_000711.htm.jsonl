These disorders first affect the muscles around the shoulder girdle and hips. These diseases get worse over time. Eventually, it may involve other muscles.\nCauses\nLimb-girdle muscular dystrophies are a large group of genetic diseases in which there is muscle weakness and wasting (muscular dystrophy).\nIn most cases, both parents must pass on the non-working (defective) gene for a child to have the disease (autosomal recessive inheritance). In some rare types, only one parent needs to pass on the non-working gene to affect the child. This is called autosomal dominant inheritance. For most of these conditions, the defective gene has been discovered.\nAn important risk factor is having a family member with\nmuscular dystrophy\n.\nSymptoms\nMost often, the first sign is pelvic muscle weakness."}

Examples of this include trouble standing from a sitting position without using the arms, or difficulty climbing stairs. The weakness starts in childhood to young adulthood.\nOther symptoms include:\nAbnormal, sometimes waddling, walk\nJoints that are fixed in a contracted position (late in the disease)\nLarge and muscular-looking calves (pseudohypertrophy), which are not actually strong\nLoss of muscle mass, thinning of certain body parts\nLow back pain\nPalpitations\nor passing-out spells\nShoulder weakness\nWeakness of the muscles in the face (later in the disease)\nWeakness in the muscles of the lower legs, feet, lower arms, and hands (later in the disease)\nExams and Tests\nTests may include:\nBlood creatine kinase levels\nDNA testing (molecular genetic testing)\nEchocardiogram\nElectrocardiogram (ECG)\nElectromyogram\n(EMG) testing\nMuscle biopsy\nPulmonary function tests\nTreatment\nThere are no known treatments that reverse the muscle weakness. Gene therapy may become available in the future."}

It includes:\nHeart monitoring\nMobility aids\nPhysical therapy\nRespiratory care\nWeight control\nSurgery is sometimes needed for any bone or joint problems.\nSupport Groups\nThe Muscular Dystrophy Association is an excellent resource:\nwww.mda.org\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn general, people tend to have weakness that slowly gets worse in affected muscles and spreads.\nThe disease causes loss of movement. The person may be dependent on a wheelchair within 20 to 30 years.\nHeart muscle weakness and abnormal electrical activity of the heart can increase the risk for palpitations, fainting, and sudden death."}

Contact a geneticist if you or a family member has been diagnosed with muscular dystrophy, and you are planning a pregnancy.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling is now offered to affected individuals and their families. Soon molecular testing will involve whole genome sequencing on patients and their relatives to better establish the diagnosis. Genetic counseling may help some couples and families learn about the risks and help with family planning."}

Genetic counseling may help some couples and families learn about the risks and help with family planning. It also allows connecting patients with diseases registries and patient organizations.\nSome of the complications can be prevented with appropriate treatment. For example, a cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator can greatly reduce the risk for sudden death due to an abnormal heart rhythm. Physical therapy may be able to prevent or delay contractures and improve quality of life.\nAffected people may want to do DNA banking. DNA testing is recommended for those who are affected. This helps to identify the family gene mutation. Once the mutation is found, prenatal DNA testing, testing for carriers, and pre-implantation genetic diagnosis are possible.\nAlternative Names\nMuscular dystrophy - limb-girdle type (LGMD)\nImages\nSuperficial anterior muscles\nReferences\nBharucha-Goebel DX.
