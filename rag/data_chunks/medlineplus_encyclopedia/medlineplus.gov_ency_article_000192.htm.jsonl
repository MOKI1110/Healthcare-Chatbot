Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes thick. Sometimes, only one part of the heart is thicker than the other parts.\nThe thickening can make it harder for blood to leave the heart, forcing the heart to work harder to pump blood. It also can make it harder for the heart to relax and fill with blood.\nCauses\nHypertrophic cardiomyopathy is most often passed down through families (inherited). It is thought to result from defects in the genes that control heart muscle growth.\nYounger people are likely to have a more severe form of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, the condition is seen in people of all ages.\nSymptoms\nSome people with the condition may have no symptoms. They may first find out they have the problem during a routine medical exam.\nIn many young adults, the first symptom of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is sudden collapse and possible death. This can be caused by highly abnormal heart rhythms (\narrhythmias\n)."}

This can be caused by highly abnormal heart rhythms (\narrhythmias\n). It may also be due to a blockage that prevents the outflow of blood from the heart to the rest of the body.\nCommon symptoms include:\nChest pain\nDizziness\nFainting\n, especially during exercise\nFatigue\nLightheadedness, especially with or after activity or exercise\nSensation of feeling the heart beat fast or irregularly (\npalpitations\n)\nShortness of breath\nwith activity or after lying down (or being asleep for a while)\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and listen to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Signs may include:\nAbnormal heart sounds\nor a heart murmur. These sounds may change with different body positions.\nHigh blood pressure.\nThe pulse in your arms and neck will also be checked."}

This is most often done with an echocardiogram or with genetic testing.\nTreatment\nAlways follow your provider's advice about exercise if you have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. You may be told to avoid strenuous exercise."}

You may be told to avoid strenuous exercise. Also, see your provider for regularly scheduled checkups.\nIf you have symptoms, you may need medicines including beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers or other newer medicines to help the heart contract and relax correctly. These medicines may relieve chest pain or shortness of breath when exercising.\nPeople with arrhythmias may need treatment, such as:\nMedicines to treat the abnormal rhythm.\nBlood thinners to reduce the risk of blood clots (if the arrhythmia is due to atrial fibrillation).\nA permanent pacemaker to control the heartbeat.\nAn implanted defibrillator that recognizes life-threatening heart rhythms and sends an electrical pulse to stop them. Sometimes a defibrillator is placed, even if the patient has not had an arrhythmia but is at high risk for a deadly arrhythmia (for example, if the heart muscle is very thick or weak, or the patient has a relative who has died suddenly).\nWhen blood flow out of the heart is severely blocked, symptoms can become severe."}

An operation called surgical myectomy may be done. In some cases, people may be given an injection of alcohol into the arteries that feed the thickened part of the heart (alcohol septal ablation). People who have this procedure often show much improvement.\nYou may need surgery to repair the heart's mitral valve if it is leaking.\nWatch this video about:\nCardiomyopathy\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSome people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy may not have symptoms and will have normal lifespan. Others may get worse slowly or quickly. In some cases, the condition may develop into\ndilated cardiomyopathy\n.\nPeople with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are at higher risk for sudden death than people without the condition. Sudden death can occur at a young age.\nThere are different types of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, which have different prognoses."}
