Bone marrow is the soft, spongy tissue found inside most bones in children and in the front chest bone (sternum) and the pelvis bones in adults. The bone marrow makes blood cells.\nPlasma cells help your body fight infection by producing proteins called\nantibodies\n. In people with multiple myeloma, abnormal plasma cells grow out of control in the bone marrow and form tumors in the areas of solid bone. The growth of these bone tumors weakens the bones. It also makes it harder for the bone marrow to make healthy blood cells and platelets.\nCauses\nThe cause of multiple myeloma is unknown. Past treatment with radiation therapy increases the risk for this type of\ncancer\n."}

Past treatment with radiation therapy increases the risk for this type of\ncancer\n. Multiple myeloma mainly affects older adults.\nSymptoms\nMultiple myeloma most commonly causes:\nLow red blood cell count (\nanemia\n), which can lead to fatigue and shortness of breath\nLow white blood cell count, which makes you more likely to get infections\nLow platelet count, which can lead to abnormal bleeding\nAs the cancer cells grow in the bone marrow, you may have bone pain, most often in the ribs or back.\nThe cancer cells can weaken bones. As a result:\nYou may develop broken bones (bone fractures) just from doing normal activities.\nIf cancer grows in the spine bones, it can press on the nerves. This can lead to\nnumbness\nor weakness of the arms or legs.\nFrequent infections may occur.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.\nBlood tests are needed to diagnose this disease."}

If your provider suspects this type of cancer, a\nbone marrow biopsy\nwill be performed.\nBone density testing may show bone loss.\nTreatment\nPeople who have no damage to their bones or body or in whom the diagnosis is not certain are usually closely monitored without giving treatment. This is called smoldering myeloma which can sometimes progress to myeloma that needs treatment.\nVarious types of medicines are used to treat multiple myeloma."}

This treatment has additional risks, but may offer the chance of a cure.
