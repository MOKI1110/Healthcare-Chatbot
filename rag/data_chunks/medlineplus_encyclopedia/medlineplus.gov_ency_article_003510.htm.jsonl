Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHCG blood test - quantitative\nHCG blood test - quantitative\nA quantitative human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG or hCG) blood test measures the specific level of HCG in the blood. HCG is a hormone produced in the body during pregnancy.\nOther HCG tests include:\nHCG urine test\nHCG blood test -- qualitative\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. This is most often taken from a vein. The procedure is called a\nvenipuncture\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nHCG appears in the blood and urine of pregnant women as early as 10 days after conception. Quantitative HCG measurement helps determine the exact age of the fetus. It can also assist in the diagnosis of abnormal pregnancies, such as ectopic pregnancies, molar pregnancies, and possible miscarriages."}
