The clean-catch urine method is used to prevent germs from the penis or vagina from getting into a urine sample.\nHow the Test is Performed\nIf possible, collect the sample when urine has been in your bladder for 2 to 3 hours.\nYou will use a special kit to collect the urine. It will most likely have a cup with a lid and wipes.\nWash your hands with soap and warm water.\nPeople with a vagina need to wash the area between the vagina \"lips\" (labia). You may be given a special clean-catch kit that contains sterile wipes.\nSit on the toilet with your legs spread apart. Use two fingers to spread open your labia.\nUse the first wipe to clean the inner folds of the labia."}

Use two fingers to spread open your labia.\nUse the first wipe to clean the inner folds of the labia. Wipe from the front to the back.\nUse a second wipe to clean over the opening where urine comes out (urethra), just above the opening of the vagina.\nTo collect the urine sample:\nKeeping your labia spread open, urinate a small amount into the toilet bowl, then stop the flow of urine.\nHold the urine cup a few inches (or a few centimeters) from the urethra and urinate until the cup is about half full.\nYou may finish urinating into the toilet bowl.\nPeople with a penis:\nClean the head of the penis with a sterile wipe. If you are not circumcised, you will need to pull back (retract) the foreskin first.\nUrinate a small amount into the toilet bowl, and then stop the flow of urine.\nThen collect a sample of urine into the clean or sterile cup, until it is half full.\nYou may finish urinating into the toilet bowl.\nINFANTS\nYou will be given a special bag to collect the urine."}

It will be a plastic bag with a sticky strip on one end, made to fit over your baby's genital area.\nIf the collection is being taken from an infant, you may need extra collection bags.\nWash the area well with soap and water, and dry. Open and place the bag on your infant.\nThe entire penis can be placed in the bag or place the bag over the labia.\nYou can put on a diaper over the bag.\nCheck the baby often and remove the bag after the urine collects in it. Active infants may displace the bag, so you may need to make more than one attempt. Drain the urine into the container you were given and return it to the health care provider as directed.\nAFTER COLLECTING THE SAMPLE\nScrew the lid tightly on the cup."}
