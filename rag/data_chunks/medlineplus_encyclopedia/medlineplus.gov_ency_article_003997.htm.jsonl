Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCentral sleep apnea\nCentral sleep apnea\nCentral sleep apnea is a\nsleep disorder\nin which breathing stops over and over during sleep.\nCauses\nCentral sleep apnea results when the brain temporarily stops sending signals to the muscles that cause breathing.\nThe condition often occurs in people who have certain medical problems. For example, it can develop in someone who has a problem with an area of the brain called the brainstem, which controls breathing.\nConditions that can cause or lead to central sleep apnea include:\nProblems that affect the brainstem, including brain infection, stroke, or conditions of the cervical spine (neck)\nCertain medicines, such as\nnarcotic painkillers\nBeing at high altitude\nIf the apnea is not associated with another disease, it is called idiopathic central sleep apnea.\nA condition called Cheyne-Stokes respiration can affect people with severe heart failure and can be associated with central sleep apnea."}

The breathing pattern involves alternating deep and heavy breathing with shallow, or even not breathing, usually while sleeping.\nCentral sleep apnea is not the same as\nobstructive sleep apnea\n. With obstructive sleep apnea, breathing stops and starts because the airway is narrowed or blocked. Central sleep apnea and obstructive sleep apnea can be present in the same person.\nSymptoms\nPeople with central sleep apnea have episodes of disrupted breathing during sleep.\nOther symptoms may include:\nChronic fatigue\nDaytime sleepiness\nMorning headaches\nRestless sleep\nOther symptoms may occur if the apnea is due to a problem with the nervous system. Symptoms depend on  the  parts of the nervous system that are affected,  and may include:\nShortness of breath\nSwallowing problems\nVoice changes\nWeakness or numbness throughout the body\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. Tests will be done to diagnose an underlying medical condition."}

Tests will be done to diagnose an underlying medical condition. A\nsleep study (polysomnography)\ncan confirm sleep apnea.\nOther tests that may be done include:\nEchocardiogram\nLung function\ntesting\nMRI\nof the brain, spine, or neck\nBlood tests, such as arterial blood gas levels\nTreatment\nTreating the condition that is causing central sleep apnea can help manage symptoms. For example, if central sleep apnea is due to heart failure, the goal is to treat the heart failure itself.\nDevices used during sleep to aid breathing may be recommended. These include\nnasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)\n,\nbilevel positive airway pressure (BiPAP)\nor adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV). Some types of central sleep apnea are treated with medicines that stimulate breathing.\nOxygen treatment may help ensure the lungs get enough oxygen while sleeping.\nIf narcotic medicine is causing the apnea, the dosage may need to be lowered or the medicine changed.\nThe FDA has approved a medical device (remede System) to treat central sleep apnea."}

The device is implanted in the chest. When a breathing pause is detected, the device stimulates the nerve that controls the breathing muscles so that you will breathe.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well you do depends on the medical condition causing central sleep apnea.\nThe outlook is usually favorable for people with idiopathic central sleep apnea.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may result from the underlying disease causing the central sleep apnea.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of sleep apnea. Central sleep apnea is usually diagnosed in people who are already severely ill.\nAlternative Names\nSleep apnea - central; Obesity - central sleep apnea; Cheyne-Stokes - central sleep apnea; Heart failure - central sleep apnea\nReferences\nRedline S.
