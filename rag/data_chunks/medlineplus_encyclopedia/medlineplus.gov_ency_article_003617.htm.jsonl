It is normally found in liver cells and cells of the small intestine. This test is used to measure how much of this protein appears in your urine.\nYour blood can also be checked for this\nprotein\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA 24-hour urine sample is needed.\nOn day 1, urinate into the toilet when you get up in the morning.\nAfterward, collect all urine in a special container for the next 24 hours.\nOn day 2, urinate into the container when you get up in the morning.\nCap the container."}

Keep it in the refrigerator or a cool place during the collection period.\nLabel the container with your name, the date, the time of completion, and return it as instructed.\nFor an infant, thoroughly wash the area where urine exits the body.\nOpen a urine collection bag (a plastic bag with an adhesive paper on one end).\nFor males, place the entire penis in the bag and attach the adhesive to the skin.\nFor females, place the bag over the labia.\nDiaper as usual over the secured bag.\nThis procedure may take more than one try. An active infant can move the bag, so that the urine leaks into the diaper.\nCheck the infant often and change the bag after the infant has urinated into it.\nDrain the urine from the bag into the container given to you by your health care provider."}

Never stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou may need this test to see if there is liver damage. It may also be done to check for certain\ntumors\n.\nThis test is only rarely done. Other tests such as gamma glutamyl transpeptidase are more accurate and readily available.\nNormal Results\nNormal values range from 2 to 18 units per 24 hours.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}
