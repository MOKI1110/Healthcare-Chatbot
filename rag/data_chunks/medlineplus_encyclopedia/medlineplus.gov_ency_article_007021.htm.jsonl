It connects the heel bone to the toes and creates the arch of the foot. When this tissue becomes swollen or inflamed, it is called plantar fasciitis.\nCauses\nSwelling occurs when the thick band of tissue on the bottom of the foot (fascia) is overstretched or overused. This can be painful and make walking more difficult.\nYou are more likely to get plantar fasciitis if you:\nHave foot arch problems (both\nflat feet\nand\nhigh arches\n)\nRun long distances, downhill or on uneven surfaces\nAre obese or gain weight suddenly\nHave a tight Achilles tendon (the tendon connecting the calf muscles to the heel)\nWear shoes with poor arch support or soft soles\nChange your activity level\nPlantar fasciitis is seen in both men and women. It is one of the most common orthopedic foot complaints.\nPlantar fasciitis was commonly thought to be caused by a heel spur. However, research has found that this is not the case."}

On x-ray, heel spurs are seen in people with and without plantar fasciitis.\nSymptoms\nThe most common symptom is pain and stiffness in the bottom of the heel. The heel pain may be dull or sharp. The bottom of the foot may also ache or burn.\nThe pain is often worse:\nIn the morning when you take your first steps\nAfter standing or sitting for awhile\nWhen climbing stairs\nAfter intense activity\nDuring walking, running, and jumping sports\nThe pain may develop slowly over time, or come on suddenly after intense activity.\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

Do this at least twice a day for 10 to 15 minutes, more often in the first couple of days.\nIf these treatments do not work, your provider may recommend:\nWearing a boot cast, which looks like a ski boot, for 3 to 6 weeks."}

Rarely, surgery may be needed to relieve the pain.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of plantar fasciitis.\nPrevention\nMaking sure your ankle, Achilles tendon, and calf muscles are flexible can help prevent plantar fasciitis. Stretch your plantar fascia in the morning before you get out of bed. Doing activities in moderation can also help.\nImages\nPlantar fascia\nPlantar fasciitis\nReferences\nGrear BJ.
