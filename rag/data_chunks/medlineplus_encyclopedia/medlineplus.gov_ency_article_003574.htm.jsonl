Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCEA blood test\nCEA blood test\nThe carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) test measures the level of CEA in the blood. CEA is a protein normally found in the tissue of a developing baby in the womb. The blood level of this protein disappears or becomes very low after birth. In adults, an abnormal level of CEA may be a sign of cancer.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample is needed\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nSmoking may increase the CEA level. If you smoke, your health care provider may tell you to avoid doing so for a short time before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to monitor the response to treatment and then to check for the return of colon and other cancers such as medullary thyroid cancer and cancers of the rectum, lung, breast, liver, pancreas, stomach, and ovaries.\nIt is not used as a screening test for cancer and should not be done unless a diagnosis of cancer has been made.\nNormal Results\nThe normal range is 0 to 2.5 ng/mL (0 to 2.5  µg/L).\nIn smokers, slightly higher values may be considered normal (0 to 5 ng/mL, or 0 to 5  µg/L).\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA high CEA level in a person recently treated for certain cancers may mean the cancer has returned. A higher than normal level may be due to the following cancers:\nBreast cancer\nCancers of the reproductive and urinary tracts\nColon cancer\nLung cancer\nPancreatic cancer\nThyroid cancer\nA higher than normal CEA level alone cannot diagnose a new cancer."}

Further testing is needed.\nAn increased CEA level may also be due to:\nLiver and gallbladder problems, such as scarring of the liver (\ncirrhosis\n), or gallbladder inflammation (\ncholecystitis\n)\nHeavy smoking\nInflammatory bowel diseases (such as\nulcerative colitis\nor\ndiverticulitis\n)\nLung infection\nInflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis)\nStomach ulcer\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:\nExcessive bleeding (rare)\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nCarcinoembryonic antigen blood test\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nFranklin WA, Aisner DL, Davies KD, et al."}
