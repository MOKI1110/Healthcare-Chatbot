This makes distant objects appear blurred. Nearsightedness is a type of refractive error of the eye.\nIf you are nearsighted, you have trouble seeing things that are far away.\nCauses\nPeople are able to see because the front part of the eye bends (refracts) light and focuses it on the retina. This is the inside of the back surface of the eye.\nNearsightedness occurs when there is a mismatch between the focusing power of the eye and the length of the eye. Light rays are focused in front of the retina, rather than directly on it. As a result, what you see is blurry. Most of the eye's focusing power comes from the cornea.\nWatch this video about:\nSeeing\nNearsightedness affects males and females equally. People who have a family history of nearsightedness are more likely to develop it. Most eyes with nearsightedness are healthy."}

People who have a family history of nearsightedness are more likely to develop it. Most eyes with nearsightedness are healthy. However, a small number of people with severe nearsightedness develop a form of retinal degeneration.\nThe predominant wavelength of light in your environment may affect the development of myopia. Recent research suggests that more time outdoors during childhood may lead to less myopia.\nSymptoms\nA nearsighted person sees close-up objects clearly, but objects in the distance are blurred. Squinting will tend to make far away objects seem clearer.\nNearsightedness is often first noticed in school-aged children or teenagers. Children often cannot read the blackboard, but they can easily read a book.\nNearsightedness gets worse during the growth years. People who are nearsighted may need to change glasses or contact lenses often."}

A newer type of laser refractive surgery called SMILE (Small Incision Lenticule Extraction) is also approved for use in the United States.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nEarly diagnosis of nearsightedness is important. A child can suffer socially and educationally by not being able to see well at a distance.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nCorneal ulcers and infections\nmay occur in people who use contact lenses.\nRarely, complications of laser vision correction may occur."}

Reading and watching television do not cause nearsightedness.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020, when most school-aged children were learning from home, there was an increase in the development of nearsightedness over what had been seen before."}

In the past, dilating eye drops were proposed as a treatment to slow the development of nearsightedness in children, but those early studies were inconclusive. However, there is recent information that certain dilating eyedrops used in certain children at just the right time, may decrease the total amount of nearsightedness that they will develop.\nThe use of glasses or contact lenses does not affect the normal progression of myopia -- they simply focus the light so the nearsighted person can see distant objects clearly. However, it is important to not prescribe glasses or contact lenses that are too strong. Hard contact lenses will sometimes hide the progression of nearsightedness, but vision will still get worse \"under\" the contact lens.\nAlternative Names\nMyopia; Shortsightedness; Refractive error - nearsightedness\nImages\nVisual acuity test\nNormal, nearsightedness, and farsightedness\nLasik eye surgery - series\nReferences\nLe NT, Mamalis C, Weikert MP, Al-Mohtaseb Z."}
