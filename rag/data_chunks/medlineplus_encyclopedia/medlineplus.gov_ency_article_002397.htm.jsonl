Premature infants may not have a cry reflex. Therefore, they must be monitored closely for signs of hunger and pain.\nInformation\nA cry is the infant's first verbal communication. It is a message of urgency or distress. The sound is nature's way of ensuring that adults attend to the baby as quickly as possible. It is very hard for most people to listen to a crying baby.\nAlmost everyone recognizes that infants cry for many reasons and that crying is a normal response. However, parents may feel a high amount of stress and anxiety when a baby cries frequently. The sound is perceived as an alarm. Parents are often frustrated at not being able to determine the cause of the crying and soothe the baby. First time parents often question their parenting abilities if a baby cannot be comforted.\nWHY INFANTS CRY\nAt times, infants cry for no apparent reason. However, most crying is in response to something."}

However, most crying is in response to something. It may be hard to figure out what is bothering the infant at the time. Some possible reasons include:\nHunger. Newborns want to eat day and night, often every 2 to 3 hours.\nPain caused by gas or intestinal spasms after feedings. The pain develops if the baby has been fed too much or not burped enough. Foods that a breastfeeding mother eats may cause gas or pain in her child.\nColic\n. Many infants age 3 weeks to 3 months develop a crying pattern associated with colic. Colic is a normal part of development that may be triggered by many factors. It usually occurs in the late afternoon or evening hours.\nDiscomfort, such as from a wet diaper.\nFeeling too hot or too cold. Babies may also cry from feeling too wrapped up in their blanket, or from wanting to be bundled up tightly.\nToo much noise, light, or activity. These can slowly or suddenly overwhelm your baby.\nCrying is probably part of the normal development of the central nervous system."}

Do not delay for long when your baby shows signs of hunger.\nMake sure you are feeding the child the proper amount and burping the baby correctly.\nCheck to see that your baby is not too cold or too hot.\nCheck to see whether the baby's diaper needs to be changed.\nMake sure there is not too much noise, light, or wind, or not enough stimulation and interaction.\nHere are a few ways to soothe a crying baby:\nTry playing soft, gentle music for comfort.\nTalk to your baby."}

The sound of your voice may be reassuring. Your baby may also be calmed by the hum or sound of a fan or clothes dryer.\nChange the infant's position.\nHold your baby close to your chest. Sometimes, infants need to experience familiar sensations, such as the sound of your voice in your chest, your heartbeat, the feel of your skin, the smell of your breath, the movement of your body, and the comfort of your hug. In the past, babies were held constantly and the absence of a parent meant danger from predators or abandonment. You cannot spoil a baby by holding them during infancy.\nIf the crying continues for longer than usual and you cannot calm the baby, contact a health care provider for advice.\nTry to get enough rest. Tired parents are less able to care for their baby.\nUse the resources of family, friends, or outside caregivers to allow yourself time to recover your energy. This will also be helpful for your baby. It does not mean that you are a bad parent or are abandoning your child."}
