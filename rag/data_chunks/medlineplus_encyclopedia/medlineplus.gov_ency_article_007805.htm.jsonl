Peanuts are legumes, not nuts, but many people who are allergic to peanuts are also allergic to nuts. Nut allergies are a type of\nfood allergy\n.\nMost people who develop nut allergies will have them for the rest of their life.\nCauses\nThe immune system normally protects the body against harmful substances, such as bacteria and viruses. It also reacts to foreign substances called\nallergens\n. These are usually harmless, and in most people, do not cause a problem.\nIf you have a nut allergy, your immune system is overly reactive. When the body identifies a nut allergen, it launches a response. Chemicals such as histamines are released. These chemicals cause allergy symptoms."}

When the body identifies a nut allergen, it launches a response. Chemicals such as histamines are released. These chemicals cause allergy symptoms. These symptoms occur every time you come in contact with even a small amount of the nut allergen.\nRisk factors for nut and other food allergies include:\nHaving eczema as a child\nHow early you were exposed to nuts in childhood\nOther theories suggest that changes to the microbiome may be a factor. The microbiome is all of the tiny organisms (bacteria, fungi, and others) that normally live on and in our bodies. A number of things may affect the microbiome, including cesarean birth, antibiotic use, and more people living in urban settings."}

In addition to the above symptoms, you may have\nlow blood pressure\nand blocked airways. These severe allergy symptoms are a medical emergency.\nExams and Tests\nIf you suspect that you or your child has a nut allergy, see an allergy specialist doctor (allergist).\nBlood or skin tests may be used to confirm that you have an allergy."}

These tests are:\nAllergy skin test\nwhere a small amount of the nut allergen is introduced into the body by pricking the skin.\nImmunoglobulin E (IgE) blood test, which measures levels of IgE in the blood\nIf results from these tests are unclear, you may have other tests.\nA double-blind food challenge is one way to diagnose a nut allergy. During this test, you and your health care provider will not know what you are eating.\nWith elimination diets, you avoid the suspected food until your symptoms disappear. Then you start eating the foods again to see if you develop an allergic reaction.\nIn provocation (challenge) testing, you eat a small amount of the suspected food under medical supervision. This type of test may cause severe allergic reactions. Challenge testing should only be done by a trained provider.\nNever try to cause a reaction or reintroduce a food on your own."}

Often, nuts and peanuts are processed in the same facility. This increases the risk for cross-contact exposure. Cross-contact is when an allergen is accidentally transferred from one food to another."}

This increases the risk for cross-contact exposure. Cross-contact is when an allergen is accidentally transferred from one food to another. For example, if you use a knife to spread peanut butter, wipe it off without washing it, and then use it for jelly, the jelly will become contaminated with the proteins from the peanut butter. Even very small amounts of an allergen can cause a reaction.\nTo avoid consuming nuts you should:\nRead food labels carefully to avoid any foods that contain nuts. These include sweets and baked goods, cereal and granola, whole-grain breads, sauces, soups, and many others.\nAvoid foods with labels that say \"may contain traces of\" a nut allergen or \"produced in a facility\" that manufactures nuts or peanuts.\nAlways let your restaurant server know that you have a nut allergy. Ask them to make sure there are no nuts or peanuts in your food.\nEMERGENCY TREATMENT\nThere may be a time that you accidentally eat foods with nuts. So you need to know what to do if you are exposed.\nSevere allergic reactions (anaphylaxis) need to be treated with a medicine called epinephrine."}

You should have it with you at all times.\nIf you develop any type of serious or whole-body reaction (even hives) after eating the nut allergen:\nInject the epinephrine.\nThen call 911 or the local emergency number and follow the instructions you are given, or, go straight to the hospital.\nIMMUNOTHERAPY\nOral immunotherapy (desensitization) is a treatment to help you be less sensitive to the nut allergen. This therapy must be done under an allergist's guidance. The allergist will give increasing amounts of the nut allergen (most often peanut powder). This raises the threshold that triggers allergic symptoms. Immunotherapy is not a cure, but it can help reduce the risk of a severe reaction."}

The sooner you inject the epinephrine, the better.\nPrevention\nBreastfeeding may help prevent allergies from developing in your baby.
