It might take place before the 20th week of pregnancy.\nCauses\nSome pregnant women have some\nvaginal bleeding\nduring the first 3 months of pregnancy. Bleeding may occur  with or without abdominal cramps. When the symptoms indicate a miscarriage is possible, the condition is called a \"threatened abortion.\" (This refers to a natural event that is not due to a medical or surgical abortion.)\nMiscarriage\nis common. Small falls, injuries or stress during the first trimester of pregnancy can cause threatened miscarriage. It occurs in almost one half of all pregnancies. The chance of miscarriage is higher in older women. About one half of women who have bleeding in the first trimester will have a miscarriage.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a threatened miscarriage include:\nVaginal bleeding during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy (last menstrual period was less than 20 weeks ago)."}

Vaginal bleeding occurs in almost all threatened miscarriages.\nAbdominal cramps may also occur. If abdominal cramps occur in the absence of significant bleeding, consult your health care provider to check for other problems besides threatened miscarriage.\nNote: During a miscarriage, low back pain or abdominal pain (dull to sharp, constant to intermittent) can occur. Tissue or clot-like material may pass from the\nvagina\n.\nExams and Tests\nYour provider may perform an abdominal or vaginal ultrasound to check the baby's development and heartbeat, and the amount of bleeding."}

Not having sexual intercourse is often recommended until the warning signs have disappeared.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost women with a threatened miscarriage go on to have a normal pregnancy.\nWomen who have had two or more miscarriages in a row may be more likely than other women to miscarry again.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nAnemia\nfrom moderate to heavy blood loss, which may require a blood transfusion.\nInfection.\nMiscarriage.\nThe provider will want to ensure that the symptoms are not due to an ectopic pregnancy. This is a potentially life-threatening complication.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIf you know you are (or are likely to be) pregnant and you have any symptoms of threatened miscarriage, contact your prenatal provider right away.\nPrevention\nMost miscarriages cannot be prevented. The most common cause of a miscarriage is a random genetic abnormality in the developing fetus."}

If you have two or more repeated miscarriages, you should consult a specialist to look for an underlying condition that is causing the problem. Women who get prenatal care have better pregnancy outcomes for themselves and their babies.\nA healthy pregnancy is more likely when you avoid things that are harmful to your pregnancy, such as:\nAlcohol\nInfectious diseases\nHigh caffeine intake\nRecreational drugs\nX-rays\nTaking a prenatal vitamin or folic acid supplement before becoming pregnant and throughout your pregnancy can lower your chance of miscarriage and improve the chance of delivering a healthy baby.\nIt is better to treat health problems before you get pregnant than to wait until you are already pregnant. Miscarriages caused by diseases that affect your whole body, such as high blood pressure, are rare."}
