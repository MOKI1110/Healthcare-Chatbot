Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPulmonic valve stenosis\nPulmonic valve stenosis\nPulmonic stenosis is a heart valve disorder that involves the pulmonary valve.\nThis is the valve separating the right ventricle (one of the chambers in the heart) and the pulmonary artery. The pulmonary artery carries oxygen-poor blood to the lungs.\nStenosis, or narrowing, occurs when the valve cannot open wide enough. As a result, blood flows less easily to the lungs.\nCauses\nNarrowing of the pulmonary valve is most often present at birth (congenital). It is caused by a problem that occurs as the baby develops in the womb before birth. The cause is unknown, but genes may play a role.\nNarrowing that occurs in the valve itself is called valvular pulmonic stenosis. There may also be narrowing just before or after the valve.\nThe defect may occur alone or with other heart defects that are present at birth. The condition can be mild or severe.\nPulmonic stenosis is a rare disorder. In some cases, the problem runs in families.\nSymptoms\nMany cases of pulmonic stenosis are mild and do not cause symptoms."}

The condition can be mild or severe.\nPulmonic stenosis is a rare disorder. In some cases, the problem runs in families.\nSymptoms\nMany cases of pulmonic stenosis are mild and do not cause symptoms. The problem is most often found in infants when a heart murmur is heard during a routine heart exam.\nWhen the valve narrowing (stenosis) is moderate to severe, the symptoms include:\nAbdominal distention\nBluish color to the skin\n(cyanosis) in some people\nPoor appetite\nChest pain\nFainting\nFatigue\nPoor weight gain or\nfailure to thrive\nin infants with a severe blockage\nShortness of breath\nSudden death\nSymptoms may get worse with exercise or activity.\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider may hear a\nheart murmur\nwhen listening to the heart using a stethoscope."}

Special x-rays are used to help guide the catheter.\nThe balloon stretches the opening of the valve.\nSome people may need heart surgery to repair or replace the pulmonary valve. The new valve can be made from different materials. If the valve cannot be repaired or replaced, other procedures may be needed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPeople with mild disease rarely get worse. However, those with moderate to severe disease will get worse. The outcome is often very good when surgery or balloon dilation is successful. Other congenital heart defects may be a factor in the outlook.\nMost often, the new valves can last for decades."}
