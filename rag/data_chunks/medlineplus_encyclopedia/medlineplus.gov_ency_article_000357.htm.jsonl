This is a hormone produced by the\nadrenal glands\n.\nCauses\nThe adrenal glands are small hormone-releasing organs located on top of each kidney. They are made up of an outer portion called the cortex, and an inner portion called the medulla.\nThe cortex produces 3 hormones:\nGlucocorticoid hormones (such as cortisol) maintain sugar (glucose) control, blood pressure, decrease (suppress) immune response, and help the body respond to stress.\nMineralocorticoid hormones (such as aldosterone) regulate sodium, water and potassium balance.\nSex hormones, androgens (male) and estrogens (female), affect sexual development and sex drive.\nThe medulla produces the hormone adrenaline (also called epinephrine). Both cortisol and adrenaline are released in response to\nstress\n.\nCortisol production is regulated by the pituitary. This is a small gland just underneath the brain. The pituitary releases adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)."}

In adrenal crisis, you need to be given the medicine hydrocortisone right away through a vein (\nintravenous\n) or muscle (intramuscular). You may receive intravenous fluids if you have low blood pressure.\nYou will need to go to the hospital for treatment and monitoring."}

You may receive intravenous fluids if you have low blood pressure.\nYou will need to go to the hospital for treatment and monitoring. If infection or another medical problem caused the crisis, you may need additional treatment.\nMany people with primary or secondary adrenal insufficiency have an emergency syringe with hydrocortisone at home that a family member can inject into muscle if they are too sick or too weak to take their hydrocortisone pills.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nShock\nmay occur if treatment is not provided early, and it can be life threatening from very low blood pressure and heart problems.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nGo to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you develop symptoms of acute adrenal crisis.\nContact your health care provider if you have Addison disease or hypopituitarism and are unable to take your glucocorticoid medicine for any reason.\nIf you have Addison disease, you will usually be told to temporarily increase the dosage of your glucocorticoid medicine if you are stressed or ill, or before having surgery."}

This is called 'stress' or 'sick-day' dosing.\nPrevention\nIf you have Addison disease, learn to recognize the signs of potential stress that may cause an acute adrenal crisis. If you have been instructed by your provider, be prepared to give yourself an emergency shot of glucocorticoid or to increase your dosage of oral glucocorticoid medicine in times of stress. Parents should learn to do this for their children who have adrenal insufficiency.\nAlways carry medical ID (card, bracelet, or necklace) that says you have adrenal insufficiency. The ID should also say the type of medicine and dosage you need in case of an emergency.\nIf you take glucocorticoid medicines for pituitary ACTH deficiency, be sure you know when to take a stress dose of your medicine."}
