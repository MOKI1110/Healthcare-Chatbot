Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nVitamin B6\nVitamin B6\nVitamin B6 is a water-soluble vitamin. Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water so the body cannot store them. Leftover amounts of the vitamin leave the body through the urine. Although the body maintains a small pool of water-soluble vitamins, they have to be taken regularly.\nLack of vitamin B6 in the body is uncommon. It can occur in people with kidney failure, liver disease, or excessive alcohol use.\nFunction\nVitamin B6 helps the body to:\nMake\nantibodies\n. Antibodies are needed to fight many viruses, infections, and other diseases.\nMaintain normal nerve function.\nMake hemoglobin. Hemoglobin carries oxygen in the red blood cells to the tissues. A vitamin B6 deficiency can cause a form of\nanemia\n.\nBreak down\nproteins\n. The more protein you eat, the more vitamin B6 you need.\nKeep blood sugar (glucose) in normal ranges.\nFood Sources\nVitamin B6 is found in:\nTuna and salmon\nBanana\nLegumes (dried beans)\nBeef and pork\nNuts\nPoultry\nWhole grains and fortified cereals\nChickpeas\nFortified breads and cereals may also contain vitamin B6."}

DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)\n: The average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people."}
