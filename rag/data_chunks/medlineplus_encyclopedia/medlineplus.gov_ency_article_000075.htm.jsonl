It leads to high blood pressure in the lung arteries (\npulmonary hypertension\n).\nCauses\nIn most cases, the cause of PVOD is unknown. The high blood pressure occurs in the pulmonary arteries. These lung arteries are directly connected to the right side of the heart.\nThe condition may be related to a viral infection. It may occur as a complication of certain diseases such as\nlupus\n, or\nbone marrow transplantation\n.\nThe disorder is most common among children and young adults."}
