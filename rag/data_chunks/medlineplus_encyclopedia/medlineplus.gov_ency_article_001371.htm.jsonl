Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPleurisy\nPleurisy\nPleurisy is an inflammation of the lining of the lungs and chest (the pleura) that leads to chest pain when you take a breath or cough.\nCauses\nPleurisy may develop when you have lung inflammation due to infection, such as a viral infection,\npneumonia\n, or\ntuberculosis\n.\nIt may also occur with:\nCertain cancers\nChest trauma\nBlood clot (\npulmonary embolus\n)\nRheumatoid arthritis\nLupus\n(systemic lupus erythematosus)\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom of pleurisy is pain in the chest. This pain often occurs when you take a deep breath in or out, or cough. Some people feel the pain in the shoulder.\nDeep breathing, coughing, and chest movement make the pain worse.\nPleurisy can cause fluid to collect inside the chest. As a result, the following symptoms can occur:\nCoughing\nShortness of breath\nRapid breathing\nPain with deep breaths\nExams and Tests\nWhen you have pleurisy, the normally smooth surfaces lining the lung (the pleura) become rough. They rub together with each breath. This results in a rough, grating sound called a friction rub."}

They rub together with each breath. This results in a rough, grating sound called a friction rub. Your health care provider may hear this sound with the stethoscope.\nYour provider may order the following tests:\nComplete blood count (\nCBC\n)\nX-ray of the chest\nCT scan of the chest\nUltrasound of the chest\nRemoval of pleural fluid with a needle (\nthoracentesis\n) for analysis\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the cause of the pleurisy. Bacterial infections are treated with antibiotics. Surgery or insertion of a tube in the chest may be needed to drain infected fluid from the lungs. Viral infections normally run their course without medicines.\nTaking acetaminophen or ibuprofen can help reduce pain.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nRecovery depends on the cause of the pleurisy and your general health condition.\nPossible Complications\nHealth problems that may develop from pleurisy include:\nBreathing difficulty\nFluid buildup between chest wall and lung\nComplications from the original illness\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of pleurisy."}
