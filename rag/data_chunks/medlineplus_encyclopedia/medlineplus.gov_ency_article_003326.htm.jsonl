Your provider will note if you repeat yourself or repeat what your provider says. Your provider will also find out if you have trouble expressing or understanding (aphasia).\nYour provider will point to everyday items in the room and ask you to name them. Or you may be asked to name less common items.\nYou may be asked to say as many words as possible in one minute that:\nStart with a certain letter\nAre in a certain category\nYou may be asked to read or write a sentence.\nJUDGMENT AND INTELLIGENCE\nThis part of the test looks at how well you solve a problem or situation. You may be asked questions such as:\n\"If you found a driver's license on the ground, what would you do?\"\n\"If a police car with lights flashing came up behind your car, what would you do?\"\nSome tests that screen for language problems do not account for people who do not read or write."}

If you know that the person being tested cannot read or write, tell the provider before the test.\nIf your child is having the test, it is important to help them understand the reason for the test.\nNormal Results\nMost tests are divided into sections, each with its own score. The results help show which part of someone's thinking and memory may be affected.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA number of health conditions can affect mental status. Your provider will discuss these with you. An abnormal mental status test alone does not diagnose the cause. However, doing poorly on such tests can be due to medical illness, brain disease such as dementia,\nParkinson disease\n, or to mental illness. Even when the cause is known, tests may be repeated over time to see if treatment is working.\nAlternative Names\nMental status exam; Neurocognitive testing; Dementia-mental status testing\nReferences\nBeresin EV, Gordon CD.
