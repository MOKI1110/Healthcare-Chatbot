Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFecal fat\nFecal fat\nThe fecal fat test measures the amount of fat in the stool. This can help gauge the percentage of dietary fat that the body does not absorb.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThere are many ways to collect the samples.\nFor adults and children, you can catch the stool on plastic wrap loosely placed over the toilet bowl and held in place by the toilet seat. Then put the sample in a clean container. One test kit supplies a special toilet tissue that you use to collect the sample, then put the sample in a clean container.\nFor infants and children wearing diapers, you can line the diaper with plastic wrap. If the plastic wrap is placed properly, you can prevent mixing of urine and stool. This will provide a better sample.\nCollect all stool that is released over a 24-hour period (or sometimes 3 days) in the containers provided."}

Label the containers with name, time, and date, and send them to the lab.\nSometimes you will be asked to provide a single stool sample to be examined under a microscope for stool fat.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nEat a normal diet containing about 100 grams (g) of fat per day for 3 days before starting the test. The health care provider may ask you to stop using medicines or\nfood additives\nthat could affect the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal bowel movements. There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test evaluates fat absorption to tell how well the liver, gallbladder, pancreas, and intestines are working.\nFat\nmalabsorption\ncan cause a change in your stools called steatorrhea."}
