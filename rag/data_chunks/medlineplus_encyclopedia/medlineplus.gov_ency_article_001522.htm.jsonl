The best care and treatment involve trained professionals.\nTreatment begins with recognizing the problem.

For example, for narcotic addiction, methadone or similar medicines may be used to prevent withdrawal and continued use.\nResidential treatment programs and intensive outpatient programs monitor and address possible withdrawal symptoms and behaviors. These programs use techniques to get users to recognize their behaviors and learn how not to go back to using (relapse).\nIf the person also has depression or another mental health issues, it should be treated.
