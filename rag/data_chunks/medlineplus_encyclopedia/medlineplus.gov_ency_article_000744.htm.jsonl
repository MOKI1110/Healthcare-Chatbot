Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFrontotemporal dementia\nFrontotemporal dementia\nFrontotemporal dementia (FTD) is a rare form of\ndementia\nthat is similar to\nAlzheimer disease\n, except that it tends to affect only certain areas of the brain.\nDementia may also be referred to as major\nneurocognitive disorder\n.\nCauses\nPeople with FTD have abnormal substances (called tangles, Pick bodies, Pick cells, and tau proteins) inside nerve cells in the damaged areas of the brain.\nThe exact cause of the abnormal substances is unknown. Many different abnormal genes have been found that can cause FTD. Some cases of FTD are passed down through families.\nFTD is rare. It can occur in people as young as 20. But it usually begins between ages 40 and 60. The average age at which it begins is 54.\nSymptoms\nThe disease gets worse slowly. Tissues in parts of the brain shrink over time. Symptoms such as behavior changes, speech difficulty, and problems with thinking occur slowly and get worse.\nEarly personality changes can help health care providers tell FTD apart from Alzheimer disease."}

(Memory loss is often the main, and earliest, symptom of Alzheimer disease.)\nPeople with FTD tend to behave the wrong way in different social settings. The changes in behavior continue to get worse and are often one of the most disturbing symptoms of the disease. Some persons have more difficulty with decision-making, complex tasks, or language (trouble finding or understanding words or writing). There are variations of FTD seen with other nervous system problems such as:\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n(ALS/Lou Gehrig disease)\nPrimary progressive\naphasia\nProgressive supranuclear palsy\nGeneral symptoms include:\nBEHAVIORAL CHANGES:\nNot able to keep a job\nCompulsive behaviors\nImpulsive or inappropriate behavior\nInability to function or interact in social or personal situations\nProblems with personal hygiene\nRepetitive behavior\nWithdrawal from social interaction\nEMOTIONAL CHANGES\nAbrupt mood changes\nDecreased interest in daily living activities\nFailure to recognize changes in behavior\nFailu"}
