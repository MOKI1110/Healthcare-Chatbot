Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nWest Nile virus infection\nWest Nile virus infection\nWest Nile virus causes a viral disease and is spread by mosquitoes. The condition ranges from mild to severe.\nCauses\nWest Nile virus was first identified in 1937 in Uganda in eastern Africa. It was first discovered in the United States in the summer of 1999 in New York. Since then, the virus has spread throughout the US.\nResearchers believe the West Nile virus is spread when a mosquito bites an infected bird and then bites a person.\nMosquitoes carry the highest amounts of the virus in the late summer and early fall, which is why more people get the disease in late August to early September."}

As the weather becomes colder and mosquitoes die off, there are fewer cases of the disease.\nAlthough many people are bitten by mosquitoes that carry West Nile virus, most do not know they have been infected.\nRisk factors for developing a more severe form of West Nile virus include:\nConditions that weaken the immune system, such as HIV/AIDS, organ transplants, and recent\nchemotherapy\nOlder or very young age\nPregnancy\nWest Nile virus may also be spread through blood transfusions and organ transplants. It is possible for an infected mother to spread the virus to her child through breast milk.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may occur 1 to 14 days after becoming infected."}

Mild disease, generally called West Nile fever, may cause some or all of the following symptoms:\nAbdominal pain\nFever, headache, and sore throat\nLack of appetite\nMuscle aches\nNausea, vomiting, and\ndiarrhea\nRash\nSwollen lymph nodes\nThese symptoms usually last for 3 to 6 days but may last a month.\nMore severe forms of the disease are called West Nile encephalitis or West Nile meningitis, depending on what part of the body is affected. The following symptoms can occur, and need prompt attention:\nMuscle weakness\nStiff neck\nWeakness of one arm or leg\nConfusion\nor change in the ability to think clearly\nLoss of consciousness\nor coma\nExams and Tests\nSigns of West Nile virus infection are similar to those of other viral infections. There may be no specific findings on a physical exam."}

Supportive care may help decrease the risk for developing complications in severe illness.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPeople with mild West Nile virus infection do well after treatment.\nFor those with severe infection, the outlook is more uncertain. West Nile encephalitis or meningitis may lead to brain damage and death."}
