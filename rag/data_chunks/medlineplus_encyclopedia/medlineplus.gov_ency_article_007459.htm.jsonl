It normally does this 60 to 100 times a minute, 24 hours a day.\nThe heart is made of four chambers:\nThe right atrium receives oxygen-poor blood from the body. That blood then flows into the right ventricle, which pumps it to the lungs.\nThe left atrium receives oxygen-rich blood from the lungs. From there, the blood flows into the left ventricle, which pumps blood out of the heart to the rest of the body.\nTogether, the arteries and veins are referred to as the vascular system."}

From there, the blood flows into the left ventricle, which pumps blood out of the heart to the rest of the body.\nTogether, the arteries and veins are referred to as the vascular system. In general, arteries carry blood away from the heart and veins carry blood back to the heart.\nThe cardiovascular system delivers oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and other important substances to cells and organs in the body. It plays an important role in helping the body meet the demands of activity, exercise, and stress. It also helps maintain body temperature, among other things.\nCARDIOVASCULAR MEDICINE\nCardiovascular medicine refers to the branch of health care that specializes in the treatment of diseases or conditions dealing with the heart and vascular systems.\nCommon disorders include:\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm\nCongenital heart defects\nCoronary artery disease\n, including angina and heart attack\nHeart failure\nHeart valve problems\nHigh blood pressure and high cholesterol\nIrregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias)\nPeripheral artery disease\n(PAD)\nStroke\nPhysicians involved in the treatment of circulatory or vascular diseases include:\nCardiologists -- Doctors who have received extra training"}
