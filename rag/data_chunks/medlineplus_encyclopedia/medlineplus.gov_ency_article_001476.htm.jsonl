Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSelective deficiency of IgA\nSelective deficiency of IgA\nSelective deficiency of IgA is the most common\nimmune deficiency disorder\n. People with this disorder have a low or absent level of a blood protein called immunoglobulin A.\nCauses\nSelective IgA deficiency is usually inherited, which means it is passed down through families. However, there are also cases of drug-induced selective IgA deficiency.\nIt may be inherited as an\nautosomal dominant\nor\nautosomal recessive\ntrait. It is usually found in people of European origin."}

However, there are also cases of drug-induced selective IgA deficiency.\nIt may be inherited as an\nautosomal dominant\nor\nautosomal recessive\ntrait. It is usually found in people of European origin. It is less common in people of other ethnicities.\nSymptoms\nMany people with selective IgA deficiency have no symptoms.\nIf a person does have symptoms, they may include frequent episodes of:\nBronchitis\n(airway infection)\nChronic diarrhea\nConjunctivitis\n(eye infection)\nGastrointestinal inflammation, including\nulcerative colitis\n,\nCrohn disease\n, and a\nsprue-like illness\nMouth infection\nOtitis media\n(middle ear infection)\nPneumonia\n(lung infection)\nSinusitis\n(sinus infection)\nSkin infections\nUpper respiratory tract infections\nOther symptoms include:\nBronchiectasis\n(a disease in which the bronchial tubes in the lungs become damaged and enlarged)\nAsthma\nwithout a known cause\nExams and Tests\nThere may be a family history of IgA deficiency. Tests that may be done include:\nIgG subclass measurements\nQuantitative immunoglobulins\nSerum immunoelectrophoresis\nTreatment\nNo specific treatment is available."}

Tests that may be done include:\nIgG subclass measurements\nQuantitative immunoglobulins\nSerum immunoelectrophoresis\nTreatment\nNo specific treatment is available. Some people gradually develop normal levels of IgA without treatment.\nTreatment involves taking steps to reduce the number and severity of infections. Antibiotics are often needed to treat bacterial infections.\nFor people with more frequent or severe infections, immunoglobulins might be given through a vein or by injection to boost the immune system.\nAutoimmune disease treatment is based on the specific problem.\nNote: People with complete IgA deficiency may develop anti-IgA antibodies if given blood products and immunoglobulins. This may lead to\nallergies\nor life-threatening\nanaphylactic shock\n. However, they can safely be given IgA-depleted immunoglobulins.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSelective IgA deficiency tends to be less severe than many other immunodeficiency diseases.\nMany people with selective IgA deficiency have no symptoms at all."}

Some people with IgA deficiency will recover on their own and produce IgA in larger quantities over a period of years.\nPossible Complications\nAutoimmune disorders such as\nrheumatoid arthritis\n,\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\n, and\nceliac disease\nmay develop.\nPeople with IgA deficiency may develop antibodies to IgA. As a result, they can have severe, even life-threatening reactions to transfusions of blood and blood products.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nPeople with IgA deficiency should contact their health care provider if they are having symptoms of an infection or intestinal symptoms.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling may be of value to prospective parents with a family history of selective IgA deficiency.\nAlternative Names\nIgA deficiency; Immunodepressed - IgA deficiency; Immunosuppressed - IgA deficiency; Hypogammaglobulinemia - IgA deficiency; Agammaglobulinemia - IgA deficiency\nImages\nAntibodies\nReferences\nCunningham-Rundles C.
