It is caused by an infection with a type of streptococcus bacteria. The infection does not occur in the kidneys, but in a different part of the body, such as the skin or throat. The disorder may develop 1 to 2 weeks after an untreated throat infection, or 3 to 4 weeks after a skin infection.\nIt may occur in people of any age, but it most often occurs in children ages 6 through 10. Although skin and throat infections are common in children, poststreptococcal GN is rarely a complication of these infections. Poststreptococcal GN causes the tiny blood vessels in the filtering units of the kidneys (glomeruli) to become inflamed."}

Poststreptococcal GN causes the tiny blood vessels in the filtering units of the kidneys (glomeruli) to become inflamed. This makes the kidneys less able to filter the blood to create urine.\nThe condition is not common today because infections that can lead to the disorder are treated with antibiotics.\nRisk factors include:\nStrep throat\nStreptococcal skin infections (such as\nimpetigo\n)\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nDecreased urine output\nRust-colored urine\nSwelling (edema), general swelling, swelling of the abdomen, swelling of the face or eyes, swelling of the feet, ankles, hands\nVisible blood in the urine\nJoint pain\nJoint stiffness or swelling\nExams and Tests\nA physical examination shows swelling (edema), especially in the face. Abnormal sounds may be heard when listening to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Blood pressure is often high.\nOther tests that may be done include:\nAnti-DNase B\nSerum ASO\n(and streptolysin O)\nSerum complement levels\nUrinalysis\nKidney biopsy\n(usually not needed)\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for this disorder."}

Treatment is focused on relieving symptoms.\nAntibiotics, such as penicillin, will likely be used to destroy any streptococcal bacteria that remain in the body.\nBlood pressure medicines and diuretic drugs may be needed to control swelling and high blood pressure.\nCorticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory medicines are generally not effective.\nYou may need to limit salt in your diet to control swelling and high blood pressure.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPoststreptococcal GN usually goes away by itself after several weeks to months.\nIn small number of adults, it may get worse and lead to long-term (chronic) kidney failure."}
