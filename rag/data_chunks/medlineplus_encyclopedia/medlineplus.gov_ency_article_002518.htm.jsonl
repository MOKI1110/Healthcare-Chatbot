PABA is sometimes called vitamin Bx, but it is not a true vitamin.\nThis article discusses reactions to PABA, such as\noverdose\nand allergic response. PABA overdose occurs when someone uses more than the normal or recommended amount of this substance. This can be by accident or on purpose.\nIncreased outdoor leisure time, decreased clothing coverage, a diminishing stratospheric ozone layer, and the rise in popularity of indoor tanning have added up to a significant increase in ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure in the last century.\nWhen used appropriately, PABA-containing products can reduce the incidence of several types of skin cancers by reducing the amount of harmful radiation which can act upon the skin.\nThis article is for information only.
