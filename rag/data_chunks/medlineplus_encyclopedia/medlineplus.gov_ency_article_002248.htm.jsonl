It can also include infants with a birth weight above the 90th percentile.\nThe LGA measurement is based on the estimated gestational age of the fetus or infant. Their actual measurements are compared with normal height, weight, head size, and development of a fetus or infant of the same age and sex.\nBefore birth LGA measurements are obtained by ultrasound exam. In an ultrasound exam obtained close to term, the exam is not as accurate and may suggest LGA in some cases where the baby is growing normally."}
