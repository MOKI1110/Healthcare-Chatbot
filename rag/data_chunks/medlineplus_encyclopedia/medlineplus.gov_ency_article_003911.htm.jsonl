Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPap test\nPap test\nThe Pap test mainly checks for changes in the cervix that may turn into\ncervical cancer\n. Cells scraped from the opening of the cervix are examined under a microscope. The cervix is the lower part of the uterus (womb) that opens at the top of the vagina.\nThis test is sometimes called a Pap \"smear\" or \"cervical cytology.\"\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou lie on a table and place your feet in footrests. Your health care provider gently inserts an instrument called a speculum into your\nvagina\nto open it slightly. This allows your provider to see your cervix.\nCells are gently collected from your cervix. The sample of cells is sent to a lab for examination.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nTell your provider if you:\nHave had an abnormal Pap test or a positive human papillomavirus (HPV) test in the past."}

The sample of cells is sent to a lab for examination.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nTell your provider if you:\nHave had an abnormal Pap test or a positive human papillomavirus (HPV) test in the past. HPV is a virus that causes genital warts and cervical cancer.\nMight be pregnant.\nDO NOT do the following for 24 hours before the test:\nDouche (douching should never be done)\nHave intercourse\nUse tampons\nTry not to schedule your Pap test for when you have your period, but if you are having unexpected bleeding, do not cancel your exam. Your provider will determine if the Pap test can still be done.\nFor your comfort, you may want to empty your bladder just before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nA Pap test causes only mild discomfort for most people. The discomfort it causes is usually similar to menstrual cramps. You may also feel some pressure during the exam.\nYou may bleed a little bit after the test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe Pap test looks for changes in cervical cells that may turn into cervical cancer."}

Most cervical cancers can be avoided if you have screenings according to the recommended schedule.\nExperts disagree about when and how often screening tests for cervical cancer should be done, including Pap tests. Some recommend having Pap tests starting at age 21 and then continuing to have them every 3 years. Others recommend waiting until age 25 and using a primary HPV test (one approved by the FDA for this purpose) to screen for cervical cancer."}

Ask your provider when you should stop screening.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means there are no abnormal cells present. The Pap test is not 100% accurate, and this is why repeat testing is recommended over time."}
