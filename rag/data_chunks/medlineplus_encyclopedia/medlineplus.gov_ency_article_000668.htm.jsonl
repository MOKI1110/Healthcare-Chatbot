It may also occur in people with weakened immune systems.\nAny type of bacteria can cause septic shock. Fungi and (rarely) viruses may also cause the condition. Toxins released by the bacteria or fungi may cause tissue damage. This may lead to low blood pressure and poor organ function."}

Fungi and (rarely) viruses may also cause the condition. Toxins released by the bacteria or fungi may cause tissue damage. This may lead to low blood pressure and poor organ function. Some researchers think that blood clots in small arteries cause the lack of blood flow and poor organ function.\nThe body may respond to the toxins with a strong inflammatory response that may contribute to organ damage.\nRisk factors for septic shock include:\nDiabetes\nDiseases of the genitourinary system,\nbiliary system\n, or intestinal system\nDiseases that weaken the immune system, such as AIDS\nIndwelling catheters (those that remain in place for extended periods, especially intravenous lines and urinary catheters, and plastic and metal stents used for drainage)\nLeukemia\nLong-term use of antibiotics\nLymphoma\nRecent infection\nRecent surgery or medical procedure\nRecent or current use of steroid medicines\nRecent chemotherapy for any type of cancer\nSolid organ or bone marrow transplantation\nSymptoms\nSeptic shock can affect any part of the body, including the heart, brain, kidneys, liver, and intestines."}

In most cases, people are admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital.\nTreatment may include:\nBreathing machine (mechanical ventilation)\nDialysis\nMedicines to treat low blood pressure, infection, or blood clotting\nHigh volume of fluids given directly into a vein (intravenously)\nOxygen\nSedatives\nSurgery or tube insertions to drain infected areas, if needed\nAntibiotics or other agents to treat viral or fungal infections\nThe pressure in the heart and lungs may be checked. This is called hemodynamic monitoring. This can only be done with special equipment and intensive care nursing.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSeptic shock has a high death rate. The death rate depends on the person's age and overall health, the cause of the infection, how many organs have failed, and how quickly and aggressively medical therapy is started.\nPossible Complications\nRespiratory failure,\ncardiac failure\n, or any other organ failure can occur."}

Gangrene may occur, possibly leading to amputation.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nGo directly to an emergency department if you develop symptoms of septic shock.\nPrevention\nPrompt treatment of bacterial infections is helpful. Vaccination could help prevent some infections. However, many cases of septic shock cannot be prevented. Take steps to prevent the possibility of infection, especially if you have a weakened immune system.\nAlternative Names\nBacteremic shock; Endotoxic shock; Septicemic shock; Warm shock\nReferences\nGordon AC, Russell JA.
