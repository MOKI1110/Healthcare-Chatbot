Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSurgery for pilonidal cyst\nSurgery for pilonidal cyst\nA pilonidal cyst is a pocket that forms around a hair follicle in the crease between the buttocks. The area may look like a small pit or pore in the skin that contains a dark spot or hair. Sometimes the cyst can become infected, and this is called a pilonidal\nabscess\n.\nDescription\nAn infected pilonidal cyst or abscess requires surgical drainage. It will not heal with antibiotic medicines alone. If you continue to have infections, the pilonidal cyst can be removed by surgery.\nThere are several types of surgery.\nIncision and drainage --\nThis is the most common treatment for an infected cyst. It is a simple procedure done in your health care provider's office.\nLocal anesthesia is used to numb the skin.\nA cut is made in the cyst to drain fluid and pus. The hole is packed with gauze and left open.\nAfterward, it can take up to 4 weeks for the cyst to heal."}

This procedure is done as an outpatient procedure, so you will not need to spend the night in the hospital.\nYou may be given medicine (\ngeneral anesthesia\n) that keeps you asleep and pain-free. Or, you may be given medicine (\nregional anesthesia\n) that numbs you from the waist down. In rare cases, you may only be given local numbing medicine.\nA cut is made to remove the skin with the pores and the underlying tissue with the hair follicles.\nDepending on how much tissue is removed, the area may or may not be packed with gauze. Sometimes a tube is placed to drain fluid that collects after surgery."}
