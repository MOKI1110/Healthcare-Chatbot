However, stress or a mental or physical trauma can trigger FND. It can also occur with no known trigger.\nCertain factors may make a person more susceptible to FND:\nHaving another neurological condition\nHaving a mental health condition\nChronic pain or fatigue\nOngoing life stress\nChildhood abuse, neglect, or trauma\nFND is uncommon in children under age 10.
