Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMarfan syndrome\nMarfan syndrome\nMarfan syndrome is a disorder of connective tissue. This is the tissue that strengthens the body's structures.\nDisorders of connective tissue affect the skeletal system, cardiovascular system, eyes, and skin.\nCauses\nMarfan syndrome is caused by variants in a gene called fibrillin-1. Fibrillin-1 plays an important role as the building block for connective tissue in the body.\nThe gene variant also causes the long bones of the body to grow too much. People with this syndrome have tall height and long arms and legs."}

People with this syndrome have tall height and long arms and legs. How this overgrowth happens is not well understood.\nOther areas of the body that are affected include:\nLung tissue (there may be a pneumothorax, in which air can escape from the lung into the chest cavity and collapse the lung)\nThe aorta, the main blood vessel that takes blood from the heart to the body may stretch or become weak (called aortic dilation or aortic aneurysm)\nThe heart valves\nThe eyes, causing cataracts and other problems (such as a dislocation of the lenses)\nThe skin\nTissue covering the spinal cord\nThe joints\nIn most cases, Marfan syndrome is passed down through families (inherited). However, up to 30% of people have no family history, which is called \"sporadic.\" In sporadic cases, the syndrome is believed to be caused by a new gene change.\nSymptoms\nPeople with Marfan syndrome are often tall with long, thin arms and legs and spider-like fingers (called arachnodactyly)."}
