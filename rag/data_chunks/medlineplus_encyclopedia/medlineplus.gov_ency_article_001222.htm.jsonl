Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBaker cyst\nBaker cyst\nBaker cyst is a buildup of joint fluid (synovial fluid) that forms a swelling behind the knee.\nCauses\nA Baker cyst is caused by swelling in the knee. The swelling occurs due to an increase in synovial fluid. This fluid lubricates the knee joint. When pressure builds up, fluid squeezes into the back of the knee.\nBaker cyst commonly occurs with:\nA tear in the meniscal cartilage of the knee\nCartilage injuries\nKnee arthritis (in older adults)\nRheumatoid arthritis\nOther knee problems that cause knee swelling and synovitis (inflammation of the joint)\nGout\nSymptoms\nIn most cases, a person may have no symptoms. A large cyst may cause some discomfort or stiffness. There may be a painless or painful\nswelling\nbehind the knee.\nThe cyst may feel like a water-filled balloon. Sometimes, the cyst may break open (rupture), causing pain, swelling, and bruising on the back of the knee and calf.\nIt is important to know whether pain or swelling is caused by a Baker cyst or a blood clot."}

A\nblood clot (deep venous thrombosis)\ncan also cause pain, swelling, and bruising on the back of the knee and calf. A blood clot may be dangerous and requires medical attention right away.\nExams and Tests\nDuring a physical exam, the health care provider will look for a soft lump in the back of the knee. If the cyst is small, comparing the affected knee to the normal knee can be helpful. There may be a decrease in range of motion caused by pain or by the size of the cyst. In some cases, there will be catching, locking, pain, or other signs and symptoms of a meniscal tear.\nShining a light through the cyst (transillumination) can show that the growth is fluid filled.\nX-rays will not show the cyst or a\nmeniscal tear\n, but they will show other problems that may be present, including arthritis.\nMRIs can help the provider see the cyst and look for any meniscal injury or other problems that caused the cyst.\nTreatment\nOften, no treatment is needed."}

The provider can watch the cyst over time.\nIf the cyst is painful, the goal of treatment is to correct the problem that is causing the cyst. Sometimes, a steroid injection to the knee can help reduce the swelling.\nSometimes, a cyst can be drained (\naspirated\n), however, the cyst often returns. In rare cases, it is removed with surgery if it becomes very large or causes symptoms. The cyst has a high chance of returning if the underlying cause is not addressed. The surgery may also damage nearby blood vessels and nerves.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nA Baker cyst will not cause any long-term harm, but it can be annoying and painful. The symptoms of Baker cysts often come and go.\nLong-term disability is rare. Most people improve with time or with surgery.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have swelling behind the knee that becomes large or painful. Pain could be a sign of infection."}
