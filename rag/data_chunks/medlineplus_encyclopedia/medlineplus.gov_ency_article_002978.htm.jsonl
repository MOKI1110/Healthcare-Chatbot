It is also called a tummy tuck. It can range from a simple mini-tummy tuck to more extensive surgery.\nAbdominal wall surgery is not the same as\nliposuction\n, which is another way to remove fat. But, abdominal wall surgery is sometimes combined with liposuction.\nDescription\nYour surgery will be done in an operating room in a hospital. You will receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n. This will keep you asleep and pain-free during the procedure. The surgery takes 2 to 6 hours. You can expect to stay in the hospital for 1 to 3 days after surgery.\nAfter you receive anesthesia, your surgeon will make a cut (incision) across your abdomen to open up the area. This cut will be just above your pubic area.\nYour surgeon will remove fatty tissue and loose skin from the middle and lower sections of your abdomen to make it firmer and flatter."}

This cut will be just above your pubic area.\nYour surgeon will remove fatty tissue and loose skin from the middle and lower sections of your abdomen to make it firmer and flatter. In extended surgeries, the surgeon also removes excess fat and skin (love handles) from the sides of the abdomen. Your abdominal muscles may be tightened also.\nMini abdominoplasty is performed when there are areas of fat pockets (love handles). It can be done with much smaller cuts.\nYour surgeon will close your cut with stitches. Small tubes called drains may be inserted to allow fluid to drain out of your cut. These will be removed later.\nA firm elastic dressing (bandage) will be placed over your abdomen. In some cases, an elastic band is placed over the dressing.\nFor less complicated surgery, your surgeon may use a medical device called an endoscope. Endoscopes are small cameras that are inserted into the skin through very small cuts. They are connected to a video monitor in the operating room that allows the surgeon to see the area being worked on. Your surgeon will remove excess fat with other small tools that are inserted through other small cuts."}

It is not usually needed for health reasons. Cosmetic abdomen repair can help improve appearance, particularly after a lot of weight gain or loss. It helps flatten the lower abdomen and tighten stretched skin.\nIt may also help relieve skin rashes or infections that develop under large flaps of skin.\nAbdominoplasty can be helpful when:\nDiet and exercise have not helped improve muscle tone, such as in women who have had more than one pregnancy.\nSkin and muscle cannot regain its normal tone. This can be a problem for very overweight people who lost a lot of weight.\nThis procedure is a major surgery."}

Ask your provider for help quitting smoking.\nIf needed,\nprepare your home\nto make it easier to recover after surgery.\nAsk your surgeon if you need to arrange to have someone drive you home after your surgery.\nDuring the week before your surgery:\nYou may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\nLet your surgeon know about any illness you may have before your surgery. This includes\nCOVID-19\n,\ncold\n,\nflu\n,\nfever\n, herpes breakout, or other illness."}

Your surgeon will prescribe\npain medicine\nto help you manage your pain. It may help to rest with your legs and hips bent during recovery to reduce pressure on your abdomen.\nWearing an elastic support similar to a girdle for 2 to 3 weeks will provide extra support while you heal. You should avoid strenuous activity and anything that makes you strain for 4 to 6 weeks. You will probably be able to return to work in 2 to 4 weeks.\nYour scars will become flatter and lighter in color over the next year. Do not expose the area to sun, because it can worsen the scar and darken the color."}
