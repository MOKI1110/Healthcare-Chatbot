It uses a radioactive substance called a tracer to look for disease or injury in the brain.\nA PET scan shows how the brain and its tissues are working. Other imaging tests, such as magnetic resonance imaging (\nMRI\n) and computed tomography (\nCT\n) scans only reveal the structure of the brain and its surrounding tissues.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA PET scan requires a small amount of radioactive material (tracer). This tracer is given through a vein (IV), usually on the inside of your elbow. Or, you breathe in the radioactive material as a gas.\nThe tracer travels through your blood and collects in organs and tissues. The tracer helps your health care provider to see certain areas or diseases more clearly.\nYou wait nearby as the tracer is absorbed by your body. This usually takes about 1 hour.\nThen, you lie on a narrow table, which slides into a large tunnel-shaped scanner. The PET scanner detects signals from the tracer."}

This usually takes about 1 hour.\nThen, you lie on a narrow table, which slides into a large tunnel-shaped scanner. The PET scanner detects signals from the tracer. A computer changes the results into 3-D pictures. The images are displayed on a monitor for your provider to read.\nYou must lie still during the test so that the machine can produce clear images of your brain. You may be asked to read or name letters if your memory is being tested.\nThe test takes between 30 minutes and 2 hours.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked not to eat anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan. You will be able to drink water.\nTell your provider if:\nYou are afraid of close spaces (have claustrophobia). You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious.\nYou are pregnant or think you might be pregnant.\nYou have any allergies to injected dye (contrast).\nYou have taken insulin for diabetes. You will need special preparation.\nAlways tell your provider about the medicines you are taking, including those bought without a prescription."}

You will need special preparation.\nAlways tell your provider about the medicines you are taking, including those bought without a prescription. Sometimes, medicines interfere with the test results.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel a sharp sting when the needle containing the tracer is placed into your vein.\nA PET scan causes no pain. The table may be hard or cold, but you can request a blanket or pillow.\nAn intercom in the room allows you to speak to someone at any time.\nThere is no recovery time unless you were given a medicine to relax.\nAfter the test, drink a lot of fluids to flush the tracer out of your body.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA PET scan can show the size, shape, and function of the brain, so your provider can make sure it is working as well as it should."}

It is most often used when other tests, such as MRI scan or CT scan, do not provide enough information.\nThis test can be used to:\nDiagnose a\nbrain tumor\nor monitor the effect of treatment on a brain tumor.\nLocate the source of seizures and prepare for\nepilepsy\nsurgery.\nHelp diagnose\ndementia\nsuch as\nAlzheimer disease\nif other tests and exams do not provide enough information.\nTell the difference between\nParkinson disease\nfrom other movement disorders. It also helps to predict the long-term outcome of Parkinson disease.\nHelp explain why someone is in a coma.\nSeveral PET scans may be taken to determine how well you are responding to treatment for cancer or another illness.\nNormal Results\nThere are no problems detected in the size, shape, or function of the brain."}

It is about the same amount of radiation as in most CT scans. Also, the radiation does not last for long in your body.\nWomen who are pregnant or are breastfeeding should let their provider know before having this test. Infants and babies developing in the womb are more sensitive to the effects of radiation because their organs are still growing.\nIt is possible, though very unlikely, to have an allergic reaction to the radioactive substance."}
