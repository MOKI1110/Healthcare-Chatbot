Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRenal pelvis or ureter cancer\nRenal pelvis or ureter cancer\nCancer of the renal pelvis or ureter is cancer that forms in the renal pelvis (center of the kidney) or ureter (tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder).\nCauses\nCancer can grow in the urine collection system (renal pelvis and ureter), but it is uncommon. Renal pelvis and ureter cancers affect men more often than women. These cancers are more common in people older than 65.\nThe exact causes of this cancer are not known. Long-term (chronic) irritation of the kidney from harmful substances removed in the urine may be a factor."}

This irritation may be caused by:\nKidney damage from medicines, especially ones for pain (\nanalgesic nephropathy\n)\nExposure to certain dyes and chemicals used to manufacture leather goods, textiles, plastics, and rubber\nSmoking\nPeople who have had bladder cancer are also at risk.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nConstant back pain\nBlood in the urine\nBurning, pain, or\ndiscomfort with urination\nFatigue\nFlank pain\nUnexplained\nweight loss\n\nLoss of appetite\nAnemia\nUrinary frequency or urgency\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam, and examine your belly area (abdomen)."}

This may include removing part of the bladder and tissues around it, or the lymph nodes.\nUreter resection -- Surgery to remove part of the ureter that contains cancer, and some healthy tissue around it. This may be used in case of superficial tumors present in the lower part of the ureter near the bladder. This may help to preserve the kidney.\nChemotherapy\n-- This is used when the cancer has spread outside of the kidney or ureter. Because these tumors are similar to a form of bladder cancer, they are treated with a similar type of chemotherapy.\nImmunotherapy -- This is used when the cancer has spread outside of the kidney or ureter. Because these tumors are similar to a form of bladder cancer, they are treated with a similar type of immunotherapy.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a cancer\nsupport group\n."}

Cancer that is only in the kidney or ureter  may be cured with surgery.\nCancer that has spread to other organs is usually not curable.\nPossible Complications\nComplications from this cancer may include:\nKidney failure\nLocal spread of the tumor with increasing pain\nSpread of the cancer to lung, liver, and bone\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have any of the symptoms listed above.\nPrevention\nMeasures that may help prevent this cancer include:\nFollow your provider's advice regarding medicines, including over-the-counter pain medicine.\nStop smoking.\nWear protective equipment if you are likely to be exposed to substances that are toxic to the kidneys.\nAlternative Names\nTransitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis or ureter; Kidney cancer - renal pelvis; Ureter"}
