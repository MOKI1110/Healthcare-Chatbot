Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nChronic cholecystitis\nChronic cholecystitis\nChronic cholecystitis is swelling and irritation of the gallbladder that continues over time.\nThe gallbladder is a sac located under the liver. It stores bile that is made in the liver.\nBile helps with the digestion of fats in the small intestine.\nCauses\nMost of the time, chronic cholecystitis is caused by repeated attacks of acute (sudden) cholecystitis. Most of these attacks are caused by gallstones in the gallbladder.\nThese attacks cause the walls of the gallbladder to thicken. The gallbladder begins to shrink. Over time, the gallbladder is less able to concentrate, store, and release bile.\nThe disease occurs more often in women than in men. It is more common after age 40. Birth control pills and pregnancy are factors that increase the risk for gallstones.\nSymptoms\nAcute cholecystitis\nis a painful condition that may lead to chronic cholecystitis."}

Surgery to remove the gallbladder is called cholecystectomy.\nLaparoscopic cholecystectomy is most often done. This surgery uses smaller surgical cuts, which results in a faster recovery. Many people are able to go home from the hospital on the same day as surgery, or the next morning.\nOpen cholecystectomy requires a larger cut in the upper-right part of the abdomen.\nIf you are too ill to have surgery because of other diseases or conditions, the gallstones may be dissolved with medicine you take by mouth. However, this may take 2 years or longer to work. The stones may return after treatment.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nCholecystectomy is a common procedure with a low risk.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nCancer\nof the gallbladder (rarely).  Sometimes cancer is found in a gallbladder that has been removed.\nJaundice.\nPancreatitis.\nWorsening of the condition.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of cholecystitis.\nPrevention\nThe condition is not always preventable.
