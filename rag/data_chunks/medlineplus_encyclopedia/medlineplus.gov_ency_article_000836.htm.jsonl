It most often appears in young women with brownish skin tone, but it can affect anyone.\nMelasma is often associated with the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. It is common in:\nPregnant women\nWomen taking birth control pills (\noral contraceptives\n)\nWomen who are taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) during menopause.\nBeing in the sun makes melasma more likely to develop. The problem is more common in tropical climates.\nSymptoms\nThe only symptom of melasma is a change in skin color. However, this color change can cause distress about your appearance.\nThe skin color changes are most often an even brown color. They often appear on the cheeks, forehead, nose, or upper lip. Dark patches are often symmetrical.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will look at your skin to diagnose the problem."}
