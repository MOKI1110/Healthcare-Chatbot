Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEndometrial biopsy\nEndometrial biopsy\nEndometrial\nbiopsy\nis the removal of a small piece of tissue from the lining of the uterus (endometrium) for examination.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis procedure may be done with or without anesthesia. This is medicine that allows you to sleep during the procedure.\nYou lie on your back with your feet in stirrups, similar to having a pelvic exam.\nYour health care provider gently inserts an instrument (speculum) into the vagina to hold it open so that your\ncervix\ncan be viewed. The cervix is cleaned with a special liquid. Numbing medicine may be applied to the cervix.\nThe cervix may then be gently grasped with an instrument to hold the uterus steady. Another instrument may be needed to gently stretch the cervical opening if there is tightness.\nAn instrument is gently passed through the cervix into the uterus to collect the tissue sample.\nThe tissue sample and instruments are removed.\nThe tissue is sent to a lab."}

There, it is examined under a microscope.\nIf you had anesthesia for the procedure, you are taken to a recovery area. Nurses will make sure you are comfortable. After you wake up and have no problems from the anesthesia and procedure, you are allowed to go home.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nBefore the test:\nTell your provider about all the medicines you take. These include blood thinners such as warfarin, clopidogrel, and aspirin.\nYou may be asked to have a test to make sure you are not pregnant.\nIn the 2 days before the procedure, do not use creams or other medicines in the vagina.\nDo NOT douche. (You should never douche. Douching can cause infection of the vagina or uterus.)\nAsk your provider if you should take pain medicine, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, just before the procedure.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe instruments may feel cold. You may feel some cramping when the cervix is grasped."}
