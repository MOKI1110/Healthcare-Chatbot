It is also used to measure how well glaucoma treatment is working.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThere are three main methods of measuring eye pressure.\nThe most accurate method measures the force needed to flatten an area of the cornea.\nThe surface of the eye is numbed with eye drops. A fine strip of paper stained with orange dye is held to the side of the eye. The dye stains the front of the eye to help with the exam. Sometimes the dye is in the numbing drops.\nYou will rest your chin and forehead on the support of a\nslit lamp\nso that your head is steady. You will be asked to keep your eyes open and to look straight ahead. The lamp is moved forward until the tip of the tonometer just touches the cornea.\nBlue light is used so that the orange dye will glow green."}

The lamp is moved forward until the tip of the tonometer just touches the cornea.\nBlue light is used so that the orange dye will glow green. The health care provider looks through the eyepiece on the slit-lamp and adjusts a dial on the machine to give the pressure reading.\nThere is no discomfort with the test.\nA second method uses a handheld device shaped like a pen. You are given numbing eye drops to prevent any discomfort. The device touches the surface of the cornea and instantly records eye pressure.\nThe last method is the noncontact method (air puff). In this method, your chin rests on a device similar to a slit lamp.\nYou stare straight into the examining device. When you are at the correct distance from the device, a tiny beam of light reflects off of your cornea onto a detector.\nWhen the test is performed, a puff of air will slightly flatten the cornea; how much it flattens depends on the eye pressure.\nThis causes the tiny beam of light to move to a different spot on the detector."}

The instrument calculates eye pressure by looking at how far the beam of light moved.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nRemove contact lenses before the exam. The dye can permanently stain contact lenses.\nTell your provider if you have a history of\ncorneal ulcers or eye infections\n, or a history of glaucoma in your family. Always tell your provider what medicines you are taking.\nHow the Test will Feel\nIf numbing eye drops were used, you should not have any pain. In the noncontact method, you may feel mild pressure on your eye for a brief moment from the air puff.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nTonometry is a test to measure the pressure inside your eyes. The test is used to screen for glaucoma and to measure how well glaucoma treatment is working.\nPeople over age 40 years, particularly African Americans, have the highest risk for developing glaucoma. Regular eye exams can help detect glaucoma early."}

Regular eye exams can help detect glaucoma early. If it is detected early, glaucoma can be treated before too much damage is done.\nThe test may also be done before and after eye surgery.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means your eye pressure is within the normal range. The normal eye pressure range is 10  to 21 mm Hg.\nThe thickness of your cornea can affect measurements. Normal eyes with thick corneas have higher readings, and normal eyes with thin corneas have lower readings."}

Normal eyes with thick corneas have higher readings, and normal eyes with thin corneas have lower readings. A thin cornea with a high reading may be very abnormal (the actual eye pressure will be higher than shown on the tonometer).\nA corneal thickness measurement (pachymetry) is needed to get a correct pressure measurement.\nTalk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be due to:\nGlaucoma\nHyphema\n(blood in the front chamber of the eye)\nInflammation in the eye\nInjury to the eye or head\nRecent eye surgery\nRisks\nIf the applanation method is used, there is a small chance the cornea may be scratched (\ncorneal abrasion\n). The scratch will normally heal within a few days.\nAlternative Names\nIntraocular pressure (IOP) measurement; Glaucoma test; Goldmann applanation tonometry (GAT)\nImages\nEye\nApplanation tonometry\nReferences\nChen S, Lee BD, Al-Aswad LA.
