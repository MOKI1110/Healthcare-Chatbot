They are located on each side of your neck. You can feel their pulse under your jawline.\nCauses\nCarotid artery disease occurs when fatty material called plaque builds up inside the arteries. This buildup of plaque is called hardening of the arteries (\natherosclerosis\n).\nThe plaque may slowly block or narrow the carotid artery. Or it may cause a clot to form suddenly."}

Your provider may use a stethoscope to listen to the blood flow in your neck for an unusual sound called a bruit. This sound may be a sign of carotid artery disease.\nYour provider also may find clots in the blood vessels of your eye."}

This occurs when a blot clot briefly blocks a blood vessel to the brain. It causes the same symptoms as stroke. Symptoms last only a few minutes to an hour or two, but no longer than 24 hours. A TIA does not cause lasting damage. TIAs are a warning sign that a stroke may happen in the future if nothing is done to prevent it.\nStroke."}

A TIA does not cause lasting damage. TIAs are a warning sign that a stroke may happen in the future if nothing is done to prevent it.\nStroke. When the blood supply to the brain is partly or completely blocked, it causes a stroke. Most often, this happens when a blood clot blocks a blood vessel to the brain. A stroke can also occur when a blood vessel breaks open or leaks. Strokes can cause long-term brain damage or death.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nGo to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) as soon as symptoms occur. The sooner you receive treatment, the better your chance for recovery. With a stroke, every second of delay can cause more brain injury.\nPrevention\nHere's what you can do to help prevent carotid artery disease and stroke:\nQuit smoking.\nFollow a healthy, low-fat diet with plenty of fresh vegetables and fruits.\nDo not drink more than 1 to 2 alcoholic drinks a day.\nDo not use recreational drugs.\nExercise at least 30 minutes a day, most days of the week.\nGet your cholesterol checked every 5 years."}
