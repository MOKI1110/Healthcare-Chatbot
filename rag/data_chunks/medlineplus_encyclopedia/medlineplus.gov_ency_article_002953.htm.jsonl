Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAngioplasty and stent placement - carotid artery\nAngioplasty and stent placement - carotid artery\nThe blood vessels that bring blood to your brain and face are called the carotid arteries. You have a carotid artery on each side of your neck.\nThe blood flow in this artery can become partly or totally blocked by fatty material called plaque. A partial blockage is called carotid artery stenosis (narrowing). A blockage in your carotid artery can reduce the blood supply to your brain. Sometimes part of a plaque can break off, travel downstream and block a brain artery. A\nstroke\ncan occur if your brain does not get enough blood.\nTwo procedures can be used to treat a carotid artery that is narrowed or blocked. These are:\nSurgery to remove plaque buildup (\nendarterectomy\n)\nCarotid artery angioplasty with stent placement\nDescription\nCarotid artery angioplasty and stenting (CAS) is done using a small surgical cut.\nYour health care provider will make a surgical cut in your groin after using some numbing medicine."}

You will also be given medicine to relax you.\nThe provider places a catheter (a flexible tube) through the cut into an artery. It is carefully moved up to your neck to the blockage in your carotid artery. Moving x-ray pictures (fluoroscopy) are used to see the artery and guide the catheter to the correct position.\nNext, the provider will move a wire through the catheter to the blockage. Another catheter with a very small balloon on the end will be pushed over this wire and into the blockage. Then the balloon is inflated.\nThe balloon presses against the inside wall of your artery. This opens the artery and allows more blood to flow to your brain. A stent (a wire mesh tube) may also be placed in the blocked area. The stent is inserted at the same time as the balloon catheter. It expands with the balloon."}

The stent is left in place to help keep the artery open.\nThe provider then removes the balloon and catheters.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nCarotid artery surgery (endarterectomy) is a well-established and effective way to treat narrowed or blocked arteries. This procedure is very safe.\nCAS has developed as a good alternative to surgery in some cases, when done by experienced providers. Certain factors may favor stenting, such as:\nThe person is too ill to have carotid endarterectomy.\nThe location of the narrowing in the carotid artery makes surgery harder.\nThe person has had neck or carotid surgery in the past.\nThe person has had radiation to the neck.\nRisks\nRisks of CAS, which depend on factors such as age, are:\nAllergic reaction to dye\nBlood clots\nor bleeding at the site of surgery\nBrain damage\nClogging of the inside of the stent (in-stent restenosis)\nHeart attack\nKidney failure (higher risk in people who already have kidney problems)\nMore blockage of the carotid artery over time\nSe"}
