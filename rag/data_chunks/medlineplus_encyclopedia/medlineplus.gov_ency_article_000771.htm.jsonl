Both are due to brain damage caused by a lack of vitamin B1.\nLack of vitamin B1 is common in people who have\nalcohol use disorder\n. It is also common in people whose bodies do not absorb food properly (\nmalabsorption\n). This can sometimes occur with a chronic illness or after weight-loss (bariatric) surgery.\nKorsakoff syndrome, or Korsakoff psychosis, tends to develop as Wernicke encephalopathy as symptoms go away. Wernicke encephalopathy causes brain damage in lower parts of the brain called the thalamus and hypothalamus."}

Usually a brain MRI exam is not needed.\nTreatment\nThe goals of treatment are to control symptoms and to prevent the disorder from getting worse. Some people may need to stay in the hospital early in the condition to help control symptoms.\nMonitoring and special care may be needed if the person is:\nIn a coma\nLethargic\nUnconscious\nVitamin B1 is usually given by injection into a vein or a muscle as soon as possible. This may improve symptoms of:\nConfusion\nor\ndelirium\nDifficulties with vision and eye movement\nLack of muscle coordination\nVitamin B1 often does not improve loss of memory and intellect that occur with Korsakoff syndrome.\nStopping alcohol use can prevent more loss of brain function and damage to nerves. A well-balanced, nourishing diet can help, but it is not a substitute for stopping alcohol use.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWithout treatment, Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome gets steadily worse, and can be life threatening."}
