It occurs when internal organs or the abdominal lining bulges through the muscles near the belly button.\nCauses\nIn the womb, the umbilical cord is attached to the baby through an opening in the baby's abdomen. After birth, this opening normally closes. When this area doesn't close completely, it leaves a weak spot in the abdomen, which can lead to a hernia. Hernias may be seen after birth or later in life.\nUmbilical hernias are common in infants. They occur slightly more often in African Americans. Most umbilical hernias are not related to disease. Some umbilical hernias are linked with rare conditions such as\nDown syndrome\n.\nSymptoms\nA hernia can vary in width from less than 1 centimeter (cm) to more than 5 cm (about 1/2 to 2 inches).\nThere is a soft swelling over the belly button that often bulges when the baby sits up, cries, or strains. The bulge may be flat when the infant lies on the back and is quiet."}

The bulge may be flat when the infant lies on the back and is quiet. Umbilical hernias are usually painless.\nExams and Tests\nA hernia is usually found by the health care provider during a physical exam.\nTreatment\nMost hernias in children heal on their own.\nSurgery\nto repair the hernia is needed only in the following cases:\nThe hernia does not heal after the child is 3 or 4 years old.\nThe intestine or other tissue bulges out and loses its blood supply (becomes strangulated). This is an emergency that needs surgery right away.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost umbilical hernias get better without treatment by the time the child is 3 to 4 years old. If surgery is needed, it is usually successful.\nPossible Complications\nStrangulation of the intestines can occur."}
