There are three main types of lung disease:\nAirway diseases -- These diseases affect the tubes (airways) that carry oxygen and other gases into and out of the lungs. They usually cause a narrowing or blockage of the airways. Airway diseases include\nasthma\n,\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n(COPD),\nbronchiolitis\n, and\nbronchiectasis\n(which also is the main disorder for persons with cystic fibrosis). People with airway diseases often say they feel as if they're \"trying to breathe out through a straw.\"\nLung tissue diseases -- These diseases affect the structure of the lung tissue. Scarring or inflammation of the tissue makes the lungs unable to expand fully (restrictive lung disease). This makes it hard for the lungs to take in oxygen and release carbon dioxide."}

They are caused by clotting, scarring, or inflammation of the blood vessels. They affect the ability of the lungs to take up oxygen and release carbon dioxide. These diseases may also affect heart function. An example of a lung circulation disease is\npulmonary hypertension\n."}
