Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFactor VIII assay\nFactor VIII assay\nThe factor VIII assay is a blood test to measure the activity of factor VIII. This is one of the proteins in the body that helps the blood clot.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is used to find the cause of too much bleeding (decreased blood clotting). Or, it may be ordered if a family member is known to have\nhemophilia A\n. The test may also be done to see how well treatment for hemophilia A is working.\nNormal Results\nA normal value is 50% to 200% of the lab control or reference value.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples."}

Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nDecreased factor VIII activity may be due to:\nHemophilia A (a bleeding disorder caused by a lack of blood clotting factor VIII)\nDisorder in which the proteins that regulate blood clotting become overactive\ndisseminated intravascular coagulation\n(DIC)\nPresence of a Factor VIII inhibitor (antibody)  that can develop due to an autoimmune condition or as a result of hemophilia A treatment\nVon Willebrand disease\n(another type of bleeding disorder)\nIncreased activity may be due to:\nOlder age\nDiabetes\nLiver disease\nInflammation\nPregnancy\nObesity\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other."}
