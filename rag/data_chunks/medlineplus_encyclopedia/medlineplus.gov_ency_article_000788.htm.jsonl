A prion causes normal proteins to fold abnormally. This affects other proteins' ability to function.\nCJD is very rare. There are several types. The classic types of CJD are:\nSporadic CJD\nmakes up most cases. It occurs for no known reason. It starts on average at age 65 years.\nFamilial CJD\noccurs when a person inherits the abnormal prion from a parent (this form of CJD is rare).\nAcquired CJD\nincludes variant CJD (vCJD), the form related to mad cow disease.\nVariant CJD is caused by eating infected meat. The infection that causes the disease in cows is thought to be the same one that causes vCJD in humans.\nVariant CJD causes less than 1% of all CJD cases. It tends to affect younger people. Fewer than 200 people worldwide have had this disease."}

It tends to affect younger people. Fewer than 200 people worldwide have had this disease. Almost all cases occurred in England and France.\nIatrogenic CJD is also an acquired form of the disease. Iatrogenic CJD is sometimes passed through a blood product transfusion, transplant, or contaminated surgical instruments.\nCJD may be related to several other diseases caused by prions, including:\nChronic wasting disease (found in deer)\nKuru\n(affected mostly women in New Guinea who ate the brains of dead relatives as part of a funeral ritual)\nScrapie (found in sheep)\nOther very rare inherited human diseases, such as Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker disease and fatal familial insomnia\nSymptoms\nCJD symptoms may include any of the following:\nDementia\nthat gets worse quickly over a few weeks or months\nBlurred vision (sometimes)\nChanges in gait\n(walking)\nConfusion\n, disorientation\nHallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't there)\nLack of coordination (for example, stumbling and falling)\nMuscle stiffness, twitching\nFeeling nervous, jumpy\nPersonality changes\nSleepiness\nSudden jerky"}

Later in the disease, a motor system exam (to test muscle reflexes, strength, coordination, and other physical functions) may show:\nAbnormal reflexes or increased normal reflex responses\nIncrease in muscle tone\nMuscle twitching and spasms\nStrong startle response\nWeakness and loss of muscle tissue (\nmuscle wasting\n)\nLoss of coordination occurs due to changes in the cerebellum."}

Today, it is very rare for a brain biopsy to be done to look for this disease.\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for this condition. Different medicines have been tried to slow the disease, but none works well.\nThe goals of treatment include:\nProvide a safe environment\nControl aggressive or agitated behavior\nMake the person comfortable\nMeet the person's needs\nThis may require monitoring and assistance in the home or in a care facility."}

Family counseling may help the family cope with the changes needed for home care.\nPeople with this condition may need help controlling unacceptable or dangerous behaviors. This involves rewarding positive behaviors and ignoring negative behaviors (when it is safe). They may also need help getting oriented to their surroundings. Sometimes, medicines are needed to help control aggression.\nIt is helpful for people with CJD and their family to seek legal advice early on.\nAdvance directive\n, power of attorney, and other legal actions can make it easier to make decisions about the care of the person with CJD.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome of CJD is very poor. People with sporadic CJD are unable to care for themselves within 6 months or less after symptoms begin.\nThe disorder is fatal in a short time, usually within 8 months. People who have variant CJD get worse more slowly, but the condition is still fatal. A few people survive for as long as 1 or 2 years."}

However, early diagnosis and treatment may make the symptoms easier to control, give patients time to make advance directives and prepare for the end of life, and give families extra time to come to terms with the condition.\nPrevention\nMedical equipment that may be contaminated should be removed from service and disposed of."}
