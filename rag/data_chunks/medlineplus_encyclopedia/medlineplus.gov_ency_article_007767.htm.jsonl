Infection with these viruses generally causes mild to moderate respiratory illnesses, such as the common cold. Some coronaviruses cause severe illness that can lead to pneumonia, and even death.\nCauses\nThere are many different coronaviruses. They affect both humans and animals. Common human coronaviruses cause mild to moderate illnesses, such as the\ncommon cold\n.\nSome animal coronaviruses evolve (mutate) and can be passed from animals to humans. They may then spread through person-to-person contact. The coronaviruses that spread from animals to humans can sometimes cause more severe illness:\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)\nis a serious form of\npneumonia\n. It is caused by the SARS-CoV coronavirus. No cases in humans have been reported since 2004.\nMiddle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)\nis a severe respiratory illness. MERS is caused by the MERS-CoV coronavirus. About 30% of people who have gotten this illness have died. Some people only have mild symptoms."}

MERS is caused by the MERS-CoV coronavirus. About 30% of people who have gotten this illness have died. Some people only have mild symptoms. MERS continues to cause illness in humans, mainly in the Arabian Peninsula.\nCOVID-19\ncan be a respiratory illness that causes cold or flu-like symptoms, but it can also affect other parts of your body. It is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2). COVID-19 can be a mild to serious illness and even fatal. COVID-19 is a serious public health threat globally and in the United States.\nMany coronaviruses originate in bats, which can then infect other animals. SARS-CoV spreads from civet cats, while MERS-CoV spreads from camels. The latest virus, SARS-CoV-2, is also suspected to have originated from animals. It is from the same family of viruses as SARS-CoV, which is why they have similar names. There are many other coronaviruses circulating in animals, but they haven't spread to humans.\nOnce a person has been infected by a coronavirus, the infection can spread to a healthy person (person-to-person transmission)."}
