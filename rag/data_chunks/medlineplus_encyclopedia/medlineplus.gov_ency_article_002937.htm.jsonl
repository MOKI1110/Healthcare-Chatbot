Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFeeding tube insertion - gastrostomy\nFeeding tube insertion - gastrostomy\nA gastrostomy feeding tube (G-tube) insertion is the placement of a feeding tube through the skin and the stomach wall. It goes directly into the stomach.\nDescription\nGastrostomy feeding tube insertion is done in part using a procedure called\nendoscopy\n. This is a way of looking inside the body using a flexible tube with a small camera on the end of it. The endoscope is inserted through the mouth and down the esophagus, which leads to the stomach.\nAfter the endoscopy tube is inserted into the stomach, the skin over the left side of the belly (abdomen) area is cleaned and numbed. Your surgeon makes a small surgical cut in this area. The G-tube is inserted through this cut into the stomach. The tube is small, flexible, and hollow. Your surgeon uses stitches to close the stomach around the tube.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nGastrostomy feeding tubes are put in for different reasons. They may be needed for a short time or permanently."}
