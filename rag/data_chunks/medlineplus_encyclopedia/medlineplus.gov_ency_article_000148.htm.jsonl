Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCystic hygroma\nCystic hygroma\nA cystic hygroma is a growth that often occurs in the head and neck area. It is a birth defect.\nCauses\nA cystic hygroma occurs as the baby grows in the womb. It forms from pieces of material that carry fluid and white blood cells. This material is called embryonic\nlymphatic tissue\n.\nAfter birth, a cystic hygroma most often looks like a soft bulge under the skin. The cyst may not be found at birth. It typically grows as the child grows. Sometimes it is not noticed until the child is older.\nSymptoms\nA common symptom is a neck growth. It may be found at birth, or discovered later in an infant after an upper respiratory tract infection (such as a cold).\nExams and Tests\nSometimes, a cystic hygroma is seen using a\npregnancy ultrasound\nwhen the baby is still in the womb."}

This can mean that the baby has a\nchromosomal\nproblem or other birth defects.\nThe following tests may be done:\nChest x-ray\nUltrasound\nCT scan\nMRI scan\nIf the condition is detected during a pregnancy ultrasound, other ultrasound tests or amniocentesis may be recommended.\nTreatment\nTreatment involves removing all of the abnormal tissue. However, cystic hygromas can often grow, making it impossible to remove all of the tissue.\nOther treatments have been tried with only limited success. These include:\nChemotherapy medicines\nInjection of sclerosing medicines into the cystic hygroma\nRadiation therapy\nSteroids\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook is good if surgery can totally remove the abnormal tissue."}

In cases where complete removal is not possible, the cystic hygroma commonly returns.\nThe long-term outcome may also depend on what other chromosomal abnormalities or birth defects, if any, are present.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nBleeding\nDamage to structures in the neck caused by surgery\nInfection\nReturn of the cystic hygroma\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIf you notice a lump in your neck or your child's neck, contact your health care provider.\nAlternative Names\nLymphangioma; Lymphatic malformation\nReferences\nBell EB, Nugent A, El-Deiry MW.
