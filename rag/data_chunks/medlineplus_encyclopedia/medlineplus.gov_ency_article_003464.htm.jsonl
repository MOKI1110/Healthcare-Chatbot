It is made primarily in the pancreas and the glands that make saliva, and can be found at low levels in other parts of the body. When the pancreas is diseased or inflamed, it releases increased amounts of amylase into the blood.\nA test can be done to measure the level of this enzyme in your blood.\nAmylase may also be measured with a\nurine amylase test\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis taken from a vein.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed. However, you should avoid alcohol before the test. Your health care provider may ask you to stop taking medicines that may affect the test."}

Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is most often used to diagnose or monitor\nacute pancreatitis\n. It may also detect some digestive tract problems  or salivary gland inflammation.\nThe test may also be done for the following conditions:\nChronic pancreatitis\nPancreatic pseudocyst\nNormal Results\nThe normal range is 40 to 140 units per liter (U/L)  or 0.67 to 2.34 micro-katal/liter ( µkat/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some laboratories use different measurement methods."}
