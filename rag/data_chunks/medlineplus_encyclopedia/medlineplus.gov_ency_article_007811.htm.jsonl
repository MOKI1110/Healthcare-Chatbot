LDL is a type of fat (lipid) in your blood.\nLDL is called \"bad\" cholesterol because it can\nbuild up and form fatty deposits\n(plaques) in the walls of your arteries.\nThe LDL test is often done as part of a\nlipid profile\n, which measures other fats in your blood:\nTotal cholesterol\nHDL cholesterol\nTriglycerides\nVery low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (\nVLDL cholesterol\n)\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed."}
