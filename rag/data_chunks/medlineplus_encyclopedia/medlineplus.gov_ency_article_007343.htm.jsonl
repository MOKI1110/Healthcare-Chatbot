Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHeart PET scan\nHeart PET scan\nA heart positron emission tomography (PET) scan is an imaging test that uses a radioactive substance called a tracer to look for disease or poor blood flow in the heart.\nUnlike\nmagnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) and\ncomputed tomography\n(CT), which reveal the structure of organs and blood flow to and from them, a PET scan gives more information about how organs and tissues are working.\nA heart PET scan can detect whether areas of your heart muscle are receiving enough blood, if there is heart damage or scar tissue in the heart, or if there is a buildup of abnormal substances in the heart muscle.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA PET scan requires a small amount of radioactive material (tracer).\nThis tracer is given through a vein (IV), most often on the inside of your elbow.\nIt travels through your blood and collects in organs and tissues, including your heart.\nThe tracer helps the radiologist see certain areas or diseases more clearly.\nYou will need to wait nearby as the tracer is absorbed by your body."}

This takes about 1 hour in most cases.\nThen, you will lie on a narrow table, which slides into a large tunnel-shaped scanner.\nElectrodes for an electrocardiogram (\nECG\n) will be placed on your chest. The PET scanner detects signals from the tracer.\nA computer changes the results into 3-D pictures.\nThe images are displayed on a monitor for the radiologist to read.\nYou must lie still during the PET scan so that the machine can produce clear images of your heart.\nSometimes, the test is done in conjunction with stress testing (exercise or pharmacologic stress).\nThe test takes about 90 minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked not to eat anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan. You will be able to drink water. Sometimes you may be given a special diet before the test.\nTell your health care provider if:\nYou are afraid of close spaces (have claustrophobia)."}

You will need special preparation for the test.\nAlways tell your provider about the medicines you are taking, including those bought without a prescription.

You also did not have symptoms or changes in blood pressure or your ECG that caused concern.\nThere are no problems detected in the size, shape, or function of the heart. There are no areas in which the radiotracer has abnormally collected.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be due to:\nCoronary artery disease\nHeart failure\nor\ncardiomyopathy\nRisks\nThe amount of radiation used in a PET scan is low. It is about the same amount of radiation as in most CT scans. Also, the radiation does not last for very long in your body.\nWomen who are pregnant or are breastfeeding should let their provider know before having this test. Infants and babies developing in the womb are more sensitive to the effects of radiation because their organs are still growing.\nIt is possible, although very unlikely, to have an allergic reaction to the radioactive substance. Some people have pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site.\nConsiderations\nIt is possible to have false results on a PET scan."}
