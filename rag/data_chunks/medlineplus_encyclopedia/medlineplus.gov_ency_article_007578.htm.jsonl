This can cause bruising of the brain (cerebral contusion), swelling, pressure, and bleeding in the brain. The large veins along the outside of the brain may tear, leading to further bleeding, swelling, and increased pressure. This can easily cause permanent brain damage or death.\nShaking an infant or small child may cause other injuries, such as damage to the neck, spine, and eyes.\nCauses\nMost cases are due to an angry parent or caregiver shaking the baby to punish or quiet it. Such shaking most often takes place when the infant is crying inconsolably and the frustrated caregiver loses control."}

Such shaking most often takes place when the infant is crying inconsolably and the frustrated caregiver loses control. Many times the caregiver did not intend to harm the baby. Still, it is a form of\nchild abuse\n.\nInjuries are most likely to happen when the baby is shaken and then the baby's head hits something. Even hitting a soft object, such as a mattress or pillow, may be enough to injure newborns and small infants. Children's brains are softer, their neck muscles and ligaments are weak, and their heads are large and heavy in proportion to their bodies. The result is a type of\nwhiplash\n, similar to what occurs in some auto accidents.\nShaken baby syndrome does not result from gentle bouncing, playful swinging or tossing the child in the air, or jogging with the child. It also is very unlikely to occur from accidents such as falling off chairs or down stairs, or accidentally being dropped from a caregiver's arms. Short falls may cause other types of head injuries, although these are often minor.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms can vary, ranging from mild to severe."}

In some cases, the condition can be difficult to diagnose and may not be found during an office visit. However, rib fractures are common and can be seen on x-rays.\nAn eye exam may find bleeding behind the baby's eye or\nretinal detachment\n. There are, however, other causes of bleeding behind the eye and they should be checked for before diagnosing shaken baby syndrome. Other factors must be considered.\nFirst Aid\nCall 911 or your local emergency number."}
