An abdominal aortic\naneurysm\n(AAA) occurs when an area of the aorta in the abdomen becomes very large or balloons out.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of an aneurysm is unknown. It occurs due to weakness in the wall of the artery. Factors that can increase your risk of having this problem include:\nSmoking\nHigh blood pressure\nMale sex\nGenetic factors\nAn abdominal aortic aneurysm is most often seen in males over age 60 who have one or more risk factors. The larger the aneurysm, the more likely it is to break open or\ntear\n. This can be life threatening.\nSymptoms\nAneurysms can develop slowly over many years, often with no symptoms. Symptoms may come on quickly if the aneurysm expands rapidly, tears open or leaks blood within the wall of the vessel (aortic dissection).\nSymptoms of rupture include:\nPain in the abdomen or back. The pain may be severe, sudden, persistent, or constant."}

The provider may find:\nA lump (mass) in the abdomen\nPulsating sensation in the abdomen\nStiff or rigid abdomen\nYour provider may find this problem by doing the following tests:\nUltrasound of the abdomen\nwhen the abdominal aneurysm is first suspected\nCT scan of the abdomen\nto confirm the size of the aneurysm\nCTA (computed tomographic angiogram) to help with surgical planning\nAny one of these tests may be done when you are having symptoms.\nYou may have an abdominal aortic aneurysm that is not causing any symptoms."}

The recommended frequency depends on the size of your aneurysm. Ask your provider what is best for you.\nMost of the time, surgery is done if the aneurysm is bigger than 2 inches (5 centimeters) across or growing quickly."}

Ask your provider what is best for you.\nMost of the time, surgery is done if the aneurysm is bigger than 2 inches (5 centimeters) across or growing quickly. The goal is to do surgery before complications develop.\nThere are two types of surgery:\nOpen repair\n- A large cut is made in your abdomen. The abnormal vessel is replaced with a graft made of man-made material.\nEndovascular stent grafting\n- This procedure can be done without making a large cut in your abdomen, so you may recover more quickly. This may be a safer approach if you have certain other medical problems or are an older adult. Endovascular repair can sometimes be done for a leaking or bleeding aneurysm.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome is often good if you have surgery to repair the aneurysm before it ruptures.\nWhen an abdominal aortic aneurysm\nbegins to tear\nor ruptures, it is a medical emergency."}
