Lymph tissue is found in the lymph nodes, spleen, tonsils, bone marrow, and other organs of the immune system. The immune system protects us against diseases and infections.\nThis article is about NHL in children.\nCauses\nNHL tends to occur more often in adults. But children do get some types of NHL and more commonly in the second decade of life. Although all ages are affected, NHL is rare in children younger than 3 years old.\nThe exact cause of NHL in children is not known. The development of lymphomas in children, however, has been associated with:\nA weak immune system from an organ transplant\nEpstein-Barr virus, the virus that causes\nmononucleosis\nHIV (human immunodeficiency virus) infection\nPast cancer treatment such as\nradiation treatment\nor\nchemotherapy\n(very rare)\nThere are many types of NHL. One classification (grouping) is by how fast the cancer spreads."}

The cancer may be low grade (slow growing), intermediate grade, or high grade (fast growing).\nNHL is further grouped by:\nHow the cells look under the microscope\nWhat type of white blood cell it originates from\nWhether there are certain genetic DNA changes in the tumor cells themselves\nSymptoms\nSymptoms depend on which area of the body is affected by the cancer and how fast the cancer is growing.\nSymptoms may include:\nSwollen lymph nodes\nin the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin\nPainless swelling or lump in the testicle\nSwelling of the head, neck, arms or upper body\nTrouble swallowing\nTrouble breathing\nWheezing\nPersistent cough\nSwelling in the belly\nNight sweats\nWeight loss\nFeeling tired\nNeurological symptoms such as severe back pain, numbness or weakness\nSkin rash\nUnexplained fever\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will take your child's medical history."}

Even late stages of NHL are curable in children.\nYour child will need to have regular exams and imaging tests for years after treatment to make sure the tumor does not come back.\nEven if the tumor comes back, there is a good chance of a cure.\nRegular follow-ups will also help your child's health care team check for signs of the cancer returning and for any long-term treatment effects.\nPossible Complications\nTreatments for NHL may have complications. Side effects of chemotherapy or radiation therapy may appear months or years after treatment. These are called \"\nlate effects\n.\" It is important to talk about treatment effects with your health care team."}
