Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHypothyroidism\nHypothyroidism\nHypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland does not make enough thyroid hormone. This condition is often called underactive thyroid.\nCauses\nThe thyroid gland is an important organ of the\nendocrine system\n. It is located at the front of the neck, just above where your collarbones meet. The thyroid makes hormones that control the way every cell in the body uses energy. This process is called\nmetabolism\n.\nHypothyroidism is more common in women and people over age 50.\nThe most common cause of hypothyroidism is thyroiditis."}

After that, your thyroid hormone levels should be monitored at least once every year.\nWhen you are taking thyroid medicine, be aware of the following:\nDo not stop taking the medicine, even when you feel better. Continue taking it exactly as your provider prescribed.\nIf you change brands of thyroid medicine, let your provider know. Your levels may need to be checked.\nWhat you eat can change the way your body absorbs thyroid medicine.
