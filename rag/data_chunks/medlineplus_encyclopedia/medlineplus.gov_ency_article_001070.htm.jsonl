Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nKneecap dislocation\nKneecap dislocation\nKneecap dislocation occurs when the round-shaped bone covering the knee (patella) moves or slides out of place. The dislocation often occurs toward the outside of the leg.\nCauses\nKneecap dislocation often occurs after a sudden change in direction when your leg is planted. This puts your kneecap under stress. This can occur when playing certain sports, such as basketball.\nDislocation may also occur as result of direct trauma. When the kneecap is dislocated, it can slip sideways to the outside of the knee.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of kneecap dislocation include:\nKnee appears to be deformed\nKnee is bent and cannot be straightened out\nKneecap (patella) is dislocated and stuck to the outside of the knee\nKnee pain\nand tenderness\nKnee swelling\nSloppy kneecap -- you can move the kneecap too much from right to left (hypermobile patella)\nThe first few times this occurs, you will feel pain and may be unable to walk. If you continue to have dislocations, your knee may not hurt as much and you may not be as disabled."}

If you continue to have dislocations, your knee may not hurt as much and you may not be as disabled. This is not a reason to avoid treatment. Kneecap dislocation damages your knee joint. It can lead to cartilage injuries and increase the risk of developing\nosteoarthritis\nat a younger age. Repeat dislocations will make the condition worse and harder to treat.\nFirst Aid\nIf you can, straighten out your knee. If it is stuck and painful to move, stabilize (splint) the knee and get medical attention.\nYour health care provider will examine your knee. This may confirm that the kneecap is dislocated.  If it is, your provider will reduce (relocate) your dislocation.\nYour provider may order a\nknee x-ray\nor an\nMRI\n. These tests can show if the dislocation caused a broken bone or cartilage damage. If tests show that you have no damage, your knee will be placed into a knee brace immobilizer to prevent you from moving it."}

If tests show that you have no damage, your knee will be placed into a knee brace immobilizer to prevent you from moving it. You will need to wear this for about 3 weeks.\nOnce you are no longer in the brace, physical therapy can help build back your muscle strength and improve the knee's range of motion.\nIf there is damage to the bone and cartilage, or if the kneecap continues to be unstable, you may need surgery to stabilize the kneecap. This may be done using\narthroscopic\nor open surgery.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you injure your knee and have symptoms of a dislocation.\nContact your provider if you are being treated for a dislocated knee and you notice:\nIncreased instability in your knee\nPain or\nswelling\nreturn after they went away\nYour injury does not appear to be getting better with time\nAlso contact your provider if you re-injure your knee.\nPrevention\nUse proper techniques when exercising or playing sports."}
