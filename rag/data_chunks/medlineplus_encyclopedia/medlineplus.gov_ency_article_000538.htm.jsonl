Without enough factor VIII, the blood cannot clot properly to control bleeding.\nCauses\nWhen you bleed, a series of reactions take place in the body that helps blood clots form. This process is called the coagulation cascade. It involves as many as 20 different special proteins called coagulation, or clotting, factors. You may have a higher chance of excess bleeding if one or more of these factors are missing or are not functioning like they should.\nFactor VIII (eight) is one such coagulation factor. Hemophilia A is the result of the body not making enough factor VIII.\nHemophilia A is caused by an inherited\nX-linked recessive\ntrait, with the variant gene located on the X chromosome. Females have two copies of the X chromosome. So if the factor VIII gene on one chromosome does not work, the gene on the other chromosome can do the job of making enough factor VIII.\nMales have only one X chromosome."}

So if the factor VIII gene on one chromosome does not work, the gene on the other chromosome can do the job of making enough factor VIII.\nMales have only one X chromosome. If the factor VIII gene is missing on a boy's X chromosome, he will have hemophilia A. For this reason, most people with hemophilia A are male.\nIf a woman has a variant factor VIII gene, she is considered a carrier. This means the variant gene can be passed down to her children. Boys born to such women have a 50% chance of having hemophilia A. Their daughters have a 50% chance of being a carrier. All female children of men with hemophilia carry the variant gene whereas male children do not.\nRisk factors for hemophilia A include:\nFamily history of bleeding\nBeing male\nSymptoms\nThe severity of symptoms vary. Prolonged\nbleeding\nis the main symptom. It is often first seen when an infant is circumcised. Other bleeding problems usually show up when the infant starts crawling and walking.\nMild cases may go unnoticed until later in life. Symptoms may first occur after surgery or injury."}

Once the specific variant has been identified, other people in your family will need tests to diagnose the disorder.\nTests to diagnose hemophilia A include:\nProthrombin time\n(PT)\nPartial thromboplastin time\n(PTT)\nSerum factor VIII\nactivity\nTreatment\nTreatment includes replacing the missing clotting factor. You will receive factor VIII concentrates."}

How much you get depends on:\nSeverity of bleeding\nSite of bleeding\nYour weight and height\nMild hemophilia may be treated with desmopressin (desamino-8-arginine vasopressin or DDAVP). This medicine helps the body release factor VIII that is stored within the lining of blood vessels.\nTo prevent a bleeding crisis, people with hemophilia and their families can be taught to give factor VIII concentrates at home at the first signs of bleeding. People with severe forms of the disease may need regular preventive treatment.\nDDAVP or factor VIII concentrate may also be needed before having dental extractions or surgery.\nYou should get the\nhepatitis B vaccine\n. People with hemophilia are more likely to get hepatitis B because they may receive blood products.\nSome people with hemophilia A develop\nantibodies\nto factor VIII. These antibodies are called inhibitors. The inhibitors attack factor VIII so that it no longer works."}

Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWith treatment, most people with hemophilia A are able to lead a fairly normal life.\nIf you have hemophilia A, you should have regular checkups with a hematologist.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nLong-term joint problems, which may require a joint replacement\nBleeding in the brain (intracerebral hemorrhage)\nBlood clots due to treatment\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nSymptoms of a bleeding disorder develops\nA family member has been diagnosed with hemophilia A\nYou have hemophilia A and you plan to have children; genetic counseling is available\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling\nmay be recommended."}
