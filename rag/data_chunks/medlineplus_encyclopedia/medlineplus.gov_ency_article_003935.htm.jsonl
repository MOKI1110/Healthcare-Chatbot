This test can help identify genetic problems as the cause of a disorder or disease.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test can be performed on almost any tissue, including:\nAmniotic fluid\nBlood\nBone marrow\nTissue from the organ that develops during pregnancy to feed a growing baby (placenta)\nTo test amniotic fluid, an\namniocentesis\nis done.\nbone marrow biopsy\nis needed to take a sample of bone marrow.\nThe sample is placed into a special dish or tube and allowed to grow in the lab. Cells are later taken from the new sample and stained. The lab specialist uses a microscope to examine the size, shape, and number of chromosomes in the cell sample. The stained sample is photographed to show the arrangement of the chromosomes. This is called a karyotype.\nCertain problems can be identified through the number or arrangement of the chromosomes."}

The stained sample is photographed to show the arrangement of the chromosomes. This is called a karyotype.\nCertain problems can be identified through the number or arrangement of the chromosomes. Chromosomes contain thousands of genes that are stored in DNA, the basic genetic material.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nFollow your health care provider's instructions on how to prepare for the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nHow the test will feel depends on whether the sample procedure is having blood drawn (\nvenipuncture\n), amniocentesis, or bone marrow biopsy.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test can:\nCount the number of chromosomes\nLook for structural changes in chromosomes\nThis test may be done:\nOn a couple that has a history of miscarriage\nTo examine any child or baby who has unusual features or developmental delays\nAny person who is suspected to have a genetic disorder\nThe bone marrow or blood test can be done to identify the Philadelphia chromosome, which is found in 85% of people with\nchronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)\n.\nThe amniotic fluid test is done to check a developing baby for chromosome problems.\nYour provider may order other tests that go together with a karyotype:\nMicroar"}
