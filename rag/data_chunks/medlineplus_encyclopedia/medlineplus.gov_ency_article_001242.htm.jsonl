Tenosynovitis is inflammation of this sheath. The cause of the inflammation may be unknown, or it may result from:\nDiseases that cause inflammation\nInfection\nInjury\nOveruse\nStrain\nThe wrists, hands, ankles, and feet are commonly affected because the tendons are long across those joints."}

Your provider will prescribe antibiotics either taken by mouth or through your veins. In severe cases, emergency surgery is needed to release the pus around the tendon.\nAsk your provider about strengthening exercises that you can do after you recover.

If tenosynovitis is caused by overuse and the activity is not stopped, it is likely to come back. If the tendon is damaged, recovery may be slow or the condition may become chronic (ongoing).\nPossible Complications\nIf tenosynovitis is not treated, the tendon may become permanently restricted or it may tear (rupture). The affected joint can become stiff.\nInfection in the tendon may spread, which could be serious and threaten the affected limb.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have pain or difficulty straightening a joint or limb.
