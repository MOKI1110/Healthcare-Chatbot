The movement is most often a sign that the person has a breathing problem.\nIntercostal retractions are a medical emergency.\nConsiderations\nThe wall of your chest is flexible. This helps you breathe  normally. Stiff tissue called cartilage attaches your ribs to the breast bone (sternum).\nThe intercostal muscles are the muscles between the ribs. During breathing, these muscles normally tighten and pull the rib cage up. Your chest expands and the lungs fill with air.\nIntercostal retractions are due to reduced air pressure inside your chest. This can happen if the upper airway (trachea) or small airways of the lungs (bronchioles) become partially blocked. As a result, the intercostal muscles are sucked inward, between the ribs, when you breathe. This is a sign of a partially or completely\nblocked airway\n."}

You may receive oxygen, medicines to reduce swelling, and other treatments.\nWhen you can breathe better, your health care provider will examine you and ask about your medical history and symptoms, such as:\nWhen did the problem start?\nIs it getting better, worse, or staying the same?\nDoes it occur all the time?\nDid you notice anything significant that might have caused an airway obstruction?\nWhat other symptoms are there, such as blue skin color, wheezing, high-pitched sound when breathing (\nstridor\n), coughing or sore throat?\nHas anything been breathed  into the airway?\nTests that may be done include:\nArterial blood gases\nChest x-ray\nComplete bloo"}
