Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSpinal cord abscess\nSpinal cord abscess\nSpinal cord abscess is the swelling and irritation (inflammation) and the collection of infected material (pus) and germs in or around the spinal cord.\nCauses\nA spinal cord abscess is caused by an infection inside the spine. An abscess of the spinal cord itself is very rare. A spinal abscess usually occurs as a complication of an\nepidural abscess\n.\nPus forms as a collection of:\nWhite blood cells\nFluid\nLive and dead bacteria or other microorganisms\nDestroyed tissue cells\nThe pus is commonly covered by a lining or membrane that forms around the edges. The pus collection causes pressure on the spinal cord.\nThe infection is usually due to bacteria. Often it is caused by a staphylococcus infection that spreads through the spine. It may be caused by\ntuberculosis\nin some areas of the world, but this is not as common today as it was in the past."}

In rare cases, the infection may be due to a fungus.\nThe following increase your risk for a spinal cord abscess:\nBack injuries or trauma, including minor ones\nBoils\non the skin, especially on the back or scalp (rare)\nComplication of\nlumbar puncture\nor back surgery\nSpread of any infection through the bloodstream from another part of the body (\nbacteremia\n)\nInjecting illicit drugs\nThe infection often begins in the bone (\nosteomyelitis\n). The bone infection may cause an epidural abscess to form. This abscess gets larger and presses on the spinal cord. The infection can spread to the spinal cord itself.\nA spinal cord abscess is rare."}

Or, pain may spread to the shoulder, arm, or hand.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and may find the following:\nTenderness over the spine\nSpinal cord compression\nParalysis of the lower body (paraplegia) or of the entire trunk, arms, and legs (quadriplegia)\nChanges in sensation below the area where the spine is affected\nThe amount of nerve loss depends on where the abscess is located on the spine and how much it is compressing the spinal cord.\nTests that may be done include:\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nCT scan\nof the spine\nDraining of abscess (may require surgery)\nGram stain\nand culture of absc"}

It involves removing part of the spine bone and draining the abscess. Sometimes it is not possible to drain the abscess completely.\nAntibiotics are used to treat the infection. They are usually given through a vein (\nIV\n).\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well a person does after treatment varies. Some people recover completely.\nAn untreated spinal cord abscess can lead to spinal cord compression. It can cause permanent, severe paralysis and nerve loss. It may be life threatening.\nIf the abscess is not drained completely, it may return or cause scarring in the spinal cord.\nPossible Complications\nThe abscess can injure the spinal cord from direct pressure."}
