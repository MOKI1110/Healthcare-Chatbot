This may cause you to drag your foot when you walk. Foot drop, also called drop foot, can be caused by a problem with the muscles, nerves, or anatomy of your foot or leg.\nCauses\nFoot drop is not a condition by itself. It is a symptom of another disorder. Foot drop can be caused by a number of health conditions.\nThe most common cause of foot drop is\nperoneal nerve injury\n. This nerve is also called the fibular nerve  is a branch of the sciatic nerve. It supplies movement and sensation to the lower leg, foot, and toes.\nConditions that affect the nerves and muscles in the body can lead to foot drop."}

They include:\nPeripheral neuropathy\n--\nDiabetes\nis the most common cause of peripheral neuropathy.\nCharcot-Marie-Tooth\ndisease is a common inherited peripheral neuropathy.\nSome muscle diseases cause foot drop, including some forms of\nmuscular dystrophy\n.\nPolio\nis caused by a virus, and can cause muscle weakness and paralysis.\nCrossing the legs at the knees can also damage the peroneal nerve.\nBrain and spinal cord disorders can cause muscle weakness and paralysis and include:\nStroke\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)\nMultiple sclerosis\nSymptoms\nFoot drop can cause problems walking. Because you can't raise the front of your foot, you need to raise your leg higher than normal to take a step to avoid dragging your toes or tripping. The foot may make a slapping noise as it hits the ground. This is called a steppage\ngait\n.\nDepending on the cause of foot drop, you may feel numbness or tingling on the top of your foot or shin."}

If the cause is a chronic or ongoing illness, foot drop may be permanent.\nCertain people may benefit from physical and occupational therapy.\nPossible treatments include:\nBraces, splints, or shoe inserts to help support the foot and keep it in a more normal position.\nPhysical therapy can help stretch and strengthen muscles and help you walk better.\nNerve stimulation may help retrain the nerves and muscles of the foot.\nSurgery may be needed to relieve pressure on the nerve or to try to repair it. For long-term foot drop, your provider may suggest fusing the ankle or foot bones. Or you may have tendon surgery. In this, a working tendon and attached muscle is transferred to a different part of the foot.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well you recover depends on what is causing foot drop.
