Nicotine is an addictive substance.\nMillions of people in the United States have been able to quit smoking. Although the number of cigarette smokers in the United States has dropped in recent years, the number of smokeless tobacco users has steadily increased. Smokeless tobacco products are either placed in the mouth, cheek, or lip and sucked or chewed on, or placed in the nasal passage. The nicotine in these products is absorbed at the same rate as smoking tobacco, and the potential for addiction is still very strong.\nBoth smoking and smokeless tobacco use carry many health risks.\nSymptoms\nNicotine use can have many different effects on the body."}

It can:\nDecrease the appetite -- Fear of weight gain makes some people unwilling to stop smoking.\nBoost mood, give people a sense of well-being, and possibly even relieve minor depression.\nIncrease activity in the intestines.\nCreate more saliva and phlegm.\nIncrease the heart rate by around 10 to 20 beats per minute.\nIncrease blood pressure by 5 to 10 mm Hg.\nPossibly cause sweating, nausea, and diarrhea.\nStimulate memory and alertness -- People who use tobacco often depend on it to help them accomplish certain tasks and perform well.\nSymptoms of nicotine withdrawal appear within 2 to 3 hours after you last use tobacco. People who smoked the longest or smoked a greater number of cigarettes each day are more likely to have withdrawal symptoms. For those who are quitting, symptoms peak about 2 to 3 days later."}
