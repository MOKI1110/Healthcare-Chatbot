Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nElbow replacement\nElbow replacement\nElbow replacement is surgery to replace the elbow joint with artificial joint parts (\nprosthetics\n).\nDescription\nThe elbow joint connects three bones:\nThe humerus in the upper arm\nThe ulna and radius in the lower arm (forearm)\nThe artificial elbow joint has two or three stems made of high-quality metal. A metal and plastic hinge joins the stems together and allows the artificial joint to bend. Artificial joints come in different sizes to fit people of different sizes.\nThe surgery is done in the following way:\nYou'll receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n. This means you'll be asleep and unable to feel pain."}

This means you'll be asleep and unable to feel pain. Or, you'll receive regional anesthesia (\nspinal and epidural\n) to numb your arm.\nA cut (incision) is made on the back of your elbow so that the surgeon can view your elbow joint.\nThe damaged tissue and parts of the arm bones that make up the elbow joint are removed.\nA tool is used to make a hole in the center of the arm bones to anchor the artificial joint in place.\nThe ends of the artificial joint are usually glued in place into each bone. They can be connected with a hinge.\nThe tissue around the new joint is repaired.\nThe wound is closed with stitches, and a bandage is applied. Your arm may be placed in a splint to keep it stable.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nElbow replacement surgery is usually done if the elbow joint is badly damaged and you have pain or cannot use your arm."}

These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\nOn the day of your surgery:\nFollow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.\nTake the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\nArrive at the hospital on time.\nAfter the Procedure\nYou may need to stay in the hospital for up to 1 to 2 days. After you go home,\nfollow instructions\non how to care for your wound and elbow.\nPhysical therapy will be needed to help you gain strength and use of your arm. It will start with gentle flexing exercises. People who have a splint usually start therapy a few weeks later than those who do not have a splint.\nSome people can start to use their new elbow as soon as 12 weeks after surgery. Complete recovery can take up to a year."}

Talk to your surgeon about your limitations. Your surgeon may give you a weight limit for lifting with that arm.\nIt is important to follow-up with your surgeon regularly to check how your replacement is doing. Be sure to go to all your appointments.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nElbow replacement surgery eases pain for most people. It can also increase the range of motion of your elbow joint. A second elbow replacement surgery is usually not as successful as the first one.\nAlternative Names\nTotal elbow arthroplasty; Endoprosthetic elbow replacement; Arthritis - elbow arthroplasty; Osteoarthritis - elbow arthroplasty; Degenerative arthritis - elbow arthroplasty; DJD - elbow arthroplasty\nPatient Instructions\nElbow replacement - discharge\nSurgical wound care - open\nImages\nElbow prosthesis\nReferences\nCohen MS, Chen NC.
