Medicines that can cause tremors include the following:\nCancer medicines such as thalidomide and cytarabine\nSeizure medicines such as divalproex sodium (Depakote)\nAsthma medicines such as theophylline and albuterol\nImmune suppressing medicines such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus\nMood stabilizers such as lithium carbonate\nStimulants\nsuch as\ncaffeine\nand amphetamines\nAntidepressant medicines such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and tricyclics\nHeart medicines such as amiodarone, procainamide, and others\nCertain antibiotics\nSteroids\nCertain antivirals, such as acyclovir and vidarabine\nAlcohol\nNicotine\nCertain high blood pressur"}

In rare cases, your lower body is affected. Your tremor may not affect both sides of the body equally.\nThe shaking is usually fast, about 4 to 12 movements per second.\nYour tremor may be:\nEpisodic (occurring in bursts, sometimes about an hour after taking the medicine)\nIntermittent (comes and goes with activity, but not always)\nSporadic (happens on occasion)\nYour tremor can:\nOccur either with movement or at rest\nDisappear during sleep\nGet worse with voluntary movement and emotional stress\nOther symptoms may include:\nHead nodding\nShaking or quivering sound to the voice\nProblems with writing, drawing, drinking from a cup, or using tools if the tremor affects the hands\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can make the diagnosis by performing a physical exam and asking abo"}

You will also be asked about the medicines you take.\nTests may be done to check for other reasons for your tremor. A tremor that occurs when the muscles are relaxed or that affects the legs or coordination may be a sign of another condition, such as\nParkinson disease\n. The speed of the tremor can be an important way to determine its cause.\nOther causes of tremors may include:\nEssential tremor\nAlcohol withdrawal\nCigarette smoking\nOveractive thyroid (\nhyperthyroidism\n)\nParkinson disease\nAdrenal gland tumor (\npheochromocytoma\n)\nToo much caffeine\nDisorder in which there is too much copper in the body (\nWilson disease\n)\nBlood tests and imaging tests (such as a\nCT scan of the head\n,\nbrain MRI\n, and\nx-rays\n) are usually normal.\nTreatment\nDrug-induced tremor often goes away when you stop taking the medicine that is causing the shaking.\nYou may not need treatment or changes in the medicine if the tremor is mild and does not interfere with your daily activit"}

Or, you may be prescribed another medicine to treat your condition. In rare cases, a medicine such as propranolol may be added to help control the tremor.\nDo not stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.\nPossible Complications\nSevere tremor can interfere with daily activities, especially fine motor skills such as writing, and other activities such as eating or drinking.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you are taking a medicine and a tremor develops that interferes with your activity or is accompanied by other symptoms.\nPrevention\nAlways tell your provider about the medicines you take. Ask your provider if it is OK to take over-the-counter medicines that contain stimulants or theophylline."}
