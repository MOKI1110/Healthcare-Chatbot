The throat infection causes a gray to black, tough, fiber-like covering, which can block your airways. In some cases, diphtheria infects your skin first and causes\nskin lesions\n.\nOnce you are infected, the bacteria make dangerous substances called toxins."}

In some cases, diphtheria infects your skin first and causes\nskin lesions\n.\nOnce you are infected, the bacteria make dangerous substances called toxins. The toxins spread through your bloodstream to other organs, such as the heart and brain, and cause damage.\nBecause of widespread vaccination (immunization) of children, diphtheria is now rare in many parts of the world.\nRisk factors for diphtheria include crowded environments, poor hygiene, and lack of immunization.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms usually occur 2 to 5 days after the bacteria enter your body:\nFever and chills\nSore throat,\nhoarseness\nPainful swallowing\nCroup-like (barking) cough\nDrooling\n(suggests airway blockage is about to occur)\nBluish coloration of the skin\nBloody, watery drainage from nose\nBreathing problems, including difficulty breathing, fast breathing, high-pitched breathing sound (\nstridor\n)\nSkin sores (usually seen in tropical areas)\nSometimes there are no symptoms.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and look inside your mouth."}

This may reveal a gray to black covering (pseudomembrane) in the throat,\nenlarged lymph glands\n, and swelling of the neck or vocal cords.\nTests used may include:\nGram stain\nor\nthroat culture\nto identify the diphtheria bacteria\nToxin assay (to detect the presence of the toxin made by the bacteria)\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG)\nTreatment\nIf your provider thinks you have diphtheria, treatment will likely be started right away, even before test results come back.\nDiphtheria antitoxin is given as a shot into a muscle or through an IV (\nintravenous\nline). The infection is then treated with antibiotics, such as penicillin and erythromycin.\nYou may need to stay in the hospital while getting the antitoxin. Other treatments may include:\nFluids by IV\nOxygen\nBed rest\nHeart monitoring\nInsertion of a breathing tube\nCorrection of airway blockages\nPeople without symptoms who carry diphtheria should be treated with antibiotics.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nDiphtheria may be mild or severe."}

Some people do not have symptoms. In others, the disease can slowly get worse. Recovery from the illness is slow.\nPeople may die, especially when the disease affects the heart.\nPossible Complications\nThe most common complication is inflammation of the heart muscle (\nmyocarditis\n). The nervous system is also frequently and severely affected, which may result in temporary\nparalysis\n.\nThe diphtheria toxin can also damage the kidneys.\nThere can also be an allergic response to the antitoxin.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider right away if you have come in contact with a person who has diphtheria.\nDiphtheria is a rare disease.

This helps you to know if diphtheria is present in your area.\nPrevention\nRoutine childhood immunizations and adult boosters prevent the disease.\nAnyone who has come into contact with an infected person should get an\nimmunization\nor booster shot against diphtheria, if they have not already received it. Protection from the vaccine lasts only 10 years. So it is important for adults to get a booster vaccine every 10 years. The booster is called tetanus-diphtheria (\nTd\n). (The shot also has vaccine medicine for an infection called\ntetanus\n.)\nIf you have been in close contact with a person who has diphtheria, contact your provider right away. Ask whether you need antibiotics to prevent getting diphtheria.\nAlternative Names\nRespiratory diphtheria; Pharyngeal diphtheria; Diphtheric cardiomyopathy; Diphtheric polyneuropathy\nImages\nAntibodies\nReferences\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention website.
