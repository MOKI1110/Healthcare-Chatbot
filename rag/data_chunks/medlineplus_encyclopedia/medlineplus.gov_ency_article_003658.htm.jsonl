Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBone marrow aspiration\nBone marrow aspiration\nBone marrow is the soft tissue inside bones that helps form blood cells. It is found in the hollow part of most bones. Bone marrow aspiration is the removal of a small amount of this tissue in liquid form for examination.\nBone marrow aspiration is not the same as\nbone marrow biopsy\n. A biopsy removes a core of bone tissue for examination.\nHow the Test is Performed\nBone marrow aspiration may be done in your health care provider's office or in a hospital. The bone marrow is removed from your pelvic or breast bone. Sometimes, another bone is selected.\nMarrow is removed in the following steps:\nIf needed, you are given medicine to help you relax.\nYour provider cleans the skin and injects numbing medicine into the area and surface of the bone.\nA special needle is inserted into the bone. The needle has a tube attached to it, which creates suction."}

A small sample of bone marrow fluid flows into the tube.\nThe needle is removed.\nPressure and then a bandage are applied to the skin.\nThe bone marrow fluid is sent to a lab and examined under a microscope.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nTell your provider:\nIf you are allergic to any medicines\nIf you are pregnant\nIf you have bleeding problems\nWhat medicines you are taking\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will feel a sting and slight burning sensation when the numbing medicine is applied. You may feel pressure as the needle is inserted into the bone, and a sharp and usually painful sucking sensation as the marrow is removed."}
