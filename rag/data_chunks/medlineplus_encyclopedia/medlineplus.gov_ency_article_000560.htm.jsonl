Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAnemia\nAnemia\nAnemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues.\nDifferent types of anemia include:\nAnemia due to vitamin B12 deficiency\nAnemia due to folate (folic acid) deficiency\nAnemia due to iron deficiency\nAnemia of chronic disease\nHemolytic anemia\nIdiopathic aplastic anemia\nMegaloblastic anemia\nPernicious anemia\nSickle cell anemia\nThalassemia\nIron deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia.\nCauses\nAlthough many parts of the body help make red blood cells, most of the work is done in the bone marrow. Bone marrow is the soft tissue in the center of bones that helps form all blood cells.\nHealthy red blood cells last between 90 and 120 days. Parts of your body then remove old blood cells. A hormone called erythropoietin (EPO) made in your kidneys signals your bone marrow to make more red blood cells.\nHemoglobin is the oxygen-carrying protein inside red blood cells. It gives red blood cells their color."}
