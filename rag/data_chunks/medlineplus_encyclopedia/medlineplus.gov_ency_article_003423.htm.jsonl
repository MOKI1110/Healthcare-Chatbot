Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nVenipuncture\nVenipuncture\nVenipuncture is the collection of blood from a vein. It is most often done for laboratory testing.\nHow the Test is Performed\nMost of the time, blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\nThe site is cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic).\nAn elastic band is put around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area. This makes the vein below it swell with blood.\nA needle is inserted into the vein.\nThe blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle.\nThe elastic band is removed from your arm.\nThe needle is taken out and the spot is covered with a bandage to stop bleeding.\nIn infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin and make it bleed. The blood collects onto a slide or test strip. A bandage may be placed over the area if there is any bleeding.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThe steps you need to take before the test will depend on the kind of blood test you are having."}

Many tests do not require special preparation.\nIn some cases, your health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test or if you need to be fasting. Do not stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nBlood is made up of two parts:\nFluid (plasma or serum)\nCells\nPlasma is the fluid part of the blood in the bloodstream that contains substances such as glucose, electrolytes, proteins, and water. Serum is the fluid part that remains after the blood is allowed to clot in a test tube.\nCells in the blood include red blood cells, white blood cells, and\nplatelets\n.\nBlood helps move oxygen, nutrients, waste products, and other materials through the body."}
