Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLow blood sodium\nLow blood sodium\nLow blood sodium is a condition in which the sodium level in the blood is lower than normal. The medical name of this condition is hyponatremia.\nCauses\nSodium is found mostly in the body fluids outside the cells. Sodium is an\nelectrolyte\n(mineral). It is very important for maintaining blood pressure. Sodium is also needed for nerves, muscles, and other body tissues to work properly.\nWhen the amount of sodium in fluids outside cells drops below normal, water moves into the cells. This causes the cells to swell with too much water."}

This causes the cells to swell with too much water. Brain cells are especially sensitive to swelling, and this causes many of the symptoms of low blood sodium.\nWith hyponatremia,\nthe imbalance of water to sodium\nis caused by one of three conditions:\nEuvolemic hyponatremia -- total body water increases, but the body's sodium content stays the same\nHypervolemic hyponatremia -- both sodium and water content in the body increase, but the water gain is greater\nHypovolemic hyponatremia -- water and sodium are both lost from the body, but the sodium loss is greater\nLow blood sodium can be caused by:\nBurns that affect a large area of the body\nDiarrhea\nDiuretic medicines (water pills), which increase urine output and loss of sodium through the urine\nHeart failure\nKidney diseases\nCirrhosis\n(advanced liver disease)\nSyndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion\n(SIADH)\nSweating\nVomiting\nSymptoms\nCommon symptoms include:\nConfusion\n, irritability, restlessness\nConvulsions\nFatigue\nHeadache\nLoss of appetite\nMuscle weakness\n, spasms, or cramp"}

Blood and urine tests will be done.\nLab tests that can confirm and help diagnose low sodium include:\nComprehensive metabolic panel\n(includes blood sodium, normal range is 135 to 145 mEq/L, or 135 to 145 mmol/L)\nBlood osmolality\nUrine osmolality\nUrine sodium\n(normal level is 20 mEq/L in a random urine sample, and 40 to 220 mEq per day for a 24-hour urine test)\nTreatment\nThe cause of low blood sodium must be diagnosed and treated. If cancer is the cause of the condition, then radiation,\nchemotherapy\n, or surgery to remove the tumor may correct the sodium imbalance.\nOther treatments depend on the specific type of hyponatremia.\nTreatments may include:\nFluids through a vein (IV)\nMedicines to relieve symptoms\nLimiting water intake\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nOutcome depends on the condition that is causing the problem."}

Hyponatremia that occurs in less than 48 hours (acute hyponatremia), is more dangerous than hyponatremia that develops slowly over time. When blood sodium level falls slowly over days or weeks (chronic hyponatremia), the brain cells have time to adjust and swelling may be minimal.\nPossible Complications\nIn severe cases, low blood sodium can lead to:\nDecreased consciousness, hallucinations or coma\nBrain herniation\nDeath\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nWhen your body's sodium level drops too much, it can be a life-threatening emergency."}
