Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEhrlichiosis\nEhrlichiosis\nEhrlichiosis is a bacterial infection transmitted by the bite of a tick.\nCauses\nEhrlichiosis is caused by bacteria that belong to the family called rickettsiae. Rickettsial bacteria cause a number of serious diseases worldwide, including\nRocky Mountain spotted fever\nand\ntyphus\n. All of these diseases are spread to humans by a\ntick\n, flea, or mite bite.\nScientists first described ehrlichiosis in 1990. There are two types of the disease in the United States:\nHuman monocytic ehrlichiosis (HME) is caused by the rickettsial bacteria\nEhrlichia chaffeensis.\nHuman granulocytic ehrlichiosis (HGE) is also called human granulocytic anaplasmosis (HGA). It is caused by the rickettsial bacteria called\nAnaplasma phagocytophilum\n.\nEhrlichia bacteria can be carried by the:\nAmerican dog tick\nDeer tick (\nIxodes scapularis\n), which can also cause\nLyme disease\nLone Star tick\nIn the United States, HME is found mainly in the southern central states and the Southeast."}

HGE is found mainly in the Northeast and upper Midwest.\nRisk factors for ehrlichiosis include:\nLiving near an area with a lot of ticks\nOwning a pet that may bring a tick home\nWalking or playing in high grasses\nSymptoms\nThe incubation period between the tick bite and when symptoms occur is about 7 to 14 days.\nSymptoms may seem like the flu (influenza), and may include:\nFever and chills\nHeadache\nMuscle aches\nNausea\nOther possible symptoms:\nDiarrhea\nFine pinhead-sized areas of bleeding into the skin (petechial rash)\nFlat red\nrash\n(maculopapular rash), which is uncommon\nGeneral ill feeling (\nmalaise\n)\nA rash appears in fewer than one third of cases.

Sometimes, the disease may be mistaken for Rocky Mountain spotted fever, if the rash is present. The symptoms are often mild, but people are sometimes sick enough to see a health care provider.\nExams and Tests\nYour provider will do a physical exam and check your vital signs, including:\nBlood pressure\nHeart rate\nTemperature\nOther tests include:\nComplete blood count (\nCBC\n)\nGranulocyte\nstain\nIndirect fluorescent antibody test\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of blood sample\nTreatment\nAntibiotics (tetracycline or doxycycline) are used to treat the disease. Children should not take tetracycline by mouth until after all their permanent teeth have grown in, because it can permanently change the color of growing teeth. Doxycycline that is used for 2 weeks or less usually does not discolor a child's permanent teeth. Rifampin has also been used in people who cannot tolerate doxycycline.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nEhrlichiosis is rarely deadly. With antibiotics, people usually improve within 24 to 48 hours."}

Recovery may take up to 3 weeks.\nPossible Complications\nUntreated, this infection may lead to:\nComa\nDeath (rare)\nKidney damage\nLung damage\nOther organ damage\nSeizure\nIn rare cases, a tick bite can lead to more than one infection (co-infection). This is because ticks can carry more than one type of organism. Two such co-infections are:\nLyme disease\nBabesiosis, a parasitic disease similar to\nmalaria\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you become sick after a recent tick bite or if you have been in areas where ticks are common. Be sure to tell your provider about the tick exposure.\nPrevention\nEhrlichiosis is spread by tick bites."}

Be sure to tell your provider about the tick exposure.\nPrevention\nEhrlichiosis is spread by tick bites. Measures should be taken to prevent tick bites, including:\nWear long pants and long sleeves when walking through heavy brush, tall grass, and thickly wooded areas.\nPull your socks over the outside of pants to prevent ticks from crawling up your leg.\nKeep your shirt tucked into your pants.\nWear light-colored clothes so that ticks can be spotted easily.\nSpray your clothes with insect repellent.\nCheck your clothes and skin often while in the woods.\nAfter returning home:\nRemove your clothes. Look closely at all skin surfaces, including scalp. Ticks can quickly climb up the length of your body.\nSome ticks are large and easy to locate. Other ticks can be quite small, so carefully look at all black or brown spots on your skin.\nIf possible, ask someone to help you examine your body for ticks.\nAn adult should examine children carefully.\nStudies suggest that a tick must be attached to your body for at least 24 hours to cause disease."}
