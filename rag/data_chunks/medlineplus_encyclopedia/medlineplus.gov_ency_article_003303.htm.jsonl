Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLow-set ears and pinna abnormalities\nLow-set ears and pinna abnormalities\nLow-set ears and pinna abnormalities refer to an abnormal shape or position of the outer ear (pinna or auricle).\nConsiderations\nThe outer ear or \"pinna\" forms when a baby is growing in the mother's womb. The growth of this ear part takes place at a time when many other organs are developing (such as the kidneys). Abnormal changes in the shape or position of the pinna may be a sign that the baby also has other related problems.\nCommon abnormal findings include cysts in the pinna or\nskin tags\n.\nMany children are born with ears that stick out."}

This exam is most often done at the hospital at the time of delivery.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nThe provider will:\nExamine and test the child for other physical abnormalities of the kidneys, bones of the face, skull, and facial nerve\nAsk if you have a family history of abnormal-shaped ears\nTo determine whether the pinna is abnormal, the provider will take measurements with a tape measure. Other parts of the body will also be measured, including the eyes, hands, and feet.\nAll newborns should have a hearing test. Exams for any changes in mental development may be performed as the child grows. Genetic testing may also be done.\nTREATMENT\nMost of the time, no treatment is needed for pinna abnormalities because they do not affect hearing. However, sometimes cosmetic surgery is recommended.\nSkin tags may be tied off, unless there is cartilage in them. In that case, surgery is needed to remove them.\nEars that stick out may be treated for cosmetic reasons."}

The child wears this framework for several months. Surgery to correct the ears cannot be done until the child is 5 years old.\nMore severe abnormalities may require surgery for cosmetic reasons as well as for function. Surgery to create and attach a new ear is often done in stages.\nAlternative Names\nLow-set ears; Microtia; \"Lop\" ear; Pinna abnormalities; Genetic defect - pinna; Congenital defect - pinna\nImages\nEar abnormalities\nPinna of the newborn ear\nReferences\nHaddad J, Dodhia SN.
