It is the ability of skin to change shape and then return to normal.\nConsiderations\nReduced skin turgor is a sign of fluid loss (\ndehydration\n).\nDiarrhea\nor\nvomiting\ncan cause fluid loss. Infants and young children with these conditions can rapidly lose a lot of fluid, if they do not take enough water. Fever speeds up this process.\nTo check for skin turgor, the health care provider grasps the skin between  two fingers so that it is tented up. Commonly the lower arm or abdomen is checked. The skin is held for a few seconds and then released.\nSkin with normal turgor snaps rapidly back to its normal position. Skin with poor turgor takes time to return to its normal position.\nPoor skin turgor occurs with moderate to severe fluid loss. Mild dehydration is when fluid loss equals 5% of body weight. Moderate dehydration is 10% loss and severe dehydration is 15% or more loss of body weight.\nEdema\nis a condition where fluid builds up in the tissues and causes swelling."}

This causes the skin to be extremely difficult to pinch up.\nCauses\nCommon causes of poor skin turgor are:\nDecreased fluid intake\nDehydration\nDiarrhea\nDiabetes\nExtreme weight loss\nHeat exhaustion\n(excessive sweating without enough fluid intake)\nVomiting\nConnective tissue disorders such as\nscleroderma\nand\nEhlers-Danlos syndrome\ncan affect the elasticity of the skin, but this is not related to the amount of fluid in the body.\nHome Care\nYou can quickly check for dehydration at home. Pinch the skin over the back of the hand, on the abdomen, or over the front of the chest under the collarbone. This will show skin turgor.\nMild dehydration will cause the skin to be slightly slow in its return to normal. To rehydrate, drink more fluids -- particularly water.\nSeverely reduced turgor indicates moderate or severe fluid loss."}

See your provider right away.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nPoor skin turgor occurs with vomiting, diarrhea, or\nfever\n.\nThe skin is very slow to return to normal, or the skin \"tents\" up during a check. This can indicate severe dehydration that needs quick treatment.\nYou have reduced skin turgor and are unable to increase your intake of fluids (for example, because of vomiting).\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nThe provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions about your medical history, including:\nHow long have you had symptoms?\nWhat other symptoms came before the change in skin turgor (vomiting, diarrhea, others)?\nWhat have you done to try to treat the condition?\nAre there things that make the condition better or worse?\nWhat other symptoms do you have (such as dry lips,\ndecreased urine output\n, and\ndecreased tearing\n)?\nTests that may be performed:\nBlood chemistry\n(such as a\nchem-20\n)\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nUrinalysis\nYou may need\nint"}
