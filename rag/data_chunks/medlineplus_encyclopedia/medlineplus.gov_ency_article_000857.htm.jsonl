It is caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV).\nThis article focuses on HSV type 2 infection.\nCauses\nGenital herpes affects the skin or mucous membranes of the genitals. The virus is spread from one person to another during sexual contact.\nThere are 2 types of HSV:\nHSV-1 most often affects the mouth and lips and causes cold sores or fever blisters. But it can spread from the mouth to the genitals during oral sex.\nHSV type 2 (HSV-2) most often causes genital herpes. It can be spread through skin contact or fluids from the mouth or genitals.\nYou may become infected with HSV if your skin, vagina, penis, or mouth comes into contact with someone who already has HSV.\nYou are most likely to get HSV if you touch the skin of someone who has herpes sores, blisters, or a rash. But the virus can still be spread, even when no sores or other symptoms are present."}

But the virus can still be spread, even when no sores or other symptoms are present. In some cases, you do not know you are infected.\nGenital HSV-2 infections are more common in women than men.\nSymptoms\nMany people with genital herpes never have sores. Or they have very mild symptoms that go unnoticed or are mistaken for insect bites or another skin condition.\nIf signs and symptoms do occur during the first outbreak, they can be severe. This first outbreak most often happens within 2 days to 2 weeks of being infected.\nGeneral symptoms may include:\nDecreased appetite\nFever\nGeneral sick feeling (\nmalaise\n)\nMuscle aches in the lower back, buttocks, thighs, or knees\nSwollen and tender lymph nodes in the groin\nGenital symptoms include small, painful\nblisters\nfilled with clear or straw-colored fluid."}

When the blisters break, they leave shallow\nulcers\nthat are very painful. These ulcers crust over and heal in 7 to 14 days or more.\nOther symptoms may include:\nPain when passing urine\nVaginal discharge\n(in women)\nProblems emptying the bladder that may require a urinary catheter\nA second outbreak can appear weeks or months later. It is most often less severe and it goes away sooner than the first outbreak. Over time, the number of outbreaks may decrease.\nExams and Tests\nTests can be done on skin sores or blisters to diagnose HSV."}

These tests are most often done when someone has a first outbreak and when a pregnant woman develops genital herpes symptoms. Tests include:\nCulture of fluid from a blister or open sore\n. This test may be positive for HSV. It is most useful during the first outbreak.\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) done on fluid from a blister. This is the most accurate test to tell whether HSV is present in the blister.\nBlood tests that check for antibody level to HSV. These tests can identify whether a person has been infected with HSV, even between outbreaks. A positive test result when a person has never had an outbreak would indicate exposure to the virus at some time in the past.\nAt this time, experts do not recommend screening for HSV-1 or HSV-2 in adolescent or adults who have no symptoms, including pregnant women.\nTreatment\nGenital herpes cannot be cured."}

Medicines that fight viruses (such as acyclovir or valacyclovir) may be prescribed.\nThese medicines help relieve pain and discomfort during an outbreak by healing the sores more quickly. They seem to work better during a first attack than in later outbreaks.\nFor repeat outbreaks, the medicine should be taken as soon as tingling, burning, or itching begins, or as soon as blisters appear.\nPeople who have many outbreaks may take these medicines daily over a period of time. This helps prevent outbreaks or shorten their length. It can also reduce the chance of giving herpes to someone else.\nSide effects are rare with acyclovir and valacyclovir.\nPregnant women with a history of herpes may be treated during the last month of pregnancy to reduce the chance of having an outbreak at the time of delivery. If there is an outbreak around the time of delivery, a C-section will be recommended."}

Others have frequent outbreaks that can be triggered by fatigue, illness, menstruation, or stress.\nPossible Complications\nPregnant women who have an active genital herpes infection\nwhen they give birth may pass the infection to their baby.
