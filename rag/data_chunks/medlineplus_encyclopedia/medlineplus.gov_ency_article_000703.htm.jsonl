It usually occurs in people who have had untreated\nsyphilis\nfor many years.\nCauses\nNeurosyphilis is caused by\nTreponema pallidum\nbacteria. Neurosyphilis usually occurs about 10 to 20 years after a person is first infected with syphilis. Not everyone who has syphilis develops this complication.\nThere are four different forms of neurosyphilis:\nAsymptomatic\n(most common form)\nGeneral paresis\nMeningovascular\nTabes dorsalis\nAsymptomatic neurosyphilis occurs before\nsymptomatic\nsyphilis. Asymptomatic means there aren't any symptoms.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms usually affect the nervous system."}

Depending on the form of neurosyphilis, symptoms may include any of the following:\nAbnormal walk\n(gait), or unable to walk\nNumbness in the toes, feet, or legs\nProblems with thinking, such as confusion or poor concentration\nMental problems, such as\ndepression\nor irritability\nHeadache,\nseizures\n, or stiff neck\nLoss of bladder control (\nincontinence\n)\nTremors\n, or weakness\nVisual problems\n, even blindness\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will do a physical examination and may find the following:\nAbnormal reflexes\nMuscle atrophy\nMuscle contractions\nMental changes\nBlood tests can be done to detect substances produced by the bacteria that cause syphilis, this includes:\nTreponema pallidum\nparticle agglutination assay (TPPA)\nVenereal disease research laboratory (\nVDRL\n) test\nFluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (\nFTA-ABS\n)\nRapid plasma reagin (\nRPR\n)\nWith neurosyphilis, it is important to\ntest the spinal fluid\nfor signs of syphilis.\nTests to look for problems with the nervous sy"}

It can be given in different ways:\nInjected into a vein several times a day for 10 to 14 days.\nBy mouth 4 times a day, combined with daily muscle injections, both taken for 10 to 14 days.\nYou must have follow-up blood tests at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months to make sure the infection is gone. You will need follow-up lumbar punctures for CSF analysis every 6 months. If you have HIV/AIDS or another medical condition, your follow-up schedule may be different.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nNeurosyphilis is a life-threatening complication of syphilis. How well you do depends on how severe the neurosyphilis is before treatment. The goal of treatment is to prevent further deterioration."}
