People with vertigo feel as though they are actually spinning or moving, or that the world is spinning around them.\nCauses\nThere are two types of vertigo, peripheral and central vertigo.\nPeripheral vertigo is due to a problem in the part of the inner ear that controls balance. These areas are called the vestibular labyrinth, or semicircular canals. The problem may also involve the vestibular nerve."}

This involves placing your head in different positions to help reset the balance organ.\nYou may be prescribed medicines to treat symptoms of peripheral vertigo, such as nausea and vomiting.\nPhysical therapy may help improve balance problems.
