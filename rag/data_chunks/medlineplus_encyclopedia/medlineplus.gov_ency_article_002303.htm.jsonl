This structure can be an artery, a vein, or another structure, such as the tube that carries urine (ureter). The stent holds the structure open.\nDescription\nWhen a stent is placed into the body, the procedure is called stenting. There are different kinds of stents. Most are made of a metal or plastic mesh-like material. However, stent grafts are made of fabric. They are used in larger arteries.\nA coronary artery stent is a small, self-expanding, metal mesh tube. It is placed inside a coronary artery after\nballoon angioplasty\n. This stent prevents the artery from re-closing.\nA drug-eluting stent is coated with a medicine. This medicine helps further prevent the arteries from re-closing."}

Like other coronary artery stents, it is left permanently in the artery.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nMost of the time, stents are used when arteries become narrow or blocked.\nStents are commonly used to treat the following conditions that result from blocked or damaged blood vessels:\nCoronary heart disease\n(CHD) (angioplasty and stent placement - heart)\nPeripheral artery disease\n(angioplasty and stent replacement - peripheral arteries)\nRenal artery stenosis\nAbdominal aortic aneurysm\n(aortic aneurysm repair - endovascular)\nCarotid artery disease\n(carotid artery surgery)\nOther reasons to use stents include:\nKeeping open a blocked or damaged ureter\n(percutaneous urinary procedures)\nTreating aneurysms\n, including\nthoracic aortic aneurysms\nKeeping bile flowing in blocked bile ducts\n(biliary stricture)\nHelping you breathe if you have a blockage in the airways\nRisks\nRelated topics include:\nAngioplasty and stent placement - heart\nAngioplasty and stent placement - peripheral arteries\nPercuta"}
