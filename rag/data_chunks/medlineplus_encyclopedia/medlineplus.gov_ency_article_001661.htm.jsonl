Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTrisomy 18\nTrisomy 18\nTrisomy 18 is a genetic disorder in which a person has a third copy of material from\nchromosome\n18, instead of the usual 2 copies. Rarely, the extra material may be attached to another chromosome (translocation). Most cases are not passed down through families. Instead, the problems that lead to this condition occur in either the sperm or the egg that forms the fetus.\nCauses\nTrisomy 18 occurs in 1 in 6000 live births. It is 3 times more common in girls than boys.\nThe syndrome occurs when there is extra material from chromosome 18. The extra material affects normal development.\nTrisomy 18: the presence of an extra (third) chromosome 18 in all of the cells.\nMosaic trisomy 18: the presence of an extra chromosome 18 in some of the cells.\nPartial trisomy 18: the presence of a part of an extra chromosome 18 in the cells.\nMost cases of Trisomy 18 are not passed down through families (inherited)."}

There may be an unusually small placenta when the baby is born. A physical exam of the infant may show unusual facial features and fingerprint patterns. X-rays may show a short breast bone.\nChromosome studies\nwill show trisomy 18. The chromosome abnormality may be present in every cell or present in only a certain percentage of the cells (called mosaicism). Studies may also show part of the chromosome in some cells. Rarely, part of the chromosome 18 becomes attached to another chromosome."}
