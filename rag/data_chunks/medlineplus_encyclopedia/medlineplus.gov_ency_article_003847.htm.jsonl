However, you may be asked not to drink or eat anything for a few hours before the test.\nFor\nsurgical removal\nof a tumor, preparation is the same as for any major surgery. You will not be able to eat anything for 6 to 8 hours before the surgery.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWith a needle biopsy, you may feel some stinging or burning if a local numbing medicine is injected.\nYou may feel pressure or mild discomfort when the needle is inserted. This should only last for 1 or 2 minutes.\nThe area may feel tender or be bruised for a few days after the biopsy.\nThe biopsy for SjÃ¶gren syndrome requires an injection of the anesthetic in the lip or in the front of the ear. You will have stitches where the tissue sample was removed.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to find the cause of abnormal lumps or growths of the salivary glands."}
