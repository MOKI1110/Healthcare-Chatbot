However, this test may be normal, and you can still have strep. Your provider may send the throat swab to a laboratory for a\nstrep culture\n. Culture results can take a few days.\nTreatment\nSwollen tonsils that are not painful or do not cause other problems do not need to be treated. Your provider may not give you an antibiotic.

It is important to finish all of your antibiotic doses as directed, even if you feel better. If you do not take them all, the infection can return.\nThe following tips may help your throat feel better:\nDrink cold liquids or suck on fruit-flavored frozen bars.\nDrink fluids, and mostly warm (not hot), bland fluids.\nGargle with warm salt water.\nSuck on lozenges (containing benzocaine or similar ingredients) to reduce pain (these should not be used in young children because of the choking risk).\nTake over-the-counter (OTC) medicines, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen to reduce pain and fever. DO NOT give a child aspirin. Aspirin has been linked to\nReye syndrome\nin children.\nSome people who have repeated infections may need surgery to remove the tonsils (\ntonsillectomy\n).\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nTonsillitis symptoms due to strep will often get better within 2 or 3 days after you start the antibiotics.\nChildren with strep throat should be kept home from school or day care until they have been on antibiotics for 24 hours."}
