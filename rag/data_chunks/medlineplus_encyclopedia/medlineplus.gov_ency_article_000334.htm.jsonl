Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFanconi anemia\nFanconi anemia\nFanconi anemia is a rare disease passed down through families (inherited) that mainly affects the bone marrow. It results in decreased production of all types of blood cells.\nThis is the most common inherited form of\naplastic anemia\n.\nFanconi anemia is different from\nFanconi syndrome\n, a rare kidney disorder.\nCauses\nFanconi anemia is due to an abnormal gene that damages cells, which keeps them from repairing damaged DNA.\nTo inherit Fanconi anemia, a person must get one copy of the abnormal gene from each parent.\nThe condition is most often diagnosed in children between 3 and 14 years old.\nSymptoms\nPeople with Fanconi anemia have lower-than-normal numbers of white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets (cells that help the blood clot).\nToo few white blood cells can lead to infections."}
