They result from increased pressure on the anus. This can occur during pregnancy or childbirth, and due to constipation. The pressure causes the normal anal veins and tissue to swell. This tissue can bleed, often during bowel movements.\nHemorrhoids may be caused by:\nStraining during bowel movements\nConstipation\nSitting for long periods of time, especially on the toilet\nCertain diseases, such as\ncirrhosis\nHemorrhoids may be inside or outside the body.\nInternal hemorrhoids occur just inside the anus, at the beginning of the rectum. When they are large, they may fall outside (prolapse). The most common problem with internal hemorrhoids is bleeding during bowel movements.\nExternal hemorrhoids occur outside the anus. They can result in difficulty cleaning the area after a bowel movement."}

They can result in difficulty cleaning the area after a bowel movement. If a blood clot forms in an external hemorrhoid, it can be very painful (thrombosed external hemorrhoid).\nSymptoms\nHemorrhoids are most often not painful, but if a blood clot forms, they can be very painful.\nCommon symptoms include:\nPainless bright red blood from the rectum\nAnal itching\nAnal ache or pain, especially while sitting\nPain during bowel movements\nOne or more hard or tender lumps near the anus\nExams and Tests\nMost of the time, a health care provider can diagnose hemorrhoids by simply looking at the rectal area."}

Use baby wipes instead.\nTry not to scratch the area.\nSitz baths can help you to feel better. Sit in warm water for 10 to 15 minutes.\nIf your hemorrhoids do not get better with home treatments, you may need some type of office treatment to shrink the hemorrhoids.\nIf office treatment is not enough, some type of surgery may be necessary, such as removal of the hemorrhoids (\nhemorrhoidectomy\n)."}

This can cause tissue around it to die. Surgery is sometimes needed to remove hemorrhoids with clots.\nRarely, severe bleeding may also occur.\nIron deficiency anemia\ncan result from long-term blood loss.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nHemorrhoid symptoms do not improve with home treatment.\nYou have rectal bleeding.
