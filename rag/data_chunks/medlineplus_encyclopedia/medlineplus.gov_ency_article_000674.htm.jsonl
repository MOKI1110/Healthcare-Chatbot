JCV is also known as human polyomavirus 2. By age 10, most people have been infected with JCV, but it rarely causes symptoms. The virus remains in the body, but normally is inactive and causes no problems. But people with a weakened immune system are at risk of developing PML. Causes of a weakened immune system include:\nHIV/AIDS (less common now because of better management of HIV/AIDS).\nMedicines that suppress the immune system, including monoclonal antibodies."}

No other treatments have proved effective for PML."}

Depending on how severe the infection is, up to one half of people diagnosed with PML die within the first few months.
