The resulting lung infection is called primary TB.\nThe usual site of TB is the lungs (\npulmonary TB\n), but other organs can be involved. In the United States, most people with primary TB get better and have no further evidence of disease. Disseminated TB develops in a small number of infected people whose immune systems do not successfully contain the primary infection.\nDisseminated disease can occur within weeks of the primary infection. Sometimes, it occurs years after you become infected. You are more likely to get this type of TB if you have a weakened immune system due to disease (such as AIDS) or certain medicines."}

Symptoms depend on the affected areas of the body and can include:\nAbdominal pain\nor\nswelling\nChills\nCough and shortness of breath\nFatigue\nFever\nGeneral discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (\nmalaise\n)\nJoint pain\nPale skin due to anemia (\npallor\n)\nSweating\nSwollen glands\nWeight loss\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

It is very important that you take the pills the way your provider instructs.\nWhen people do not take their TB medicines as instructed, the infection can become much more difficult to treat. The TB bacteria can become resistant to treatment. This means the medicines no longer work.\nWhen there is concern that a person may not take all the medicines as directed, a provider may need to watch the person take the prescribed medicines. This approach is called directly observed therapy. In this case, medicines may be given 2 or 3 times a week, as prescribed by a provider.\nYou may need to stay at home or be admitted to a hospital for 2 to 4 weeks to avoid spreading the disease to others until you are no longer contagious.\nYour provider may be required by law to report your TB illness to the local health department. Your health care team will ensure that you receive the best care.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost forms of disseminated TB respond well to treatment."}

Skin testing for TB is used in high-risk populations or in people who may have been exposed to TB, such as health care workers.\nPeople who have been exposed to TB should be skin tested immediately and have a follow-up test at a later date, if the first test is negative.\nA positive skin test means you have come into contact with the TB bacteria. It does not mean that you have active disease or are contagious. Talk to your provider about how to prevent developing active disease.\nPrompt treatment is extremely important in controlling the spread of TB from those who have active TB disease to those who have never been infected with TB.\nSome countries with a high incidence of TB give people a vaccination (called BCG) to prevent TB. The effectiveness of this vaccine is limited and it is not routinely used in the United States.\nPeople who have had BCG may still be skin tested for TB."}
