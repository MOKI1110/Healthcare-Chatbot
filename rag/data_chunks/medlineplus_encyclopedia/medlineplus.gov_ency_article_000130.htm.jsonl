Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCoal worker's pneumoconiosis\nCoal worker's pneumoconiosis\nCoal worker's pneumoconiosis (CWP) is a lung disease that results from breathing in dust from coal, graphite, or man-made carbon over a long time.\nCWP is also known as black lung disease.\nCauses\nCWP occurs in two forms: simple and complicated (also called progressive massive fibrosis, or PMF).\nYour risk for developing CWP depends on how long you have been around coal dust. Most people with this disease are older than 50. Smoking does not increase your risk for developing this disease, but it may have an added harmful effect on the lungs.\nIf CWP occurs with\nrheumatoid arthritis\n, it is called\nCaplan syndrome\n.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of CWP include:\nCough\nShortness of breath\nCoughing up of black sputum\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about your symptoms.\nTests that may be done include:\nChest x-ray\nChest CT scan\nLung function tests\nTreatment"}

Information can be found at the American Lung Association: Treating and Managing Coal Worker's Pneumoconiosis website:\nwww.lung.org/lung-health-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/black-lung/treating-and-managing\n.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nOutcome for the simple form is usually good. It rarely causes disability or death."}

The complicated form may cause shortness of breath that worsens over time.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nChronic\nbronchitis\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n(COPD)\nCor pulmonale\n(failure of the right side of the heart)\nRespiratory failure\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall your provider right away if you develop a cough, shortness of breath, fever, or other signs of a lung infection, especially if you think you have the flu. Since your lungs are already damaged, it's very important to have the infection treated right away. This will prevent breathing problems from becoming severe, as well as further damage to your lungs.\nPrevention\nWear a protective mask when working around coal, graphite, or man-made carbon. Follow directions to prevent high-level exposure. Companies should enforce the maximum permitted dust levels."}
