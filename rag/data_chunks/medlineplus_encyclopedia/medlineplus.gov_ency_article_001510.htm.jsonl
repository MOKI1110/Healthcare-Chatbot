This is called secondary vaginal cancer.\nCancer that starts in the vagina is called primary vaginal cancer. This type of cancer is rare. Most primary vaginal cancers start in skin-like cells called squamous cells. This cancer is known as squamous cell carcinoma. The other types include:\nAdenocarcinoma\nMelanoma\nSarcoma\nThe cause of squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina is unknown. But a history of cervical cancer is common in women with squamous cell carcinoma of the vagina. So it may be associated with\nhuman papilloma virus\n(HPV) infection.\nMost women with squamous cell cancer of the vagina are over 50.\nAdenocarcinoma of the vagina tends to affect younger women. The average age at which this cancer is diagnosed is 19."}

Most women are treated with\nradiation\n. If the tumor is cervical cancer that has spread to the vagina, radiation and\nchemotherapy\nare both given.\nSarcoma may be treated with a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\nsupport group\nwhose members share common experiences and problems.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook for women with vaginal cancer depends on the size and the stage of disease and the specific type of tumor.\nPossible Complications\nVaginal cancer may spread to other areas of the body."}
