The most common type of ear infection is called otitis media. It is caused by swelling and infection of the middle ear. The middle ear is located just behind the eardrum.\nAn acute ear infection starts over a short period and is painful. Ear infections that last a long time or come and go are called\nchronic ear infections\n.\nCauses\nThe eustachian tube runs from the middle of each ear to the back of the throat. Normally, this tube drains fluid that is made in the middle ear. If this tube gets blocked, fluid can build up. This can lead to infection.\nEar infections are common in infants and children because their eustachian tubes are easily clogged.\nEar infections can also occur in adults, although they are much less common than in children.\nAnything that causes the eustachian tubes to become swollen or blocked may lead to more fluid buildup in the middle ear behind the eardrum."}

Sudden drainage of yellow or green fluid from the ear may mean the eardrum has ruptured.\nAll acute ear infections involve fluid behind the eardrum. At home, you can use an electronic ear monitor to check for this fluid. You can buy this device at a drugstore. You still need to see your child's provider to confirm an ear infection.\nExams and Tests\nYour provider will take your medical history and ask about symptoms.\nYour provider will look inside the ears using an instrument called an otoscope."}

Treating the pain and allowing the body time to heal itself is often all that is needed:\nApply a warm cloth or warm water bottle to the affected ear.\nUse over-the-counter pain relief drops for ears. Or, ask your provider about prescription eardrops to relieve pain.\nTake over-the-counter medicines such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen for pain or fever.
