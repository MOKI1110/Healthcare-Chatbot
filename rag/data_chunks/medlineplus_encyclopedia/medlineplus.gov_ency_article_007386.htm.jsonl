The thigh bone is called the femur. It is part of the hip joint.\nHip pain\nis a related topic.\nDescription\nYou may receive general anesthesia for this surgery. This means you will be unconscious and unable to feel pain. You may have\nspinal anesthesia\n. With this kind of anesthesia, medicine is put into your back to make you numb below your waist. You may also receive anesthesia through your veins to make you sleepy during the surgery.\nThe type of surgery you have depends on the kind of fracture you have and also your general health.\nIf your fracture is in the neck of the femur (the part just below the top of the bone) you may have a hip pinning procedure. During this surgery:\nYou lie on a special table."}

Often, more than one piece of bone is broken in this type of fracture. During this surgery:\nYou lie on a special table. This allows your surgeon to use an x-ray machine to see how well the parts of your hip bone line up.\nThe surgeon makes a surgical cut on the side of your thigh.\nThe metal plate or nail is attached with a few screws.\nThis surgery takes 1 to 3 hours.\nYour surgeon may perform a total hip replacement or partial hip replacement (\nhemiarthroplasty\n) if there is concern that your hip will not heal well using one of the procedures above."}

Hemiarthroplasty replaces only the ball part of your hip joint. Total hip replacement replaces the ball and the socket part of the hip.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nIf a hip fracture is not treated, you may need to stay in a chair or bed for a few months until the fracture is healed. This can lead to life-threatening medical problems, especially if you are older. Surgery is often recommended because of these risks.\nRisks\nThe following are risks of surgery:\nAvascular\nnecrosis\n. This is when the blood supply in part of the femur is cut off for a period of time. This can cause part of the bone to die even after the fracture has healed.\nInjury to nerves or blood vessels.\nParts of the hip bone may not join together at all or may join in an incorrect position.\nBlood clots\nin the legs or lungs.\nMental confusion or\ndelirium\n. Older adults who fracture a hip may already have problems thinking clearly."}

This may require you to take antibiotics or have more surgeries to eradicate the infection.\nBefore the Procedure\nYou will likely be admitted to the hospital because of a hip fracture. You probably will not be able to put any weight on your leg or get out of bed.\nTell your surgeon and health care provider what medicines you are taking. This includes medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\nOn the day of the surgery:\nYou will likely be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight before your surgery. This includes chewing gum and breath mints."}

Rinse your mouth with water if it feels dry, but do not swallow.\nTake the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\nIf you are going to the hospital from home, be sure to arrive at the scheduled time.\nAfter the Procedure\nYou will stay in the hospital for 3 to 5 days. Full recovery will take from 3 to 4 months to a year.\nAfter surgery:\nYou will have an IV (a catheter, or tube, that is inserted into a vein, usually in your arm). You will receive fluids through the IV until you are able to drink on your own.\nSpecial compression stockings on your legs help improve blood flow in your legs. These reduce your risk of getting\nblood clots\n, which are more common after hip surgery.\nYour surgeon will prescribe pain medicines.
