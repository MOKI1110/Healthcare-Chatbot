The umbilical cord is the cord connecting the baby to the mother's womb (uterus).\nCord blood testing can be done to evaluate a newborn's health.\nHow the Test is Performed\nRight after the birth of your baby, the umbilical cord is clamped and cut. If cord blood is to be drawn, another clamp is placed 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 centimeters) away from the first."}

If cord blood is to be drawn, another clamp is placed 8 to 10 inches (20 to 25 centimeters) away from the first. The section between the clamps is cut and a blood sample is collected into a specimen tube.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special steps are needed to prepare for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will not feel anything beyond the normal birthing process.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nCord blood testing is done to measure the following in your baby's blood:\nBilirubin\nlevel\nBlood culture\n(if an infection is suspected)\nBlood gases (including oxygen, carbon dioxide, and pH levels)\nBlood sugar level\nBlood type\nand Rh\nComplete blood count (\nCBC\n)\nPlatelet count\nNormal Results\nNormal values mean that all items checked are within normal range.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA low pH (less than 7.04 to 7.10) means there are higher levels of acids in the baby's blood. This might occur when the baby does not get enough oxygen during labor."}

This might occur when the baby does not get enough oxygen during labor. One reason for this could be that the umbilical cord was compressed during labor or delivery.\nA blood culture that is positive for bacteria means your baby has a blood infection.\nHigh level of blood sugar (glucose) in the cord blood may be found if the mother has diabetes. The newborn will be watched for hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) after delivery.\nHigh level of bilirubin in the newborn\nhas many causes, which could be due to infections the baby gets.\nNote: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nConsiderations\nMost hospitals routinely collect cord blood for testing at birth. The process is fairly easy and this is the only time when this type of blood sample can be collected.\nYou can also decide to bank or donate cord blood at the time of your delivery. Cord blood can be used to treat certain types of bone marrow-related cancers."}

Cord blood can be used to treat certain types of bone marrow-related cancers. Some parents may choose to save (bank) their child's cord blood for this and other future medical purposes.\nCord blood banking for personal use is done by both cord blood banks and private companies. There is a charge for the service if you use a private service. If you choose to bank your infant's cord blood, you should talk to your health care provider about the pros and cons of different options.\nReferences\nAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists.
