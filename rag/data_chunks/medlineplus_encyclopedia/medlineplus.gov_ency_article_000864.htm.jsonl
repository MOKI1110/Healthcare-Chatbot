For this reason, ecthyma is often called deep impetigo.\nCauses\nEcthyma is most often caused by the streptococcus bacteria. Sometimes, staphylococcus bacteria cause this skin infection on its own or in combination with streptococcus.\nThe infection may start in skin that has been injured due to a scratch, rash, or insect bite. The infection often develops on the legs. People with diabetes or a weakened immune system are more prone to ecthyma.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom of ecthyma is a small\nblister\nwith a red border that may be filled with pus. The blister is similar to that seen with\nimpetigo\n, but the infection spreads much deeper into the skin.\nAfter the blister goes away, a crusty ulcer appears.\nExams and Tests\nYour  health  care provider  can usually diagnose this condition simply by looking at your skin."}

In rare cases, the fluid inside the blister  is sent to a lab for closer examination, or a\nskin biopsy\nneeds to  be done.\nTreatment\nYour  provider will usually prescribe antibiotics that you need to take by mouth (oral antibiotics). Very early cases may be treated with antibiotics that you apply to the affected area (topical antibiotics).  Serious infections  may need antibiotics given through a vein (intravenous antibiotics).\nPlacing a warm, wet cloth over the area can help remove ulcer crusts. Your  provider may recommend antiseptic soap or peroxide washes to speed recovery.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nEcthyma can sometimes result in scarring.\nPossible Complications\nThis condition may lead to:\nSpread of infection to other parts of the body\nPermanent skin damage with scarring\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nMake an appointment with your provider if you have symptoms of ecthyma.\nPrevention\nCarefully clean the skin after an injury, such as a bite or scratch."}
