Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nGastric bypass surgery\nGastric bypass surgery\nGastric bypass is surgery that helps you lose weight by changing how your stomach and small intestine handle the food you eat.\nAfter the surgery, your stomach will be smaller. You will feel full with less food.\nAlso, the food you eat will no longer go into some parts of your small intestine that absorb the nutrients in food. Because of this, your body will not get all of the calories from the food you eat.\nDescription\nYou will have\ngeneral anesthesia\nbefore this surgery. You will be asleep and pain-free.\nThere are 2 steps during gastric bypass surgery:\nThe first step makes your stomach smaller. Your surgeon uses staples to divide your stomach into a small upper section and a larger bottom section. The top section of your stomach (called the pouch) is where the food you eat will go. The pouch is about the size of a walnut. It holds only about 1 ounce (oz) or 28 grams (g) of food. Because of this you will eat less and lose weight.\nThe second step is the bypass."}

The pouch is about the size of a walnut. It holds only about 1 ounce (oz) or 28 grams (g) of food. Because of this you will eat less and lose weight.\nThe second step is the bypass. Your surgeon connects a part of your small intestine (the jejunum) to a small hole in your pouch. The food you eat will now travel from the pouch into this new opening and into your small intestine below where it would normally go, thus bypassing part of your small intestine. As a result, your body will absorb fewer calories.\nGastric bypass can be done in two ways. With open surgery, your surgeon makes a large surgical cut to open your belly. The bypass is done by working on your stomach, small intestine, and other organs.\nAnother way to do this surgery is to use a scope with a tiny camera, called a laparoscope. This camera is placed in your belly. The surgery is called laparoscopy. The scope allows the surgeon to see inside your belly.\nIn laparoscopic surgery:\nThe surgeon makes 4 to 6 small cuts in your belly.\nThe scope and instruments needed to perform the surgery are inserted through these cuts.\nThe camera is connected to a video monitor in the operating room."}

Someone with a BMI of 35 or more is about 80 or more pounds (lbs) (36.3 kg) over their recommended weight. A normal BMI is 18.5 to 24.9.
