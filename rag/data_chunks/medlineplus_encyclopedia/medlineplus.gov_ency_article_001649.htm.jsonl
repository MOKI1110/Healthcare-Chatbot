Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEnlarged adenoids\nEnlarged adenoids\nThe adenoids are lymph tissues that sit in your upper airway between your nose and the back of your throat. They are similar to the tonsils.\nEnlarged adenoids means this tissue is swollen.\nCauses\nEnlarged adenoids may be normal. They may grow bigger when the baby grows in the womb. The adenoids help the body prevent or fight infections by trapping bacteria and germs.\nInfections can cause the adenoids to become swollen. The adenoids may stay enlarged even when you are not sick.\nSymptoms\nChildren with enlarged adenoids often breathe through the mouth because the nose is blocked. Mouth breathing occurs mostly at night, but may be present during the day.\nMouth breathing may lead to the following symptoms:\nBad breath\nCracked lips\nDry mouth\nPersistent\nrunny nose\nor\nnasal congestion\nEnlarged adenoids may also cause sleep problems."}
