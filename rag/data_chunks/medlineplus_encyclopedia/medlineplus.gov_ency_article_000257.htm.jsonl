Diverticulitis occurs when these pouches become inflamed or infected. Most often, these pouches are in the lower part of the large intestine (colon).\nCauses\nThe formation of pouches or sacs on the intestinal lining is called diverticulosis. It is found in more than half of Americans over age 60. However, no one knows exactly what causes the pouches to form.\nEating a low-fiber diet mostly made up of processed foods may be a cause. Constipation and hard stools are more likely when you do not eat enough fiber. Straining to pass stools increases the pressure in the colon or intestines, which may lead to the formation of these pouches.\nIn some cases, one of the pouches can become inflamed and a small tear develops in the lining of the intestine. This can lead to an infection at the site. When this occurs, the condition is called diverticulitis."}

The cause of diverticulitis is not known.\nSymptoms\nPeople with\ndiverticulosis\noften have no symptoms, but they may have bloating and cramping in the lower part of the belly. Rarely, they may notice blood in their stool or on toilet paper.\nSymptoms of diverticulitis are more severe and often start suddenly, but they may become worse over a few days. They include:\nPain or discomfort, usually in the left lower part of the abdomen\nBloating or gas\nFever and chills\nNausea and vomiting\nNot feeling hungry and not eating\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you. This may show tenderness in the abdomen, especially in its left lower part. You may need blood tests to see if you have an infection.\nOther tests that help diagnose diverticulitis may include:\nCT scan\nUltrasound of the abdomen\nX-rays of the abdomen\nTreatment\nThe treatment of diverticulitis depends on how serious the symptoms are."}

Some people may need to be in the hospital, but often, the problem can be treated at home.\nTo help with the pain, your provider may suggest that you:\nRest in bed and use a heating pad on your belly.\nTake pain medicines (ask your provider which ones you should use).\nDrink only fluids for a day or two, and then slowly begin drinking thicker liquids and then eating foods.\nThe provider may treat you with antibiotics.\nAfter you are better, your provider may suggest that you add more fiber to your diet. Eating more fiber can help prevent future attacks. If you have bloating or gas, reduce the amount of fiber you eat for a few days.\nOnce these pouches have formed, you will have them for life. Diverticulitis can return, but some providers think a\nhigh-fiber diet\nmay lessen your chances of a recurrence.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost often, this is a mild condition that responds well to treatment. Some people will have more than one attack of diverticulitis. Surgery may be needed in some cases."}
