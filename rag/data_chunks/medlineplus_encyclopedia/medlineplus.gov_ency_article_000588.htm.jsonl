Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nWaldenstrom macroglobulinemia\nWaldenstrom macroglobulinemia\nWaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia (WM) is a cancer of the B lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). WM is associated with the overproduction of proteins called IgM\nantibodies\n.\nCauses\nWM is a result of a condition called lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. This is a\ncancer\nof the white blood cells, in which the B immune cells start dividing rapidly. The exact cause of too much production of the IgM antibody is unknown. Hepatitis C may increase the risk of WM. Gene mutations are often found in the malignant B cells.\nProduction of excess IgM antibodies can cause several types of problems:\nHyperviscosity, which causes the blood to become too thick."}

Gene mutations are often found in the malignant B cells.\nProduction of excess IgM antibodies can cause several types of problems:\nHyperviscosity, which causes the blood to become too thick. This can make it harder for blood to flow through small blood vessels.\nNeuropathy, or nerve damage, when the IgM antibody damages nerve tissue.\nAnemia\n, when the IgM antibody binds to red blood cells and damages them.\nKidney disease, when the IgM antibody deposits in kidney tissue.\nCryoglobulinemia\nand vasculitis (inflammation of the blood vessels) when the IgM antibody forms immune complexes with cold exposure.\nWM is very rare. Most people with this condition are over 65 years of age.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of WM may include any of the following:\nBleeding of the gums\nand nosebleeds\nBlurred or decreased vision\nBluish skin\nin the fingers after cold exposure\nDizziness\nor\nconfusion\nEasy bruising of the skin\nFatigue\nDiarrhea\nNumbness\n, tingling, or burning pain in the hands, feet, fingers, toes, ears, or nose\nRash\nSwollen glands\nUnintentional weight loss\nVision loss in one eye\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam may reveal a\nswollen spleen\n, liver, and lymph nodes."}

Levels are often higher than 3000 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 30 grams per liter (g/L). An immunofixation test will be done to show if the IgM antibody is derived from a single cell type (clonal).\nA serum viscosity test can tell if the blood has become thick."}

This condition is known as smoldering WM. No treatment is needed other than careful follow-up.\nIn people with symptoms, treatment aims at decreasing the symptoms and the risk of developing organ damage.
