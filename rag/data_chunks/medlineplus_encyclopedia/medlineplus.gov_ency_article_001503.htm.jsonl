It occurs at or around the time when an egg is released from the ovaries (ovulation).\nCauses\nOne in five women have pain around the time of ovulation. This is called mittelschmerz. The pain may occur just before, during, or after ovulation.\nThis pain can be explained in several ways. Just before the ovulation, the growth of the follicle where the egg develops may stretch the surface of the ovary. This can cause pain. At the time of ovulation, fluid or blood is released from the ruptured egg follicle. This may irritate the lining of the abdomen.\nSymptoms\nMittelschmerz may be felt on one side of the body during one month and then switch to the other side during the next month. It may also occur on the same side for many months in a row.\nSymptoms include lower-abdominal pain that:\nOccurs only on one side.\nGoes on for minutes to a few hours."}

It can last up to 24 to 48 hours.\nFeels like a sharp, cramping pain unlike other pain.\nIs severe (rare).\nMay switch sides from month to month.\nBegins midway through the menstrual cycle.\nExams and Tests\nA pelvic exam shows no problems. Other tests (such as an abdominal ultrasound or transvaginal pelvic ultrasound) may be done to look for other causes of ovarian or pelvic pain. These tests may be done if the pain is ongoing. In some cases, the ultrasound may show a collapsed ovarian follicle. This finding helps support for the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nMost of the time, treatment is not needed. Pain relievers may be needed if the pain is intense or lasts a long time. In patients with Mittelschmerz-related symptoms that interfere with their normal activities, the use of an oral contraceptive may be used to control symptoms.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMittelschmerz can be painful, but it is not harmful. It is not a sign of disease."}

It is important for you to discuss any pain you are having with your health care provider. There are other conditions that can cause similar pain that are much more serious and require treatment.\nPossible Complications\nMost of the time, there are no complications.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nOvulation pain seems to change.\nPain lasts longer than usual.\nPain occurs with vaginal bleeding.\nPrevention\nBirth control pills can be taken to prevent ovulation. This can help reduce pain that is linked to ovulation.\nAlternative Names\nOvulation pain; Midcycle pain\nImages\nFemale reproductive anatomy\nReferences\nChen JH. Acute and chronic pelvic pain.
