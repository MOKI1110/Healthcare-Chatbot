It may cause long-term or permanent damage to the ear and involves a hole in the eardrum (perforation) that does not heal.\nCauses\nThe eustachian tube runs from the middle of each ear to the back of the throat. This tube drains fluid made in the middle ear. If the eustachian tube becomes blocked, fluid can build up. When this happens, infection can occur."}

Chronic ear infections are much less common than acute ear infections.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a chronic ear infection may be less severe than symptoms of an acute infection."}

They may occur in one or both ears.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will look in the ears using an otoscope. The exam may reveal:\nDullness, redness in the middle ear\nAir bubbles in the middle ear\nThick fluid in the middle ear\nEardrum that sticks to the bones in the middle ear\nDraining fluid from the eardrum\nA hole in the eardrum\nAn eardrum that bulges out or pulls back inward (collapses)\nTests may include:\nCultures of the ear fluid that may show a bacterial infection.\nCT scan of the head\nor mastoids may show that the infection has spread beyond the middle ear.\nHearing tests may be needed.\nTreatment\nYour provider may prescribe antibiotics if the infection is caused by bacteria."}

The provider may recommend using a mild acidic solution (such as vinegar and water) for a hard-to-treat infected ear that has a hole. A surgeon may need to clean out (debride) tissue that has gathered inside the ear.\nOther surgeries that may be needed include:\nSurgery to clean the infection out of the mastoid bone (\nmastoidectomy\n)\nSurgery to repair or replace the small bones in the middle ear\nRepair of the eardrum\nEar tube surgery\n(myringotomy)\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nChronic ear infections often respond to treatment.
