The artificial joint is called a\nprosthesis\n. However, over time some or all parts of a prosthesis may wear out due to a number of reasons. The prosthesis may also loosen up with trauma or infection. When this happens, another surgery is needed to replace or repair the artificial knee joint. This is called total knee joint replacement revision.\nDescription\nThe results of a total knee joint replacement are often excellent. Most artificial knee joints last 10 to 15 years. Some last as long as 20 years before they loosen and need to be replaced again. Revision of knee joint replacement may either require replacement of the whole prosthesis or some of its parts.\nYou will not feel any pain during the surgery."}

You will have one of these two types of anesthesia:\nGeneral anesthesia\n-- This means you will be asleep and unable to feel pain.\nRegional (\nspinal or epidural\n) anesthesia -- Medicine is put into your back to make you numb below your waist. You will also get medicine to make you sleepy. And you may get medicine that will make you forget about the procedure, even though you are not fully asleep.\nAfter you receive anesthesia, your surgeon will:\nMake an incision following the same line used for the primary (initial) knee replacement surgery.\nAssess the soft tissues for any infection.\nExamine all the metal and plastic parts of the prosthesis to check if any part is worn, loose, or dislocated.\nRemove the existing implant, if required.\nRemove cement, if it was used in the primary surgery.\nReconstruct damaged bone around the knee, if there is significant bone loss."}
