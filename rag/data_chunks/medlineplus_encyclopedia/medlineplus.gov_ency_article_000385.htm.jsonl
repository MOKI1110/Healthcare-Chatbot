Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHypoparathyroidism\nHypoparathyroidism\nHypoparathyroidism is a disorder in which the parathyroid glands in the neck do not produce enough parathyroid hormone (PTH).\nCauses\nThere are 4 tiny parathyroid glands in the neck, located near or attached to the back side of the thyroid gland.\nThe parathyroid glands help regulate calcium absorption, use, and removal by the body. They do this by producing PTH. PTH helps control calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the blood and bone. It is important for healthy bones.\nHypoparathyroidism occurs when the glands produce too little PTH. The blood calcium level falls, and the phosphorus level rises.\nThe most common cause of hypoparathyroidism is injury to the parathyroid glands during thyroid or neck surgery."}

It may also be caused by any of the following:\nAutoimmune\nattack on the parathyroid glands (common)\nVery low magnesium level in the blood (reversible)\nRadioactive iodine treatment for hyperthyroidism (very rare)\nDiGeorge syndrome is a disease in which hypoparathyroidism occurs because all the parathyroid glands are missing at birth. This disease includes other health problems besides hypoparathyroidism. It is usually diagnosed in childhood.\nFamilial hypoparathyroidism occurs with other endocrine diseases such as adrenal insufficiency in a syndrome called type I polyglandular autoimmune syndrome (PGA I).\nSymptoms\nOnset of the disease is very gradual and symptoms can be mild. Many people diagnosed with hypoparathyroidism have had symptoms for years before they are diagnosed."}

These usually must be taken for life. Blood levels are measured regularly to make sure that the dose is correct. A high-calcium, low-phosphorous diet is recommended.\nInjections of PTH may be recommended for some people. Your provider can tell you if this medicine is right for you.\nPeople who have life-threatening attacks of low calcium levels or prolonged muscle contractions are given calcium through a vein (IV). Precautions are taken to prevent seizures or larynx spasms. Your heart is monitored for abnormal rhythms until you are stable. When the life-threatening attack has been controlled, treatment continues with medicine taken by mouth.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome is likely to be good if the diagnosis is made early."}

Excess treatment may sometimes interfere with kidney function, or even cause kidney failure.\nHypoparathyroidism increases the risk for:\nAddison disease\n(only if the cause is autoimmune)\nCataracts\nParkinson disease\nPernicious anemia\n(only if the cause is autoimmune)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop any symptoms of hypoparathyroidism.\nSeizures or breathing problems are an emergency."}
