When bacteria from the vagina or cervix travel to your womb, fallopian tubes, or ovaries, they can cause an infection.\nMost of the time, PID is caused by the bacteria\nchlamydia\nor\ngonorrhea\n. These are sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Having unprotected sex with someone who has an STI can cause PID.\nBacteria normally found in the cervix can also travel into the uterus and fallopian tubes during a medical procedure such as:\nChildbirth\nEndometrial biopsy\n(removing a small piece of your womb lining to test for cancer)\nGetting an\nintrauterine\ndevice (IUD)\nMiscarriage\nAbortion\nIn the United States, nearly 1 million women have PID each year."}

An ectopic pregnancy is when an egg grows outside of the uterus. It puts the mother's life in danger.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider may do a pelvic exam to look for:\nBleeding from your\ncervix\n. The cervix is the opening to your uterus.\nFluid coming out of your cervix.\nPain when your cervix is touched.\nTenderness in your uterus, tubes, or ovaries.\nYou may have lab tests to check for signs of body-wide infection:\nC-reactive protein\n(CRP)\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate\n(ESR)\nWBC count\nOther tests include:\nA swab taken of your vagina or cervix. This sample will be checked for gonorrhea, chlamydia, or other causes of PID.\nPelvic ultrasound or CT scan to see what else may be causing your symptoms."}

Follow up with your provider after you've finished the antibiotics to make sure that you no longer have the bacteria in your body.\nIt's very important that you practice safe sex in order to reduce your risk of getting infections, which could lead to PID.\nIf your PID is caused by an STI like gonorrhea or chlamydia, your sexual partner must be treated as well.\nIf you have more than one sexual partner, they must all be treated.\nIf your partner is not treated, they can infect you again, or can infect other people in the future.\nBoth you and your partner must finish taking all of the prescribed antibiotics.\nUse condoms until you both have finished taking antibiotics.\nPossible Complications\nPID infections can cause scarring of the pelvic organs."}
