Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRight heart ventricular angiography\nRight heart ventricular angiography\nRight heart ventricular angiography is a test that images the right chambers (atrium and ventricle) of the heart.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will get a mild sedative 30 minutes before the procedure. A cardiologist will cleanse the site and numb the area with a local anesthetic. Then a catheter will be inserted into a vein in your neck, arm, or groin.\nThe catheter will be moved into the right side of the heart. As the catheter is advanced, the doctor can record pressures from the right atrium and right ventricle.\nContrast material (\"dye\") is injected into the right side of the heart."}

As the catheter is advanced, the doctor can record pressures from the right atrium and right ventricle.\nContrast material (\"dye\") is injected into the right side of the heart. It helps the cardiologist determine the size and shape of the heart's chambers and evaluate their function as well as the function of the tricuspid and pulmonary valves.\nThe actual angiography will only last a few seconds, but the entire procedure will take longer, and if combined with other procedures may be considerably longer.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will not be allowed to eat or drink for 6 to 8 hours before the test. The procedure takes place in the hospital or a specialized procedure unit. Generally, you will be admitted the morning of the procedure. However, you may need to be admitted the night before.\nA health care provider will explain the procedure and its risks. You must sign a consent form.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will be given local anesthesia where the catheter is inserted. Afterward, the only thing you should feel is pressure at the site. You will not feel the catheter as it is moved through your veins into the right side of the heart."}
