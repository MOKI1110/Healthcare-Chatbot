Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCranial sutures\nCranial sutures\nCranial sutures are fibrous bands of tissue that connect the bones of the skull.\nInformation\nAn infant's skull is made up of 6 separate cranial (skull) bones:\nFrontal bone\nOccipital bone\nTwo parietal bones\nTwo temporal bones\nThese bones are held together by strong, fibrous, elastic tissues called sutures.\nThe spaces between the bones that remain open in babies and young children are called fontanelles. Sometimes, they are called soft spots. These spaces are a part of normal development. The cranial bones remain separate for about 12 to 18 months. They then grow together as part of normal growth. They stay connected throughout adulthood.\nTwo fontanelles usually are present on a newborn's skull:\nOn the top of the middle head, just forward of center (anterior fontanelle)\nIn the back of the middle of the head (posterior fontanelle)\nThe posterior fontanelle usually closes by age 1 to 2 months."}

It may already be closed at birth.\nThe anterior fontanelle usually closes sometime within 7 to 19 months of age.\nThe sutures and fontanelles are needed for the infant's brain growth and development. During childbirth, the flexibility of the sutures allows the bones to overlap so the baby's head can pass through the birth canal without pressing on and damaging their brain.\nDuring infancy and childhood, the sutures are flexible. This allows the brain to grow quickly and protects the brain from minor impacts to the head (such as when the infant is learning to hold his head up, roll over, and sit up). Without flexible sutures and fontanelles, the child's brain could not grow enough. The child would develop brain damage.\nFeeling the cranial sutures and fontanelles is one way that health care providers follow the child's growth and development. They are able to assess the pressure inside the brain by feeling the tension of the fontanelles."}
