Specifically, the immune system attacks the proteins that attach the top layer of skin (epidermis) to the bottom layer of skin.\nThis disorder usually occurs in older persons and is rare in young people. Symptoms come and go. The condition often goes away within 5 years.\nIn some cases, the condition is triggered by a medicine.\nSymptoms\nMost people with this disorder have itchy skin that may be severe. In most cases, there are blisters, called\nbullae\n.\nBlisters are usually located on the arms, legs, or middle of the body. In rare cases, blisters can form in the mouth.\nThe blisters may break open and form open sores (\nulcers\n).\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine the skin and ask about the symptoms."}

They will review your list of medicines.\nTests that may be done to help diagnose this condition include:\nBlood tests\nSkin biopsy\nof the blister or the area next to it\nTreatment\nAnti-inflammatory medicines called corticosteroids may be prescribed. They may be taken by mouth or applied to the skin. More powerful medicines may be used to help suppress the immune system if steroids do not work, or to allow lower steroid doses to be used.\nAntibiotics in the tetracycline family may be useful.\nNiacin\n(a B complex vitamin) is sometimes given along with tetracycline.\nYour provider may suggest self-care measures. These may include:\nApplying anti-inflammatory creams to the skin\nUsing mild soaps and applying moisturizer to the skin after bathing\nProtecting the affected skin from sun exposure and injury\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nBullous pemphigoid usually responds well to treatment. The medicine can often be stopped after several years."}
