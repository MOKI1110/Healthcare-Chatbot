They control your body's:\nMovements\nSenses\nThoughts and memories\nThey also help control the organs such as your heart and bowels.\nNerves are the pathways that carry signals to and from your brain and the rest of your body. The spinal cord is the bundle of nerves that runs from your brain down the center of your back. Nerves extend out from the spinal cord to every part of your body.\nAGING CHANGES AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE NERVOUS SYSTEM\nAs you age, your brain and nervous system go through natural changes. Your brain and spinal cord lose nerve cells and weight (atrophy). Nerve cells may begin to pass messages more slowly than in the past. Waste products or other chemicals such as beta amyloid can collect in the brain tissue as nerve cells break down. This can cause abnormal changes in the brain called plaques and tangles to form."}

Waste products or other chemicals such as beta amyloid can collect in the brain tissue as nerve cells break down. This can cause abnormal changes in the brain called plaques and tangles to form. A fatty brown pigment (\nlipofuscin\n) can also build up in nerve tissue.\nBreakdown of nerves can affect your senses. You might have reduced or lost reflexes or sensation. This leads to problems with movement and safety and makes it more likely to suffer falls.\nSlowing of thought, memory, and thinking is a normal part of aging. These changes are not the same in everyone. Some people have many changes in their nerves and brain tissue. Others have few changes. These changes are not always related to the effects on your ability to think.\nNERVOUS SYSTEM PROBLEMS IN OLDER PEOPLE\nDementia\nand severe memory loss are not a normal part of aging. They can be caused by brain diseases such as\nAlzheimer disease\n, which doctors believe is associated with plaques and tangles forming in the brain.\nDelirium is sudden confusion that leads to changes in thinking and behavior. It is often due to illnesses that are not related to the brain. Infection can cause an older person to become severely confused."}
