This is the tube that moves food from your throat to your stomach. After it is removed, the esophagus is rebuilt from part of your stomach or part of your large intestine.\nDescription\nDuring open esophagectomy, one or more large surgical cuts (incisions) are made in your belly, chest, or neck. Another way to remove the esophagus is\nlaparoscopically\n. The surgery is done through several small incisions, using a viewing scope.\nThis article discusses three types of open surgery. With any surgery, you will receive medicine (anesthesia) that will keep you asleep and pain-free.\nTranshiatal esophagectomy:\nThe surgeon makes two large cuts. One cut is in your neck area and one is in your upper belly.\nFrom the cut in the belly, the surgeon frees the stomach and lower part of the esophagus from the nearby tissues."}

From the cut in the neck, the rest of the esophagus is freed.\nThe surgeon then removes the part of your esophagus where the cancer or other problem is.\nYour stomach is then reshaped into a tube to make a new esophagus. It is joined to the remaining part of your esophagus with staples or stitches.\nDuring surgery, lymph nodes in your neck and belly are likely removed to determine if cancer has spread to them.\nA feeding tube is placed in your small intestine so that you can be fed while you are recovering from surgery.\nDrainage tubes may be left in the chest to remove fluid.\nTransthoracic esophagectomy:\nThis surgery is done in a similar way as the transhiatal procedure. But the upper cut is made in your right chest, not in the neck.\nEn bloc esophagectomy:\nThe surgeon makes large cuts in your neck, chest, and belly. All of your esophagus and part of your stomach are removed.\nThe rest of your stomach is reshaped into a tube and placed in your chest to replace your esophagus."}

If the stomach cannot be used, a part of the large intestine might be used instead.\nThe surgeon also removes all lymph nodes in your chest, neck, and belly.\nMost of these operations take 3 to 6 hours.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nMost of the time, esophagectomy is done to treat cancer of the esophagus or a severely damaged esophagus. You may also have radiation therapy or chemotherapy before or after surgery.\nSurgery to remove the lower esophagus may also be done to treat:\nA condition in which the ring of muscle in the esophagus does not work well (\nachalasia\n)\nSevere damage of the lining of the esophagus that can lead to cancer (\nBarrett esophagus\n)\nSevere trauma\nDestroyed esophagus\nSeverely damaged stomach\nRisks\nThis is major surgery and has many risks.
