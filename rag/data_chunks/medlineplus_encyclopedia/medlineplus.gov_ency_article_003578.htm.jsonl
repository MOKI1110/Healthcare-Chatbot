However, it may be done soon after the person swallowed the medicine, using stomach contents taken through\ngastric lavage\n(stomach pumping) or after vomiting.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed. If you are able, tell your health care provider what drugs (including prescription and over-the-counter medicines) you have taken, including when you took them and how much you consumed.\nThis test is sometimes part of an investigation for drug use or abuse."}
