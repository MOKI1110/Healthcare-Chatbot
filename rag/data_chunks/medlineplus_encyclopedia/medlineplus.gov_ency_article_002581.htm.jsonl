They are one of several classes of drugs used to treat the heart and related conditions. These medicines are a common cause of poisoning.\nCardiac glycoside overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose.\nCardiac glycosides are found in several plants, including the leaves of the foxglove plant. This plant is the original source of the medicine digitalis. People who eat a large amount of these leaves may develop symptoms of an\noverdose\n.\nLong-term (chronic) poisoning can occur in people who take cardiac glycosides every day. This can happen if someone develops kidney problems or becomes dehydrated (especially in the hot summer months). This problem usually occurs in older people.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose."}
