This happens most often when the weather is hot or humid. As your infant sweats, little red bumps and possibly tiny blisters form because the blocked glands cannot clear the sweat.\nInformation\nTo avoid heat rash, keep your baby cool and dry during warm weather.\nSome helpful suggestions:\nDuring the hot season, dress your baby in lightweight, soft, cotton clothing. Cotton is very absorbent and keeps moisture away from your baby's skin.\nIf air conditioning is not available, a fan may help cool your infant. Place the fan far enough away so that there is only a gentle breeze drifting over your infant.\nAvoid the use of powders, creams, and ointments. Baby powders do not improve or prevent heat rash. Creams and ointments tend to keep the skin warmer and block the pores.\nAlternative Names\nHeat rashes and babies; Prickly heat rash; Red miliaria\nImages\nHeat rash\nInfant heat rash\nReferences\nHoward RM, Frieden IJ."}
