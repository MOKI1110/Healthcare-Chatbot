The intestines are hollow, so bowel sounds echo through the abdomen much like the sounds heard from water pipes.\nMost bowel sounds are normal. They simply mean that the gastrointestinal tract is working. However, there are some cases in which abnormal sounds can indicate a problem. A health care provider can check abdominal sounds by listening to the abdomen with a stethoscope (\nauscultation\n).\nIleus\nis a condition in which there is a lack of intestinal activity. Many medical conditions may lead to ileus. This problem can cause gas, fluids, and the contents of the intestines to build up and break open (rupture) the bowel wall. The provider may be unable to hear any bowel sounds when listening to the abdomen.\nReduced (hypoactive) bowel sounds include a reduction in the loudness, tone, or regularity of the sounds."}

The provider may be unable to hear any bowel sounds when listening to the abdomen.\nReduced (hypoactive) bowel sounds include a reduction in the loudness, tone, or regularity of the sounds. They are a sign that intestinal activity has slowed.\nHypoactive bowel sounds are normal during sleep. They also occur normally for a short time after the use of certain medicines and after abdominal surgery. Decreased or absent bowel sounds often indicate constipation.\nIncreased (\nhyperactive\n) bowel sounds can sometimes be heard even without a stethoscope. Hyperactive bowel sounds mean there is an increase in intestinal activity."}

Hyperactive bowel sounds mean there is an increase in intestinal activity. This may happen with diarrhea or after eating.\nAbdominal sounds are always evaluated together with symptoms such as:\nGas\nNausea\nPresence or absence of bowel movements\nVomiting\nIf bowel sounds are hypoactive or hyperactive and there are other abnormal symptoms, you should continue to follow-up with your provider.\nFor example, no bowel sounds after a period of hyperactive bowel sounds can mean there is a rupture of the intestines, or strangulation of the bowel and death (\nnecrosis\n) of the bowel tissue.\nVery high-pitched bowel sounds may be a sign of early\nbowel obstruction\n.\nCauses\nMost of the sounds you hear in your stomach and intestines are due to normal digestion. They are not a cause for concern. Many conditions can cause hyperactive or hypoactive bowel sounds."}
