Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPolycystic ovary syndrome\nPolycystic ovary syndrome\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a condition in which a woman has increased levels of male hormones (androgens). Many problems occur as a result of this increase of hormones, including:\nMenstrual irregularities\nInfertility\nSkin problems, such as acne and increased hair growth\nIncreased number of small cysts in the ovaries\nInsulin resistance, with an increased risk of developing diabetes\nCauses\nPCOS is linked to changes in hormone levels that make it harder for the ovaries to release fully-grown (mature) eggs. The reasons for these changes are unclear. The hormones affected are:\nEstrogen and progesterone, the female hormones that help a woman's ovaries release eggs\nAndrogen, a male hormone that is found in small amounts in women\nNormally, one or more eggs are released during a woman's cycle. This is known as ovulation. In most cases, this release of eggs occurs about 2 weeks after the start of a menstrual period.\nIn many women with PCOS, mature eggs are not released."}

This is known as ovulation. In most cases, this release of eggs occurs about 2 weeks after the start of a menstrual period.\nIn many women with PCOS, mature eggs are not released. Instead, they stay in the ovaries with a small amount of fluid (cyst) around them. The affected ovary may be slightly enlarged. There can be many of these. However, not all women with the condition will have ovaries with this appearance.\nWomen with PCOS have cycles where ovulation does not occur every month which may contribute to\ninfertility\nThe other symptoms of this disorder are due to the high levels of male hormones.\nMost of the time, PCOS is diagnosed in women in their 20s or 30s. However, it may also affect teenage girls. The symptoms often begin when a girl's periods start."}

Women with this disorder often have a mother or sister who has similar symptoms.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of PCOS include changes in the menstrual cycle, such as:\nNot getting a period after you have had one or more normal ones during puberty (\nsecondary amenorrhea\n)\nIrregular periods that may come and go, and be very light to very heavy\nOther symptoms of PCOS include:\nExtra body hair that grows on the chest, belly, face, and around the nipples\nAcne on the face, chest, or back\nSkin changes, such as dark or thick skin markings and creases around the armpits, groin, neck, and breasts\nThe development of male characteristics is not typical of PCOS and may indicate another problem. The following changes may indicate another problem apart from PCOS:\nThinning hair on the head at the temples, called male pattern baldness\nEnlargement of the clitoris\nDeepening of the voice\nDecrease in breast size\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam.
