Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFocal segmental glomerulosclerosis\nFocal segmental glomerulosclerosis\nFocal segmental glomerulosclerosis is scar tissue in the filtering unit of the kidney. This structure is called the glomerulus. The glomeruli serve as filters that help the body get rid of harmful substances. Each kidney has thousands of glomeruli.\n\"Focal\" means that some of the glomeruli become scarred. Others remain normal. \"Segmental\" means that only part of an individual glomerulus is damaged.\nCauses\nThe cause of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis is often unknown.\nThe condition affects both children and adults. It occurs slightly more often in men and boys. It is also more common in African Americans."}

This exam may show tissue swelling (edema) and high blood pressure. Signs of kidney (renal) failure and excess fluid may develop as the condition gets worse.\nTests may include:\nKidney biopsy\nKidney function tests\n(blood and urine)\nUrinalysis\nUrine microscopy\nUrine protein\nTreatment\nTreatments may include:\nMedicines to reduce the body's inflammatory response.\nMedicines to lower blood pressure."}
