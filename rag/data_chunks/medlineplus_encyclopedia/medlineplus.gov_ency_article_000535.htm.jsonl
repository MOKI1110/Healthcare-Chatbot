Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nImmune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)\nImmune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP)\nImmune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is a\nbleeding disorder\nin which the immune system destroys platelets, which are necessary for normal blood clotting. People with the disease have too few platelets in the blood.\nCauses\nITP occurs when certain immune system cells produce\nantibodies\nagainst platelets. Platelets help your blood clot by clumping together to plug small holes in damaged blood vessels.\nThe antibodies attach to the platelets. The body destroys the platelets that carry the antibodies.\nIn children, the disease sometimes follows a viral infection. In adults, it is more often a long-term (chronic) disease and can occur after a viral infection, with use of certain medicines, during pregnancy, or as part of an immune disorder.\nITP affects women more often than men. It is more common in children than adults."}

It is more common in children than adults. In children, the disease affects boys and girls equally.\nSymptoms\nITP symptoms can include any of the following:\nAbnormally heavy periods in women\nBleeding into the skin\n, often around the shins, causing a skin rash that looks like pinpoint red spots (petechial rash)\nEasy bruising\nNosebleed or bleeding in the mouth\nExams and Tests\nBlood tests will be done to check your\nplatelet count\n.\nbone marrow aspiration\nor\nbiopsy\nmay also be done.\nTreatment\nIn children, the disease usually goes away without treatment. Some children may need treatment.\nAdults are usually started on a steroid medicine called prednisone or dexamethasone. In some cases, surgery to remove the spleen (\nsplenectomy\n) is recommended. This increases the platelet count in about half of people."}

In rare cases, ITP may become a long-term condition in adults and reappear, even after a symptom-free period.\nPossible Complications\nSudden and severe loss of blood from the digestive tract may occur. Bleeding into the brain may also occur.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nGo to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if severe bleeding occurs, or if other new symptoms develop.\nAlternative Names\nITP; Immune thrombocytopenia; Bleeding disorder - idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura; Bleeding disorder - ITP; Autoimmune - ITP; Low platelet count - ITP\nImages\nBlood cells\nReferences\nAbrams CS.
