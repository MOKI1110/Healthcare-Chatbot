Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nGlucagon blood test\nGlucagon blood test\nA glucagon blood test measures the amount of a hormone called glucagon in your blood. Glucagon is produced by specific cells in the pancreas. It helps regulate your blood sugar level by increasing blood sugar when it is too low.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample is needed\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour health care provider will tell you if you need to fast (not eat anything) for a period of time before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nGlucagon stimulates the liver to release glucose. As the level of blood sugar decreases, the pancreas releases more glucagon."}

This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nGlucagon stimulates the liver to release glucose. As the level of blood sugar decreases, the pancreas releases more glucagon. And as blood sugar increases, the pancreas releases less glucagon.\nThe provider may measure glucagon level if a person has symptoms of:\nDiabetes\n(not commonly measured)\nGlucagonoma\n(rare tumor of the pancreas) with symptoms of a skin rash called necrotizing migratory erythema, weight loss, mild diabetes,\nanemia\n,\nstomatitis\n,\nglossitis\nGrowth hormone deficiency in children\nLiver\ncirrhosis\n(scarring of the liver and poor liver function)\nLow blood sugar (\nhypoglycemia\n) -- most common reason\nMultiple endocrine neoplasia type I\n(disease in which one or more of the endocrine glands are overactive or form a tumor)\nPancreatitis\n(inflammation of the pancreas)\nNormal Results\nThe normal range is 25 to 50 pg/mL.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may indicate that the person may have a condition described under Why the Test is Performed.\nSome experts now believe that high glucagon levels in the blood contribute to the development of diabetes instead of just a low level of insulin. Medicines are being developed to decrease glucagon levels or block the signal from glucagon in the liver.\nWhen your blood sugar is low, the level of glucagon in your blood should be high. If it is not increased, this can help identify people that are at higher risk of severe hypoglycemia that can be dangerous.\nGlucagon can be increased by prolonged fasting.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
