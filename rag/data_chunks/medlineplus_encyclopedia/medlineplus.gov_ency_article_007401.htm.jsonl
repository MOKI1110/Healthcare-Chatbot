Problems with these muscles can lead to\ngastroesophageal reflux disease\n(GERD).\nThis surgery can also be done during a\nhiatal hernia\nrepair.\nThis article discusses anti-reflux surgery in children.\nDescription\nThe most common type of anti-reflux surgery is called fundoplication. This surgery most often takes 2 to 3 hours.\nYour child will be given general anesthesia before the surgery. That means the child will be asleep and unable to feel pain during the procedure.\nThe surgeon will use stitches to wrap the upper part of your child's stomach around the end of the esophagus. This helps prevent stomach acid and food from flowing back up.\nA gastrostomy tube (g-tube) may be put in place if your child has had swallowing or feeding problems."}

This helps prevent stomach acid and food from flowing back up.\nA gastrostomy tube (g-tube) may be put in place if your child has had swallowing or feeding problems. This tube helps with feeding and releases air from your child's stomach.\nAnother surgery, called\npyloroplasty\nmay also be done. This surgery widens the opening between the stomach and small intestine so the stomach can empty faster.\nThis surgery may be done several ways, including:\nOpen repair -- The surgeon will make a large cut in the child's belly area (abdomen).\nLaparoscopic repair -- The surgeon will make 3 to 5 small cuts in the belly. A thin, hollow tube with a tiny camera on the end (a laparoscope) is placed through one of these cuts. Other tools are passed through the other surgical cuts.\nThe surgeon may need to switch to an open procedure if there is bleeding, a lot of scar tissue from earlier surgeries, or if the child is very overweight.\nEndoluminal fundoplication is similar to a laparoscopic repair, but the surgeon reaches the stomach by going through the mouth."}

Small clips are used to tighten the connection between the stomach and esophagus.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nAnti-reflux surgery is usually done to treat GERD in children only after medicines have not worked or complications develop. Your child's health care provider may suggest anti-reflux surgery when:\nYour child has symptoms of heartburn that get better with medicines, but you do not want your child to continue taking these medicines.\nSymptoms of heartburn are burning in their stomach, throat, or chest, burping or gas bubbles, or problems swallowing food or fluids.\nPart of your child's stomach is getting stuck in the chest or is twisting around itself.\nYour child has a narrowing of the esophagus (called stricture) or bleeding in the esophagus.\nYour child is not growing well or is\nfailing to thrive\n.\nYour child has a lung infection caused by breathing contents of the stomach into the lungs (called\naspiration pneumonia\n).\nGERD causes a chronic cough or hoarseness in your child.\nRi"}
