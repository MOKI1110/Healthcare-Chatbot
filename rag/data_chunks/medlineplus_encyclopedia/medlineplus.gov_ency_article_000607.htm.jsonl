Questions will focus on symptoms and possible exposure to someone who might have the same symptoms, such as a stiff neck and fever.\nIf your provider thinks meningitis is possible, a lumbar puncture (\nspinal tap\n) will likely be done. This is to obtain a sample of spinal fluid for testing.\nOther tests that may be done include:\nBlood culture\nChest x-ray\nCT scan of the head\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nGram stain\nor other special stains, and\nculture of the spinal fluid\nTreatment\nAntibiotics will be started as soon as possible. Ceftriaxone is one of the most commonly used antibiotics.\nIf the antibiotic is not working and your provider suspects antibiotic resistance, vancomycin or rifampin may be used. Sometimes, corticosteroids are also used.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMeningitis is a dangerous infection and it can be deadly. The sooner it is treated, the better your chance for recovery."}
