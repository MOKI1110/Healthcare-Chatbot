Early symptoms include:\nAppetite loss\nFatigue\nLow fever\nMuscle and joint aches\nNausea and vomiting\nYellow skin and dark urine\nSymptoms will go away in a few weeks to months if your body is able to fight off the infection. Some people never get rid of the HBV. This is called chronic hepatitis B.\nPeople with chronic hepatitis may not have symptoms and may not know they are infected."}

It can help detect:\nNew infection\nOlder infection that is still active\nOlder infection that is no longer active\nThe following tests are done to look for liver damage if you have chronic hepatitis B:\nAlbumin level\n.\nLiver function tests\n.\nProthrombin time\n.\nOther blood tests may be used to assess how much liver scarring you have.\nYou may also have a test to measure the level of HBV in your blood (viral load). This lets your health care provider know how your treatment is working.\nImaging tests, such as ultrasound, MRI, and others are also often recommended.\nSCREENING\nThe CDC recommends that all adults over age 18 be screened for Hepatitis B. This may be needed even when they have no symptoms."}

Factors that lead to increased risk include:\nThe risk factors described above in the\nCauses\nsection.\nPeople from countries where a higher number of people have hepatitis B. These countries or areas include Japan, some Mediterranean countries, parts of Asia and the Middle East, West Africa, and South Sudan.\nTreatment\nAcute hepatitis, unless severe, needs no treatment. Liver and other body functions are watched using blood tests. You should get plenty of rest, drink plenty of fluids, and eat healthy foods.\nSome people with chronic hepatitis B may be treated with antiviral drugs. These medicines can decrease or remove hepatitis B from the blood. Examples include pills such as tenofovir  (Viread), entecavir (Baraclude), and lamivudine (Epivir) or an injection called interferon. They also help to reduce the risk for cirrhosis and liver cancer.\nIt is not always clear which people with chronic hepatitis B should receive drug therapy and when it should be started."}

You are more likely to receive these medicines if:\nYour liver function is quickly becoming worse.\nYou develop symptoms of long-term liver damage.\nYou have high levels of the HBV in your blood.\nYou are pregnant.\nFor these medicines to work best, you need to take them as instructed by your provider. Ask what side effects you can expect and what to do if you have them. Not everybody who takes these medicines responds well.\nIf you develop liver failure, you may be considered for a\nliver transplant\n. A liver transplant is the only cure in some cases of liver failure.\nOther steps you can take:\nAvoid alcohol.\nCheck with your provider before taking any over-the-counter medicines or herbal supplements. This includes medicines such as acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen.\nSevere liver damage or\ncirrhosis\ncan be caused by hepatitis B.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with HBV condition and their families can be found by joining a\nsupport group\n."}

Very few adults who get the virus develop chronic hepatitis B.\nA newborn born to a mother with hepatitis B is given hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG).\nThere is a much higher rate of\nliver cancer\nin people who have chronic hepatitis B. For this reason, people with Hepatitis B are screened for liver cancer.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nYou develop symptoms of hepatitis B.\nYour hepatitis B symptoms do not go away in 2 to 3 weeks, or new symptoms develop.\nYou belong to a high-risk group for hepatitis B and have not had the\nHBV vaccine\n.\nPrevention\nThe best way to prevent hepatitis B is to get the vaccine."}
