A similar problem, called toxic shock-like syndrome (TSLS), can be caused by a toxin from streptococcal bacteria. Very few staph or strep infections cause toxic shock syndrome.\nThe earliest cases of toxic shock syndrome involved women who used tampons during their menstrual periods. However, today less than one half of cases are linked to tampon use. Toxic shock syndrome can also occur with skin infections, burns, and after surgery."}
