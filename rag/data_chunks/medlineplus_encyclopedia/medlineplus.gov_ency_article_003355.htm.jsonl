Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNitroblue tetrazolium blood test\nNitroblue tetrazolium blood test\nThe nitroblue tetrazolium test checks if certain immune system cells can change a colorless chemical called nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) into a deep blue color.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nThe chemical NBT is added to the white blood cells in the lab. The cells are then examined under a microscope to see if the chemical has made them turn blue.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to screen for\nchronic granulomatous disease\n. This disorder is passed down in families."}

This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to screen for\nchronic granulomatous disease\n. This disorder is passed down in families. In people who have this disease, certain immune cells do not help protect the body from infections.\nHealth care providers may order this test for people who have frequent infections in the bones, skin, joints, lungs, and other parts of the body.\nNormal Results\nNormally, the white blood cells turn blue when NBT is added. This means that the cells should be able to kill bacteria and protect the person from infections.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly from one lab to another. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf the sample does not change color when NBT is added, the white blood cells are missing the substance needed to kill bacteria. This may be due to chronic granulomatous disease.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
