Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nOpiate and opioid withdrawal\nOpiate and opioid withdrawal\nOpiates or opioids are drugs used to treat pain. Opiates are derived from plants and opioids are synthetic drugs that have the same actions as opiates. The term narcotic refers to either type of drug.\nIf you stop or cut back on any of these drugs after heavy use for a few weeks or more, you will have a number of symptoms. This is called withdrawal.\nCauses\nIn 2018 in the United States, about 808,000 people reported using heroin during the past year. In the same year, about 11.4 million people used narcotic pain relievers without a prescription. Narcotic pain relievers include:\nCodeine\nHeroin\nHydrocodone (Vicodin)\nHydromorphone (Dilaudid)\nMethadone\nMeperidine (Demerol)\nMorphine\nOxycodone (Percocet or Oxycontin)\nFentanyl\nThese drugs can cause\nphysical dependence\n. This means that a person needs to take the drug to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Over time, more of the drug is needed for the same effect."}

This means that a person needs to take the drug to prevent withdrawal symptoms. Over time, more of the drug is needed for the same effect. This is called drug tolerance.\nHow long it takes to become physically dependent varies with each person.\nWhen the person stops taking the drugs the body needs time to recover. This causes withdrawal symptoms. Withdrawal from opiates can occur any time long-term use is stopped or cut back.\nSymptoms\nEarly symptoms of withdrawal include:\nAgitation\nAnxiety\nMuscle aches\nIncreased tearing\nInsomnia\nRunny nose\nSweating\nYawning\nLate symptoms of withdrawal include:\nAbdominal cramping\nDiarrhea\nDilated pupils\nGoosebumps\nNausea\nVomiting\nThese symptoms are very uncomfortable but are not life threatening. Symptoms usually start within 12 hours of last heroin usage and within 30 hours of last methadone exposure.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions about your medical history and drug use.\nUrine or blood tests to screen for drugs can confirm opiate or opioid use.\nOther testing will depend on your provider's concern for other problems."}

Treatment most often involves medicines, counseling, and support and is the same for both opiates and opioids. You and your provider will discuss your care and treatment goals.\nWithdrawal can take place in a number of settings:\nAt-home, using medicines and a strong support system. (This method is difficult, and withdrawal should be done very slowly.)\nUsing facilities set up to help people with detoxification (detox).\nIn a regular hospital, if symptoms are severe.\nMEDICINES\nMethadone\nrelieves withdrawal symptoms and helps with detox."}

It is also used as a long-term maintenance medicine for opioid dependence. After a period of maintenance, the dose may be decreased slowly over a long time. This helps reduce the intensity of withdrawal symptoms. Some people stay on methadone for years.\nBuprenorphine\n(Subutex) treats withdrawal from opiates, and it can shorten the length of detox. It may also be used for long-term maintenance, like methadone. Buprenorphine is often combined with Naloxone (Bunavail, Suboxone, Zubsolv), which helps prevent dependence and misuse.\nClonidine\nis used to help reduce anxiety, agitation, muscle aches, sweating, runny nose, and cramping that are due to withdrawal. It does not help reduce drug cravings.\nOther medicines can:\nTreat vomiting and diarrhea\nHelp with sleep\nNaltrexone\ncan help prevent relapse. It is available in pill form or as an injection."}

This is called aspiration, and it can cause lung infection. Vomiting and diarrhea can cause dehydration and body chemical and mineral (electrolyte) disturbances.\nThe biggest complication is returning to drug use.
