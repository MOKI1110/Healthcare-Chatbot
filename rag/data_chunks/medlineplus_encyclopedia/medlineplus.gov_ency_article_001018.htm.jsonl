The edge of the upper eyelid may be lower than it should be (ptosis) or there may be excess baggy skin in the upper eyelid (dermatochalasis). Eyelid drooping is often a combination of both conditions.\nThe problem is also called ptosis.\nCauses\nA drooping eyelid is most often due to:\nWeakness of the muscle that raises the eyelid\nDamage to the nerves that control that muscle\nLooseness of the skin of the upper eyelids\nDrooping eyelid can be:\nCaused by the normal aging process\nPresent before birth\nThe result of an injury or disease\nDiseases or illnesses that may lead to eyelid drooping include:\nTumor around or behind the eye\nDiabetes\nHorner syndrome\nMyasthenia gravis\nStroke\nSwelling in the eyelid, such as with a\nstye\nSymptoms\nDrooping may be present in one or both eyelids depending on the cause."}

The lid may cover only the upper eye, or the entire pupil may be covered.\nProblems with vision will often be present:\nAt first, just a sense that the very upper field of vision is being blocked.\nWhen the drooping eyelid covers the pupil of the eye, vision may become completely blocked.\nChildren may tip their head back to help them see under the eyelid.\nTiredness and achiness around the eyes may also be present.\nIncreased tearing\ndespite a feeling of dry eyes may be noticed.\nExams and Tests\nWhen drooping is on one side only, it is easy to detect by comparing the two eyelids. Drooping is more difficult to detect when it occurs on both sides, or if there is only a slight problem."}

Most cases of drooping eyelids are due to aging and there is no disease involved.\nEyelid lift surgery (blepharoplasty) is done to repair sagging or drooping upper eyelids.\nIn milder cases, it can be done to improve the appearance of the eyelids.\nIn more severe cases, surgery may be needed to correct interference with vision.\nIn children with ptosis, surgery may be needed to prevent\namblyopia\n, also called \"lazy eye.\"\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nA drooping eyelid can stay constant, worsen over time (be progressive), or come and go (be intermittent).\nThe expected outcome depends on the cause of the ptosis."}
