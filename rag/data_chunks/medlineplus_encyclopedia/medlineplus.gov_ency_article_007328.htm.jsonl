Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nDouble outlet right ventricle\nDouble outlet right ventricle\nDouble outlet right ventricle (DORV) is a heart disease that is\npresent from birth (congenital)\n. The aorta connects to the right ventricle (RV, the chamber of the heart that pumps oxygen-poor blood to the lungs), instead of to the left ventricle (LV, the chamber that normally pumps oxygen-rich blood to the body).\nBoth the pulmonary artery (which carries oxygen-poor blood to the lungs) and aorta (which carries oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the body) come from the same pumping chamber. No arteries are connected to the left ventricle (the chamber that normally pumps blood to the body).\nCauses\nIn a normal heart structure, the aorta connects to the LV. The pulmonary artery normally is connected to the RV. In DORV, both arteries flow out of the RV. This is a problem because the RV pumps oxygen-poor blood."}

The pulmonary artery normally is connected to the RV. In DORV, both arteries flow out of the RV. This is a problem because the RV pumps oxygen-poor blood. This blood is then circulated throughout the body.\nAnother defect called a\nventricular septal defect\n(VSD) always occurs with DORV.\nOxygen-rich blood from the lungs flows from the left side of the heart, through the VSD opening and into the RV. This helps the infant with DORV by allowing oxygen-rich blood to mix with oxygen-poor blood. Even with this mixture, the body may not get enough oxygen. This makes the heart work harder to meet the body's needs. There are several types of DORV.\nThe difference between these types is the location of the VSD as it relates to the location of the pulmonary artery and aorta. The symptoms and severity of the problem will depend on the type of DORV."}
