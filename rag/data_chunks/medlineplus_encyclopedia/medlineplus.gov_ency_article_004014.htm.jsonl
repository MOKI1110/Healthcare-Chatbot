Evidence of increasing age includes\nwrinkles\nand sagging skin. Whitening or graying of the hair is another obvious sign of aging.\nYour skin does many things. It:\nContains nerve receptors that allow you to feel touch, pain, and pressure\nHelps control fluid and\nelectrolyte\nbalance\nHelps control your body temperature\nProtects you from the environment\nAlthough skin has many layers, it can generally be divided into three main parts:\nThe outer part (epidermis) contains skin cells, pigment, and proteins.\nThe middle part (dermis) contains skin cells, blood vessels, nerves, hair follicles, and oil glands."}

The dermis provides nutrients to the epidermis.\nThe inner layer under the dermis (the\nsubcutaneous\nlayer) contains sweat glands, some hair follicles, blood vessels, and fat.\nEach layer also contains connective tissue with collagen fibers to give support and elastin fibers to provide flexibility and strength.\nWatch this video about:\nComponents of skin\nSkin changes are related to environmental factors, genetic makeup, nutrition, and other factors. The greatest single factor, though, is sun exposure. You can see this by comparing areas of your body that have regular sun exposure with areas that are protected from sunlight.\nNatural pigments seem to provide some protection against sun-induced skin damage."}

Blue-eyed, fair-skinned people show more aging skin changes than people with darker, more heavily pigmented skin.\nAGING CHANGES\nWith aging, the outer skin layer (epidermis) thins, even though the number of cell layers remains unchanged.\nThe number of pigment-containing cells (melanocytes) decreases. The remaining melanocytes increase in size. Aging skin looks thinner, paler, and clear (translucent). Pigmented spots including\nage spots\nor \"liver spots\" may appear in sun-exposed areas. The medical term for these areas is lentigos.\nChanges in the connective tissue reduce the skin's strength and elasticity. This is known as elastosis. It is more noticeable in sun-exposed areas (solar elastosis). Elastosis produces the leathery, weather-beaten appearance common to farmers, sailors, and others who spend a large amount of time outdoors.\nThe blood vessels of the dermis become more fragile."}

Elastosis produces the leathery, weather-beaten appearance common to farmers, sailors, and others who spend a large amount of time outdoors.\nThe blood vessels of the dermis become more fragile. This leads to bruising, bleeding under the skin (often called senile purpura), and\ncherry angiomas\n.\nSebaceous glands produce less oil as you age. Men experience a minimal decrease, most often after the age of 80. Women gradually produce less oil beginning after menopause. This can make it harder to keep the skin moist, resulting in dryness and itchiness.\nThe subcutaneous fat layer thins so it has less insulation and padding. This increases your risk of skin injury and reduces your ability to maintain body temperature. Because you have less natural insulation, you can get\nhypothermia\nin cold weather.\nSome medicines are absorbed by the fat layer. Shrinkage of this layer may change the way that these medicines work.\nThe sweat glands produce less sweat. This makes it harder to keep cool. Your risk for overheating or developing\nheat stroke\nincreases.\nGrowths such as\nskin tags\n,\nwarts\n, brown rough patches (seborrheic keratoses), and other blemishes are more common in older people."}

Also common are pinkish rough patches (actinic keratosis) which have a small chance of becoming a skin cancer. Skin cancers are also common and usually located in sun-exposed areas. Your health care provider can inform you if any skin lesions are worrisome.\nEFFECT OF CHANGES\nAs you age, you are at increased risk for skin injury. Your skin is thinner, more fragile, and you lose some of the protective fat layer. You also may be less able to sense touch, pressure, vibration, heat, and cold.\nRubbing or pulling on the skin can cause skin tears. Fragile blood vessels can break easily. Bruises, flat collections of blood (purpura), and raised collections of blood (\nhematomas\n) may form after even a minor injury.\nPressure ulcers can be caused by skin changes, loss of the fat layer, reduced activity, poor nutrition, and illnesses. Sores are most easily seen on the outside surface of the forearms, but they can occur anywhere on the body.\nAging skin repairs itself more slowly than younger skin."}

More than 90% of all older people have some type of skin disorder.\nSkin disorders can be caused by many conditions, including:\nBlood vessel diseases, such as\natherosclerosis\nDiabetes\nHeart disease\nLiver disease\nNutritional deficiencies\nObesity\nReactions to medicines\nStress\nOther causes of skin changes:\nAllergies to plants and other substances\nClimate\nClothing\nExposures to industrial and household chemicals\nIndoor heating\nSunlight can cause:\nLoss of elasticity (elastosis)\nNoncancerous skin growths (keratoacanthomas)\nPigment changes such as liver spots\nThickening of the skin\nSun exposure has also been directly linked to skin cancers, including basal cell cancer, squ"}

Sometimes minor nutritional deficiencies can cause rashes,\nskin lesions\n, and other skin changes, even if you have no other symptoms.\nKeep skin moist with lotions and other moisturizers.
