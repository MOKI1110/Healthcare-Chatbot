It can happen during the day and night. Bruxism during sleep is often a bigger problem because it is harder to control.\nThere is some disagreement about the cause of bruxism. Daily stress may be the trigger in many people. Some people probably clench or grind their teeth and never feel symptoms.\nFactors that influence whether or not bruxism causes pain and other problems will vary from person to person. They may include:\nHow much stress you have\nHow long and how tightly you clench and grind your teeth\nWhether your teeth are misaligned\nYour posture\nYour ability to relax\nYour diet\nYour sleeping habits\nSymptoms\nGrinding your teeth puts pressure on the muscles, tissues, and other structures around your jaw. The symptoms can cause\ntemporomandibular joint problems\n(TMJ).\nGrinding can wear down your teeth."}

It can be noisy enough at night to bother sleeping partners.\nSymptoms of bruxism include:\nAnxiety, stress, and tension\nDepression\nEarache\n(partly because the structures of the temporomandibular joint are very close to the ear canal, and because you can feel pain in a different location than its source; this is called referred pain)\nEating disorders\nHeadache\nMuscle tenderness, especially in the morning\nHot, cold, or sweet sensitivity in the teeth\nInsomnia\nSore or painful jaw\nExams and Tests\nAn exam can check for other disorders that may cause similar jaw pain or ear pain, including:\nDental disorders\nEar disorders, such as\near infections\nProblems with the temporomandibular joint (TMJ)\nYou may have a history of a high stress level and tension.\nTreatment\nThe goals of treatment are to reduce pain, prevent permanent damage to the teeth, and reduce clenching as much as possible.\nThese self-care tips may help relieve pain:\nApply ice or wet heat to sore jaw muscles."}

Look for small, painful nodules called trigger points that can cause pain throughout your head and face.\nRelax your face and jaw muscles throughout the day. The goal is to make facial relaxation a habit.\nTry to\nreduce your daily stress\nand learn relaxation techniques.\nTo prevent damage to your teeth, mouth guards or appliances (splints) are often used to treat teeth grinding, clenching, and TMJ disorders. A splint may help protect your teeth from the pressure of grinding.\nA well-fitting splint should help minimize the effects of grinding. However, some people find that the symptoms go away as long as they use the splint, but pain returns when they stop."}

However, some people find that the symptoms go away as long as they use the splint, but pain returns when they stop. The splint may also not work as well over time.\nThere are many types of splints. Some fit over the top teeth, some on the bottom. They may be designed to keep your jaw in a more relaxed position or provide some other function. If one type doesn't work, another may. Botox injections into the jaw muscles have also shown some success in controlling clenching and grinding.\nAfter splint therapy, adjustment of the bite pattern may help some people.\nFinally, many approaches try to help people unlearn their clenching behaviors. These are more successful for daytime clenching.\nIn some people, just relaxing and modifying daytime behavior is enough to reduce nighttime bruxism. Methods to directly modify nighttime clenching have not been well studied. They include biofeedback devices, self-hypnosis, and other alternative therapies.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nBruxism is not a dangerous disorder."}
