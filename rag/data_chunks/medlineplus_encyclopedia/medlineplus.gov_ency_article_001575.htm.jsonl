The exact cause of this tumor is unknown in most children.\nA missing iris of the eye (aniridia) is a birth defect that is sometimes associated with WT. Other birth defects linked to this type of kidney cancer include certain urinary tract problems and enlargement of one side of the body, a condition called\nhemihypertrophy\n.\nIt is more common among some siblings and twins, which suggests a possible genetic cause.\nThe disease occurs most often in children about 3 years old. More than 90% of cases are diagnosed before 10 years of age."}

Use care during bathing and handling to avoid injury to the tumor site.\nThe first step in treatment is to stage the tumor.
