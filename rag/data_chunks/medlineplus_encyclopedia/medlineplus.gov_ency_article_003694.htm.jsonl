Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nDexamethasone suppression test\nDexamethasone suppression test\nThe dexamethasone suppression test measures whether cortisol secretion by the adrenal gland can be suppressed. It can also help assess the reason for an excess of cortisol in your body such as if it is due to an excess of adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) secretion by the pituitary.\nHow the Test is Performed\nDuring this test, you will receive dexamethasone. This is a strong man-made (synthetic) glucocorticoid medicine. Afterward, your blood is drawn so that the cortisol level in your blood can be measured.\nThere are two different types of dexamethasone suppression tests: low dose and high dose. Each type can either be done in an overnight (common) or standard (3-day) method (rare). There are different processes that may be used for either test. Examples of these are described below.\nCommon:\nLow-dose overnight -- You will get 1 milligram (mg) of dexamethasone at 11 p.m., and a health care provider will draw your blood the next morning at 8 a.m."}

Then you will receive 8 mg of dexamethasone at 11 p.m. Your blood is drawn the next morning at 8 a.m. for a cortisol measurement.\nRare:\nStandard low-dose -- Urine is collected over 3 days (stored in 24-hour collection containers) to measure cortisol. On day 2, you will get a low dose (0.5 mg) of dexamethasone by mouth every 6 hours for 48 hours.\nStandard high-dose -- Urine is collected over 3 days (stored in 24-hour collection containers) for measurement of cortisol. On day 2, you will receive a high dose (2 mg) of dexamethasone by mouth every 6 hours for 48 hours.\nRead and follow the instructions carefully."}

The most common cause of an abnormal test result is when instructions are not followed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider may tell you to stop taking certain medicines that can affect the test, including:\nAntibiotics\nAnti-seizure medicines\nMedicines that contain corticosteroids, such as hydrocortisone, prednisone\nEstrogen\nOral birth control (contraceptives)\nWater pills (diuretics)\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done when your provider suspects that your body is producing too much cortisol. It is done to help diagnose\nCushing syndrome\nand identify the cause.\nThe low-dose test can help tell whether your body is producing too much ACTH."}

The high-dose test can help determine whether the problem is in the pituitary gland (\nCushing disease\n) or from a different site in the body (ectopic).\nDexamethasone is a man-made (synthetic) steroid that binds to the same receptor as cortisol. Dexamethasone reduces ACTH release in normal people. Therefore, taking dexamethasone should reduce ACTH level and lead to a decreased cortisol level.\nIf your pituitary gland produces too much ACTH, you will have an abnormal response to the low-dose test. But you can have a normal response to the high-dose test.\nNormal Results\nCortisol level should decrease after you receive dexamethasone.\nLow dose:\nOvernight -- 8 a.m."}

Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal response to the low-dose test may mean that you have abnormal release of cortisol (Cushing syndrome). This could be due to:\nAdrenal tumor\nthat produces cortisol\nPituitary tumor\nthat produces ACTH\nTumor in the body that produces ACTH (\nectopic Cushing syndrome\n)\nThe high-dose test can help tell a pituitary cause (Cushing disease) from other causes."}

Dexamethasone levels that are lower can cause a false-positive test result.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nDST; ACTH suppression test; Cortisol suppression test\nReferences\nBertholf RL, Cooper M, Winter WE.
