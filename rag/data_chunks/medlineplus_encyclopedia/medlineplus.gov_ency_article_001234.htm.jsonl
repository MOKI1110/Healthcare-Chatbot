Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFibrous dysplasia\nFibrous dysplasia\nFibrous dysplasia is a bone disease that destroys and replaces normal bone with fibrous bone tissue. One or more bones can be affected.\nCauses\nFibrous dysplasia usually occurs in childhood. Most people have symptoms by the time they are 30 years old. The disease occurs more often in females.\nFibrous dysplasia is linked to a problem with genes (gene mutation) that control bone-producing cells. The mutation occurs when a baby is developing in the womb. The condition is not passed from parent to child.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nBone pain\nBone sores (lesions)\nHormone (endocrine gland) problems\nFractures or bone deformities\nUnusual skin color (pigmentation), which occurs with\nMcCune-Albright syndrome\nThe bone lesions may stop when the child reaches puberty.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical examination. X-rays of bones are taken. An MRI may be recommended.\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for fibrous dysplasia. Bone fractures or deformities are treated as needed."}

Hormone problems will need to be treated.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook depends on the severity of the condition and the symptoms that occur.\nPossible Complications\nDepending on the bones that are affected, health problems that may result include:\nIf skull bone is affected, there can be vision or hearing loss\nIf a leg bone is affected, there can be difficulty walking and joint problems such as\narthritis\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your child has symptoms of this condition, such as repeated bone fractures and unexplained bone deformity.\nSpecialists in orthopedics, endocrinology, and genetics may be involved in your child's diagnosis and care.\nPrevention\nThere is no known way to prevent fibrous dysplasia."}
