In some infants, it can be fatal.\nNormally, red blood cells (RBCs) last for about 120 days in the body. In this disorder, RBCs in the blood are destroyed quickly and thus do not last as long.\nCauses\nDuring pregnancy, RBCs from the unborn baby can cross into the mother's blood through the placenta. HDN occurs when the immune system of the mother sees a baby's RBCs as foreign. Antibodies then develop against the baby's RBCs. These antibodies attack the RBCs in the baby's blood and cause them to break down too early.\nHDN may develop when a mother and her unborn baby have different blood types. The types are based on small substances (antigens) on the surface of the blood cells.\nThere is more than one way in which the unborn baby's blood type may not match the mother's.\nA, B, AB, and O\nare the 4 major blood group antigens or types. This is the most common form of a mismatch."}

This is the most common form of a mismatch. In most cases, this is not very severe.\nRh is short for the \"rhesus\" antigen or blood type. People are either positive or negative for this antigen. If the mother is\nRh-negative\nand the baby in the womb has Rh-positive cells, her antibodies to the Rh antigen can cross the placenta and cause very severe anemia in the baby. It can be prevented in most cases.\nThere are other, much less common, types of mismatch between minor blood group antigens."}

This involves removing a large amount of the baby's blood, and thus the extra bilirubin and antibodies. Fresh donor blood is infused.\nSimple transfusion (without exchange). This may need to be repeated after the baby goes home from the hospital.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe severity of this condition can vary. Some babies have no symptoms. In other cases, problems such as hydrops can cause the baby to die before, or shortly after, birth. Severe HDN may be treated before birth by intrauterine blood transfusions.\nPrevention\nThe most severe form of this disease, which is caused by Rh incompatibility, can be prevented if the mother is tested during pregnancy. If needed, she is given a shot of a medicine called RhoGAM at certain times during and after her pregnancy."}
