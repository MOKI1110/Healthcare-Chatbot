Mononeuropathy usually means there is a local cause of the nerve damage. Diseases affecting the entire body (systemic disorders) can also cause isolated nerve damage.\nThis condition occurs when the nerve is inflamed, trapped, or injured by trauma. The most common reason is trapping (entrapment) by a ligament in the wrist. This causes carpal tunnel syndrome. Trapping puts pressure on the nerve where it passes through a narrow area. Wrist fractures may injure the median nerve directly. Or, it may increase the risk for trapping the nerve later on.\nInflammation of the tendons (\ntendinitis\n) or joints (\narthritis\n) can also put pressure on the nerve."}

Or, it may increase the risk for trapping the nerve later on.\nInflammation of the tendons (\ntendinitis\n) or joints (\narthritis\n) can also put pressure on the nerve. Some repetitive movements increase the chance of developing carpal tunnel entrapment. Women are more affected than men.\nProblems that affect the tissue near the nerve or cause deposits to form in the tissue can block blood flow and lead to pressure on the nerve. Such conditions include:\nToo much growth hormone in the body (\nacromegaly\n)\nDiabetes\nUnderactive thyroid (\nhypothyroidism\n)\nKidney disease\nA blood cancer called\nmultiple myeloma\nPregnancy\nObesity\nAmyloidosis\nIn some cases, no cause can be found."}

Wearing the splint at night rests the area and decreases inflammation. An injection into the wrist may help with symptoms, but it won't fix the underlying problem.\nSurgery\nmay be needed if a splint or medicines don't help. Using proper ergonomics at work is essential."}

In some cases, there is some or complete\nloss of movement\nor sensation.\nNerve pain\nmay be severe and persist for a long time.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nDeformity of the hand (rare)\nPartial or complete loss of hand movement\nPartial or complete loss of sensation in the fingers\nRecurrent or unnoticed injury to the hand\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of distal median nerve dysfunction."}
