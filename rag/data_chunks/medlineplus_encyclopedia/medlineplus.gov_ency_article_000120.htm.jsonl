Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency\nAlpha-1 antitrypsin (AAT) deficiency is a condition in which the body does not make enough of AAT, a protein that protects the lungs and liver from damage. The condition can lead to\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n(COPD) and liver disease (\ncirrhosis\n).\nCauses\nAAT is a type of protein called a protease inhibitor. AAT is made in the liver and it works to protect the lungs and liver.\nAAT deficiency means there is not enough of this protein in the body. It is caused by a genetic variant. The condition is most common among Europeans and North Americans of European descent.\nAdults with severe AAT deficiency will develop emphysema, sometimes before 40 years of age."}

The condition is most common among Europeans and North Americans of European descent.\nAdults with severe AAT deficiency will develop emphysema, sometimes before 40 years of age. Smoking can increase the risk for emphysema and make it occur earlier.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nShortness of breath\nwith and without exertion, and other symptoms of COPD\nSymptoms of liver failure\nLoss of weight\nwithout trying\nWheezing\nCoughing\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam may reveal a barrel-shaped chest, wheezing, or decreased breath sounds. The following tests may also help with diagnosis:\nAAT\nblood test\nArterial blood gases\nChest x-ray\nCT scan of the chest\nGenetic testing\nLung function tests\nYour health care provider may suspect you of having this condition if you develop:\nCOPD before age 45\nCOPD but you have never smoked or been exposed to toxins\nCOPD and you have a family history of the condition\nCirrhosis and no other cause can be found\nCirrhosis and you have a family history of liver disease\nTreatment\nTreatment for AAT deficiency involves replacing the missing AAT protein. The protein is given through a vein each week or every 4 weeks."}

The protein is given through a vein each week or every 4 weeks. This is only slightly effective at preventing more lung damage in people without end-stage disease. This procedure is called augmentation therapy.\nIf you smoke, you need\nto quit\n.\nOther treatments are also used for COPD and cirrhosis.\nLung transplant can be used for severe lung disease, and liver transplant can be used for severe cirrhosis.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSome people with this deficiency will not develop liver or lung disease. If you quit smoking, you can slow the progression of the lung disease.\nCOPD and cirrhosis can be life threatening.\nPossible Complications\nComplications of AAT deficiency include:\nBronchiectasis\n(damage of the large airways)\nCOPD\nLiver failure or cancer\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of AAT deficiency.\nAlternative Names\nAAT deficiency; Alpha-1 protease deficiency; COPD - alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency; Cirrhosis - alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency\nImages\nLungs\nLiver anatomy\nReferences\nHan MK, Lazarus SC."}
