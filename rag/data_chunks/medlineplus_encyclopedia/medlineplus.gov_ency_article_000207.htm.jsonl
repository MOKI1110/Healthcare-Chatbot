It causes swallowing difficulties.\nBenign means that it is not caused by\ncancer of the esophagus\n.\nCauses\nEsophageal stricture can be caused by:\nGastroesophageal reflux disease\n(GERD).\nEosinophilic esophagitis\n.\nInjuries caused by an\nendoscope\nor treatments through an endoscope.\nLong-term use of a nasogastric (NG) tube (tube through the nose into the stomach).\nSwallowing substances that harm the lining of the esophagus."}

These may include household cleaners, lye, disc batteries, or battery acid.\nTreatment of\nesophageal varices\n.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nTrouble swallowing\nPain with swallowing\nUnintentional weight loss\nRegurgitation of food\nExams and Tests\nYou may need the following tests:\nBarium swallow\nto look for narrowing of the esophagus\nEndoscopy\n(EGD or esophagogastroduodenoscopy) to look for narrowing of the esophagus\nTreatment\nDilation (stretching) of the esophagus using a thin cylinder or balloon that is inserted through an endoscope is the main treatment for acid reflux-related strictures. You may need to have this treatment repeated after a period of time to prevent the stricture from narrowing again.\nProton pump inhibitors (acid-blocking medicines) can keep an acid reflux-related stricture from returning. Surgery is rarely needed.\nIf you have eosinophilic esophagitis, you may need to take medicines or make changes to your diet to reduce the inflammation."}

In some cases, dilation is done.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe stricture may come back in the future. This may require a repeat dilation.\nPossible Complications\nSwallowing problems may keep you from getting enough fluids and nutrients. Solid food, especially meat, can get stuck above the stricture. If this happens, endoscopy would be needed to remove the lodged food.\nThere is also a higher risk of having food, fluid, or vomit enter the lungs with regurgitation. This can cause choking or\naspiration pneumonia\n.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have swallowing problems that  do not  go away.\nPrevention\nUse safety measures to avoid swallowing substances that can harm your esophagus. Keep dangerous chemicals out of the reach of children. See your provider if you have GERD.\nPatient Instructions\nAnti-reflux surgery - discharge\nReferences\nFalk GW, Katzka DA.
