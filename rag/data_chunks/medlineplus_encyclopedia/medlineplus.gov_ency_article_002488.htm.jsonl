Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSodium hypochlorite poisoning\nSodium hypochlorite poisoning\nSodium hypochlorite is a chemical commonly found in bleach, water purifiers, and cleaning products. Sodium hypochlorite is a caustic chemical. If it contacts tissues, it can cause injury.\nSwallowing sodium hypochlorite can lead to poisoning. Breathing sodium hypochlorite fumes may also cause poisoning, especially if the product is mixed with ammonia.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure."}

Swallowing larger amounts can cause more serious symptoms. Industrial-strength bleach contains much higher concentrations of sodium hypochlorite, which may cause severe injury.\nNEVER mix ammonia with sodium hypochlorite (bleach or bleach-containing products)."}

However, more severe problems can occur with industrial-strength bleach, or from mixing bleach with ammonia.\nHow well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment was received. The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\nCancer of the esophagus is a high risk for people who live after ingesting sodium hypochlorite, especially industrial strength.\nWithout prompt treatment, extensive damage to the mouth, throat, eyes, lungs, esophagus, nose, and stomach are possible, and may continue to occur for several weeks after the poison was swallowed."}
