The sample may be taken using a needle to draw fluid (\naspiration\n) from the lymph node or during a\nlymph node biopsy\n.\nThe sample is sent to a laboratory. There, it is placed in a special dish and watched to see if bacteria, fungi, or viruses grow. This process is called a culture. Sometimes, special stains are also used to identify specific cells or microorganisms before culture results are available.\nIf needle aspiration does not provide a good enough sample, the entire lymph node may be removed and sent for culture and other testing.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour health care provider will instruct you on how to prepare for the lymph node sampling.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen local anesthetic is injected, you will feel a prick and a mild stinging sensation."}

The site will likely be sore for a few days after the test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order this test if you have swollen glands and infection is suspected.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means there was no growth of microorganisms on the lab dish.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results are a sign of a bacterial, fungal, mycobacterial, or viral infection.\nRisks\nRisks may include:\nBleeding\nInfection (in rare cases, the wound may get infected and you may need to take antibiotics)\nNerve injury if the biopsy is done on a lymph node close to nerves (the numbness usually goes away in a few months)\nAlternative Names\nCulture - lymph node\nImages\nLymphatic system\nLymph node culture\nReferences\nFerry JA.
