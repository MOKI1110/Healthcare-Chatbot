Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nVentricular fibrillation\nVentricular fibrillation\nVentricular fibrillation (VF) is a severely abnormal heart rhythm (\narrhythmia\n) that is life threatening.\nCauses\nThe heart pumps blood to the lungs, brain, and other organs. If the heartbeat is interrupted, even for a few seconds, it can lead to fainting (syncope) or cardiac arrest.\nFibrillation is an uncontrolled twitching or quivering of muscle fibers (fibrils). When it occurs in the lower chambers of the heart, it is called VF. During VF, blood is not pumped from the heart. Sudden cardiac death results.\nThe most common cause of VF is a heart attack. However, VF can occur whenever the heart muscle does not get enough oxygen."}

Sudden cardiac death results.\nThe most common cause of VF is a heart attack. However, VF can occur whenever the heart muscle does not get enough oxygen. Conditions that can lead to VF include:\nElectrocution accidents or injury to the heart\nHeart attack\nor angina\nHeart disease that is present at birth (congenital)\nHeart muscle disease in which the\nheart muscle becomes weakened and stretched\nor\nthickened\nHeart surgery\nSudden cardiac death (commotio cordis); most often occurs in athletes who have had a sudden blow to the area directly over the heart\nMedicines\nVery high or very low potassium levels in the blood\nMany people with VF have no history of heart disease. However, they often have heart disease risk factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes.\nSymptoms\nA person who has a VF episode will suddenly collapse and become unconscious."}

However, they often have heart disease risk factors, such as smoking, high blood pressure, and diabetes.\nSymptoms\nA person who has a VF episode will suddenly collapse and become unconscious. This happens because the brain and muscles are not receiving blood from the heart.\nThe following symptoms may occur within minutes to 1 hour before the collapse:\nChest pain\nDizziness\nNausea\nRapid or irregular heartbeat (\npalpitations\n)\nShortness of breath\nExams and Tests\nA cardiac monitor will show a very disorganized (\"chaotic\") heart rhythm.\nTests will be done to look for the cause of the VF.\nTreatment\nVF is a medical emergency. It must be treated immediately to save a person's life.\nCall 911 or the local emergency number for help if a person who is having a VF episode collapses at home or becomes unconscious.\nWhile waiting for help, place the person's head and neck in line with the rest of the body to help make breathing easier. Start\nCPR\nby doing chest compressions in the center of the chest (\"push hard and push fast\"). Compressions should be delivered at the rate of 100 to 120 times per minute."}

Compressions should be done to a depth of at least 2 inches (5 cm) but no more than 2  ¼ inches (6 cm).\nContinue to do this until the person becomes alert or help arrives.\nVF is treated by delivering a quick electric shock through the chest. It is done using a device called an external defibrillator. The electric shock can immediately restore the heartbeat to a normal rhythm, and should be done as quickly as possible. Many public places now have these machines.\nMedicines may be given to control the heartbeat and heart function.\nAn\nimplantable cardioverter defibrillator\n(ICD) is a device that can be implanted in the chest wall of people who are at risk for this serious rhythm disorder The ICD detects the dangerous heart rhythm and quickly sends a shock to correct it. It is a good idea for family members and friends of people who have had VF and heart disease to take a CPR course."}

CPR courses are available through the American Red Cross, hospitals, or the American Heart Association.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nVF will lead to death within a few minutes unless it is treated quickly and properly. Even then, long-term survival for people who live through a VF attack outside of the hospital is low.\nPossible Complications\nPeople who have survived VF may be in a coma or have long-term brain or other organ damage.\nAlternative Names\nVF; Fibrillation - ventricular; Arrhythmia - VF; Abnormal heart rhythm - VF; Cardiac arrest - VF; Defibrillator - VF; Cardioversion - VF; Defibrillate - VF\nPatient Instructions\nImplantable cardioverter defibrillator - discharge\nImages\nHeart - section through the middle\nHeart - front view\nReferences\nAl-Khatib SM, Stevenson WG, Ackerman MJ, et al."}
