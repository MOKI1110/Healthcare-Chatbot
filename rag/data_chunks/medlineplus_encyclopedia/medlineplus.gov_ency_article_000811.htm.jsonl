This occurs because of narrowed or blocked airways.\nCauses\nWhen you sleep, all of the muscles in your body become more relaxed. This includes the muscles that help keep your throat open so air can flow into your lungs.\nNormally, your throat remains open enough during sleep to let air pass by. Some people have a narrow throat. When the muscles in their upper throat relax during sleep, the tissues close in and block the airway. This stop in breathing is called apnea.\nLoud\nsnoring\nis a telltale symptom of OSA. Snoring is caused by air squeezing through the narrowed or blocked airway."}

It occurs when the brain temporarily stops sending signals to the muscles that regulate breathing.\nSymptoms\nIf you have OSA, you usually begin snoring heavily soon after falling asleep.\nThe snoring often becomes very loud.\nSnoring may be interrupted by a long silent period while your breathing stops.\nThe silence is followed by a loud snort and gasp, as you attempt to breathe.\nThis pattern repeats throughout the night.\nMost people with OSA do not know their breathing starts and stops during the night. Usually, a sleep partner or other family members hear the loud snoring, gasping, and snorting. Snoring can be loud enough to hear through walls."}

They can make symptoms worse.\nAvoid sleeping on your back.\nLose excess weight.\nContinuous positive airway pressure\n(CPAP) devices work well to treat OSA in most people.\nYou wear a mask over your nose or over your nose and mouth while you sleep.\nThe mask is connected by a hose to a small machine that sits at the side of your bed.\nThe machine pumps air under pressure through the hose and mask and into your airway while you sleep. This helps keep your airway open.\nIt can take some time to get used to sleeping with CPAP therapy."}

It is best to talk with a provider who specializes in sleep problems before trying them.\nIn December 2024, the medicine tirzepatide (Zepbound) was approved by the US Food and Drug administration for treating moderate to severe OSA.\nSurgery may be an option for some people.
