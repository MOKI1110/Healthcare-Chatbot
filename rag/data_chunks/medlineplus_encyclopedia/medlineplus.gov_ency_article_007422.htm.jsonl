You may also have back stiffness, decreased movement of the lower back, and difficulty standing straight.\nLow back pain that is long-term is called chronic low back pain.\nCauses\nLow back pain is common. Almost everyone has back pain at some time in their life. Often, the exact cause of the pain cannot be found.\nA single event may not have caused your pain. You may have been doing many activities, such as lifting the wrong way, for a long time. Then suddenly, one simple movement, such as reaching for something or bending from your waist, leads to pain.\nMany people with chronic back pain have arthritis. Or they may have extra wear and tear of the spine, which may be due to:\nHeavy use from work or sports\nInjuries or fractures\nSurgery\nYou may have had a\nherniated disk\n, in which part of the spinal disk pushed onto nearby nerves. Normally, the disks provide space and cushion in your spine."}
