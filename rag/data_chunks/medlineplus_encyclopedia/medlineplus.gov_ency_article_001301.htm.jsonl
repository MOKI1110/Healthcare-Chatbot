It is a complication of certain bacterial infections.\nCauses\nThe\nlymph system\n(lymphatics) is a network of lymph nodes, lymph ducts, lymph vessels, and organs that produce and move a fluid called lymph from tissues to the bloodstream.\nThe lymph glands, or lymph nodes, are small structures that filter the lymph fluid. There are many white blood cells in the lymph nodes to help fight infection.\nLymphadenitis occurs when the glands become enlarged by swelling (inflammation), often in response to bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The swollen glands are usually found near the site of an infection, tumor, or inflammation.\nLymphadenitis may occur after skin infections or other infections caused by bacteria such as streptococcus or staphylococcus."}

Sometimes, it is caused by rare infections such as tuberculosis or\ncat scratch disease\n(bartonella).\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nRed, tender skin over lymph node\nSwollen, tender, or hard lymph nodes\nFever\nLymph nodes may feel rubbery if an\nabscess\n(pocket of pus) has formed or they have become inflamed.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. This includes feeling your lymph nodes and looking for signs of injury or infection around any swollen lymph nodes.\nbiopsy\nand culture of the affected area or node may reveal the cause of the inflammation.\nBlood cultures\nmay reveal spread of infection (often bacteria) to the bloodstream.\nTreatment\nLymphadenitis may spread within hours."}

Treatment should begin right away.\nTreatment may include:\nAntibiotics to treat any bacterial infection\nAnalgesics\n(painkillers) to control pain\nAnti-inflammatory medicines to reduce inflammation\nCool compresses to reduce inflammation and pain\nSurgery may be needed to drain an abscess.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPrompt treatment with antibiotics usually leads to a complete recovery. It may take weeks, or even months, for swelling to disappear.\nPossible Complications\nUntreated lymphadenitis may lead to:\nAbscess formation\nCellulitis\n(a skin infection)\nFistulas\n(seen in lymphadenitis that is due to tuberculosis)\nSepsis\n(bloodstream infection), which can lead to death\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider or go to the emergency room if you have symptoms of lymphadenitis.\nPrevention\nGood general health and hygiene are helpful in the prevention of any infection.\nAlternative Names\nLymph node infection; Lymph gland infection; Localized lymphadenopathy\nImages\nLymphatic system\nSwo"}
