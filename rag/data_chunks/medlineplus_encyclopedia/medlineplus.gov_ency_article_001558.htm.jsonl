The developing brain and spine at this point are called the neural tube. The term \"NTD\" refers to any birth defect in which the neural tube in the area of the spine fails to close completely.\nMyelomeningocele is an NTD in which the bones of the spine do not completely form. This results in an incomplete spinal canal. The spinal cord and meninges protrude from the child's back.\nThis condition may affect as many as 1 out of every 4,000 infants.\nOther types of NTDs include:\nSpina bifida occulta, a condition in which the bones of the spine do not close."}

The spinal cord and meninges remain in place and skin usually covers the defect.\nMeningoceles, a condition where the meninges protrude from the spinal defect. The spinal cord remains in place.\nEncephaloceles,  a condition where the meninges and even brain can protrude from the skull.\nA child with myelomeningocele may also have other disorders or birth defects. Eight out of ten children with this condition have\nhydrocephalus\n, or an abnormal buildup of spinal fluid in the ventricles of the brain.\nOther disorders of the spinal cord or musculoskeletal system may be seen with myelomeningocele, including:\nSyringomyelia\n(a fluid-filled cyst within the spinal cord)\nHip dislocation\nThe cause of NTDs is not known. However, low levels of\nfolic acid\nin a woman's body before and during early pregnancy appear to play a part in this type of birth defect."}

However, low levels of\nfolic acid\nin a woman's body before and during early pregnancy appear to play a part in this type of birth defect. Folic acid (or folate) is important for development of brain and spinal cord.\nIf a child is born with myelomeningocele, future children in that family have a higher risk than the general population. However, in many cases, there is no family connection. Factors such as diabetes, obesity, and the use of anti-seizure and other medicines known to lower folic acid levels in the mother may increase the risk of this defect.\nSymptoms\nA newborn with this disorder will have an open area or a fluid-filled sac on the mid to lower back.\nSymptoms may include:\nLoss of bladder or bowel control\nPartial or complete lack of sensation\nPartial or complete paralysis of the legs\nWeakness of the hips, legs, or feet of a newborn\nOther signs and/or symptoms may include:\nAbnormal feet or legs, such as\nclubfoot\nBuildup of fluid inside the skull (\nhydrocephalus\n)\nExams and Tests\nPrenatal screening can help detect this condition."}

During the second trimester, pregnant women can have a blood test called the\nquadruple screen test\n. This test screens for myelomeningocele, Down syndrome, and other congenital diseases in the baby. Most women carrying a baby with spina bifida will have an increased level of a protein called maternal alpha fetoprotein (AFP).\nIf the quadruple screen test is positive, further testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis.\nSuch tests may include:\nPregnancy ultrasound\nAmniocentesis\nMyelomeningocele can be seen after the child is born. A neurologic exam may show that the child has loss of nerve-related functions below the defect. For example, watching how the infant responds to pinpricks at various locations may tell where the baby can feel the sensations.\nTests done on the baby after birth may include x-rays, ultrasound, CT, or MRI of the spinal area.\nTreatment\nThe health care provider may suggest genetic counseling."}

Intrauterine surgery to close the defect (before the baby is born) may reduce the risk of some later complications.\nAfter your baby is born,\nsurgery to repair the defect\nis most often suggested within the first few days of life. Outcomes are better if the birth takes place in a center where the repair can be done. Before surgery, the infant must be handled carefully to reduce damage to the exposed spinal cord. This may include:\nSpecial care and positioning\nProtective devices\nChanges in the methods of handling, feeding, and bathing\nChildren who also have hydrocephalus may need to have a\nventriculoperitoneal shunt\nplaced."}

Drainage tubes, called catheters, may be needed as well. Bowel training programs and a high fiber diet may improve bowel function.\nMuscle and joint problems -- Orthopedic or physical therapy may be needed to treat musculoskeletal symptoms.
