How well you do after surgery depends on the reason for the surgery:\nIf you had surgery for Conn syndrome, you may have to stay on blood pressure medicines.\nIf you had surgery for Cushing syndrome, you are at risk for complications that may need to be treated. Your provider can tell you more about this.\nIf you had surgery for pheochromocytoma, the outcome is usually good.\nAlternative Names\nAdrenalectomy; Removal of adrenal glands\nImages\nAdrenal glands\nReferences\nLim SK, Rha KH.
