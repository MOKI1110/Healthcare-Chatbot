Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nChest tube insertion\nChest tube insertion\nA chest tube is a hollow, flexible tube placed into the chest. It acts as a drain.\nChest tubes drain blood, fluid, or air from around your lungs, heart, or esophagus.\nThe tube is placed between your ribs and into the space between the lungs and the wall of your chest cavity. This is called the pleural space. Suction is applied through the tube, removing fluid or air. This allows your lungs to fully expand.\nDescription\nWhen your chest tube is inserted, you will lie on your side or sit partly upright, with one arm over your head.\nSometimes, you will receive medicine through a vein (intravenous, or IV) to make you relaxed and sleepy.\nYour skin will be cleaned at the site of the planned insertion.\nYou will be given local anesthesia (numbing medicine to reduce pain) at and around the place where the chest tube will be.\nThe chest tube is inserted through a small cut in your skin between your ribs. Then it is guided to the correct spot.\nThe tube is connected to a special canister."}

Then it is guided to the correct spot.\nThe tube is connected to a special canister. Suction is often used to help it drain. Other times, gravity alone will allow it to drain.\nA stitch (suture) and tape keep the tube in place.\nAfter your chest tube insertion, you will have a chest x-ray to make sure the tube is in the right place.\nThe chest tube most often stays in place until x-rays show that all the blood, fluid, or air has drained from your chest and your lung has fully re-expanded.\nThe tube is easy to remove when it is no longer needed.\nSome people may have a chest tube inserted that is guided by x-ray, computerized tomography (CT), or ultrasound. If you have major\nlung\nor\nheart surgery\n, a chest tube will be placed while you are under general anesthesia (asleep) during your surgery.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nChest tubes are used to treat conditions that cause a lung to collapse."}

Some of these conditions are:\nSurgery or trauma to the chest\nAir leaks from inside the lung into the chest (\npneumothorax\n)\nFluid buildup in the chest (called a\npleural effusion\n) due to bleeding into the chest, buildup of fatty fluid,\nabscess\nor pus buildup in the lung or the chest, or\nheart failure\ntear in the esophagus\n(the tube that allows food to go from the mouth to the stomach)\nRisks\nSome risks from the insertion procedure are:\nBleeding or infection where the tube is inserted\nImproper placement of the tube (into the tissues, abdomen, or too far in the chest)\nInjury to the lung or heart\nInjury to organs near the tube, such as the spleen, liver, stomach, or diaphragm\nAfter the Procedure\nYou will most likely stay in the hospital until your chest tube is removed. In some cases, a person may go home with a chest tube.\nWhile the chest tube is in place, your health care provider will carefully check for air leaks, breathing problems, and if you need oxygen."}

In some cases, a person may go home with a chest tube.\nWhile the chest tube is in place, your health care provider will carefully check for air leaks, breathing problems, and if you need oxygen. They will also make sure the tube stays in place. Your provider will tell you whether it is OK to get up and walk around or sit in a chair.\nWhat you will need to do:\nBreathe deeply and cough often (your nurse will teach you how to do this). Deep breathing and coughing will help re-expand your lung and help with drainage.\nBe careful there are no kinks in your tube. The drainage system should always sit upright and be placed below your lungs. If it is not, the fluid or air will not drain and your lungs can't re-expand.\nGet help right away if:\nYour chest tube comes out or shifts position.\nThe tubes become disconnected.\nYou suddenly have a harder time breathing or have more pain.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook depends on the reason a chest tube is inserted. Pneumothorax most often improves, but sometimes surgery is needed to correct the underlying problem. This may be performed through a scope or may require a large incision depending on your underlying condition."}
