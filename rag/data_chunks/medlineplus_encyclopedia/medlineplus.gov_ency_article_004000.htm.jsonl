Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAging changes in hormone production\nAging changes in hormone production\nThe\nendocrine\nsystem is made up of organs and tissues that produce hormones. Hormones are natural chemicals produced in one location, released into the bloodstream, and then used by other target organs and systems.\nHormones control the target organs. Some organ systems have their own internal control systems along with, or instead of, hormones.\nAs we age, changes naturally occur in the way body systems are controlled. Some target tissues become less sensitive to their controlling hormone. The amount of hormones produced may also change.\nBlood levels of some hormones increase, some decrease, and some are unchanged. Hormones are also broken down (metabolized) more slowly.\nMany of the organs that produce hormones are controlled by other hormones. Aging also changes this process."}

Hormones are also broken down (metabolized) more slowly.\nMany of the organs that produce hormones are controlled by other hormones. Aging also changes this process. For example, an endocrine tissue may produce less of its hormone than it did at a younger age, or it may produce the same amount at a slower rate.\nAGING CHANGES\nThe\nhypothalamus\nis located in the brain. It produces hormones that control the other structures in the endocrine system, including the pituitary gland. The amount of these regulating hormones stays about the same, but the response by the endocrine organs can change as we age.\nThe pituitary gland is located just below (anterior pituitary) or in (posterior pituitary) the brain. This gland reaches its maximum size in middle age and then gradually becomes smaller. It has two parts:\nThe back (posterior) part stores hormones produced in the hypothalamus.\nThe front (anterior) part produces hormones that affect growth, the thyroid gland (thyroid stimulating hormone or\nTSH\n), adrenal cortex, ovaries, testes, and breasts.\nThe thyroid gland is located in the neck. It produces hormones that help control\nmetabolism\n."}

It produces hormones that help control\nmetabolism\n. With aging, the thyroid may become lumpy (nodular). Metabolism slows over time, beginning at around age 20. Because thyroid hormones are produced and broken down (metabolized) at the same rate,\nthyroid function tests\nare most often still normal. In some people, thyroid hormone levels may rise, leading to an increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease.\nThe parathyroid glands are four tiny glands located around the thyroid. Parathyroid hormone affects calcium and phosphate levels, which affect bone strength. Parathyroid hormone levels rise with age, which may contribute to\nosteoporosis\n.\nInsulin is produced by the pancreas. It helps sugar (glucose) go from the blood to the inside of cells, where it can be used for energy.\nThe average\nfasting glucose\nlevel rises 6 to 14 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) every 10 years after age 50 as the cells become less sensitive to the effects of insulin."}

Once the level reaches 126 mg/dL or higher, the person is considered to have diabetes mellitus.\nThe\nadrenal glands\nare located just above the kidneys. The adrenal cortex, the surface layer, produces the hormones\naldosterone\n, cortisol, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).\nAldosterone regulates fluid and\nelectrolyte\nbalance.\nCortisol is the \"stress response\" hormone. It affects the breakdown of glucose, protein, and fat, and it has anti-inflammatory and anti-allergy effects.\nAldosterone release decreases with age. This decrease can contribute to lightheadedness and a drop in blood pressure with sudden position changes (orthostatic hypotension). Cortisol release also decreases with aging, but the blood level of this hormone stays about the same. DHEA levels also drop. The effects of this drop on the body are not clear.\nThe ovaries and testes have two functions. They produce the reproductive cells (ova and sperm)."}
