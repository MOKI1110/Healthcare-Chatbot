Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSputum culture\nSputum culture\nRoutine sputum culture is a laboratory test that looks for germs that cause infection. Sputum is the material that comes up from air passages when you cough deeply.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA sputum sample is needed. You will be asked to cough deeply and spit any phlegm that comes up from your lungs into a special container. The sample is sent to a lab. There, part of it is placed in a special dish (culture). It is then watched for two to three days or longer to see if bacteria or other disease-causing germs grow.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nDrinking a lot of water and other fluids the night before the test may make it easier to cough up the sputum.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will need to cough. Sometimes the health care provider will tap on your chest to loosen deep sputum. Or, you may be asked to inhale a steam-like mist to help you cough up the sputum."}

You may have some discomfort from having to cough deeply.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test helps identify the bacteria or other types of germs that are causing an infection in the lungs or airways (bronchi).\nNormal Results\nIn a normal sputum sample there will be no disease-causing germs. Sometimes the sputum culture grows bacteria because the sample contains bacteria that are normally present in the mouth.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf the sputum sample is abnormal, the results are called \"positive.\" Identifying bacteria, fungi, or viruses in the sputum may help diagnose the cause of:\nBronchitis\n(swelling and inflammation in the main passages that carry air to the lungs)\nLung abscess (collection of pus in the lung)\nPneumonia\nTuberculosis\nFlare up of\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n(COPD) or\ncystic fibrosis\nRisks\nThere are no risks with this test.\nAlternative Names\nSputum culture\nImages\nSputum test\nReferences\nBrainard J.
