However, along with nutrients, any toxins in the mother's system may be delivered to the fetus. These toxins may cause damage to the developing fetal organs. A baby also may become dependent on substances used by the mother.\nWHAT ARE THE SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS SEEN IN AN INFANT OF A SUBSTANCE-USING MOTHER?\nBabies born to substance-using mothers may have short- or long-term effects.\nShort-term withdrawal symptoms may consist only of mild fussiness.\nMore severe symptoms may include irritable or jittery behavior, feeding problems, and diarrhea. Symptoms vary depending on which substances were used.\nThe diagnosis for babies with signs of withdrawal may be confirmed with drug tests of the baby's urine, stool or umbilical cord."}

Symptoms vary depending on which substances were used.\nThe diagnosis for babies with signs of withdrawal may be confirmed with drug tests of the baby's urine, stool or umbilical cord. The mother's urine may also be tested. However, if urine or stool is not collected soon enough, the results may be negative.\nMore significant long-term developmental problems may be seen in babies who are born with growth failure or various organ problems.\nInfants born to mothers who drink alcohol, even in modest amounts, are at risk for\nfetal alcohol syndrome\n(FAS). This condition consists of growth problems, unusual facial features, and intellectual disability. It may not be detected at the time of birth.\nOther drugs may cause birth defects involving the heart, brain, bowel, or kidneys.\nBabies who have been exposed to drugs, alcohol, or tobacco are at higher risk for SIDS\n(sudden infant death syndrome)\n.\nWHAT IS THE TREATMENT FOR AN INFANT OF A SUBSTANCE-USING MOTHER?\nThe baby's treatment will depend on the drugs the mother used."}

Treatment may involve:\nLimiting noise and bright lights\nMaximizing \"TLC\" (tender loving care) including skin-to-skin care and breastfeeding with mothers who are in treatment/no longer using illicit substances\nUsing medicines (in some cases)\nIn the case of babies whose mothers used narcotics, the baby may require small doses of a narcotic. The amount is slowly adjusted as the baby is weaned off of the substance over days to weeks. Sedatives are sometimes used as well.\nInfants with organ damage, birth defects or developmental issues may need medical or surgical therapy and long-term therapies.\nThese infants are more likely to grow up in homes that do not promote healthy emotional, social, and mental development."}
