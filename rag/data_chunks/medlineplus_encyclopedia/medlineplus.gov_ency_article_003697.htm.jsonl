Your health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines. Do not stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.\nMedicines that can increase the gastrin level include:\nStomach acid reducers, such as antacids\nH2 blockers (cimetidine,  nizatidine, and famotidine)\nProton pump inhibitors (omeprazole, pantoprazole, and several others)\nSome of these medicines are available without a prescription. Discuss non-prescription medicines you are taking with your provider.\nMedicines that can decrease gastrin level include caffeine, corticosteroids, and the rarely used blood pressure medicines deserpidine, reserpine, and rescinnamine.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain.

Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nGastrin is the main hormone that controls the release of acid in your stomach. When there is food in the stomach, gastrin is released into the blood. As the acid level rises in your stomach and intestines, your body normally makes less gastrin.\nYour provider may order this test if you have signs or symptoms of a problem linked to an abnormal amount of gastrin. This includes\npeptic ulcer disease\n.\nNormal Results\nNormal values are generally less than 100 pg/mL (48.1 pmol/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test result.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nToo much gastrin can causes severe peptic ulcer disease."}
