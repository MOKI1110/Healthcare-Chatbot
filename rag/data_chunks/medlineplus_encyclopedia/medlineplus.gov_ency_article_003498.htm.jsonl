Others feel a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nKetones are substances produced in the liver when fat cells break down in the blood. This test is used to diagnose\nketoacidosis\n. This is a life-threatening problem that affects people who:\nHave diabetes (diabetic ketoacidosis or DKA). It occurs when the body cannot use sugar (glucose) as a fuel source because there is not enough insulin. Fat is used for fuel instead."}

When fat breaks down, waste products called ketones build up in the body.\nDrink large amounts of alcohol (alcoholic ketoacidosis).\nTake a type of medicine called sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors.\nNormal Results\nA normal test result is negative. This means there are no ketones in the blood.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA test result is positive if ketones are found in the blood."}
