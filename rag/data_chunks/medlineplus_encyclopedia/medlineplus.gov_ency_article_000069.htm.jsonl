Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is scarring or thickening of the lungs without a known cause.\nCauses\nHealth care providers do not know what causes IPF or why some people develop it. Idiopathic means the cause is not known. The condition may be due to the lungs responding to an unknown substance or injury. Genes may play a role in developing IPF. The disease occurs most often in people between 60 and 70 years old. IPF is more common in men than women.\nSymptoms\nWhen you have IPF, your lungs become scarred and stiffened. This makes it hard for you to breathe. In most people, IPF gets worse quickly over months or a few years."}

This makes it hard for you to breathe. In most people, IPF gets worse quickly over months or a few years. In others, IPF worsens over a much longer time.\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nChest pain (sometimes)\nCough (usually dry)\nNot able to be as active as before\nShortness of breath\nduring activity (this symptom lasts for months or years, and over time may also occur when at rest)\nFeeling faint\nGradual weight loss\nExams and Tests\nYour provider will do a physical exam and ask about your medical history."}
