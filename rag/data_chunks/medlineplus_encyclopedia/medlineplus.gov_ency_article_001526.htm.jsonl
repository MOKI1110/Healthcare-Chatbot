It often appears in the first 2 to 3 years of life. ASD affects the brain's ability to develop normal social and communication skills.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of ASD isn't known. It's likely that a number of factors may lead to ASD. Research shows that genes may be involved, since ASD runs in some families. Certain medicines taken during pregnancy may also lead to ASD in the child.\nOther causes have been suspected, but not proven. Some scientists believe that damage to a part of the brain, called the amygdala, may be involved. Others are looking at whether a virus may trigger symptoms.\nSome parents have heard that vaccines may cause ASD. But studies have found no link between vaccines and ASD. All expert medical and government groups state that there is no link between vaccines and ASD.\nThe increase in children with ASD may be due to better diagnosis and newer definitions of ASD."}

This is true if a child doesn't meet any one of these language milestones:\nBabbling by 12 months\nGesturing (pointing, waving bye-bye) by 12 months\nSaying single words by 16 months\nSaying two-word spontaneous phrases by 24 months (not just echoing)\nLosing any language or social skills at any age\nThese children might need a hearing test, blood lead test, and screening test for ASD.\nA provider experienced in diagnosing and treating ASD should see the child to make the actual diagnosis. Because there isn't a definitive test for ASD, diagnosis is often based on guidelines from a medical book titled\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V)\n.\nAn evaluation for ASD often includes a complete physical and nervous system (neurologic) exam.

So, a single, brief evaluation can't tell a child's true abilities. It's best to have a team of specialists to evaluate the child. They might evaluate:\nCommunication\nLanguage\nMotor skills\nSpeech\nSuccess at school\nThinking abilities\nSome parents don't want to have their child diagnosed because they're afraid the child will be labeled. But without a diagnosis, their child may not get the needed treatment and services.\nTreatment\nAt this time, there is no cure for ASD. A treatment program will greatly improve the outlook for most young children. Most programs build on the interests of the child in a highly structured schedule of constructive activities.\nTreatment plans may combine techniques, including:\nApplied behavior analysis (ABA)\nMedicines, if needed\nOccupational therapy\nPhysical therapy\nSpeech-language therapy\nAPPLIED BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS (ABA)\nThis program is for younger children."}

It  helps in some cases. ABA uses one-on-one teaching that reinforces various skills. The goal is to get the child close to normal functioning for their age.\nAn ABA program is often done in a child's home. A behavioral psychologist oversees the program. ABA programs can be very expensive and aren't widely used by school systems. Parents often have to find funding and staffing from other sources, which aren't available in many communities.\nTEACCH\nAnother program is called the Treatment and Education of Autistic and Related Communication Handicapped Children (TEACCH). It uses picture schedules and other visual cues. These help  children work on their own and organize and structure their environments.\nThough TEACCH tries to improve a child's skills and ability to adapt, it also accepts the problems associated with ASD. Unlike ABA programs, TEACCH doesn't expect children to achieve typical development with treatment.\nMEDICINES\nThere is no medicine that treats ASD itself."}

These include:\nAggression\nAnxiety\nAttention problems\nExtreme compulsions that the child cannot stop\nHyperactivity\nImpulsiveness\nIrritability\nMood swings\nOutbursts\nSleep difficulty\nTantrums\nThe drug risperidone is FDA approved to treat children ages 5 through 16 for the irritability and aggression that can occur with ASD. The drug aripriprazole is FDA approved to treat children ages 6 through 17 for the same symptoms. Other medicines that may also be used are mood stabilizers and stimulants.\nDIET\nSome children with ASD seem to do well on a gluten-free or casein-free diet. Gluten is in foods containing wheat, rye, and barley. Casein is in milk, cheese, and other dairy products. Not all experts agree that changes in diet make a difference."}

You want to be sure that  your child is still getting enough calories and the right nutrients.\nOTHER APPROACHES\nBeware of widely publicized treatments for ASD that don't have scientific support, and reports of miracle cures. If your child has ASD, talk with other parents. Also discuss your concerns with ASD specialists. Follow the progress of ASD research, which is rapidly developing.\nSupport Groups\nMany\norganizations\nprovide additional information and help on ASD.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWith the right treatment, many ASD symptoms can be improved.
