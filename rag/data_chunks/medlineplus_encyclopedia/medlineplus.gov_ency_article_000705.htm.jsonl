It involves\nmuscle weakness\n, which quickly gets worse.\nCauses\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy is a form of\nmuscular dystrophy\n. It worsens quickly. Other muscular dystrophies (including\nBecker muscular dystrophy\n) get worse much more slowly.\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by a defective gene for dystrophin (a\nprotein\nin the muscles). However, it often occurs in people without a known family history of the condition.\nThe condition most often affects boys due to the way the disease is inherited. The sons of women who are carriers of the disease (women with a defective gene, but no symptoms themselves) each have a 50% chance of having the disease. The daughters each have a 50% chance of being carriers. Very rarely, a female can be affected by the disease.\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy occurs in about 1 out of every 3,600 male infants."}

Because this is an inherited disorder, risks include a family history of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms most often appear before age 6. They may start as early as infancy. Most boys show no symptoms in the first few years of life.\nSymptoms may include:\nFatigue\nLearning difficulties (the IQ can be below 75).\nIntellectual disability (possible, but does not get worse over time).\nMuscle weakness:\nBegins in the legs and pelvis, but also occurs less severely in the arms, neck, and other areas of the body.\nProblems with motor skills (running, hopping, jumping).\nFrequent falls.\nTrouble getting up from a lying position or climbing stairs.\nShortness of breath, fatigue, and swelling of the feet due to a weakening of the heart muscle.\nProblem breathing due to a weakening of the respiratory muscles.\nGradual worsening of muscle weakness.\nProgressive\ndifficulty walking\n:\nAbility to walk may be lost by age 12, and the child will have to use a wheelchair.\nBreathing difficulties and hear"}

Stem cells and gene therapy may be used in the future.\nGenetic therapies may be helpful to certain patients, depending on the genetic cause. Each therapy only works on a small number of patients, depending on their specific genetic change (mutation). While these treatments have been shown to increase dystrophin production, they have not yet been shown to have significant clinical benefits.
