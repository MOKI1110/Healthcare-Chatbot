In the first stages of an illness, little or no antibody may be detected. For this reason, the test is often repeated in 10 days to 2 or more weeks.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no special preparation for the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is done to detect an infection with the EBV. EBV causes mononucleosis or mono. The EBV antibody test detects not only a recent infection, but also one that occurred in the past."}

EBV causes mononucleosis or mono. The EBV antibody test detects not only a recent infection, but also one that occurred in the past. It can be used to tell the difference between a recent or previous infection.\nAnother test for mononucleosis is called the\nMonospot test\n. It is often done when a person has current symptoms of mononucleosis.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means no antibodies to EBV were seen in your blood sample. This result means you have never been infected with EBV.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA positive result means there are antibodies to EBV in your blood. This indicates a current or prior infection with EBV.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
