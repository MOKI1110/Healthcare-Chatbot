Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEpiglottitis\nEpiglottitis\nEpiglottitis is inflammation of the epiglottis. This is the tissue-lined cartilage that covers the trachea (windpipe) while swallowing. Epiglottitis can be a life-threatening disease.\nCauses\nThe epiglottis is a stiff, yet flexible tissue (called cartilage) at the back of the tongue. It closes your windpipe (trachea) when you swallow so food does not enter your airway. This helps prevent coughing or choking after swallowing.\nIn children, epiglottitis is usually caused by the bacteria\nHaemophilus influenzae\n(\nH influenzae\n) type B. In adults, it is often due to other bacteria such as\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n, or viruses such as herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster.\nEpiglottitis is now very uncommon because the\nH influenzae type B (Hib) vaccine\nis given routinely to all children. The disease was once most often seen in children ages 2 through 6. In rare cases, epiglottitis can occur in adults.\nSymptoms\nEpiglottitis begins with a high fever and sore throat."}

Other symptoms may include:\nAbnormal breathing sounds (\nstridor\n)\nFever\nBlue skin color (\ncyanosis\n)\nDrooling\nDifficulty breathing (the person may need to sit upright and lean slightly forward to breathe)\nDifficulty swallowing\nVoice changes (hoarseness)\nThe airways can become totally blocked, which can result in cardiac arrest and death.\nExams and Tests\nEpiglottitis can be a medical emergency. Seek medical help right away. Do not use anything to press the tongue down to try to look at the throat at home. Doing so may make the condition worse.\nThe health care provider may examine the voice box (larynx) using a small mirror held against the back of the throat. Or a viewing tube called a laryngoscope may be used."}

With proper treatment, the outcome is usually good.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nSeek immediate medical attention or call 911 or the local emergency number if a person has breathing trouble.\nDifficulty breathing is a late, but important sign. Spasm may cause the airways to suddenly close. Or, the airways may become totally blocked. Either of these situations could result in death.\nPrevention\nThe Hib vaccine protects most children from epiglottitis.\nThe most common bacteria (\nH influenza\ntype b\n)\nthat causes epiglottitis is easily spread. If someone in your family is sick from this bacteria, other family members need to be tested and treated.\nAlternative Names\nSupraglottitis\nImages\nEpiglottis\nThroat anatomy\nHaemophilus influenzae organism\nHaemophilus influenza organism\nReferences\nNayak JL, Weinberg GA.
