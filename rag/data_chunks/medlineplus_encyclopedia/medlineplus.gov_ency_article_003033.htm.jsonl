But prominent eyes are not the same as bulging eyes. Bulging eyes should be checked by a health care provider.\nBulging of one eye, especially in a child, can be a very serious sign. It should be checked right away.\nHyperthyroidism\n(particularly\nGraves disease\n) is the most common medical cause of bulging eyes. With this condition, the eyes do not blink often and seem to have a staring quality.\nNormally, there should be no visible white between the top of the iris (the colored part of the eye) and the upper eyelid. Seeing white in this area most often is a sign that the eye is bulging.\nBecause eye changes most often develop slowly, family members may not notice it until the condition is fairly advanced."}

Because bulging eyes can cause a person to be self-conscious, emotional support is important.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nYou have bulging eyes and the cause has not yet been diagnosed.\nBulging eyes are accompanied by other symptoms, such as pain or fever.\nThe provider will ask about your medical history and do a physical exam.\nSome questions you may be asked include:\nAre both eyes bulging?\nWhen did you first notice bulging eyes?\nIs it getting worse?\nDo you have pain in your eyes?\nWhat other symptoms do you have?\nslit-lamp examination\nmay be done. Blood testing for thyroid disease may be done.\nTreatments depend on the cause."}
