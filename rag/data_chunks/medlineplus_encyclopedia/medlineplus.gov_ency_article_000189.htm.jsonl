Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRestrictive cardiomyopathy\nRestrictive cardiomyopathy\nRestrictive cardiomyopathy refers to a set of changes in how the heart muscle functions. These changes cause the heart to fill poorly (more common) or squeeze poorly (less common). Sometimes, both problems are present.\nCauses\nIn a case of restrictive cardiomyopathy, the heart muscle is of normal size or slightly enlarged. Most of the time, it also pumps normally. However, it does not relax normally during the time between heartbeats when the blood returns from the body (diastole).\nAlthough the main problem is abnormal filling of the heart, the heart may not pump blood strongly when the disease progresses. The abnormal heart function can affect the lungs, liver, and other body systems. Restrictive cardiomyopathy may affect either or both of the lower heart chambers (ventricles). Restrictive cardiomyopathy is a rare condition. The most common causes are amyloidosis and scarring of the heart from an unknown cause."}

The main goal of treatment is to control symptoms and improve quality of life.\nThe following treatments may be used to control symptoms or prevent problems:\nBlood thinning medicines\nChemotherapy (in some situations)\nDiuretics to remove fluid and help improve breathing\nMedicines to prevent or control abnormal heart rhythms\nOther treatments that may be used depending on the specific type of cardiomyopathy include:\nChemotherapeutic agents\nMedicines such as tafamidis that target abnormal proteins (amyloid fibrils)\nLiver transplantation\nAdditional treatments are also under investigation.\nheart transplant\nmay be considered if the heart function is very poor and symptoms are severe.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPeople with this c"}

Problems with heart rhythm or \"leaky\" heart valves may also occur.\nPeople with restrictive cardiomyopathy may be heart transplant candidates. The outlook depends on the cause of the condition, but it is usually poor. Survival after diagnosis may exceed 10 years.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have symptoms of restrictive cardiomyopathy.\nAlternative Names\nCardiomyopathy - restrictive; Infiltrative cardiomyopathy; Idiopathic myocardial fibrosis\nImages\nHeart - section through the middle\nHeart - front view\nReferences\nElliott PM, Olivotto I.
