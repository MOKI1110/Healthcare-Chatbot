This can lead to severe money problems, job loss, crime or fraud, and damage to family relationships.\nCauses\nCompulsive gambling most often begins in early adolescence in men, and between ages 20 and 40 in women.\nPeople with compulsive gambling have a hard time resisting or controlling the impulse to gamble. The brain is reacting to this impulse in the same manner it reacts to a person addicted to alcohol or illegal drugs. Although it shares features of obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), compulsive gambling is likely a different condition.\nIn people who develop compulsive gambling, occasional gambling leads to a gambling habit. Stressful situations can worsen gambling problems.\nSymptoms\nPeople with compulsive gambling often feel ashamed and try to avoid letting other people know about their problem."}
