Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAgammaglobulinemia\nAgammaglobulinemia\nAgammaglobulinemia is an inherited disorder in which a person has very low levels of protective immune system proteins called immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins are a type of\nantibody\n. Low levels of these antibodies make you more likely to get infections.\nCauses\nThis is a rare disorder that mainly affects males. It is caused by a gene defect that blocks the growth of normal, mature immune cells called B lymphocytes.\nAs a result, the body makes very little (if any) immunoglobulins. Immunoglobulins play a major role in the\nimmune response\n, which protects against illness and infection.\nPeople with this disorder develop infections again and again. Common infections include ones that are due to bacteria such as\nHaemophilus influenzae\n, pneumococci (\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n), and staphylococci."}
