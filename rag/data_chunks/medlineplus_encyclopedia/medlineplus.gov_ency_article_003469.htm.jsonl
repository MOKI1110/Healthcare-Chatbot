Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCO2 blood test\nCO2 blood test\nCO2 is carbon dioxide. This article discusses the laboratory test to measure the amount of carbon dioxide in the liquid part of your blood, called the serum.\nIn the body, most of the CO2 is in the form of a substance called bicarbonate (HCO3-). Therefore, the CO2 blood test is really a measure of your blood bicarbonate level.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. Most of the time,\nblood is drawn from a vein\nlocated on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nMany medicines can interfere with blood test results.\nYour health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test.\nDO NOT stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe CO2 test is most often done as part of an\nelectrolyte\nor basic metabolic panel."}

You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe CO2 test is most often done as part of an\nelectrolyte\nor basic metabolic panel. Changes in your CO2 level may suggest that you are losing or retaining acidic fluid. This may cause an imbalance in your body's electrolytes.\nCO2 levels in the blood are affected by kidney and lung function. The kidneys help maintain the normal bicarbonate levels.\nNormal Results\nThe normal range is 23 to 29 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L) or 23 to 29 millimoles per liter (mmol/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nThe example above shows the common measurement range of results for these tests."}
