The test is used to help diagnose Lyme disease.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nA laboratory specialist looks for Lyme disease antibodies in the blood sample using the\nELISA test\n. If the ELISA test is positive, it must be confirmed with another test called the Western blot test.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou do not need to take special steps to prepare for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is done to check for the diagnosis of Lyme disease.\nNormal Results\nA negative test result is normal. This means none or few antibodies to Lyme disease were seen in your blood sample."}

This means none or few antibodies to Lyme disease were seen in your blood sample. If the ELISA test is negative, usually no other testing is needed.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA positive ELISA result is abnormal. This means antibodies were seen in your blood sample. But, this does not confirm a diagnosis of Lyme disease. A positive ELISA result must be followed up with a Western blot test. Only a positive Western blot test can confirm the diagnosis of Lyme disease.\nFor many people, the ELISA test remains positive, even after they have been treated for Lyme disease and no longer have symptoms.\nA positive ELISA test may also occur with certain diseases not related to Lyme disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken."}
