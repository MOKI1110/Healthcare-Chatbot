Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nToxoplasma blood test\nToxoplasma blood test\nThe toxoplasma blood test looks for\nantibodies\nin the blood to a parasite called\nToxoplasma gondii\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample is needed\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no special preparation for the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people may feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is done when the health care provider suspects that you have\ntoxoplasmosis\n. The infection is a danger to a developing baby if a pregnant woman gets infected. It is also dangerous in people with HIV/AIDS.\nIn pregnant women, the test is done to:\nCheck if a woman has a current infection or had an infection in the past.\nCheck if the baby has the infection.\nThe presence of antibodies before pregnancy probably protects a developing baby against toxoplasmosis at birth."}

But antibodies that develop during pregnancy may mean the mother and baby have a current infection. This infection during pregnancy increases the risk for miscarriage or birth defects.\nThis test may also be done if you have:\nAn unexplained lymph node swelling\nAn unexplained rise in the blood white cell (lymphocyte) count\nHIV and have symptoms of toxoplasmosis of the brain (including headache, seizures, weakness, and speech or vision problems)\nInflammation of the back part of the eye (chorioretinitis)\nNormal Results\nNormal results mean you have likely never had a toxoplasma infection.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test result.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results mean that you have probably been infected with the parasite."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test result.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results mean that you have probably been infected with the parasite. Two types of antibodies are measured, IgM and IgG:\nIf the level of IgM antibodies is raised, you likely became infected in the recent past (or currently).\nIf the level of IgG antibodies is raised, you became infected sometime in the past.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nToxoplasma serology; Toxoplasma antibody titer\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nMathison BA, Pritt BS.
