This can be due to swallowing, injecting, breathing in, or other means. Most poisonings occur by accident.\nImmediate first aid is very important in a poisoning emergency. The first aid you give before getting medical help can save a person's life.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\nConsiderations\nMillions of poisonings are reported to United States poison control centers every year. Many result in death.\nIt is important to note that just because a package does not have a warning label does not mean a substance in the package is safe. You should consider poisoning if someone suddenly becomes sick for no apparent reason."}
