Allergic conjunctivitis occurs when the conjunctiva becomes swollen or inflamed due to a reaction to pollen, dust mites, pet dander, mold, or other allergy-causing substances.\nCauses\nWhen your eyes are exposed to allergens (which cause allergies), a substance called histamine is released by your body. The blood vessels in the\nconjunctiva\nbecome swollen. The eyes can become red,\nitchy\n, and\nteary\nvery quickly.\nThe pollens that cause symptoms vary from person to person and from area to area. Tiny pollens that may cause allergic symptoms include grasses, ragweed and trees. These same pollens may also cause hay fever.\nYour symptoms may be worse when there is more pollen in the air. Higher levels of pollen are more likely on hot, dry, windy days. On cool, damp, rainy days most pollen is washed to the ground.\nMold, animal dander, or dust mites may cause this problem also.\nAllergies\ntend to run in families."}

It is hard to know exactly how many people have allergies. Many conditions are often lumped under the term \"allergy\" even when they might not truly be an allergy.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may be seasonal and can include:\nIntense itching or\nburning eyes\nPuffy eyelids, most often in the morning\nRed eyes\nStringy eye discharge\nTearing (watery eyes)\nWidened blood vessels in the clear tissue covering the white of the eye\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider may look for the following:\nSmall, raised bumps on the inside of the eyelids (papillary conjunctivitis)\nPositive skin test for suspected allergens on\nallergy tests\nAllergy testing may identify the pollen or other substances that trigger your symptoms.\nSkin testing is the most common method of allergy testing.\nSkin testing is more likely to be done if symptoms do not respond to treatment.\nTreatment\nThe best treatment is to\navoid what causes your allergy symptoms\nas much as possible."}

Common triggers to avoid include dust, mold and pollen.\nSome things you can do to ease symptoms are:\nUse lubricating eye drops.\nApply cool compresses to the eyes.\nDo not smoke and avoid secondhand smoke.\nTake over-the-counter oral antihistamines or antihistamine or decongestant eye drops. These medicines can offer more relief, but they can sometimes make your eyes dry. Do not use the eye drops if you have contact lenses in place. Also, do not use the decongestant eye drops for more than 5 days, as rebound congestion can occur.\nIf home-care does not help, you may need to see a provider for treatments such as eye drops that contain antihistamines or eye drops that reduce swelling.\nMild steroid eye drops can be prescribed for more severe reactions. You may also use eye drops that prevent a type of white blood cell called mast cells from causing swelling. These drops are given along with antihistamines."}

These medicines work best if you take them before you come in contact with the allergen. Referral to an ophthalmologist before using steroid eye drops should be done since intraocular pressure measurements and a more thorough eye exam (using a slit lamp) is needed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSymptoms often go away with treatment. However, they can persist if you continue to be exposed to the allergen.\nLong-term swelling of the outer lining of the eyes may occur in those with chronic allergies or asthma. It is called\nvernal conjunctivitis\n. It is most common in young males, and most often occurs during the spring and summer.\nPossible Complications\nIn severe cases of allergic conjunctivitis, there could be more severe inflammation."}
