Humans need iodine for normal thyroid function, and for the production of thyroid hormones.\nFood Sources\nIodized salt is table salt with iodine added. It is the main food source of iodine.\nSeafood is naturally rich in iodine. Cod, sea bass, haddock, and perch are good sources.\nKelp is the most common vegetable harvested from the sea. It is a rich source of iodine.\nDairy products also contain iodine.\nOther good sources are plants grown in iodine-rich soil.\nSide Effects\nLack of enough iodine (deficiency) may occur in places that have iodine-poor soil. Many months of iodine deficiency in a person's diet may cause\ngoiter\nor\nhypothyroidism\n. Without enough iodine, the thyroid cells and the thyroid gland become enlarged.\nLack of iodine is more common in women than in men. It is also common in pregnant women and older children."}

Without enough iodine, the thyroid cells and the thyroid gland become enlarged.\nLack of iodine is more common in women than in men. It is also common in pregnant women and older children. Getting enough iodine in the diet may prevent a form of physical and mental abnormality called\ncretinism\n. Cretinism is very rare in the United States because iodine deficiency is generally not a problem.\nIodine poisoning is rare in the US. Very high intake of iodine can reduce the function of the thyroid gland. Taking high doses of iodine with anti-thyroid medicines can have an additive effect and could cause hypothyroidism.\nRecommendations\nThe best way to get the daily requirement of essential vitamins is to eat a balanced diet that contains a variety of foods from the food guide plate.\nMost people are able to meet the daily recommendations by eating seafood, iodized salt, and plants grown in iodine-rich soil. When buying salt make sure it is labeled \"iodized.\" There are 78 micrograms of iodine in 1/4 teaspoon of iodized salt."}

A 3 ounce (oz) portion of cod provides 146 micrograms of iodne.\nDosages for iodine, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)\n: The average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people. An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence.\nAdequate Intake (AI)\n: This level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA."}
