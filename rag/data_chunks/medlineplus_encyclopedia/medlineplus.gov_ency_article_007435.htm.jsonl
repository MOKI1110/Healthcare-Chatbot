Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nVertical sleeve gastrectomy\nVertical sleeve gastrectomy\nVertical sleeve gastrectomy is surgery to help with weight loss. The surgeon removes a large portion of your stomach.\nThe new, smaller stomach is about the size of a banana. It limits the amount of food you can eat and makes you feel full after eating small amounts of food.\nDescription\nYou will receive\ngeneral anesthesia\nbefore this surgery. This is medicine that keeps you asleep and pain-free.\nThe surgery is usually done using a small camera that is placed in your belly. This type of surgery is called laparoscopy. The camera is called a laparoscope. It allows your surgeon to see inside your belly.\nIn this surgery:\nYour surgeon makes 2 to 5 small cuts (incisions) in your belly.\nThe scope and instruments needed to perform the surgery are inserted through these cuts.\nThe camera is connected to a video monitor in the operating room. This allows the surgeon to view inside your belly while doing the operation.\nA harmless gas is pumped into your belly to expand it."}

This allows the surgeon to view inside your belly while doing the operation.\nA harmless gas is pumped into your belly to expand it. This gives the surgeon room to work.\nYour surgeon removes most of your stomach.\nThe remaining portions of your stomach are joined together using surgical staples. This creates a long vertical tube or banana-shaped stomach.\nThe surgery does not involve cutting or changing the sphincter muscles that allow food to enter or leave the stomach.\nThe scope and other tools are removed. The cuts are closed with stitches, staples, or glue.\nThe surgery takes 60 to 90 minutes.\nWeight-loss surgery may increase your risk for gallstones. Your surgeon may recommend having a cholecystectomy. This is surgery to remove the gallbladder. It may be done before the weight-loss surgery or at the same time.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nWeight-loss surgery may be an option if you are very obese and have not been able to lose weight through diet and exercise.\nVertical sleeve gastrectomy is not a quick fix for obesity. It will greatly change your lifestyle."}

If you do not follow these measures, you may have complications from the surgery and poor weight loss.\nThis procedure may be recommended if you have:\nbody mass index (BMI)\nof 40 or more. Someone with a BMI of 40 or more is at least 100 pounds (lb) or 45 kilograms (kg) over their recommended weight. A normal BMI is between 18.5 and 25.\nA BMI of 35 or more and a serious medical condition that might improve with weight loss.

It can train you to eat less, but you still have to do much of the work.
