Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nStable angina\nStable angina\nStable angina is\nchest pain\nor discomfort that most often occurs with activity or emotional stress. Angina is due to poor blood flow through the blood vessels in the heart called the coronary arteries.\nCauses\nYour heart muscle needs a constant supply of oxygen. The coronary arteries carry oxygen-rich blood to the heart.\nWhen the heart muscle has to work harder, it needs more oxygen. Symptoms of angina may occur when blood supply to the heart muscle is reduced. This happens when the coronary arteries are narrowed or blocked by\natherosclerosis\nor by a blood clot.\nThe most common cause of angina is\ncoronary artery disease\n. Angina pectoris is the medical term for this type of chest pain.\nStable angina is less serious than unstable angina, but it can be very painful or uncomfortable.\nThere are many risk factors for\ncoronary artery disease\n."}

This means that about the same amount of exercise or activity may cause your angina to occur. Your angina should improve or go away quickly when you stop or slow down the exercise.\nThe most common symptom is chest pain that occurs behind the breastbone or slightly to the left of it. The pain of stable angina most often begins slowly and gets worse over the next few minutes before going away when the activity stops.\nTypically, the chest pain feels like tightness, heavy pressure, squeezing, or a crushing feeling."}
