Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFood labeling\nFood labeling\nFood labels contain a great deal of information on most packaged foods. Food labels are called \"Nutrition Facts.\" The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did a major update of the Nutrition Facts label in 2016. Most manufacturers have been following these new requirements since 2021.\nFunction\nThe United States government requires food labels on most packaged foods. The label offers complete, useful, and accurate nutrition information. The government encourages food manufacturers to improve the quality of their products to help people make healthier food choices. The consistent format of the label helps you directly compare the nutritional content of various foods.\nSERVING SIZE\nThe serving size on the label is based on an average amount of food that people typically eat. Similar food products have similar serving sizes to make comparing products easier.\nKeep in mind that the serving size on the label does not always equal a healthy serving size. It reflects the amount that people typically eat."}

It reflects the amount that people typically eat. It is not a recommendation for how much of that food to eat.\nMost of the time, the serving size on a label does not match the serving size on the diabetic exchange list. For packages that contain more than one serving, sometimes the label will include information based on serving size and total package size.\nAMOUNTS PER SERVING\nThe total number of calories per serving is indicated in large type. This helps consumers clearly see the number of calories per serving. The list of nutrients includes:\nTotal fat\nTrans fat\nSaturated fat\nCholesterol\nSodium\nTotal carbohydrate\nDietary fiber\nTotal sugars\nAdded sugars\nProtein\nThese nutrients are important to our health. Their amounts are shown in grams (g) or milligrams (mg) per serving to the right of the nutrient.\nVITAMINS AND MINERALS\nVitamin D\n,\ncalcium\n,\niron\n, and potassium are the only micronutrients required to be on the food label."}

Food companies can voluntarily list other vitamins and minerals in the food.\nPERCENT DAILY VALUE (% Daily Value)\nMany nutrients include a percent daily value (%DV).\nThis shows how much one serving contributes to the recommended total daily intake for each nutrient. Percent daily values make it easy for you to compare foods and see how a certain food fits into your diet.\nFor example, a food that has 13 grams of fat with a %DV of 20% means that 13 grams of fat provides 20%, or one-fifth of your recommended total daily fat intake.\nPercent daily values are based on a 2,000-calorie diet. You can use these numbers as a general guide, but bear in mind that your calorie needs may be higher or lower depending on your age, sex, height, weight, and physical activity level."}

Note that protein, trans fats, and total sugars do not have percent daily values listed.\nNUTRIENT CONTENT CLAIMS\nA nutrient content claim is a word or phrase on a food package that makes a comment about the level of a particular nutrient in the food. The claim will mean the same for every product. The following are some approved nutrient claims.\nCalorie terms:\nCalorie-free: less than 5 calories per serving.\nLow-calorie: 40 calories or less per serving (serving size greater than 30 grams).\nReduced-calorie: At least 25% fewer calories per serving when compared to the regular-calorie food.\nLight or Lite: One-third fewer total calories or 50% less fat per serving compared to the regular food."}
