The walls of the cabin are clear so that you and your health care provider can see each other. You will breathe or pant against a mouthpiece. Clips will be put on your nose to close off your nostrils. Depending on the information your provider is looking for, the mouthpiece may be open at first, and then closed.\nYou will breathe against the mouthpiece in both the open and closed positions. The positions give different information to your provider. As your chest moves while you breathe or pant, it changes the pressure and amount of air in the room and against the mouthpiece."}

The positions give different information to your provider. As your chest moves while you breathe or pant, it changes the pressure and amount of air in the room and against the mouthpiece. From these changes, your provider can get an accurate measure of the amount of air in your lungs.\nDepending on the purpose of the test, you may be given medicine before the test to most accurately measure the volume.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nLet your provider know if you are taking any medicines, particularly ones for breathing problems. You may have to temporarily stop taking certain medicines before the test.\nWear loose clothes that allow you to breathe comfortably.\nAvoid smoking and heavy exercise for 6 hours before the test.\nAvoid heavy meals before the test. They can affect your ability to take deep breaths.\nLet your provider know if you are claustrophobic.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves rapid and normal breathing, and should not be painful. You may feel short of breath or lightheaded. You will be monitored at all times by a technician.\nThe mouthpiece may feel uncomfortable against your mouth.\nIf you have trouble in tight spaces, the box might make you anxious."}

But it is clear and you can see outside at all times.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is done to see how much air you can hold in your lungs during rest. It helps your provider determine if a lung problem is due to damage to the lung structure, or a loss of the lungs' ability to expand (get bigger as air flows in).\nAlthough this test is the most accurate way to measure how much air you can hold in your lungs, it is not always used because of its technical difficulties.\nNormal Results\nNormal results depend on your age, height, weight, and sex.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results point to a problem in the lungs or chest. This problem can be due to a breakdown of the lung structure, a problem with the chest wall and its muscles, or a problem with the lungs being able to expand and contract.\nLung plethysmography will not find the cause of the problem."}
