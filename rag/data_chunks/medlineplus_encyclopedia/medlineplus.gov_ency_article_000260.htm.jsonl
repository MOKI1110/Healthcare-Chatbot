The contents of the intestine cannot pass through it.\nCauses\nObstruction of the bowel may be due to:\nA mechanical cause, which means something is partially of fully blocking the bowel\nIleus, a condition in which the bowel does not work correctly, but there is no structural problem causing the obstruction\nParalytic ileus, also called pseudo-obstruction, is one of the major causes of intestinal obstruction in infants and children."}

This is to help relieve abdominal swelling (distention) and vomiting. Volvulus of the large bowel may be treated by passing a tube into the rectum.\nSurgery may be needed to relieve the obstruction if the tube does not relieve the symptoms. It may also be needed if there are signs of tissue death. If a tumor is causing a mechanical obstruction, surgery may be needed. Obstruction from inflammation such as Crohn disease may be treated with surgery, a procedure to dilate the narrow area, or medicine if inflammation is causing a blockage.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome depends on the cause of the blockage."}

Risks for tissue death are related to the cause of the blockage and how long it has been present. Hernias, volvulus, and intussusception carry a higher gangrene risk.\nIn a newborn, paralytic ileus that destroys the bowel wall (necrotizing enterocolitis) is a life-threatening condition. It may lead to blood and lung infections.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you:\nCannot pass stool or gas\nHave a swollen abdomen (distention) that does not go away\nKeep vomiting\nHave unexplained abdominal pain that does not go away\nPrevention\nPrevention depends on the cause."}
