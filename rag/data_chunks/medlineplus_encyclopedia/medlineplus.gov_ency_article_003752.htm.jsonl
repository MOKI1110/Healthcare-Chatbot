The sample is taken by placing a thin rubber tube (called a catheter) through the urethra into the bladder. A nurse or a trained technician may do this.\nFirst, the area around the opening of the urethra is thoroughly washed with a germ-killing (antiseptic) solution. The tube is inserted into the urethra. The urine drains into a sterile container, and the catheter is removed.\nRarely, your health care provider may choose to collect a urine sample by inserting a needle directly into the bladder from the abdominal wall and draining the urine. However, this is most often done only in infants or to immediately screen for bacterial infection.\nThe urine is sent to a laboratory. Tests are done to determine if there are germs in the urine sample."}

Tests are done to determine if there are germs in the urine sample. Other tests may be done to determine the best medicine to fight the germs.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nDo not urinate for at least 1 hour before the test. If you don't have the urge to urinate, you may be instructed to drink a glass of water 15 to 20 minutes before the test. Otherwise, there is no preparation for the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThere is some discomfort. As the catheter is inserted, you may feel pressure. If you have a\nurinary tract infection\n, you may have some pain when the catheter is inserted.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is done:\nTo get a sterile urine sample in a person who cannot urinate on their own\nIf you might have a urinary tract infection\nIf you cannot empty your bladder (urinary retention)\nNormal Results\nNormal values depend on the test being performed."}

Normal results are reported as \"no growth\" and are a sign that there is no infection.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA \"positive\" or abnormal test means germs, such as bacteria or yeast, are found in the urine sample. This likely means that you have a urinary tract infection or a bladder infection. If there is only a small amount of germs and you have no symptoms, your provider may not recommend treatment.\nSometimes, bacteria that do not cause urinary tract infections may be found in the culture. This is called a contaminant. You may not need to be treated.\nPeople who have a\nurinary catheter all of the time\nmay have bacteria in their urine sample, but it does not cause a true infection."}
