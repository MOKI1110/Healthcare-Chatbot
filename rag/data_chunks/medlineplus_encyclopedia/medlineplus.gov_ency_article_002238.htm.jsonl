It reduces or stops the flow of urine into the urethra. The urethra is the tube that carries urine out of the body.\nCauses\nThis condition is common in aging men. It is often caused by an\nenlarged prostate\n.\nBladder stones\nand\nbladder cancer\nare also more commonly seen in men than women. As a man ages, the chances of getting these diseases increase greatly.\nOther common causes of BOO include:\nPelvic tumors (cervix, prostate, uterus, rectum)\nNarrowing of the tube that carries urine\nout of the body from the bladder (urethra), due to scar tissue or certain birth defects\nLess common causes include:\nCystocele (when the bladder falls into the vagina)\nForeign objects in the bladder or urethra\nUrethral or pelvic muscle spasms\nInguinal (groin) hernia\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms of BOO may vary, but can include:\nAbdominal pain\nContinuous feeling of a full bladder\nFrequent urination\nPain during urination (\ndysuria\n)\nProblems starting urina"}

A tube, called a catheter, is inserted into the bladder through the urethra. This is done to relieve the blockage.\nSometimes, a catheter is placed through the belly area into the bladder to drain the bladder. This is called a suprapubic tube.\nMost often, you will need surgery for long-term cure of BOO. However, many of the diseases that cause this problem can be treated with medicines. Talk to your provider about possible treatments.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost causes of BOO can be cured if diagnosed early. However, if the diagnosis or treatment is delayed, this can cause permanent damage to the bladder or kidneys.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of BOO.\nAlternative Names\nBOO; Lower urinary tract obstruction; Prostatism; Urinary retention - BOO\nImages\nKidney anatomy\nFemale urinary tract\nMale urinary tract\nKidney - blood and urine flow\nReferences\nAndersson KE, Wein AJ."}
