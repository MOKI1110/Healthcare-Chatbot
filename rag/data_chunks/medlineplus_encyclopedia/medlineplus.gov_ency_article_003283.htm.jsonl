They run in the direction of nail growth.\nThey are named splinter hemorrhages because they look like a splinter under the fingernail. The hemorrhages may be caused by tiny clots that damage the small capillaries under the nails.\nSplinter hemorrhages can occur with infection of the heart valves (\nendocarditis\n). They may be caused by vessel damage from swelling of the blood vessels (\nvasculitis\n) or tiny clots that damage the small capillaries (microemboli).\nCauses\nCauses may include:\nBacterial endocarditis\nInjury to the nail\nHome Care\nThere is no specific care for splinter hemorrhages."}
