Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFuchs dystrophy\nFuchs dystrophy\nFuchs (pronounced \"fooks\") dystrophy is an eye disease in which cells lining the inner surface of the cornea slowly start to die off. The disease most often affects both eyes.\nCauses\nFuchs dystrophy can be inherited, which means it can be passed down from parents to children. If either of your parents has the disease, you have a 50% chance of developing the condition.\nHowever, the condition may also occur in people without a known family history of the disease.\nFuchs dystrophy is more common in women than in men. Vision problems do not appear before age 50 years in most cases. However, a health care provider may be able to see signs of the disease in affected people by their 30s or 40s.\nFuchs dystrophy affects the thin layer of cells (endothelium) that lines the back part of the cornea. These cells help pump excess fluid out of the cornea. As more and more cells are lost, fluid begins to build up in the cornea, causing swelling and a\ncloudy cornea\n."}

These cells help pump excess fluid out of the cornea. As more and more cells are lost, fluid begins to build up in the cornea, causing swelling and a\ncloudy cornea\n. Another reason for visual loss is the development of gutatta, which are little bumps that develop in the endothelium. These bumps can cause glare by breaking up the incoming light rays.\nAt first, fluid may build up only during sleep, when the eye is closed. As the disease gets worse, small blisters may form. The blisters get bigger and may eventually break. This causes\neye pain\n. Fuchs dystrophy can also cause the shape of the cornea to change, leading to more vision problems.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nEye pain\nEye sensitivity to light\nand glare\nFoggy or\nblurred vision\n, at first only in the mornings\nSeeing colored halos around lights\nWorsening vision throughout the day\nExams and Tests\nAn eye doctor can diagnose Fuchs dystrophy during a\nslit-lamp exam\n.\nOther  tests that may be done include:\nPachymetry -- measures the thickness of the cornea\nSpecular microscope examination -- allows the eye doctor to look at the thin layer of cells that line the back part of the cornea\nVisual acui"}

During this procedure, a small round piece of the cornea is removed, leaving an opening in the front of the eye. A matching piece of cornea from a human donor is then sewn into the opening in the front of the eye.\nA newer technique called endothelial keratoplasty (DSEK, DSAEK, or DMEK) has become the preferred option for people with Fuchs dystrophy. In this procedure, only the inner layers of the cornea are replaced, instead of all the layers. This leads to a faster recovery and fewer complications."}

In this procedure, only the inner layers of the cornea are replaced, instead of all the layers. This leads to a faster recovery and fewer complications. Stitches are most often not needed.\nFor people with Fuchs dystrophy that have mostly guttata and not much swelling, stripping off a small central disk of the endothelium containing the guttata can be helpful. In this method, DWEK, transplanting new endothelium, as would be done in DSEK, DSAEK or DMEK, is not necessary.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nFuchs dystrophy gets worse over time. Without a corneal transplant, a person with severe Fuchs dystrophy may become blind or have severe pain and very reduced vision.\nMild cases of Fuchs dystrophy often worsen after\ncataract surgery\n. A cataract surgeon will evaluate this risk and may modify the technique or the timing of your cataract surgery.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have:\nEye pain\nEye sensitivity to light\nThe feeling that something is in your eye when there is nothing there\nVision problems such as seeing halos or cloudy vision\nWorsening vision\nPrevention\nThere is no known prevention."}
