Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTurner syndrome\nTurner syndrome\nTurner syndrome is a rare genetic condition in which a female does not have the usual pair of X chromosomes.\nCauses\nThe typical number of human chromosomes is 46. Chromosomes contain all of your genes and DNA, the building blocks of the body. Two of these chromosomes, the sex chromosomes, determine if you become a boy or a girl.\nFemales typically have 2 of the same sex chromosomes, written as XX.\nMales have an X and a Y chromosome (written as XY).\nIn Turner syndrome, cells are missing all or part of an X chromosome. The condition only occurs in females. Most commonly, a female with Turner syndrome has only 1 X chromosome. Others may have 2 X chromosomes, but one of them is incomplete. Sometimes, a female has some cells with 2 X chromosomes, but other cells have only 1."}

This situation is called mosaicism.\nSymptoms\nPossible findings of the head and neck include:\nEars are low-set\n.\nNeck appears wide or web-like.\nRoof of the mouth is narrow (high palate).\nHairline at the back of the head is lower.\nLower jaw is lower and appears to fade away (recede).\nDrooping eyelids and dry eyes.\nOther findings may include:\nFingers and toes are short.\nHands and feet are swollen in infants.\nNails are narrow and turn upward.\nChest is broad and flat.\nNipples appear more widely spaced.\nHeight at birth is often smaller than average.\nA child with Turner syndrome is much shorter than children who are the same age and sex. This is called\nshort stature\n. This problem may not be noticed in girls before age 11.\nPuberty may be absent or not complete. If puberty occurs, it most often begins at the normal age."}

After the age of puberty, unless treated with female hormones, these findings may be present:\nPubic hair is often present and normal.\nBreast development may not occur.\nMenstrual periods are absent or very light.\nVaginal dryness and pain with intercourse are common.\nInfertility.\nSometimes, the diagnosis of Turner syndrome may not be made until adulthood. It may be discovered because a woman has very light or no menstrual periods and problems becoming pregnant.\nExams and Tests\nTurner syndrome can be diagnosed at any stage of life.\nIt may be diagnosed before birth if:\nA chromosome analysis is done during prenatal testing.\nA cystic hygroma is a fluid collection that often occurs in the head and neck area. This finding may be seen on ultrasound during the pregnancy and leads to further testing.\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and look for signs of atypical development."}
