Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nDuodenal atresia\nDuodenal atresia\nDuodenal atresia is a condition in which the first part of the small bowel (the\nduodenum\n) has not developed properly. It is not open and does not allow the passage of stomach contents.\nCauses\nThe cause of duodenal atresia is not known. It is thought to result from problems during an embryo's development. The duodenum does not change from a solid to a tube-like structure, as it normally would.\nMany infants with duodenal atresia also have\nDown syndrome\n. Duodenal atresia is often associated with other birth defects.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of duodenal atresia include:\nUpper abdominal swelling (sometimes)\nEarly vomiting of large amounts, which may be greenish (containing\nbile\n)\nContinued vomiting even when infant has not been fed for several hours\nNo bowel movements after first few meconium stools\nExams and Tests\nA fetal ultrasound may show high amounts of\namniotic fluid\nin the womb (\npolyhydramnios\n)."}

It may also show swelling of the baby's stomach and part of the duodenum.\nAn\nabdominal x-ray\nmay show air in the stomach and first part of duodenum, with no air beyond that. This is known as the double-bubble sign.\nTreatment\nA tube is placed to decompress the stomach. Dehydration and electrolyte imbalances are corrected by providing fluids through an intravenous tube (IV, into a vein). Checking for other congenital anomalies should be done.\nSurgery to correct the duodenal blockage is necessary, but not an emergency. The exact surgery will depend on the nature of the abnormality. Other problems (such as those related to Down syndrome) must be treated as appropriate.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nRecovery from the duodenal atresia is expected after treatment."}
