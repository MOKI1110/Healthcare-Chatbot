Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPellagra\nPellagra\nPellagra is a disease that occurs when a person does not get enough\nniacin\n(one of the B complex vitamins) or\ntryptophan\n(an amino acid).\nCauses\nPellagra is caused by having too little niacin or tryptophan in the diet. It can also occur if the body fails to absorb these nutrients.\nPellagra may also develop due to:\nGastrointestinal diseases\nWeight loss (bariatric) surgery\nAnorexia\nExcessive alcohol use\nCarcinoid syndrome\n(group of symptoms associated with carcinoid tumors of the small intestine, colon, appendix, and bronchial tubes in the lungs)\nCertain medicines, such as isoniazid, 5-fluorouracil, 6-mercaptopurine, pyrazinamide, hydantoin, ethionamide, phenobarbital, azathioprine, and chloramphenicol\nPellagra is most common among poor and food-limited populations. The disease is more common in parts of the world (such as certain parts of Africa) where people have a lot of untreated corn in their diet. Corn is a poor source of tryptophan, and niacin in corn is tightly bound to other components of the grain."}

Corn is a poor source of tryptophan, and niacin in corn is tightly bound to other components of the grain. Niacin is released from corn if soaked in limewater overnight. This method is used to cook tortillas in Central America where pellagra is rare. Pellagra is rare in the United States and may be associated with severe alcoholism or medical causes of malnutrition.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of pellagra include:\nDelusions or mental confusion\nDiarrhea\nWeakness\nLoss of appetite\nPain in abdomen\nInflamed mucous membrane\nScaly skin sores, especially in sun-exposed areas of the skin\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam.
