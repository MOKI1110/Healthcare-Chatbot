These are called the peripheral nerves.\nCauses\nCharcot-Marie-Tooth is one of the most common nerve-related disorders passed down through families (inherited). Changes to any of at least 40 genes can cause different forms of this disease.\nThe disease leads to damage or destruction to the covering (\nmyelin\nsheath) around nerve fibers.\nSymptoms\nNerves that stimulate movement (called the motor nerves) are most severely affected. The nerves in the legs are affected first and most severely.\nSymptoms most often begin between mid-childhood and early adulthood."}

The nerves in the legs are affected first and most severely.\nSymptoms most often begin between mid-childhood and early adulthood. They may include:\nFoot deformity (very high arch to feet)\nFoot drop (inability to point foot upward to hold it horizontal)\nLoss of lower leg muscle, which leads to skinny calves\nNumbness in the foot or leg\n\"Slapping\" gait (feet hit the floor hard when walking)\nWeakness\nof the hips, legs, or feet\nLater, similar symptoms may appear in the arms and hands. These may include a claw-like hand.\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam may show:\nDifficulty lifting up the foot and making toe-out movements (foot drop)\nLack of stretch reflexes in the legs\nLoss of muscle control and atrophy (shrinking of the muscles) in the foot or leg\nThickened nerve bundles under the skin of the legs\nNerve conduction tests are often done to identify different forms of the disorder. A nerve biopsy may confirm the diagnosis.\nGenetic testing is also available for most forms of the disease.\nTreatment\nThere is no known cure."}

Orthopedic surgery or equipment (such as braces or orthopedic shoes) may make it easier to walk.\nPhysical and occupational therapy may help maintain muscle strength and improve independent functioning.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nCharcot-Marie-Tooth disease slowly gets worse. Some parts of the body may become numb, and pain can range from mild to severe. Eventually the disease may cause disability.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nProgressive inability to walk\nProgressive weakness\nInjury to areas of the body that have decreased sensation\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if there is ongoing weakness or decreased sensation in the feet or legs.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling and testing is advised if there is a strong family history of the disorder.\nAlternative Names\nProgressive neuropathic (peroneal) muscular atrophy; Hereditary peroneal nerve dysfunction; Neuropathy - peroneal (hereditary); Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy\nImages\nCe"}
