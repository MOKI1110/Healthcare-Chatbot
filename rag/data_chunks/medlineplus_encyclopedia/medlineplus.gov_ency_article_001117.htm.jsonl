Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLymphatic obstruction\nLymphatic obstruction\nLymphatic obstruction is a blockage of the\nlymph vessels\nthat drain fluid from tissues throughout the body and allow immune cells to travel where they are needed. Lymphatic obstruction may cause lymphedema, which means swelling due to a blockage of the lymph passages.\nCauses\nThe most common reason for lymphatic obstruction is the removal or enlargement of the lymph nodes.\nOther causes of lymphatic obstruction include:\nInfections with parasites, such as filariasis\nInjury\nRadiation therapy\nSkin infections, such as\ncellulitis\n(more common in obese people)\nSurgery\nTumors\nA common cause of lymphedema is removal of the breast (\nmastectomy\n) and underarm lymph tissue for breast cancer treatment."}

This causes lymphedema of the arm in some people, because the lymphatic drainage of the arm passes through the armpit (axilla).\nRare forms of lymphedema that are present from birth (congenital) may result from problems in the development of the lymphatic vessels.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom is persistent (\nchronic\n) swelling, usually of the arm or leg.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history. This will include questions about how much the swelling improves with elevation and how firm the tissues are.\nThe following tests may be done:\nCT\nor\nMRI\nscan\nImaging tests to check the lymph nodes and lymph drainage (\nlymphangiography\nand lymphoscintigraphy)\nTreatment\nTreatment for lymphedema includes:\nCompression (usually with wrapping in bandages or\nstockings\n)\nManual lymph drainage (MLD)\nRange of motion or resistance exercises\nManual lymph drainage is a light massage therapy technique."}

During the massage, the skin is moved in certain directions based on the structure of the lymphatic system. This helps the lymph fluid drain through the proper channels.\nTreatment also includes skin care to prevent injuries, infection, and skin breakdown. Light exercise and movement programs may also be prescribed. Wearing compression garments on the affected area or using a pneumatic compression pump may be helpful. Your provider and physical therapist will decide which compression methods are best.\nSurgery is used in some cases, but it has limited success. Your surgeon must have a lot of experience with this type of procedure. You will still need physical therapy after surgery to reduce lymphedema.\nTypes of surgery include:\nLiposuction\nRemoval of abnormal lymphatic tissue\nTransplant of normal lymphatic tissues to areas with abnormal lymphatic drainage (rarely done)\nIn rare cases, surgery to bypass abnormal lymph tissue using vein grafts is done."}

These procedures are most effective for early lymphedema and should be performed by an experienced surgeon.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nLymphedema is a chronic condition that usually requires lifelong management. In some cases, lymphedema improves with time. Some swelling is usually permanent.\nPossible Complications\nIn addition to swelling, the most common complications include:\nChronic wounds and\nulcers\nSkin breakdown\nCancer of the lymph tissue (rare)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have swelling of your arms, legs, or lymph nodes that does not respond to treatment or go away.\nPrevention\nMost surgeons now use a technique called sentinel lymph node sampling to reduce your risk for lymphedema after breast cancer surgery.
