Tell your provider if you have recently been exposed to radioisotopes, such as during a nuclear medicine test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain.

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nIn women, an increase in LH level at mid-cycle causes release of eggs (ovulation). Your provider will order this test to see if:\nYou are ovulating, when you are having trouble getting pregnant or have periods that are not regular\nYou have reached menopause\nIf you are a man, the test may be ordered if you have signs of infertility or lowered sex drive. The test may be ordered if you have signs of a\npituitary gland\nproblem.\nNormal Results\nNormal results for adult women are:\nBefore menopause: 5 to 25 IU/L\nLevel peaks even higher around the middle of the menstrual cycle\nLevel then becomes higher after menopause: 14.2 to 52.3 IU/L\nLH levels are normally low during childhood.\nNormal result for men over 18 years of age is around 1.8 to 8.6 IU/L.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}
