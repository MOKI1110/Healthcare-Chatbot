Having COPD makes it hard to breathe.\nThere are two main forms of COPD:\nChronic bronchitis, which involves a long-term cough with mucus\nEmphysema, which involves damage to the lungs over time\nMost people with COPD have a combination of both conditions.\nCauses\nSmoking is the main cause of COPD. The more a person smokes, the more likely that person will develop COPD."}

The more a person smokes, the more likely that person will develop COPD. But some people smoke for years and never get COPD.\nIf a person has a rare condition in which they lack a protein called\nalpha-1 antitrypsin\n, they can develop emphysema even without smoking.\nOther risk factors for COPD are:\nExposure to certain gases or fumes in the workplace\nExposure to heavy amounts of secondhand smoke and pollution\nFrequent use of a cooking fire without proper ventilation\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nCough\n, with or without mucus\nFatigue\nFrequent respiratory infections\nShortness of breath (\ndyspnea\n) that gets worse with mild activity\nTrouble catching one's breath\nWheezing\nBecause the symptoms develop slowly, many people may not know that they have COPD.\nExams and Tests\nThe best test for COPD is a lung function test called\nspirometry\n. This involves blowing out as hard as possible into a small machine that tests air movement and lung capacity."}

This involves blowing out as hard as possible into a small machine that tests air movement and lung capacity. The results can be checked right away.\nUsing a stethoscope to listen to the lungs can also be helpful, showing prolonged expiratory time or wheezing. But sometimes, the lungs sound normal, even when a person has COPD.\nImaging tests of the lungs, such as\nx-rays\nand\nCT scans\nmay be ordered. With an x-ray, the lungs may look normal, even when a person has COPD. A CT scan will almost always show signs of COPD if it is present.\nSometimes, a blood test called\narterial blood gas\nmay be done to measure the amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood.\nIf your health care provider suspects you have alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, a\nblood test\nwill likely be ordered to detect this condition.\nTreatment\nThere is no cure for COPD. But there are many things you can do to relieve symptoms and keep the disease from getting worse.\nIf you smoke,\nnow is the time to quit\n."}

Only a few people benefit from these surgical treatments:\nOne-way valves can be inserted with a bronchoscopy to help deflate parts of the lung that are hyperinflated (overinflated) in select patients.\nSurgery to remove parts of the diseased lung, which can help less-diseased parts work better in some people with emphysema (lung volume reduction surgery).\nLung transplant\nfor a small number of very severe cases.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\nsupport group\n.
