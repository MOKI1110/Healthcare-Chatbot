Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBrain abscess\nBrain abscess\nA brain abscess is a collection of pus, immune cells, and other material in the brain, caused by a bacterial or fungal infection.\nCauses\nBrain abscesses commonly occur when bacteria or fungi infect part of the brain. As a result, swelling and irritation (inflammation) develop. Infected brain cells, white blood cells, live and dead bacteria or fungi collect in an area of the brain. Tissue forms around this area and creates a mass or abscess.\nThe germs that cause a brain abscess can reach the brain through the blood. Or, they enter the brain directly, such as during brain surgery. In some cases, a brain abscess develops from an infection in the sinuses.\nThe source of the infection is often not found. However, the most common identified source is a lung infection."}
