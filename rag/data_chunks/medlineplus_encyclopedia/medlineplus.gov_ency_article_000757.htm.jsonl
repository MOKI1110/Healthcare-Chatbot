However, people with MSA-P have more widespread damage to the part of the nervous system that regulates important functions such as heart rate, blood pressure, and sweating.\nThe other subtype of MSA is\nMSA-cerebellar\n. It mainly affects the cerebellum, an area deep in the brain, just above the spinal cord.\nCauses\nThe cause of MSA-P is unknown. The affected areas of the brain overlap with areas affected by Parkinson disease, with similar symptoms. For this reason, this subtype of MSA is called parkinsonian.\nMSA-P is most often diagnosed in men older than 60.\nSymptoms\nMSA damages the nervous system. The disease tends to progress rapidly."}

For this reason, this subtype of MSA is called parkinsonian.\nMSA-P is most often diagnosed in men older than 60.\nSymptoms\nMSA damages the nervous system. The disease tends to progress rapidly. About one half of people with MSA-P have lost most of their motor skills within 5 years of onset of the disease.\nSymptoms may include:\nPassing out (syncope) due to drops in blood pressure\nTremors\nMovement difficulties, such as slowness, loss of balance, shuffling when walking\nFrequent falls\nMuscle aches and pains (\nmyalgia\n), and stiffness\nFace changes, such as a masklike appearance to the face and staring\nDifficulty chewing or\nswallowing\n(occasionally), not able to close the mouth\nDisrupted sleep patterns (often during rapid eye movement [REM] sleep late at night)\nDizziness\nor fainting when standing up or after standing still\nErection problems\nLoss of control over\nbowels\nor\nbladder\nProblems with activities that requires small movements (loss of fine motor skills), such as writing that is small and hard to read\nLoss of sweating in any part of the body\nDecline in mental function\nNausea\nand problems with digestion\nPosture problems, such as unstable, stooped, or slumped over\nVision change"}

Also contact your provider if new symptoms appear, including possible side effects of medicines, such as:\nChanges in alertness/behavior/mood\nDelusional behavior\nDizziness\nHallucinations\nInvoluntary movements\nLoss of mental functioning\nNausea or vomiting\nSevere confusion or disorientation\nIf you have a family member with MSA and their condition declines to the point that you are unable to care for the person at home, seek advice from your family member's provider.\nAlternative Names\nShy-Drager syndrome; Neurologic orthostatic hypotension; Shy-McGee-Drager syndrome; Parkinson plus syndrome; MSA-P; MSA-C\nImages\nCentral nervous system and peripheral nervous system\nReferences\nJankovic J.
