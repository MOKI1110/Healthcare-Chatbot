Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNasal polyps\nNasal polyps\nNasal polyps are soft, sac-like growths on the lining of the nose or sinuses.\nCauses\nNasal polyps can grow anywhere on the lining of the nose or the sinuses. They often grow where the sinuses open into the nasal cavity. Small polyps may not cause any problems. Large polyps can block your sinuses or nasal airway.\nNasal polyps are not cancer. They seem to grow due to long-term swelling and inflammation in the nose from allergies, asthma, or infection.\nNo one knows exactly why some people get nasal polyps. If you have any of the following conditions, you may be more likely to get nasal polyps:\nAspirin sensitivity\nAsthma\nLong-term (chronic) sinus infections\nCystic fibrosis\nHay fever\nSymptoms\nIf you have small polyps, you may not have any symptoms."}

If polyps block nasal passages, a\nsinus infection\ncan develop.\nSymptoms include:\nRunny nose\nStuffed up nose\nSneezing\nFeeling like your\nnose is blocked\nLoss of smell\nLoss of taste\nHeadache and pain if you also have a sinus infection\nSnoring\nWith polyps, you may feel like you always have a head cold.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will look in your nose. They may need to perform nasal endoscopy to see the full extent of the polyps. Polyps look like a grayish grape-shaped growth in the nasal cavity.\nYou may have a\nCT scan\nof your sinuses. Polyps will appear as cloudy spots. Older polyps may have broken down some of the bone inside your sinuses.\nTreatment\nMedicines help relieve symptoms, but rarely get rid of nasal polyps.\nNasal steroid sprays can sometimes shrink polyps. They help clear blocked nasal passages and runny nose. Symptoms return if treatment is stopped.\nCorticosteroid pills or liquid may also shrink polyps, and can reduce swelling and nasal congestion."}

The effect lasts a few months in most cases.\nAllergy medicines can help prevent polyps from growing back.\nAntibiotics can treat a sinus infection caused by bacteria. They can't treat polyps or sinus infections caused by a virus.\nIf medicines don't work, or you have very large polyps, you may need surgery to remove them.\nEndoscopic sinus surgery is often used to treat polyps. With this procedure, your surgeon uses a thin, lighted tube with instruments at the end. The tube is inserted into your nasal passages and your surgeon removes the polyps.\nUsually you can go home the same day.\nSometimes polyps come back, even after surgery.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nRemoving polyps with surgery often makes it easier to breathe through your nose."}

However, nasal sprays, antihistamines, and allergy shots may help prevent polyps that block your airway.  Newer treatments such as injection therapy with anti-IGE antibodies may help prevent polyps from coming back.\nTreating sinus infections right away also may help.\nImages\nThroat anatomy\nNasal polyps\nReferences\nBachert C, Zhang N, Gevaert P.
