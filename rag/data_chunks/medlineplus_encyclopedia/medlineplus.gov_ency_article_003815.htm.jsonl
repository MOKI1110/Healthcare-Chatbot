Organs include the liver, spleen, stomach, and intestines. The bones of the lower spine are also visible.\nWhen the test is done to look at the bladder and kidney structures, it is called a KUB (kidneys, ureters, bladder) x-ray.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test may be done in a hospital radiology department. Or, it may be done in the health care provider's office by an x-ray technologist.\nYou lie on your back on the x-ray table. The x-ray machine is positioned over your abdominal area. You hold your breath as the picture is taken so that the picture will not be blurry."}
