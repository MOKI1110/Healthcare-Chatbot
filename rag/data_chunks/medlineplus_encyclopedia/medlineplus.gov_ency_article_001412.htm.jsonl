Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEpidural hematoma\nEpidural hematoma\nAn epidural hematoma (EDH) is bleeding between the inside of the skull and the outer covering of the brain (called the dura mater).\nCauses\nAn EDH is often caused by a skull\nfracture\nduring childhood or adolescence. The membrane covering the brain is not as closely attached to the skull as it is in older people and children younger than 2 years. Therefore, this type of bleeding is more common in young people.\nAn EDH can also occur due to rupture of a blood vessel, usually an artery. The blood vessel then bleeds into the space between the dura and the skull.\nThe affected vessels are often torn by skull fractures. The fractures are most often the result of a severe head injury, such as those caused by motorcycle, bicycle, skateboard, snow boarding, or automobile accidents. Less severe blunt trauma, such as getting hit by a baseball, can also result in an EDH.\nRapid bleeding causes a collection of blood (hematoma) that presses on the brain. The pressure inside the head (\nintracranial pressure, ICP\n) increases quickly."}

But this pattern may not appear in all people.\nThe most important symptoms of an EDH are:\nConfusion\nDizziness\nDrowsiness\nor altered level of alertness\nEnlarged pupil in one eye\nHeadache\n(severe)\nHead injury\nor trauma followed by loss of consciousness, a period of alertness, then rapid deterioration back to\nunconsciousness\nNausea or vomiting\nWeakness\nin part of the body, usually on the opposite side from the side with the enlarged pupil\nSeizures\ncan occur as a result of head impact\nThe symptoms usually occur within minutes to hours after a head injury and indicate an emergency situation.\nSometimes, b"}

The symptoms of pressure on the brain also do not occur right away.\nExams and Tests\nThe brain and nervous system (neurological) exam may show that a specific part of the brain is not working well (for instance, there may be arm weakness on one side).\nThe exam may also show signs of increased ICP, such as:\nHeadaches\nSomnolence\nConfusion\nNausea and vomiting\nIf there is increased ICP, emergency surgery may be needed to relieve the pressure and prevent further brain injury.\nA non-contrast\nhead CT scan\nwill confirm the diagnosis of EDH, and will pinpoint the exact location of the hematoma and any associated skull fracture. MRI may be useful to identify small epidural hematomas from subdural ones.\nTreatment\nAn EDH is an emergency condition. Treatment goals include:\nTaking measures to save the person's life\nRegulating symptoms\nMinimizing or preventing permanent damage to the brain\nLife support measures may be required."}

Treatment goals include:\nTaking measures to save the person's life\nRegulating symptoms\nMinimizing or preventing permanent damage to the brain\nLife support measures may be required. Emergency surgery is often necessary to reduce pressure within the brain. This may include drilling a small hole in the skull to relieve pressure and allow blood to drain outside the skull.\nLarge hematomas or solid\nblood clots\nmay need to be removed through a larger opening in the skull (\ncraniotomy\n).\nMedicines used in addition to surgery will vary according to the type and severity of symptoms and brain damage that occurs.\nAntiseizure medicines may be used to regulate or, ideally, completely prevent seizures. Some medicines called hyperosmotic agents may be used to reduce brain swelling.\nFor people on blood thinners or with bleeding disorders, treatments to prevent further bleeding might be needed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAn EDH has a high risk of death without prompt surgical intervention. Even with prompt medical attention, a significant risk of death and disability remains.\nPossible Complications\nThere is a risk of permanent brain injury, even if EDH is treated quickly."}
