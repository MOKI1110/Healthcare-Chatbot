Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPulmonary angiography\nPulmonary angiography\nPulmonary angiography is a test to see how blood flows through the lung.\nAngiography is an imaging test that uses\nx-rays\nand a special dye to see the insides of the arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis test is done at a hospital or specialized procedure unit. You will be asked to lie on an x-ray table.\nBefore the test starts, you will be given a mild sedative to help you relax.\nAn area of your body, most often the arm or groin, is cleaned and numbed with a local numbing medicine (anesthetic).\nThe radiologist or cardiologist inserts a needle or makes a small cut in a vein in the area that has been cleaned. A thin hollow tube called a catheter is inserted.\nThe catheter is placed through the vein and carefully moved up into and through the right-sided heart chambers and into the pulmonary artery, which leads to the lungs."}

The doctor can see live x-ray images of the area on a TV-like monitor, and use them as a guide.\nOnce the catheter is in place, dye is injected into the catheter. X-ray images are taken to see how the dye moves through the lungs' arteries. The dye helps detect any blockages to blood flow.\nYour\npulse\n, blood pressure, and breathing are checked during the procedure.\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG) leads are taped to your arms and legs to monitor your heart.\nAfter the x-rays are taken, the needle and catheter are removed.\nPressure is applied to the puncture site for 20 to 45 minutes to stop the bleeding. After that time, the area is checked and a tight bandage is applied."}

After that time, the area is checked and a tight bandage is applied. You should keep your leg straight for 6 hours after the procedure.\nRarely, medicines are delivered to the lungs if a blood clot has been found during the procedure.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 6 to 8 hours before the test.\nYou will be asked to wear a hospital gown and sign a consent form for the procedure. Remove jewelry from the area being imaged.\nTell your health care provider:\nIf you are pregnant\nIf you have ever had any allergic reactions to x-ray contrast material, shellfish, or iodine substances\nIf you are allergic to any medicines\nWhich medicines you are taking (including any herbal preparations)\nIf you have ever had any bleeding problems\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe x-ray table may feel cold. Ask for a blanket or pillow if you are uncomfortable. You may feel a brief sting when the numbing medicine is given and a brief, sharp, stick as the catheter is inserted.\nYou may feel some pressure as the catheter moves up into the lungs."}

You may feel a brief sting when the numbing medicine is given and a brief, sharp, stick as the catheter is inserted.\nYou may feel some pressure as the catheter moves up into the lungs. The contrast dye can cause a feeling of warmth and flushing. This is normal and usually goes away in a few seconds.\nYou may have some tenderness and bruising at the site of the injection after the test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is most often used to detect\nblood clots\n(\npulmonary embolism\n) and other blockages in the blood flow in the lung. Most of the time, your provider will have tried other tests to diagnose a blood clot in the lungs.\nPulmonary angiography may also be used to help diagnose:\nAV malformations of the lung\nCongenital (present from birth) narrowing of the pulmonary vessels\nPulmonary artery aneurysms\nPulmonary hypertension\n, high blood pressure in the arteries of the lungs\nNormal Results\nThe x-ray will show normal structures for the age of the person.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be due to:\nAneurysms of pulmonary vessels\nBlood clot in the lungs (pulmonary embolism)\nNarrowed blood vessel\nPrimary pulmonary hypertension\nTumor in the lung\nRisks\nA"}
