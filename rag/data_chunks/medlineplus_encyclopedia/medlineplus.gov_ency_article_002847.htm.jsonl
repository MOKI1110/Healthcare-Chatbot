They contain a medicine called epinephrine, which you should take right away if you get a bee, wasp, hornet, or yellow jacket sting.\nCall poison control or a hospital emergency room if the person who is stung has an allergy to the insect or was stung inside the mouth or throat. People with severe reactions may need to go to the hospital.\nTo treat the sting:\nTry to remove the stinger from the skin (if it is still present). To do this, carefully scrape the back of a knife or other thin, blunt, straight-edged object (like a credit card) across the stinger if the person can keep still and it is safe to do so. If you are pulling the stinger out, it is important to not pinch the venom sac at the end of the stinger. If this sac is squeezed or broken, more venom will be released.\nClean the area thoroughly with soap and water.\nPlace ice (wrapped in a clean cloth) on the site of the sting for 10 minutes and then off for 10 minutes. Repeat this process."}
