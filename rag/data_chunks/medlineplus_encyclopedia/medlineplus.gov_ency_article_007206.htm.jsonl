The arthroscope is inserted through a small cut (incision) in your skin.\nDescription\nThe rotator cuff is a group of muscles and their tendons that form a cuff over the shoulder joint. These muscles and tendons hold the arm in the shoulder joint. This also helps the shoulder move in different directions. The tendons in the rotator cuff can tear when they are overused or injured.\nYou will likely receive\ngeneral anesthesia\nfor this surgery. This means you will be asleep and unable to feel pain. Or, you may have regional anesthesia. Your arm and shoulder area will be numbed and as a result, you do not feel any pain. If you receive regional anesthesia, you will also be given medicine or general anesthesia to make you very sleepy during the operation.\nDuring the procedure, the surgeon:\nInserts the arthroscope into your shoulder through a small incision."}

The scope is connected to a video monitor in the operating room.\nInspects all the tissues of your shoulder joint and the area above the joint. These tissues include the cartilage, bones, tendons, and ligaments.\nRepairs any damaged tissues. To do this, your surgeon makes 1 to 3 more small incisions and inserts other instruments through them. A tear in a muscle, tendon, or cartilage is fixed. Any damaged tissue is removed.\nYour surgeon may do one or more of these procedures during your operation:\nRotator cuff repair:\nThe edges of the tendon are brought together. The tendon is attached to the bone with sutures.\nSmall rivets (called suture anchors) are often used to help attach the tendon to the bone.\nThe anchors can be made of metal, plastic, or suture material alone."}

They do not need to be removed after surgery.\nSurgery for impingement syndrome:\nDamaged or inflamed tissue is cleaned out in the area above the shoulder joint.\nA ligament called the coracoacromial ligament may be cut.\nThe underside of a bone called the acromion may be shaved. A bony growth (spur) on the underside of the acromion often causes impingement syndrome. The spur can cause inflammation and pain in your shoulder.\nSurgery for shoulder instability:\nIf you have a torn labrum, the surgeon will repair it. The labrum is the cartilage that lines the rim of the shoulder joint.\nLigaments that attach to this area will also be repaired.\nThe Bankart lesion is a tear on the labrum in the lower part of the shoulder joint.  It can involve part of the glenoid bone where it can be broken off.\nA SLAP lesion involves the labrum and the ligament on the top part of the shoulder joint.\nAt the end of the surgery, the incisions will be closed with stitches and covered with a dressing (bandage)."}

Most surgeons take pictures from the video monitor during the procedure to show you what they found and the repairs that were made.\nYour surgeon may need to do open surgery if there is a lot of damage. Open surgery means you will have a large incision so that the surgeon can get directly to your bones and tissues.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nArthroscopy may be recommended for these shoulder problems:\nA torn or damaged cartilage ring (labrum) or ligaments\nShoulder instability, in which the shoulder joint is loose and slides around too much or becomes dislocated (slips out of the ball and socket joint)\nA torn or damaged biceps tendon\nA torn rotator cuff\nA bone spur or inflammation around the rotator cuff\nInflammation or damaged lining of the joint, often caused by an illness, such as rheumatoid arthritis\nArthritis of the end of the clavicle (collarbone)\nLoose tissue that needs to be removed\nShoulder impingement syndrome, to make more room for the shoulder to move around\nRisks\nRisks of"}

Ask your\nprovider for help\n. Smoking can\nslow wound and bone healing\n.\nTell your surgeon about any cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness you may have before your surgery.\nOn the day of surgery:\nFollow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.\nTake any medicines you're asked to take with a small sip of water.\nFollow instructions on when to arrive at the hospital.

It can range from 1 week to several months.\nPhysical therapy may help you regain motion and strength in your shoulder. The length of therapy will depend on what was done during your surgery.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nArthroscopy often results in less pain and stiffness, fewer complications, a shorter (if any) hospital stay, and faster recovery than open surgery.\nIf you had a repair, your body needs time to heal, even after arthroscopic surgery, just as you would need time to recover from open surgery. Because of this, your recovery time may still be long.\nSurgery to fix a cartilage tear is usually done to make the shoulder more stable. Many people recover fully, and their shoulder stays stable."}
