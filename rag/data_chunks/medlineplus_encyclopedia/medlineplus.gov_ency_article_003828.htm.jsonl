They may be done separately or together.\nDuring the perfusion scan, a technician injects radioactive albumin into your vein. You are placed on a movable table that is under the arm of a scanner."}

The machine scans your lungs as blood flows through them to find the location of the radioactive particles.\nDuring the ventilation scan, you breathe in radioactive gas through a mask while you are sitting or lying on a table under the scanner arm.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou do not need to stop eating (fast), be on a special diet, or take any medicines before the test.\nchest x-ray\nis usually done before, and sometimes after a ventilation and perfusion scan.\nYou wear a hospital gown or comfortable clothing that does not have metal fasteners.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe table may feel hard or cold. You may feel a sharp prick when the IV is placed in the vein in your arm for the perfusion part of the scan.\nThe mask used during the ventilation scan may make you feel nervous about being in a small space (claustrophobia)."}

You must lie still during the scan.\nThe\nradioisotope\ninjection usually does not cause discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe ventilation scan is used to see how well air moves and blood flows through the lungs. The perfusion scan measures the blood supply through the lungs.\nA ventilation and perfusion scan is most often done to detect an acute\npulmonary embolus\n(blood clot in the lungs). It is also used to:\nDetect abnormal circulation (shunts) in the blood vessels of the lungs (pulmonary vessels)\nDetect abnormal circulation from multiple old blood clots (chronic thromboembolic disease)\nTest regional (different lung areas) lung function in people with advanced\npulmonary disease\n, such as\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n(COPD)\nNormal Results\nA radiologist will evaluate your ventilation and perfusion scan in conjunction with a chest x-ray."}

All parts of both lungs should take up the radioisotope evenly.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf the lungs take up lower than normal amounts of radioisotope during a ventilation or perfusion scan, it may be due to any of the following:\nAirway obstruction\nCOPD\nPneumonia\nNarrowing of the pulmonary artery\nInflammation of the lungs due to breathing in a foreign substance (pneumonitis)\nPulmonary embolus\nChronic thromboembolic pulmonary disease\nReduced breathing and ventilation ability\nRisks\nRisks are about the same as for x-rays (radiation) and needle pricks.\nNo radiation is released from the scanner. Instead, it detects radiation and converts it into an image.\nThere is a small exposure to radiation from the radioisotope. The radioisotopes used during scans are short-lived. All of the radiation leaves the body in a few days."}

However, as with any radiation exposure, caution is advised for pregnant or breastfeeding women.\nThere is a slight risk for infection or bleeding at the site where the needle is inserted. The risk with perfusion scan is the same as with inserting an\nintravenous\nneedle for any other purpose.\nIn rare cases, a person may develop an\nallergy\nto the radioisotope. This may include a serious\nanaphylactic reaction\n.\nConsiderations\nA pulmonary ventilation and perfusion scan may be a lower-risk alternative to\npulmonary angiography\nfor evaluating disorders of the lung blood supply.\nThis test may not provide a definite diagnosis, particularly in people with lung disease. Other tests may be needed to confirm or check for the findings of a pulmonary ventilation and perfusion scan.\nThis test has largely been replaced by CT pulmonary angiography for diagnosing pulmonary embolism."}
