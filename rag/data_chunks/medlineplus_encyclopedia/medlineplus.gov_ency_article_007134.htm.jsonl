Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAnemia caused by low iron - children\nAnemia caused by low iron - children\nAnemia\nis a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues. There are many types of anemia.\nIron helps make red blood cells and helps these cells carry oxygen. A lack of iron in the body may lead to anemia. The medical name of this problem is iron deficiency anemia.\nCauses\nAnemia caused by a low iron level is the most common form of anemia. The body gets iron through certain foods. It also reuses iron from old red blood cells.\nA diet that does not have enough iron is the most common cause of this type of anemia in children. When a child is growing rapidly, such as during puberty, even more iron is needed.\nToddlers who drink too much cow's milk may also become anemic because too much cow's milk makes it difficult for the body to absorb iron."}

Also, children who drink too much cow's milk may not eat enough other healthy foods that have iron.\nOther causes may be:\nThe body is not able to absorb iron well, even though the child is eating enough iron.\nSlow blood loss over a long period, often due to menstrual periods or bleeding in the digestive tract.\nIron deficiency in children can also be related to\nlead poisoning\n.\nSymptoms\nMild anemia may have no symptoms."}

A value of less than 15% supports the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nSince children only absorb a small amount of the iron they eat, most children need to have 3 mg/kg to 6 mg/kg of iron per day, in 1 to 2 doses per day.\nEating healthy foods is the most important way to prevent and treat iron deficiency."}

These are taken by mouth.\nDo not give your child iron supplements or vitamins with iron without checking with your child's provider. Your provider will prescribe the right kind of supplement for your child. Too much iron in children can be toxic. Supplemental iron is usually prescribed to be taken by mouth, but may also be given intravenously (through a vein).\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWith treatment, the outcome is likely to be good. In most cases, the blood counts will return to normal in 2 to 3 months."}

A low iron level can cause decreased attention span, reduced alertness, and learning problems in children.\nA low iron level can cause the body to absorb too much lead.\nPrevention\nEating a variety of healthy foods is the most important way to prevent and treat iron deficiency.\nAlternative Names\nAnemia - iron deficiency -  children\nImages\nHypochromia\nFormed elements of blood\nHemoglobin\nReferences\nMarcdante KJ, Kliegman RM, Schuh AM.
