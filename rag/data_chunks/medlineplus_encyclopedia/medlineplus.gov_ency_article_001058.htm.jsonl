Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMalocclusion of teeth\nMalocclusion of teeth\nMalocclusion means the teeth are not aligned properly.\nCauses\nOcclusion refers to the alignment of teeth and the way that the upper and lower teeth fit together (bite). The upper teeth should fit slightly over the lower teeth. The points of the molars should fit the grooves of the opposite molar.\nThe upper teeth keep you from biting your cheeks and lips, and your lower teeth protect your tongue.\nMalocclusion is most often hereditary. This means it is passed down through families. It may be caused by a difference between the size of the upper and lower jaws or between the jaw and tooth size. It causes tooth overcrowding or abnormal bite patterns."}

It may be caused by a difference between the size of the upper and lower jaws or between the jaw and tooth size. It causes tooth overcrowding or abnormal bite patterns. The shape of the jaws or birth defects such as\ncleft lip and palate\nmay also be reasons for malocclusion.\nOther causes include:\nChildhood habits such as thumb sucking, tongue thrusting, pacifier use beyond age 3, and prolonged use of a bottle\nExtra teeth, lost teeth, impacted teeth, or abnormally shaped teeth\nIll-fitting dental fillings, crowns, dental appliances, retainers, or braces\nMisalignment of jaw fractures after a severe injury\nTumors of the mouth and jaw\nThere are different categories of malocclusion:\nClass 1 malocclusion is the most common."}

The bite is normal, but the upper teeth slightly overlap the lower teeth.\nClass 2 malocclusion, called retrognathism or overbite, occurs when the upper jaw and teeth severely overlap the bottom jaw and teeth.\nClass 3 malocclusion, called prognathism or underbite, occurs when the lower jaw protrudes or juts forward, causing the lower jaw and teeth to overlap the upper jaw and teeth.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of malocclusion are:\nAbnormal alignment of teeth\nAbnormal appearance of the face\nDifficulty or discomfort when biting or chewing\nSpeech difficulties (rare), including lisp\nMouth breathing (breathing through the mouth without closing the lips)\nInability to bite into food correctly (open bite)\nExams and Tests\nMost problems with teeth alignment are discovered by a dentist during a routine exam. Your dentist may pull your cheek outward and ask you to bite down to check how well your back teeth come together."}

Your dentist may pull your cheek outward and ask you to bite down to check how well your back teeth come together. If there is any problem, your dentist may refer you to an orthodontist for diagnosis and treatment.\nYou may need to have\ndental x-rays\n,\nhead or skull x-rays\n, or facial x-rays. Diagnostic models of the teeth are often needed to diagnose the problem.\nTreatment\nVery few people have perfect teeth alignment. However, most problems are minor and do not require treatment.\nMalocclusion is the most common reason for referral to an orthodontist.\nThe goal of treatment is to correct the positioning of the teeth. Correcting moderate or severe malocclusion can:\nMake teeth easier to clean and decrease risk of\ntooth decay\nand periodontal diseases (\ngingivitis\nor\nperiodontitis\n).\nEliminate strain on the teeth, jaws, and muscles."}

This lessens the risk of breaking a tooth and may reduce symptoms of\ntemporomandibular joint disorders (TMJ)\n.\nTreatments may include:\nBraces or other appliances: Metal bands are placed around some teeth, or metal, ceramic, or plastic bonds are attached to the surface of the teeth. Wires or springs apply force to the teeth. Clear braces (aligners) without wires may be used in some people.\nRemoval of one or more teeth: This may be needed if overcrowding is part of the problem.\nRepair of rough or irregular teeth: Teeth may be adjusted down, reshaped, and bonded or capped. Misshapen restorations and dental appliances should be repaired.\nSurgery: Surgical reshaping to lengthen or shorten the jaw is needed in rare cases. Wires, plates, or screws may be used to stabilize the jaw bone.\nIt is important to\nbrush and floss your teeth\nevery day and have regular visits to a general dentist."}

Plaque builds up on braces and may permanently mark teeth or cause tooth decay if it is not properly removed.\nYou will need a retainer to stabilize your teeth after having braces.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nProblems with teeth alignment are easier, quicker, and less expensive to treat when they are corrected early. Treatment works best in children and adolescents because their bones are still soft and teeth are moved more easily. Treatment may last 6 months to 2 or more years."}

It may be necessary to control habits such as thumb sucking or tongue thrusting (pushing your tongue forward between your upper and lower teeth)."}
