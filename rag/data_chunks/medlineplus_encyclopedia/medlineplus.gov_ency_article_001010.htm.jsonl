Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nConjunctivitis or pink eye\nConjunctivitis or pink eye\nThe conjunctiva is a clear layer of tissue lining the eyelids and covering the white of the eye. Conjunctivitis occurs when the\nconjunctiva\nbecomes swollen or inflamed.\nThis swelling can be due to an infection, an irritant, dry eyes, or an allergy.\nCauses\nTears most often protect the eyes by washing away germs and irritants. Tears contain proteins and\nantibodies\nthat kill germs. If your eyes are dry, germs and irritants are more likely to cause problems.\nConjunctivitis is most often caused by germs such as viruses and bacteria.\n\"Pink eye\" most often refers to a highly contagious viral infection that spreads easily among children.\nConjunctivitis can be found in people with COVID-19 before they have other typical symptoms.\nIn newborns, an eye infection may be caused by bacteria in the birth canal."}

This condition is called\nvernal conjunctivitis\n. It most commonly occurs in young men and boys in the spring and summer months. A similar condition can occur in long-time contact lens wearers. It may make it difficult to continue to wear contact lenses.\nAnything which irritates the eye may also cause conjunctivitis."}

Eye drops that contain antihistamines for the eye or drops containing steroids, may be necessary in more severe cases.\nAntibiotic medicines work well to treat conjunctivitis caused by bacteria.
