Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBili lights\nBili lights\nBili lights are a type of light therapy (phototherapy) that is used to treat\nnewborn jaundice\n. Jaundice is a yellow coloring of the skin and eyes. It is caused by too much of a yellow substance called bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is created when the body replaces old red blood cells with new ones.\nInformation\nPhototherapy involves shining fluorescent light from the bili lights on bare skin. A specific wavelength of light can break down bilirubin into a form that the body can get rid of through the urine and stools. The light looks blue.\nThe newborn is placed under the lights without clothes or just wearing a diaper.\nThe eyes are covered to protect them from the bright light.\nThe baby is turned frequently.\nThe health care team carefully notes the infant's temperature, vital signs, and responses to the light. They also note how long the treatment lasted and the position of the light bulbs.\nThe baby may become dehydrated from the lights."}

Fluids may be given through a vein during treatment.\nBlood tests are done to check the bilirubin level. When the level has dropped enough, phototherapy is complete.\nSome infants receive phototherapy at home. In this case, a nurse visits daily and draws a sample of blood for testing.\nTreatment depends on 3 things:\nGestational age\nBilirubin level in the blood\nNewborn's age (in hours)\nIn severe cases of increased bilirubin, an\nexchange transfusion\nmay be done instead.\nAlternative Names\nPhototherapy for jaundice; Bilirubin - bili lights; Neonatal care - bili lights; Newborn care - bili lights\nPatient Instructions\nNewborn jaundice - discharge\nImages\nBili lights\nReferences\nGolden WC, Watchko JF.
