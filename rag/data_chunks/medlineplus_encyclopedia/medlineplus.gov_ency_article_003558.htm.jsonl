It can screen blood samples for more than one kind of hepatitis virus at the same time.\nAntibody\nand\nantigen\ntests can detect each of the different hepatitis viruses or signs or prior infection.\nNote: Hepatitis D only causes disease in people who also have hepatitis B. It is not routinely checked in a hepatitis antibody panel.\nHow the Test is Performed\nBlood is most often drawn from a vein from the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand. The site is cleaned with germ-killing medicine (antiseptic). The health care provider wraps an elastic band around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area and make the vein swell with blood.\nNext, the provider gently inserts a needle into the vein. The blood collects into an airtight tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm. Once the blood has been collected, the needle is removed."}

The blood collects into an airtight tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm. Once the blood has been collected, the needle is removed. The puncture site is covered to stop any bleeding.\nIn infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin and make it bleed. The blood collects into a small glass tube, or onto a slide or test strip. A bandage may be placed over the area if there is any bleeding.\nThe blood sample is sent to a lab to be examined. Blood (serology) tests are used to check for antibodies to each of the hepatitis viruses or parts of the viruses called antigens.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nSome people feel moderate pain when the needle is inserted to draw blood. Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, you may feel some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order this test if you have signs or symptoms of hepatitis."}

This is called a negative result.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly depending on the lab doing the test. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThere are different tests for hepatitis A and hepatitis B. A positive test is considered abnormal.\nA positive test may mean:\nYou currently have a hepatitis infection."}
