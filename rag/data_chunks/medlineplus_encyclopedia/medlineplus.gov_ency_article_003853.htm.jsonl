By measuring how much air you exhale, and how quickly you exhale, spirometry can evaluate a broad range of lung diseases. In a spirometry test, while you are sitting, you breathe into a mouthpiece that is connected to an instrument called a spirometer. The spirometer records the amount and the rate of air that you breathe in and out over a period of time. When standing, some numbers might be slightly different.\nFor some of the test measurements, you can breathe normally and quietly. Other tests require forced inhalation or exhalation after a deep breath. Sometimes, you will be asked to inhale a different gas or a medicine to see how it changes your test results.\nLung volume measurement can be done in two ways:\nThe most accurate way is called body plethysmography. You sit in a clear airtight box that looks like a phone booth."}

You sit in a clear airtight box that looks like a phone booth. The technologist asks you to breathe in and out of a mouthpiece. Changes in pressure inside the box help determine the lung volume.\nLung volume can also be measured when you breathe nitrogen or helium gas through a tube for a certain period of time. The concentration of the gas in a chamber attached to the tube is measured to estimate your lung volume. This method can be less accurate, especially for people with certain lung diseases.\nTo measure\ndiffusion capacity\n, you breathe a harmless gas, called a tracer gas, for a very short time, often for only one breath. The concentration of the gas in the air you breathe out is measured. The difference in the amount of gas inhaled and exhaled measures how effectively gas travels from the lungs into the blood. This test allows your health care provider to estimate how well your lungs move oxygen from the air into your bloodstream.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nDo not eat a heavy meal before the test."}

This test allows your health care provider to estimate how well your lungs move oxygen from the air into your bloodstream.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nDo not eat a heavy meal before the test. Do not smoke for 4 to 6 hours before the test. You will get specific instructions if you need to stop using bronchodilators or other inhaled medicines. You may have to breathe in medicine before or during the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nSince the test involves some forced breathing and rapid breathing, you may have some temporary shortness of breath or lightheadedness. You also might have some coughing. You breathe through a tight-fitting mouthpiece and you will have nose clips. If you are claustrophobic, the part of the test in the closed booth may feel uncomfortable.\nFollow instructions for using the mouthpiece of the spirometer."}

Your results are considered abnormal if they are significantly lower.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories, based on slightly different ways to determine normal values."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nDifferent measurements that may be found on your report after pulmonary function tests commonly include:\nDiffusion capacity to carbon monoxide (DLCO)\nExpiratory reserve volume (ERV)\nForced vital capacity (FVC)\nForced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1)\nForced expiratory flow 25% to 75% (FEF25-75)\nFunctional residual capacity (FRC)\nMaximum voluntary ventilation (MVV)\nResidual volume (RV)\nPeak expiratory flow (PEF)\nSlow vital capacity (SVC)\nTotal lung capacity (TLC)\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results usually mean that you may have chest or lung disease.\nSome lung diseases (such as emphysema, asthma, chronic bronchitis, and infections) mainly affect the airways that carry air to and from the lungs. They can make the lungs contain too much air and take longer to empty."}

They can make the lungs contain too much air and take longer to empty. These lung diseases are called obstructive lung disorders.\nOther lung diseases make the lungs scarred and smaller so that they contain too little air and are poor at transferring oxygen into the blood. Examples of these types of illnesses include:\nExtreme overweight\nPulmonary fibrosis\n(scarring or thickening of the lung tissue)\nSarcoidosis\nand\nscleroderma\nMuscular weakness can also cause abnormal test results, even if the lungs are normal, that is, similar to the diseases that cause smaller lungs.\nRisks\nThere is a small risk for\ncollapsed lung\n(pneumothorax) in people with a certain type of lung disease. The test should not be given to a person who has experienced a recent heart attack, has certain other types of heart disease, or has had a recent collapsed lung.\nAlternative Names\nPFTs; Spirometry; Spirogram; Lung function tests; Lung volume; Plethysmography\nImages\nSpirometry\nMatch test\nReferences\nBhakta NR, Kaminsky DA.
