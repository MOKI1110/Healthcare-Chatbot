Carpal tunnel syndrome is pain and weakness in the hand that is caused by pressure on the median nerve in the wrist.\nDescription\nThe median nerve and the tendons that flex (or curl) your fingers go through a passage called the carpal tunnel in your wrist. This tunnel is narrow, so any swelling can pinch the nerve and cause pain. A thick ligament (tissue) just under your skin (the carpal ligament) makes up the top of this tunnel. During the operation, the surgeon cuts through the carpal ligament to make more space for the nerve and tendons.\nThe surgery is done in the following way:\nFirst, you receive numbing medicine so that you do not feel pain during surgery. You may be awake but you will also receive medicines to make you relax.\nA small surgical cut is made in the palm of your hand near your wrist.\nNext, the ligament that covers the carpal tunnel is cut. This eases the pressure on the median nerve."}

This eases the pressure on the median nerve. Sometimes, tissue around the nerve is removed as well.\nThe skin and tissue underneath your skin are closed with sutures (stitches).\nSometimes this procedure is done using a tiny camera attached to a monitor. The surgeon inserts the camera into your wrist through a small surgical cut and views the monitor to see inside your wrist. This is called endoscopic surgery. The instrument used is called an endoscope.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nPeople with symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome usually try nonsurgical treatments first. These may include:\nAnti-inflammatory medicines\nTherapy to learn exercises and stretches\nWorkplace changes to improve your seating and how you use your computer or other equipment\nWrist splints\nShots of corticosteroid medicine into the carpal tunnel\nIf none of these treatments help, some surgeons will test the electrical activity of the median nerve with an\nEMG\n(electromyogram)."}

If the test shows that there's a significant problem with your median nerve, carpal tunnel release surgery may be recommended.\nIf the muscles in your hand and wrist are getting smaller because the median nerve is being pinched, surgery will usually be done sooner.\nRisks\nRisks of this surgery are:\nAllergic reactions to medicines\nBleeding\nInfection\nInjury to the median nerve or nerves that branch off of it\nWeakness and numbness around the hand\nIn rare cases, injury to another nerve or blood vessel (artery or vein)\nScar tenderness\nWorsening pain after the procedure\nBefore the Procedure\nBefore the surgery, you should:\nTell your surgeon what medicines you are taking. This includes medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\nYou may be asked to temporarily stop taking your blood-thinning medicines."}

This includes medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\nYou may be asked to temporarily stop taking your blood-thinning medicines. These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), and other medicines.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\nIf you smoke, try to stop. Ask your provider for help. Smoking can slow healing.\nLet your surgeon know about any cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness. If you do get sick, your surgery may need to be postponed.\nOn the day of surgery:\nFollow instructions about whether you need to stop eating or drinking before surgery.\nTake any medicines you're asked to take with a small sip of water.\nFollow instructions on when to arrive at the hospital. Be sure to arrive on time.\nAfter the Procedure\nThis surgery is done on an outpatient basis. You will not need to stay in the hospital.\nAfter the surgery, your wrist will probably be in a splint or heavy bandage for about a week. Keep this on until your first surgeon visit after surgery, and keep it clean and dry."}

Keep this on until your first surgeon visit after surgery, and keep it clean and dry. After the splint or bandage is removed, you will begin motion exercises or a hand therapy program.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nCarpal tunnel release decreases pain, nerve tingling, and numbness, and restores muscle strength. Most people are helped by this surgery.\nThe length of your recovery will depend on how long you had symptoms before surgery and how badly damaged your median nerve is. If you had symptoms for a long time, you may not be completely free of symptoms after you recover.\nAlternative Names\nMedian nerve decompression; Carpal tunnel decompression; Surgery - carpal tunnel\nPatient Instructions\nSurgical wound care - open\nImages\nCarpal tunnel syndrome\nSurface anatomy - normal palm\nSurface anatomy - normal wrist\nWrist anatomy\nCarpal tunnel repair  - series\nReferences\nAmadio PC.
