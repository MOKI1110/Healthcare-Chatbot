Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBone mineral density test\nBone mineral density test\nA bone mineral density (BMD) test measures how much calcium and other types of minerals are in an area of your bone.\nThis test helps your health care provider detect\nosteoporosis\nor bone loss and predict your risk for bone fractures.\nHow the Test is Performed\nBone density testing can be done in several ways.\nThe most common and accurate way uses a dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) scan. DEXA uses low-dose\nx-rays\n. (You receive more radiation from a chest x-ray than a DEXA scan.)\nThere are two types of DEXA scans:\nCentral DEXA -- You lie on a soft table. The scanner passes over your lower spine and hip. In most cases, you do not need to undress. This scan is the best test to predict your risk for fractures, especially of the hip.\nPeripheral DEXA (p-DEXA) -- These smaller machines measure the bone density in your wrist, fingers, leg, or heel."}

These machines are found in some health care offices, pharmacies, shopping centers, and at health fairs.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nIf you are or could be pregnant, tell your provider before this test is done.\nDO NOT take calcium supplements for 24 hours before the test.\nYou'll be told to remove all metal items from your body, such as jewelry and buckles.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe scan is painless. You need to remain still during the test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nBone mineral density (BMD) tests are used to:\nDiagnose bone loss and osteoporosis\nSee how well osteoporosis medicines are working\nPredict your risk for future bone fractures\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force recommends this test for women age 65 and older and for some women younger than age 65 who have an increased risk of osteoporosis.\nThere is not full agreement on whether men should undergo this type of testing."}

Some groups recommend testing of men at age 70, while others state that the evidence is not clear enough to say whether men will benefit from screening.\nYounger women, as well as men of any age, may also need bone density testing if they have risk factors for osteoporosis. These risk factors include:\nFracturing a bone after age 50\nStrong family history of osteoporosis\nHistory of treatment for prostate cancer or breast cancer\nHistory of medical conditions such as\nrheumatoid arthritis\n, diabetes, thyroid imbalances, or\nanorexia nervosa\nEarly\nmenopause\n(either from natural causes or hysterectomy)\nLong-term use of medicines such as corticosteroids, thyroid hormone, or aromatase inhibitors\nLow body weight (less than 127 pounds or 57 kilograms) or low body mass index (less than 20 kilograms per square meter)\nSignificant loss of height\nLong-term tobacco or excessive alcohol use\nNormal Results\nThe results of your test are usually reported as a T-score and Z-score:\nT-score compares your bone de"}

The more negative the number, the higher your risk for a bone fracture.\nA T-score is within the normal range if it is -1.0 or above.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nBone mineral density testing does not diagnose fractures. Along with other risk factors you may have, it helps predict your risk for having a bone fracture in the future. Your provider will help you understand the results.\nIf your T-score is:\nFrom -1.1 to -2.4, you may have bone loss (osteopenia)\nEqual to or below -2.5, you likely have osteoporosis\nTreatment recommendations depend on your total fracture risk. This risk can be calculated using the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool (FRAX) score. Your provider can tell you more about this."}

Most experts feel that the risk is very low compared with the benefits of finding osteoporosis before you break a bone.\nAlternative Names\nBMD test; Bone density test; Bone densitometry; DEXA scan; DXA; Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry; p-DEXA; Osteoporosis - BMD;  Dual x-ray absorptiometry\nImages\nBone density scan\nOsteoporosis\nOsteoporosis\nReferences\nAlmohaya M, Almehthel M, Kendler D.
