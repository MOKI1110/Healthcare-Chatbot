Most often, it is a natural, normal body change that occurs between ages 45 to 55. After menopause, a woman can no longer become pregnant.\nCauses\nDuring menopause, a woman's ovaries stop releasing eggs. Her body produces less of the female hormones estrogen and progesterone. Lower levels of these hormones cause menopause symptoms.\nPeriods occur less often and eventually stop. Sometimes this happens suddenly. But most of the time, periods slowly stop over time.\nMenopause is complete when you have not had a period for 1 year. This is called postmenopause. Surgical menopause takes place when surgical treatments cause a drop in estrogen. This can happen if both of your ovaries are removed.\nMenopause can also sometimes be caused by drugs used for chemotherapy or\nhormone therapy\n(HT) for breast cancer.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms vary from woman to woman. They may last 5 or more years. Symptoms may be worse for some women than others."}

Some women might get their period every 3 weeks before starting to skip periods You may have irregular periods for 1 to 3 years before they stop completely.\nCommon symptoms of menopause include:\nMenstrual periods that occur less often and eventually stop\nHeart pounding or racing\nHot flashes, usually worst during the first 1 to 2 years\nNight sweats\nSkin flushing\nSleeping problems (insomnia)\nOther symptoms of menopause may include:\nDecreased interest in sex or changes in sexual response\nForgetfulness (in some women)\nHeadaches\nMood swings, including irritability, depression, and anxiety\nUrine leakage\nVaginal dryness and painful sexual intercourse\nVaginal infections\nJoint aches and pains\nIrregular heartbeat (\npalpitations\n)\nExams and Tests\nBlood and urine tests can be used to look for changes in hormone levels."}

Test results can help your health care provider determine if you are close to menopause or if you have already gone through menopause. Your provider may need to repeat testing your hormone levels several times to confirm your menopausal status if you have not completely stopped menstruating.\nTests that may be done include:\nEstradiol\nFollicle-stimulating hormone (\nFSH\n)\nLuteinizing hormone (\nLH\n)\nYour provider will perform a pelvic exam. Decreased estrogen can cause changes in the lining of the vagina.\nBone loss increases during the first few years after your last period. Your provider may order a\nbone density test\nto look for bone loss related to osteoporosis. This bone density test is recommended for all women at age 65 if they have not already had it. This test may be recommended sooner if you are at higher risk for osteoporosis because of your family history or medicines that you take.\nTreatment\nTreatment may include lifestyle changes, HT, or both."}

HT is treatment with estrogen and, sometimes, progesterone.\nTalk to your provider about the benefits and risks of HT. Your provider should be aware of your entire medical and family history before prescribing HT.\nSeveral major studies have questioned the health benefits and risks of HT, including the risk of developing breast cancer, heart attacks, strokes, and blood clots. However, using HT for the 10 years after developing menopause is associated with a lower chance of death.\nCurrent guidelines support the use of HT for the treatment of hot flashes."}

However, using HT for the 10 years after developing menopause is associated with a lower chance of death.\nCurrent guidelines support the use of HT for the treatment of hot flashes. Specific recommendations are:\nHT may be started in women who have recently entered menopause.\nHT should not be used in women who started menopause many years ago, except for vaginal estrogen treatments.\nHT should not be used for longer than necessary. Some women may require prolonged estrogen use due to troublesome hot flashes. This is safe in healthy women.\nWomen taking HT should have a low risk for stroke, heart disease, blood clots, or breast cancer.\nTo reduce the risks of estrogen therapy, your provider may recommend:\nA lower dose of estrogen or a different estrogen preparation (for instance, a vaginal cream or skin patch rather than a pill).\nUsing patches appears to be safer than oral estrogen, as it avoids the increased risk for blood clots seen with oral estrogen use.\nFrequent and regular physical exams, including breast exams and mammograms\nWomen who still have a uterus (that is, have not had surgery to remove it for any reason) should take estrogen combined with progesterone t"}

These include:\nAntidepressants, including paroxetine (Paxil), venlafaxine (Effexor), bupropion (Wellbutrin), and fluoxetine (Prozac)\nA blood pressure medicine called clonidine\nGabapentin, a seizure drug that also helps reduce hot flashes\nDIET AND LIFESTYLE CHANGES\nLifestyle steps\nyou can take to reduce menopause symptoms include:\nDiet changes:\nAvoid caffeine, alcohol, and spicy foods.\nEat soy containing foods.
