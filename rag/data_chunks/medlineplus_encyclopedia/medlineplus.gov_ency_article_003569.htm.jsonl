But this depends on the laboratory and the testing method used. Follow any instructions for not eating before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to determine if you have too much or too little vitamin D in your blood."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to determine if you have too much or too little vitamin D in your blood. Screening of all adults, even when pregnant, for low vitamin D levels is generally not recommended.\nHowever, testing may be done on people who are at high risk for vitamin D deficiency, such as those who:\nAre over the age of 65 (both skin production of vitamin D and gut absorption of vitamin D becomes lower as we get older)\nAre obese (or have lost weight from bariatric surgery)\nAre taking certain medicines, such as phenytoin\nHave\nosteoporosis\nor thin bones\nHave limited sun exposure\nHave problems absorbing vitamins and nutrients in their intestines, such as those with\nulcerative colitis\n,\nCrohn disease\n, or\nceliac disease\nNormal Results\nThe normal range of 25-hydroxy vitamin D is measured as nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL) or nanomoles/liter (nmol/L). Many experts recommend a level from 20 and 40 ng/mL or 60 and 100 nmol/L. Others recommend a level from 30 to 50 ng/mL (75 to 125 nmol/L).\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests."}

Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some laboratories use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results, and whether you may need vitamin D supplements.\nMany people are confused by the way these tests are reported.\n25 hydroxy vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) is the vitamin D that your own body has made or that you absorbed from an animal source (such as fatty fish or liver) or a cholecalciferol supplement.\n25 hydroxy vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) is the vitamin D that you have absorbed from foods fortified with plant vitamin D or from an ergocalciferol supplement.\nThe two vitamins (ergo- and cholecalciferol) work similarly in the body."}

The important value is the total 25 hydroxy vitamin D level in your blood.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA lower-than-normal level can be due to a vitamin D deficiency, which can result from:\nLack of skin exposure to sunlight, darkly pigmented skin, or consistent use of high-SPF sunscreen\nLack of enough vitamin D in the diet\nLiver and kidney diseases\nPoor food absorption\nUse of certain medicines, including phenytoin, phenobarbital, and rifampin\nPoor vitamin D absorption due to advanced age, weight-loss surgery, or conditions in which fat is not absorbed well\nA low vitamin D level is more common in African American children (especially in the winter), as well as in infants who are breastfed only.\nA higher-than-normal vitamin D level (\nhypervitaminosis D\n) is most commonly caused by taking too much vitamin D. This can result in too much calcium in the blood (\nhypercalcemia\n). This may lead to many symptoms and kidney damage.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken."}
