A\nmedication abortion\nuses medicine to end an undesired pregnancy.\nAn abortion is not the same as\nmiscarriage\n. Miscarriage is when a pregnancy ends on its own before the 20th week of pregnancy.\nDescription\nAn abortion procedure involves dilating the opening to the uterus (cervix) and placing a small suction tube into the uterus. Suction is used to remove the fetus and related pregnancy material from the uterus.\nBefore the procedure, you may have the following tests:\nA pelvic exam to confirm the pregnancy and estimate how many weeks pregnant you are.\nurine or blood HCG\ntest to confirm you are pregnant.\nA blood test to check your blood type. Based on the test result, you may need a special shot to prevent problems if you get pregnant in the future."}

These allow your legs to be positioned so that your health care provider can view your vagina and\ncervix\n.\nYour provider may numb your cervix so you feel little pain during the procedure.\nSmall rods called dilators will be put in your cervix to gently stretch it open.

This reduces bleeding.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nReasons an abortion might be considered include:\nYou have made a personal decision to not carry the pregnancy.\nThe fetus has a severe birth defect or genetic problem.\nYour pregnancy may be harmful to your health.\nThe pregnancy resulted after a traumatic event such as\nrape or incest\n.\nThe decision to end a pregnancy is very personal.
