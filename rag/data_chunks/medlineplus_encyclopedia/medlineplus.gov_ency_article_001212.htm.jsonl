It can damage the small blood vessels in the retina, the back part of your eye. This condition is called diabetic retinopathy.\nDiabetes\nalso increases the chance of having\nglaucoma\n,\ncataracts\n, and other eye problems.\nCauses\nDiabetic retinopathy is caused by damage from diabetes to blood vessels of the retina. The retina is the layer of tissue at the back of the inner eye. It changes light and images that enter the eye into nerve signals, which are sent to the brain.\nDiabetic retinopathy is a leading cause of decreased vision or blindness in Americans ages 20 to 74 years. People with\ntype 1\nor\ntype 2 diabetes\nare at risk for this condition."}

Some people who have type 2 diabetes that develops slowly already have eye damage when they are first diagnosed.\nWatch this video about:\nDiabetes - retinal conditions\nThe chance of developing retinopathy and having a more severe form is higher when:\nYou have had diabetes for a long time.\nYour blood sugar (glucose) has been poorly controlled.\nYou also smoke or you have high blood pressure or high cholesterol.\nIf you already have damage to the blood vessels in your eye, some types of exercise can make the problem worse."}

Check with your health care provider before starting an exercise program.\nOther eye problems that can occur in people with diabetes include:\nCataract -- Cloudiness of the eye lens.\nGlaucoma -- Increased pressure in the eye that can lead to blindness.\nMacular edema -- Blurry vision due to fluid leaking into the area of the retina that provides sharp central vision.\nRetinal detachment\n-- Scarring that may cause part of the retina to pull away from the back of your eyeball.\nHigh blood sugar or rapid changes in blood sugar level often causes blurred vision that is usually brief and temporary. This is because the lens in the middle of the eye cannot change shape when it has too much sugar and water in the lens. This is not the same problem as diabetic retinopathy.\nSymptoms\nMost often, diabetic retinopathy has no symptoms until the damage to your eyes is severe."}

This is why everyone with diabetes should have regular eye exams.\nExams and Tests\nYour eye doctor will examine your eyes. You may first be asked to read an eye chart.

But they should be closely followed by an eye doctor who is trained to diagnose and treat diabetic eye diseases.\nIf your eye doctor notices new blood vessels growing in your retina (neovascularization) or you develop macular edema, treatment is usually needed.\nEye surgery is the main treatment for diabetic retinopathy.\nLaser eye surgery creates small burns in the retina where there are abnormal blood vessels. This process is called photocoagulation. It is used to keep vessels from leaking, or to shrink abnormal vessels.\nSurgery called vitrectomy is used when there is bleeding (hemorrhage) into the eye."}
