This leads to damage in major organs of the body. It was formerly known as Wegener's granulomatosis.\nCauses\nGPA mainly causes inflammation of blood vessels in the lungs, kidneys, nose, sinuses, and ears. This is called vasculitis or angiitis. Other areas may also be affected in some cases. The disease can be fatal and prompt treatment is important.\nIn most cases, the exact cause is not known, but it is an\nautoimmune disorder\n. Rarely, vasculitis with positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA) has been caused by several drugs including cocaine cut with levamisole, hydralazine, propylthiouracil, and minocycline.\nGPA is most common in middle-aged adults of northern European descent. It is rare in children.\nSymptoms\nFrequent sinusitis and bloody noses are the most common symptoms."}

Other early symptoms include a fever that has no clear cause, night sweats,\nfatigue\n, and a general ill feeling (\nmalaise\n).\nOther common symptoms may include:\nChronic ear infections\nPain, and sores around the opening of the nose\nCough with or without blood in the sputum\nChest pain and shortness of breath as the disease progresses\nLoss of appetite and weight loss\nSkin changes such as bruises and ulcers of the skin\nKidney problems\nBloody urine\nEye problems ranging from mild\nconjunctivitis\nto severe swelling of the eye\nLess common symptoms include:\nJoint pain\nWeakness\nAbdominal pain\nExams and Tests\nYou may have a blood test that looks for ANCA proteins as well as two additional proteins called proteinase 3 (PR3) and myeloperoxidase (MPO)."}

Sometimes urine is collected over 24 hours to check how the kidneys are working.\nStandard blood tests include:\nComplete blood count (CBC)\nComprehensive metabolic panel\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR)\nBlood tests may be done to check for other illnesses. These may include:\nAntinuclear antibodies\nAnti-glomerular basement membrane (anti-GBM) antibodies\nC3 and C4, cryoglobulins, hepatitis serologies, HIV\nLiver function tests\nTuberculosis screen and blood cultures\nbiopsy\nis sometimes needed to confirm the diagnosis and check how severe the disease is.

You may also have one of the following:\nNasal mucosal biopsy\nOpen lung biopsy\nSkin biopsy\nUpper airway biopsy\nOther tests that may be done include:\nSinus CT scan\nChest CT scan\nTreatment\nBecause of the potentially serious nature of GPA, you may be hospitalized. Once the diagnosis is made, you will probably be treated with high doses of glucocorticoids (such as prednisone). These are given through the vein for 3 to 5 days at the beginning of treatment. Prednisone is given along with other medicines that slow down the immune response.\nFor milder disease other medicines that slow down the immune response such as methotrexate or azathioprine may be used.\nCommon medicines for vasculitis include:\nRituximab (Rituxan)\nCyclophosphamide (Cytoxan)\nMethotrexate\nAzathioprine (Imuran)\nMycophenolate (Cellcept or Myfortic)\nThese medicines are effective in severe disease, but they may cause serious side effects."}

Most people with GPA are treated with ongoing medicines to prevent relapse for at least 12 to 24 months. Talk to your health care provider about your treatment plan.\nOther medicines used for GPA include:\nMedicines to prevent bone loss caused by prednisone\nFolic acid or folinic acid, if you are taking methotrexate\nAntibiotics to prevent lung infections\nSupport Groups\nSupport groups with others who suffer from similar diseases may help people with the condition and their families learn about the diseases and adjust to the changes associated with the treatment.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWithout treatment, people with severe forms of this disease can die within a few months.\nWith treatment, the outlook for most patients is good.

People with GPA develop tissue damage in the lungs, airways, and the kidneys. Kidney involvement may result in blood in the urine and kidney failure. Kidney disease can quickly get worse. Kidney function may not improve, even when the condition is controlled by medicines.\nIf untreated, kidney failure and possibly death occur in most cases.\nOther complications may include:\nEye swelling\nLung failure\nCoughing up blood\nNasal septum perforation (hole inside the nose)\nSide effects from medicines used to treat the disease\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nYou develop chest pain and shortness of breath.\nYou cough up blood.\nYou have blood in your urine.\nYou have other symptoms of this disorder.\nPrevention\nThere is no known prevention.\nAlternative Names\nFormerly: Wegener's gra"}
