Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nDouble inlet left ventricle\nDouble inlet left ventricle\nDouble inlet left ventricle (DILV) is a heart defect that is present from birth (congenital). It affects the valves and chambers of the heart. Babies born with this condition have only one working pumping chamber (ventricle) in their heart.\nCauses\nDILV is one of several heart defects known as single (or common) ventricle defects. People with DILV have a large left ventricle and a small right ventricle. The left ventricle is the pumping chamber of the heart that sends oxygen-rich blood to the body. The right ventricle is the pumping chamber that sends oxygen-poor blood to the lungs.\nIn the normal heart, the right and left ventricles receive blood from the right and left atria. The atria are upper chambers of the heart. Oxygen-poor blood returning from the body flows to the right atrium and right ventricle. The right ventricle then pumps blood to the pulmonary artery."}

The atria are upper chambers of the heart. Oxygen-poor blood returning from the body flows to the right atrium and right ventricle. The right ventricle then pumps blood to the pulmonary artery. This is the blood vessel that carries blood to the lungs to pick up oxygen.\nBlood with fresh oxygen returns to the left atrium and left ventricle. The aorta then carries oxygen-rich blood to the rest of the body from the left ventricle. The aorta is the major artery leading out of the heart.\nIn people with DILV, only the left ventricle is developed. Both atria empty blood into this ventricle. This means that oxygen-rich blood mixes with oxygen-poor blood. The mixture is then pumped to both the body and the lungs.\nDILV can happen if the large blood vessels arising from the heart are in the wrong positions. The aorta arises from the small right ventricle and the pulmonary artery arises from the left ventricle. It can also occur when the arteries are in normal positions and arise from the usual ventricles. In this case, blood flows from the left to right ventricle through a hole between the chambers called a\nventricular septal defect\n(VSD).\nDILV is very rare. The exact cause is unknown."}

The most common surgeries to treat DILV are a series of 2 to 3 operations. These surgeries are similar to the ones used to treat\nhypoplastic left heart syndrome\nand\ntricuspid atresia\n.\nThe first surgery may be needed when your baby is only a few days old. In most cases, the baby can go home from the hospital afterward. Your child will most often need to take medicines every day and be closely followed by a pediatric heart specialist (cardiologist). Your child's cardiologist will determine when the second stage of surgery should be done.\nThe next surgery (or first surgery, if your baby didn't need a procedure as a newborn) is called the bidirectional Glenn shunt or Hemifontan procedure."}

This surgery is most often done when your child is 18 months to 3 years old. After this final step, your baby is no longer blue.\nThe Fontan operation does not create normal circulation in the body. But, it does improve blood flow enough for the child to live and grow.\nYour child may need more surgeries for other defects or to extend survival while waiting for the Fontan procedure.\nYour child may need to take medicines before and after surgery. These may include:\nAnticoagulants to prevent blood clotting\nACE inhibitors to reduce blood pressure\nInotropic agents to help the heart contract\nWater pills (diuretics) to reduce swelling in the body\nA heart transplant may be recommended, if the above methods fail.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nDILV is a very complex heart defect that isn't easy to treat."}
