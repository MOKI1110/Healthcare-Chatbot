Alcohol used during pregnancy may also lead to long-term medical problems and birth defects.\nInformation\nWhen a pregnant woman drinks alcohol, the alcohol travels through her blood and into the baby's blood, tissues, and organs. Alcohol breaks down much more slowly in the baby's body than in an adult. That means the baby's blood alcohol level remains increased longer than the mother's. This can harm the baby and can sometimes lead to lifelong damage.\nDANGERS OF ALCOHOL DURING PREGNANCY\nDrinking a lot of alcohol during pregnancy can lead to a group of defects in the baby known as fetal alcohol syndrome."}
