It may be patchy or all over (diffuse). Normally, you lose roughly 100 hairs from your head every day. The scalp contains about 100,000 hairs.\nCauses\nHEREDITY\nBoth men and women tend to lose hair thickness and amount as they age. This type of baldness is not usually caused by a disease. It is related to aging, heredity, and changes in the hormone testosterone. Inherited, or pattern baldness, affects many more\nmen\nthan\nwomen\n. Male pattern baldness can occur at any time after puberty. About 80% of men show signs of male pattern baldness by age 70 years.\nPHYSICAL OR EMOTIONAL STRESS\nPhysical or emotional stress may cause one half to three quarters of scalp hair to shed. This kind of hair loss is called telogen effluvium. Hair tends to come out in handfuls when you shampoo, comb, or run your hands through your hair. You may not notice this for weeks to months after the episode of stress. Hair shedding decreases over 6 to 8 months."}

You may not notice this for weeks to months after the episode of stress. Hair shedding decreases over 6 to 8 months. Telogen effluvium is usually temporary. But it can become long-term (chronic).\nCauses of this type of hair loss are:\nHigh fever or severe infection\nChildbirth\nMajor surgery, major illness, sudden blood loss\nSevere emotional stress\nCrash diets, especially those that do not contain enough protein\nDrugs, including retinoids, birth control pills, beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, certain antidepressants, NSAIDs (including ibuprofen)\nSome women ages 30 to 60 years may notice a thinning of the hair that affects the entire scalp. The hair loss may be heavier at first, and then gradually slow or stop."}

There is no known cause for this type of telogen effluvium.\nOTHER CAUSES\nOther causes of hair loss, especially if it is in an unusual pattern, include:\nAlopecia areata\n(bald patches on the scalp, beard, and, possibly, eyebrows; eyelashes may fall out)\nAnemia\nAutoimmune conditions such as\nlupus\nBurns\nCertain infectious diseases such as\nsyphilis\nExcessive shampooing and blow-drying\nHormone changes\nThyroid diseases\nNervous habits such as continual\nhair pulling\nor scalp rubbing\nRadiation therapy\nTinea capitis\n(ringworm of the scalp)\nTumor of the\novary\nor\nadrenal glands\nHair styles that put too much tension on the hair follicles\nBacterial infections of the scalp\nHome Care\nHair loss from menopause or childbirth often goes away after 6 months to 2 years.\nFor hair loss due to illness (such as fever),\nradiation therapy\n, medicine use, or other causes, no treatment is needed. Hair usually grows back when the illness ends or the therapy is finished."}

Hair usually grows back when the illness ends or the therapy is finished. You may want to wear a wig, hat, or other covering until the hair grows back.\nHair weaves, hair pieces, or changes of hair style may disguise hair loss. This is generally the least expensive and safest approach to hair loss. Hair pieces should not be sutured (sewn) to the scalp because of the risk for scars and infection.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall your health care provider if you have any of the following:\nLosing hair in an unusual pattern\nLosing hair rapidly or at an early age (for example, in your teens or twenties)\nPain or itching with the hair loss\nThe skin on your scalp under the involved area is red, scaly, or otherwise abnormal\nAcne, facial hair, or an abnormal menstrual cycle\nYou are a woman and have male pattern baldness\nBald spots on your beard or eyebrows\nWeight gain or muscle weakness, intolerance to cold temperatures, or fatigue\nAreas of infection on your scalp\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nA careful medical history and examination of the hair and s"}

Other medicines, such as hormones, may be prescribed to decrease hair loss and promote hair growth. Drugs such as finasteride and dutasteride can be taken by men to decrease hair loss and grow new hair.\nIf you have a certain vitamin deficiency, your provider will likely recommend that you take a supplement.\nHair transplant\nmay also be recommended.\nAlternative Names\nLoss of hair; Alopecia; Baldness; Scarring alopecia; Non-scarring alopecia\nImages\nHair follicle\nRingworm, tinea capitis - close-up\nAlopecia areata with pustules\nAlopecia totalis - back view of the head\nAlopecia totalis - front view of the head\nAlopecia, under treatment\nTrichotillomania - top of the head\nFolliculitis - decalvans on the scalp\nReferences\nPhillips TG, Slomiany WP, Allison R."}
