This affects nervous system functions, such as movement, learning, hearing, seeing, and thinking.\nThere are several different types of CP, including spastic, dyskinetic, ataxic, hypotonic, and mixed.\nCauses\nCP is caused by injuries or abnormalities of the brain. Most of these problems occur as the baby grows in the womb. But they can happen at any time during the first 2 years of life, while the baby's brain is still developing.\nIn some people with cerebral palsy, parts of the brain are injured due to a low level of oxygen (\nhypoxia\n) in those areas. It is not known why this occurs.\nPremature infants have a slightly higher risk of developing CP."}

It is not known why this occurs.\nPremature infants have a slightly higher risk of developing CP. It may also occur in early infancy as a result of certain conditions such as:\nBleeding in the brain\nBrain infections (\nencephalitis\n,\nmeningitis\n, herpes simplex infections)\nHead injury\nInfections in the mother during pregnancy (\nrubella\n)\nUntreated\njaundice\nInjuries to the brain during the childbirth process\nExposure to toxins while developing (mercury)\nIn some cases, the cause of CP is never determined.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of CP can be very different between people with this group of disorders. Symptoms may:\nBe very mild or very severe\nOnly involve one side of the body or both sides\nBe more pronounced in either the arms or legs, or involve both the arms and legs\nSymptoms are usually seen before a child is 2 years old. Sometimes symptoms begin as early as 3 months. Parents may notice that their child is delayed in reaching developmental stages such as sitting, rolling, crawling, or walking.\nThere are several different types of cerebral palsy."}

Parents may notice that their child is delayed in reaching developmental stages such as sitting, rolling, crawling, or walking.\nThere are several different types of cerebral palsy. Some people have a mix of symptoms.\nSpastic CP is the most common type. Symptoms include:\nMuscles that are very tight and do not stretch. They may tighten even more over time.\nAbnormal walk (gait) -- arms tucked in toward the sides, knees crossed or touching, legs make \"scissors\" movements, walk on the toes.\nJoints are tight and do not open all the way (called joint contracture).\nMuscle weakness or loss of movement in a group of muscles (paralysis).\nSymptoms may affect one arm or leg, one side of the body, both legs, or both arms and legs.\nThe following symptoms may occur in other types of CP:\nAbnormal movements (twisting, jerking, or writhing) of the hands, feet, arms, or legs while awake, which gets worse during periods of stress\nTremors\nUnsteady gait\nLoss of coordination\nFloppy muscles, especially at rest, and joints that move around too much\nOther brain and nervous system symptoms may include:\nLearning disabilities are common, but intelligence can be normal\nSpeech problems (dysarth"}
