It develops after birth.\nCongenital tracheomalacia\nis a related topic.\nCauses\nAcquired tracheomalacia is very uncommon at any age. It occurs when normal cartilage in the wall of the windpipe begins to break down.\nThis form of tracheomalacia may result:\nWhen large blood vessels put pressure on the airway\nAs a complication after surgery to repair birth defects in the windpipe and esophagus (the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach)\nAfter having a breathing tube or trachea tube (tracheostomy) for a long time\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of tracheomalacia include:\nBreathing problems that get worse with coughing, crying, or upper respiratory infections, such as a cold\nBreathing noises that may change when body position changes, and improve during sleep\nHigh-pitched breathing\nRattling, noisy breaths\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam confirms the symptoms."}

A chest x-ray may show narrowing of the trachea when breathing out. Even if the x-ray is normal, it is needed to rule out other problems.\nA procedure called a laryngoscopy is used to diagnose the condition. This procedure allows the otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat doctor, or ENT) to see the structure of the airway and determine how severe the problem is.\nOther tests may include:\nAirway fluoroscopy\nBarium swallow\nBronchoscopy\nCT scan\nLung function tests\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nTreatment\nThe condition may improve without treatment. However, people with tracheomalacia must be monitored closely when they have respiratory infections.\nAdults with breathing problems may need\ncontinuous positive airway pressure\n(CPAP). Rarely, surgery is needed."}

A hollow tube called a\nstent\nmay be placed to hold the airway open.\nPossible Complications\nAspiration pneumonia\n(a lung infection) can occur from breathing in food or saliva.\nAdults who develop tracheomalacia after being on a breathing machine often have serious lung problems.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you or your child breathes in an abnormal way.
