This nerve sends the images you see to your brain.\nMost often, optic nerve damage is caused by increased pressure in the eye. This is called intraocular pressure.\nCauses\nGlaucoma is one of the most common causes of blindness in the United States. There are four major types of glaucoma:\nOpen-angle glaucoma\nAngle-closure glaucoma, also called closed-angle glaucoma\nCongenital glaucoma\nSecondary glaucoma\nThe front part of the eye is filled with a clear fluid called aqueous humor. This fluid is made in an area behind the colored part of the eye (iris). It leaves the eye through channels where the iris and cornea meet. This area is called the anterior chamber angle, or the angle."}

It leaves the eye through channels where the iris and cornea meet. This area is called the anterior chamber angle, or the angle. The cornea is the clear covering on the front of the eye that is in front of the iris, pupil, and angle.\nAnything that slows or blocks the flow of this fluid will cause pressure to build up in the eye.\nIn open-angle glaucoma, the increase in pressure is often small and slow.\nIn closed-angle glaucoma, the increase is often high and sudden.\nEither type can damage the optic nerve.\nOpen-angle glaucoma\nis the most common type of glaucoma.\nThe cause is unknown. The increase in eye pressure happens slowly over time. You cannot feel it.\nThe increased pressure pushes on the optic nerve. Damage to the optic nerve causes blind spots in your vision.\nOpen-angle glaucoma tends to run in families. Your risk is higher if you have a parent or grandparent with open-angle glaucoma. People of African descent are also at higher risk for this disease.\nClosed-angle glaucoma\noccurs when the fluid is suddenly blocked and cannot flow out of the eye."}

Your eye doctor is likely to treat your second eye to prevent a first attack in that eye.\nSecondary glaucoma\noccurs due to a known cause.

This is called\ntonometry\n.\nIn most cases, you will be given eye drops to widen (dilate) your pupil.\nWhen your pupil is dilated, your eye doctor will look at the inside of your eye and the optic nerve.\nEye pressure is different at different times of the day."}
