Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSolitary fibrous tumor\nSolitary fibrous tumor\nSolitary fibrous tumor (SFT) is a noncancerous\ntumor\nof the lining of the lung and chest cavity, an area called the pleura. SFT used to be called localized fibrous mesothelioma.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of SFT remains unknown. This type of tumor affects men and women equally.\nSymptoms\nAbout one half of the people with this type of tumor do not show any symptoms.\nIf the tumor grows to a large size and pushes on the lung, it can lead to symptoms, such as:\nChest pain\nChronic cough\nShortness of breath\nClubbed appearance of the fingers\nExams and Tests\nSFT is usually found by accident when a\nchest x-ray\nis done for other reasons. If your health care provider suspects SFT, additional tests will be ordered. These may include:\nCT scan of the chest\nOpen lung biopsy\nPulmonary function tests\nThe diagnosis of SFT is difficult compared with the cancerous type of this disease, called\nmalignant mesothelioma\n, which is caused by exposure to asbestos (as cancer needs to be checked for)."}

SFT is not caused by asbestos exposure.\nTreatment\nSFT is usually treated by removing the tumor.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome is expected to be good with prompt treatment. In rare cases, the tumor may return.\nPossible Complications\nFluid escaping into the membranes around the lungs (\npleural effusion\n) is a complication.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider for an appointment if you notice symptoms of SFT.\nAlternative Names\nMesothelioma - benign; Mesothelioma - fibrous; Pleural fibroma\nImages\nRespiratory system\nReferences\nKaidar-Person O, Zagar T, Haithcock BE, Weiss, J.
