This causes the airways to become permanently wider.\nBronchiectasis can be present at birth or infancy, which is rare, or develop later in life.\nCauses\nBronchiectasis is often caused by inflammation or an infection of the airways that keeps coming back.\nSometimes it begins in childhood after having a severe lung infection or\ninhaling a foreign object\n. Breathing in food particles can also lead to this condition.\nOther causes of bronchiectasis can include:\nCystic fibrosis\n, a disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs\nAutoimmune disorders, such as\nrheumatoid arthritis\n,\nSjÃ¶gren syndrome\n, or inflammatory bowel disease\nAllergic lung diseases\nLeukemia\nand related\ncancers\nImmune deficiency syndromes\nPrimary ciliary dyskinesia (another congenital disease)\nInfection with non-tuberculous mycobacteria\nAs a complication of bronchiolitis obliterans\nAsthma\nor\nchronic obstructive lung disease\n(uncommon)\nSymptoms\nSymptoms develop over time."}

They may occur months or years after the event that causes the bronchiectasis.\nLong-term (chronic) cough with large amounts of foul smelling sputum is the main symptom of bronchiectasis. Other symptoms may include:\nBreath odor\nCoughing up blood\n(less common in children)\nFatigue\nPaleness\nShortness of breath\nthat gets worse with exercise\nWeight loss\nWheezing\nLow grade fever and night sweats\nClubbing\nof fingers (rare, depends on the cause)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

A respiratory therapist can show the person coughing exercises that will help.\nMedicines are often prescribed. These include:\nAntibiotics to treat infections\nBronchodilators to open up airways\nExpectorants to help loosen and cough up thick sputum\nSurgery to remove (\nresect\n) the lung may be helpful if medicine does not work and the disease is in a small area, or if the person has a lot of bleeding in the lungs. It is more commonly considered if there is no genetic or acquired predisposition to bronchiectasis (for example, more likely to consider if there is bronchiectasis in one segment of the lung only because of prior obstruction).\nIn severe cases, lung transplantation might be needed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook depends on the specific cause of the disease."}
