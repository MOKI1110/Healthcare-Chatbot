This buildup of fluid leads to shortness of breath.\nCauses\nPulmonary edema is often caused by\ncongestive heart failure\n. When the heart is not able to pump efficiently, blood can back up into the blood vessels that take blood through the lungs.\nAs the pressure in these blood vessels increases, fluid is pushed into the air spaces (alveoli) in the lungs. This fluid reduces normal oxygen movement through the lungs."}

You may need to be in an intensive care unit (ICU).\nOxygen is given through a face mask or tiny plastic tubes are placed in the nose.\nA breathing tube may be placed into the windpipe (trachea) so you can be connected to a breathing machine (ventilator) if you cannot breathe well on your own (only needed in severe cases).\nThe cause of pulmonary edema should be identified and treated quickly. For example, if a heart attack has caused the condition, it must be treated right away.\nMedicines that may be used include:\nDiuretics that remove excess fluid from the body\nMedicines that strengthen the heart muscle, control the heartbeat, or relieve pressure on the heart\nOther medicines when heart failure is not the cause of the pulmonary edema\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook depends on the cause. The condition may get better quickly or slowly. Some people may need to use a breathing machine for a long time."}
