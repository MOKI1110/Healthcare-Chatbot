If an arrhythmia is detected, the device quickly sends an electrical shock to the heart. The shock changes the rhythm back to normal. This is called defibrillation.\nDescription\nAn S-ICD is made up of these parts:\nThe pulse generator contains a battery and electrical circuits that read the electrical activity of your heart.\nThe electrode is a wire, also called a lead, that is inserted under the skin in the middle of your chest along your breastbone.\nThe procedure involves placing the S-ICD under your skin just below your armpit area on the left side of your chest.\nYou will be in a sleep-like state (\ngeneral anesthesia\n) or awake but relaxed during the procedure."}

Your surgeon will tell you what type of sedation you require.\nA small incision is made on the left side of your chest, under your left arm.\nThe pulse generator device is placed inside a pouch made in the skin on the left lower part of your chest. The electrode is placed under the skin near your breastbone to sense any abnormal heart rhythms.\nThe device is connected to the electrode above the heart and is anchored in place under the skin. The S-ICD will be tested during the procedure. Your incision will be closed with stitches, glue, or tape strips.\nWhy the Procedure Is Performed\nAn S-ICD is placed in people who have heart disease and are at high risk of sudden cardiac death from an abnormal heart rhythm. These rhythms include\nventricular tachycardia\n(VT) or\nventricular fibrillation\n(VF).\nReasons you may be at high risk are:\nYou have had episodes of one of these abnormal heart rhythms.\nYour heart is weakened, too large, and does not pump blood very well."}

This may be from earlier heart attacks, heart failure, or\ncardiomyopathy\n(diseased heart muscle).\nYou have a type of congenital (present at birth) heart problem or genetic health condition.\nHow does S-ICD differ from traditional ICD?\nTransvenous ICDs use 3 wire leads that run into the heart through veins. S-ICD is a less invasive technique and uses a lead placed under your skin rather than through veins. This process has fewer complications.\nA traditional ICD also includes a\npacemaker\n, to help keep your heart rhythm beating normally. The S-ICD does not include a pacemaker."}

Even though a shock lasts a very short time, you can feel it in most cases.\nThis and other S-ICD problems can sometimes be prevented by changing how your S-ICD is programmed."}

These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\nLet your surgeon know about any illness you may have before your surgery. This includes\nCOVID-19\n, a\ncold\n,\nflu\n, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness.
