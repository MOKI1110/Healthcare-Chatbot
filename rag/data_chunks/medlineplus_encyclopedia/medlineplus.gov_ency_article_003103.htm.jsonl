The extra fluid can lead to a rapid increase in weight over a short period of time (days to weeks).\nSwelling can occur all over the body (generalized) or only in one part of the body (localized).\nConsiderations\nSlight swelling (edema) of the lower legs is common in warm summer months, especially if a person has been standing or walking a lot.\nGeneral swelling, or massive edema (also called anasarca), is a common sign in people who are very sick. Although slight edema may be hard to detect, a large amount of swelling is obvious.\nEdema is described as pitting or non-pitting.\nPitting edema leaves a dent in the skin after you press the area with a finger for about 5 seconds."}

The dent will slowly fill back in.\nNon-pitting edema does not leave this type of dent when pressing on the swollen area.\nCauses\nSwelling can be caused by any of the following:\nAcute glomerulonephritis\n(a kidney disease)\nBurns\n, including sunburn\nChronic kidney disease\nHeart failure\nLiver failure from\ncirrhosis\nor other liver disease\nNephrotic syndrome\n(a kidney disease)\nPoor nutrition\nPregnancy\nThyroid disease\nToo little\nalbumin\nin the blood (hypoalbuminemia)\nToo much salt or sodium\nUse of certain medicines, such as corticosteroids or medicines used to treat heart disease, high blood pressure, or diabetes\nHome Care\nFollow your health care provider's treatment recommendations. If you have long-term swelling, ask your provider about options to prevent skin breakdown, such as:\nFlotation ring\nLamb's wool pad\nPressure-reducing mattress\nContinue with your everyday activities. When lying down, keep your arms and legs above your heart level, if possible, so the fluid can drain."}

See your provider instead.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIf you notice any unexplained swelling, contact your provider.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nYour provider will take your medical history and will perform a\nphysical examination\n. You may be asked about the symptoms of your swelling. Questions may include when the swelling started, whether it is all over your body or just in one area, what you have tried at home to help the swelling. In an emergency situation (pulmonary edema), rapid diagnosis and treatment is important.\nTests that may be done include:\nAlbumin blood test\nBlood electrolyte levels\nEchocardiography\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG)\nKidney function tests\nLiver function tests\nUrinalysis\nX-rays\nTreatment may include avoiding salt or taking water pills (diuretics)."}
