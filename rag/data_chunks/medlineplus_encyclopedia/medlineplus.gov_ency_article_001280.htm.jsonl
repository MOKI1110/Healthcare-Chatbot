Many types of bacteria and viruses can cause this condition.\nThe most common virus that causes orchitis is\nmumps\n. It most often occurs in boys after puberty. Orchitis most often develops 4 to 6 days after the mumps begins.\nOrchitis may also occur along with infections of the prostate or\nepididymis\n.\nOrchitis may be caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as\ngonorrhea\nor\nchlamydia\n."}
