This is the fluid surrounding the brain and spinal cord. The name of this infection is coccidioidomycosis, or\nvalley fever\n. When the infection involves the covering of the brain and spinal cord (the meninges), it is called coccidioidal meningitis.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA sample of spinal fluid is needed for this test. The sample is usually obtained by\nlumbar puncture\n(spinal tap).\nThe sample is sent to a laboratory. There, it is examined for Coccidioides antibodies using a laboratory method called\ncomplement\nfixation. This technique checks if your body has produced substances called antibodies to a specific foreign substance (antigen), in this case Coccidioides.\nAntibodies are specialized proteins that defend your body against bacteria, viruses, and fungi."}

This is why the test is called \"fixation.\"\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nFollow your health care provider's instructions on how to prepare for the test. Expect to be in the hospital for several hours afterward.\nHow the Test Will Feel\nDuring the test:\nYou lie on your side with knees pulled up toward your chest and chin tucked downward."}

Expect to be in the hospital for several hours afterward.\nHow the Test Will Feel\nDuring the test:\nYou lie on your side with knees pulled up toward your chest and chin tucked downward. Or, you sit up, but bent forward.\nAfter your back is cleaned, the doctor injects a local numbing medicine (anesthetic) into your lower spine.\nA spinal needle is inserted, usually into the lower back area.\nOnce the needle is properly positioned, CSF pressure is measured, and a sample is collected.\nThe needle is removed, the area is cleaned, and a bandage is placed over the needle site.\nYou are taken to a recovery area where you rest for several hours to prevent any CSF leakage.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test checks if your central nervous system has an active infection from Coccidioides.\nNormal Results\nThe absence of fungus (a negative test) is normal.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf the test is positive for fungus, there may be an active infection in the central nervous system.\nAn abnormal spinal fluid test means that the central nervous system is infected. During the early stage of an illness, few antibodies may be detected."}
