Excess bacteria in the small intestine may use up the nutrients needed by the body. As a result, a person may become\nmalnourished\n.\nThe breakdown of nutrients by the excess bacteria can also damage the lining of the small intestine."}

This can make it even harder for the body to absorb nutrients.\nConditions that can lead to overgrowth of bacteria in the small intestine include:\nComplications of diseases or surgery that create pouches or blockages in the small intestine.\nCrohn disease\nis one of these conditions.\nDiseases that lead to decreased movement of the small bowel, such as\ndiabetes\nand\nscleroderma\n.\nImmunodeficiency, such as AIDS or immunoglobulin deficiency.\nShort bowel syndrome\ncaused by surgical removal of the small intestine.\nSmall bowel diverticulosis, in which small, or, at times, large sacs occur in the wall of the intestine. These sacs allow too many bacteria to grow.\nSurgical procedures that create a loop of small intestine where excess bacteria can grow."}

An example is a Billroth II type of stomach removal (\ngastrectomy\n).\nSome cases of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\nSymptoms\nThe most common symptoms are:\nAbdominal fullness\nAbdominal pain and cramps\nBloating\nDiarrhea (most often watery)\nGassiness\nOther symptoms may include:\nFatty stool\nWeight loss\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history. Tests may include:\nBlood chemistry tests (such as albumin level)\nComplete blood count (\nCBC\n)\nFecal fat test\nSmall intestine\nendoscopy\nVitamin levels in the blood\nSmall intestine biopsy or culture\nSpecial breath tests\nTreatment\nThe goal is to treat the cause of the bacterial overgrowth. Treatment may include:\nAntibiotics\nMedicines that speed intestinal movement\nIntravenous (IV) fluids\nNutrition given through a vein (total parenteral nutrition or TPN) in a malnourished person\nA lactose-free diet can be helpful.\nPossible Complications\nSevere cases lead to malnutrition."}
