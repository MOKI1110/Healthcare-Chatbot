It is known as \"the kissing disease.\" Mono occurs most often or seen in adolescents and young adults, but the infection may develop at any age.\nMono is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Rarely, it is caused by other viruses, such as cytomegalovirus (CMV).\nSymptoms\nMono may begin slowly with fatigue, a general ill feeling, headache, and sore throat. The sore throat slowly gets worse. Your tonsils become swollen and develop a whitish-yellow covering. Often, the lymph nodes in the neck are swollen and painful.\nA pink, measles-like rash can occur, and is more likely if you take the medicine ampicillin or amoxicillin for a throat infection."}

Steroid medicine (prednisone) may be given if your symptoms are severe.\nAntiviral drugs, such as acyclovir, have little or no benefit.\nTo relieve typical symptoms:\nDrink plenty of fluids.\nGargle with warm salt water to ease a sore throat.\nGet plenty of rest.\nTake acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain and fever.\nAlso avoid contact sports if your spleen is swollen (to prevent it from rupturing).\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe fever usually drops in 10 days, and swollen lymph glands and spleen heal in 4 weeks."}
