You will lie on a table beneath an x-ray machine. You will place your feet in stirrups, like you do during a pelvic exam. A tool called a speculum is placed into your\nvagina\n.\nAfter the\ncervix\nis cleaned, the health care provider places a thin tube (catheter) through the cervix. Dye, called contrast, flows through this tube, filling the womb and fallopian tubes. X-rays are taken. The dye makes these areas easier to see on\nx-rays\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider may give you antibiotics to take before and after the test. This helps prevent infections. You may also be given medicines to take the day of the procedure to help you relax.\nThe best time for this test is in the first half of the menstrual cycle. Doing it at this time enables the provider to see uterine cavity and tubes more clearly."}

Doing it at this time enables the provider to see uterine cavity and tubes more clearly. It also reduces the risk for infection, and ensures that you are not pregnant.\nTell your provider if you have had an allergic reaction to contrast dye before.\nYou can eat and drink normally before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may have some discomfort when the speculum is inserted into your vagina. This is similar to a pelvic exam with a Pap test.\nSome women have cramps during or after the test, like those you may get during your period.\nYou may have some pain if the dye leaks out of the tubes, or if the tubes are blocked.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to check for blockages in your fallopian tubes or other problems in your womb and tubes. It is often done as part of an infertility exam. It may also be done after you have your tubes tied to confirm that the tubes are fully blocked after you have had a hysteroscopic tubal occlusion procedure to prevent pregnancy.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means everything looks normal."}
