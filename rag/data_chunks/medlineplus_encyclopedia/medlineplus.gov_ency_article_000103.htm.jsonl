Infants can also have\nrespiratory distress syndrome\n.\nCauses\nARDS can be caused by any major direct or indirect injury to the lung. Common causes include:\nBreathing vomit into the lungs (\naspiration\n)\nInhaling chemicals\nLung transplant\nPneumonia\n, including COVID-19 infection\nSeptic shock\n(infection throughout the body)\nTransfusions (multiple)\nTrauma\nDepending on the amount of oxygen in the blood and during breathing, the severity of ARDS is classified as:\nMild\nModerate\nSevere\nARDS leads to a buildup of fluid in the air sacs (alveoli). This fluid prevents enough oxygen from passing into the bloodstream.\nThe fluid buildup also makes the lungs heavy and stiff. This decreases the lungs' ability to expand."}

This fluid prevents enough oxygen from passing into the bloodstream.\nThe fluid buildup also makes the lungs heavy and stiff. This decreases the lungs' ability to expand. The level of oxygen in the blood can stay dangerously low, even if the person receives oxygen from a breathing machine (\nventilator\n) through a breathing tube (endotracheal tube).\nARDS often occurs along with the failure of other organ systems, such as the heart, liver or\nkidneys\n. Cigarette smoking and heavy alcohol use may be risk factors for its development.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms usually develop within 24 to 48 hours of the injury or illness. Often, people with ARDS are so sick they cannot report symptoms. Symptoms can include any of the following:\nShortness of breath\nFast heartbeat\nLow blood pressure and organ failure\nRapid breathing\nExams and Tests\nListening to the chest with a stethoscope (\nauscultation\n) reveals abnormal breath sounds, such as crackles, which may be signs of fluid in the lungs. Often, blood pressure is low."}

Often, blood pressure is low. Blue skin, lips, and nails caused by lack of oxygen to the tissues (\ncyanosis\n) is often seen.\nTests used to diagnose ARDS include:\nArterial blood gas\nBlood tests, including\nCBC\n(complete blood count) and blood chemistries\nBlood\nand\nurine\ncultures\nBronchoscopy\nin some people\nChest x-ray\nor CT scan\nSputum cultures\nand analysis\nTests for possible infections\nAn\nechocardiogram\nmay be needed to rule out\nheart failure\n, which can look similar to ARDS on a chest x-ray.\nTreatment\nARDS often needs to be treated in an intensive care unit (ICU).\nThe goal of treatment is to provide breathing support and treat the cause of ARDS. This may involve medicines to treat infections, reduce inflammation, and remove fluid from the lungs.\nA ventilator is used to deliver high doses of oxygen and positive pressure to the damaged lungs. People often need to be deeply sedated with medicines. During treatment, your health care providers make every effort to protect your lungs from further damage."}

People often need to be deeply sedated with medicines. During treatment, your health care providers make every effort to protect your lungs from further damage. Certain ways of using the ventilator can protect your lungs better and improve chances of recovery. Treatment is mainly supportive until the lungs recover.\nSometimes, a treatment called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is done. During ECMO, blood is filtered through a machine to provide oxygen and remove carbon dioxide.\nSupport Groups\nMany family members of people with ARDS are under extreme stress. They can often relieve this stress by joining\nsupport groups\nwhere members share common experiences and problems.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAbout one third of people with ARDS die of the disease. Those who live often get back most of their normal lung function, but many people have permanent (usually mild) lung damage.\nMany people who survive ARDS have memory loss or other quality-of-life problems after they recover. This is due to brain damage that occurred when the lungs were not working properly and the brain was not getting enough oxygen."}
