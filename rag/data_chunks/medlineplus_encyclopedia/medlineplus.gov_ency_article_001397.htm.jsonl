This is the area in the brain that controls muscle movement. Ataxia means loss of muscle coordination, especially of the hands and legs.\nCauses\nAcute cerebellar ataxia in children, particularly younger than age 3, may occur several days or weeks after an illness caused by a virus.\nViral infections that may cause this include\nchickenpox\n, Coxsackie disease, Epstein-Barr,\nechovirus\n, among others.\nOther causes of acute cerebellar ataxia include:\nAbscess\nof the cerebellum\nAlcohol, medicines, insecticides, and illicit drugs\nBleeding into the cerebellum\nMultiple sclerosis\nStrokes of the cerebellum\nVaccination\nTrauma to head and neck\nCertain conditions associated with some cancers (paraneoplastic disorders)\nSymptoms\nAtaxia may affect movement of the middle part of the body from the neck to the hip area (the trunk) or the arms and legs (limbs).\nWhen the person is sitting, the body may move s"}

Then the body quickly moves back to a sitting upright position.\nWhen a person with ataxia of the arms reaches for an object, the hand may sway back and forth.\nCommon symptoms of ataxia include:\nClumsy speech pattern (\ndysarthria\n)\nRepetitive eye movements (\nnystagmus\n)\nUncoordinated eye movements\nWalking problems (unsteady gait) that can lead to falls\nDifficulty controlling arm movements\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will ask if the person has recently been sick and will check for any other causes of the problem."}

Brain and nervous system exam will be done to identify the most affected areas of the nervous system.\nThe following tests may be ordered:\nCT scan of the head\nMRI scan of the head\nSpinal tap\nBlood tests to detect infections caused by viruses or bacteria\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the cause:\nIf the acute cerebellar ataxia is due to bleeding, surgery may be needed.\nFor an ischemic stroke, medicine to thin the blood can be given. Removing a blood clot from within the blood vessels may also be needed.\nInfections may need to be treated with antibiotics or antivirals.\nCorticosteroids may be needed for swelling (inflammation) of the cerebellum (such as from multiple sclerosis).\nCerebellar ataxia caused by a recent viral infection may not need treatment.\nPhysical therapy may be needed to reduce risk of falling.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPeople whose condition was caused by a recent viral infection should make a full recovery without treatment in a few months."}
