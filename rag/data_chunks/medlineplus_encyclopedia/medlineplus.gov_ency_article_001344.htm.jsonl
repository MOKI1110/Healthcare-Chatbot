The infection can pass through the placenta to the unborn infant during pregnancy.\nCauses\nCongenital syphilis is caused by the bacterium\nTreponema pallidum\n, which can be passed from mother to child during fetal development or at birth. Up to half of all babies infected with syphilis in the womb die shortly before or after birth.\nDespite the fact that this disease can be cured with antibiotics if caught early, rising rates of syphilis among pregnant women in the United States have increased the number of infants born with congenital syphilis since 2013.\nSymptoms\nMost babies who are infected before birth appear normal. Over time, symptoms may develop."}

A physical examination of the infant may show signs of liver and spleen swelling and bone inflammation.\nA routine (screening) blood test for syphilis is done for all pregnant women. Mothers may receive the following blood tests:\nFluorescent treponemal antibody absorbed test (\nFTA-ABS\n)\nRapid plasma reagin (\nRPR\n)\nVenereal disease research laboratory test (\nVDRL\n)\nAn infant or child whose mother had syphilis may have the following tests:\nBone x-ray\nDark-field examination to detect syphilis bacteria under a microscope\nEye examination\nLumbar puncture\n(spinal tap) to remove spinal fluid for testing\nBlood tests (similar to those listed above for the mother)\nTreatment\nPenicillin is the drug of choice for treating this infection.

Treatment of the expectant mother lowers the risk for congenital syphilis in the infant. Babies who become infected when passing through the birth canal have a better outlook than those who are infected earlier during pregnancy.\nPossible Complications\nHealth problems that can result if the baby isn't treated include:\nBlindness\nDeafness\nDeformity of the face\nNervous system problems\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if your baby has signs or symptoms of this condition.\nIf you think that you may have syphilis and are pregnant (or plan to get pregnant), contact your provider right away so you can be tested for syphilis.\nPrevention\nSafer sexual practices\nhelp prevent the spread of syphilis. If you suspect you have a sexually transmitted disease such as syphilis, seek medical attention right away to avoid complications like infecting your baby during pregnancy or birth.\nPrenatal care is very important."}
