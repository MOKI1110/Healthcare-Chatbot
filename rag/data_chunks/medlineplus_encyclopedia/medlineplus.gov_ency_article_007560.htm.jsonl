Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSpinal cord stimulation\nSpinal cord stimulation\nSpinal cord stimulation (SCS) is a treatment for pain that uses a mild electric current to block nerve impulses in the spine.\nDescription\nA trial electrode will be put in place first to see if it helps your pain.\nYour skin will be numbed with a local anesthetic.\nWires (leads) will be placed under your skin and stretched into the space on top of your spinal cord.\nThese wires will be connected to a small current generator outside of your body that you carry like a cell phone.\nThe procedure takes about 1 to 2 hours. You will be able to go home after the leads are placed.\nIf the treatment greatly reduces your pain, you will be offered a permanent generator. The generator will be implanted a few weeks later.\nYou will be asleep and pain-free with\ngeneral anesthesia\n.\nThe generator will be inserted under the skin of your abdomen or buttocks through a small surgical cut.\nThe procedure takes about 30 to 45 minutes.\nThe generator runs on batteries. Some batteries are rechargeable. Others last 2 to 5 years."}

After the SCS is implanted, you may not be able to get an MRI anymore. Discuss this with your surgeon.\nBefore the Procedure\nTell your surgeon or nurse if:\nYou are or could be pregnant\nYou are taking any medicines, including drugs, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\nDuring the week before your surgery:\nYou may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E."}

Your recovery will be slower and possibly not as good if you keep smoking. Ask your provider for\nhelp quitting\n.\nTalk with your surgeon if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol.\nOn the day of surgery:\nFollow instructions about when to stop eating and drinking.\nTake the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\nArrive at the hospital on time.\nBring your cane, walker, or wheelchair if you have one already. Also bring shoes with flat, nonskid soles.\nAfter the Procedure\nAfter the permanent generator is placed, the surgical cut will be closed and covered with a dressing."}

You will be taken to the recovery room to wake up from the anesthesia.\nMost people can go home the same day, but your surgeon may want you to stay overnight in the hospital. You will be taught how to care for your surgical site.\nYou should avoid heavy lifting, bending, and twisting while you are healing. Light exercise such as walking can be helpful during recovery.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAfter the procedure, you may have less back pain and will not need to take as much pain medicines. But, the treatment does not cure back pain or treat the source of the pain. The stimulator can also be adjusted depending on your response to the treatment.\nAlternative Names\nNeurostimulator; SCS; Neuromodulation; Dorsal column stimulation; Chronic back pain - spinal stimulation; Complex regional pain - spinal stimulation; CRPS - spinal stimulation; Failed back surgery - spinal stimulation\nReferences\nBurke JF, GilliganIn CJ, Poree L.
