Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nOptic glioma\nOptic glioma\nGliomas are tumors that grow in various parts of the brain. Optic gliomas can affect:\nOne or both of the optic nerves that carry visual information to the brain from each eye\nThe optic chiasm, the area where the optic nerves cross each other in front of the hypothalamus of the brain\nAn optic glioma may also grow along with a\nhypothalamic glioma\n.\nCauses\nOptic gliomas are rare. The cause of optic gliomas is unknown. Most optic gliomas are slow-growing and noncancerous (\nbenign\n) and occur in children, almost always before age 20. Most cases are diagnosed by 5 years of age.\nThere is a strong association between optic glioma and\nneurofibromatosis type 1\n(NF1).\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms are due to the tumor growing and pressing on the optic nerve and nearby structures."}

Symptoms may include:\nInvoluntary eyeball movement\nOutward bulging of one or both eyes\nSquinting\nVision loss in one or both eyes that starts with the loss of\nperipheral\nvision and eventually leads to\nblindness\nThe child may show symptoms of diencephalic syndrome, which includes:\nDaytime sleeping\nDecreased memory and brain function\nHeadaches\nDelayed growth\nLoss of body fat\nVomiting\nExams and Tests\nA brain and nervous system (neurologic) examination reveals a loss of vision in one or both eyes. There may be changes in the optic nerve, including swelling or scarring of the nerve, or paleness and damage to the optic disc.\nThe tumor may extend into deeper parts of the brain. There may be signs of increased pressure in the brain (intracranial pressure)."}

The goal may be to cure the disorder, relieve symptoms, or improve vision and comfort.\nSurgery to remove the tumor may cure some optic gliomas. Partial removal to reduce the size of the tumor can be done in many cases. This will keep the tumor from damaging normal brain tissue around it. Chemotherapy may be used in some children. Chemotherapy may be especially useful when the tumor extends into the hypothalamus or if vision has been worsened by the tumor's growth.\nRadiation therapy may be recommended in some cases when the tumor is growing despite chemotherapy, and surgery is not possible."}

Early treatment improves the chance of a good outcome.
