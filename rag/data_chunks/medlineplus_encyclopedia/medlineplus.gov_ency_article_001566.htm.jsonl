An autopsy does not show an explainable cause of death.\nCauses\nThe cause of SIDS is unknown. Many doctors and researchers now believe that SIDS is caused by many factors, including:\nProblems with the baby's ability to wake up (sleep arousal)\nInability of the baby's body to detect a buildup of carbon dioxide in the blood\nSIDS rates have gone down sharply since doctors began recommending that babies be put on their backs or sides to sleep to reduce the chance of problem. However, SIDS is still a major cause of death in infants under 1 year old. Thousands of babies die of SIDS in the United States each year.\nSIDS is most likely to occur between 2 and 4 months of age. SIDS affects boys more often than girls."}

Thousands of babies die of SIDS in the United States each year.\nSIDS is most likely to occur between 2 and 4 months of age. SIDS affects boys more often than girls. Most SIDS deaths occur in the winter.\nThe following may increase the risk for SIDS:\nSleeping on the stomach\nBeing around cigarette smoke while in the womb or after being born\nSleeping in the same bed as their parents (co-sleeping)\nSoft bedding in the crib\nMultiple birth babies (being a twin, triplet, or member of a larger multiple birth)\nPremature birth\nHaving a brother or sister who had SIDS\nMothers who smoke or use illegal drugs\nBeing born to a teen mother\nShort time period between pregnancies\nLate or no prenatal care\nLiving in poverty situations\nWhile studies show that babies with the above risk factors are more likely to be affected, the impact or importance of each factor is not well-defined or understood.\nSymptoms\nAlmost all SIDS deaths happen without any warning or symptoms. Death occurs when the infant is thought to be sleeping.\nExams and Tests\nAutopsy results are not able to confirm a cause of death."}

However, the information from an autopsy can add to overall knowledge about SIDS. State law may require an autopsy in the case of unexplained death.\nSupport Groups\nSeveral organizations offer\nresources and support services\nfor people who have experienced the loss of a child from SIDS.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIf your baby is not moving or breathing, begin\nCPR\nand call 911 or the local emergency number. Parents and caregivers of all infants and children should be trained in CPR.\nPrevention\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends the following:\nAlways put a baby to sleep on its back.\n(This includes naps.) Do NOT put a baby to sleep on its stomach."}

Do NOT put a baby to sleep on its stomach. Also, a baby can roll onto the stomach from its side, so this position should be avoided.\nPut babies on a firm surface (such as in the crib) to sleep.\nNever allow the baby to sleep in bed with other children or adults, and do NOT put them to sleep on other surfaces, such as a sofa.\nLet babies sleep in the same room (NOT the same bed) as parents.\nIf possible, babies' cribs should be placed in the parents' bedroom to allow for night-time feeding.\nAvoid soft bedding materials.\nBabies should be placed on a firm, tight-fitting crib mattress without loose bedding. Use a light sheet to cover the baby. Do not use pillows, comforters, or quilts.\nMake sure the room temperature is not too hot.\nThe room temperature should be comfortable for a lightly clothed adult. A baby should not be hot to the touch.\nOffer the baby a pacifier when going to sleep.\nPacifiers at naptime and bedtime can reduce the risk for SIDS."}

Health care professionals think that a pacifier might allow the airway to open more, or prevent the baby from falling into a deep sleep. If the baby is breastfeeding, it is best to wait until 1 month before offering a pacifier, so that it doesn't interfere with breastfeeding.\nDo not use breathing monitors or products marketed as ways to reduce SIDS.\nResearch found that these devices do not help prevent SIDS.\nOther recommendations from SIDS experts:\nKeep your baby in a smoke-free environment.\nMothers should avoid alcohol and drug use during and after pregnancy.\nBreastfeed your baby, if possible. Breastfeeding reduces some upper respiratory infections that may influence the development of SIDS.\nNever give honey to a child younger than 1 year old.
