This is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen in the blood.\nPorphyrins can be measured in the blood or the\nurine\n. This article discusses the blood test.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nThe sample is then placed in ice and taken immediately to the lab. Three porphyrins can normally be measured in small amounts in human blood. They are:\nCoproporphyrin\nProtoporphyrin (PROTO)\nUroporphyrin\nProtoporphyrin is normally found in the highest amount. More tests are needed to show the levels of specific porphyrins.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou should not eat for 12 to 14 hours before this test. You may drink water right before the test. Your test results may be affected if you do not follow these instructions.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is used to diagnose\nporphyrias\n. This is a group of rare disorders often passed down through family members.\nIt may also be used along with other tests to diagnose lead poisoning and certain nervous system and skin disorders.\nNormal Results\nThis test specifically measures total porphyrin levels. But, reference values (a range of values seen in a group of healthy people) for the individual components are also included:\nTotal porphyrin levels: 0 to 1.0 mcg/dL (0 to 15 nmol/L)\nCoproporphyrin level: <2 mcg/dL (<30 nmol/L)\nProtoporphyrin level: 16 to 60 mcg/dL (0.28 to 1.07  µmol/L)\nUroporphyrin level: <2 mcg/dL (<2.4 nmol/L)\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different lab. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIncreased levels of coproporphyrins may be a sign of:\nCongenital erythropoietic porphyria\nHepatic coproporphyria\nSideroblastic anemia\nVariegate porphyria\nAn increased protoporphyrin level may be a sign of:\nAnemia of chronic disease\nCongenital\nerythropoietic protoporphyria\nIncreased erythropoiesis\nInfection\nIron deficiency anemia\nLead poisoning\nSideroblastic anemia\nThalassemia\nVariegate porphyria\nAn increased uroporphyrin level may be a sign of:\nCongenital erythropoietic porphyria\nPorphyria cutanea tarda\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.
