The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord. NMO causes inflammation and damage to the optic nerve and spinal cord. The optic nerve sends signals from the back of the eye (retina) to the brain. In some cases, NMO also may affect the brain.\nCauses\nNMO is a type of autoimmune disorder.\nAutoimmune disorders\nare conditions where the body's immune system destroys healthy cells and tissues.\nNMO causes damage to a type of nerve cell called astrocytes as well as the myelin sheath of nerve cells. This sheath is the protective covering that surrounds nerve cells. When this nerve covering is damaged, nerve signals slow or stop. This can occur anywhere along the optic nerve and spinal cord.\nNMO is often confused with and misdiagnosed as\nmultiple sclerosis\n(MS) because they have similar symptoms. However, the two conditions are different and have different treatments.\nThere is no identifiable cause for NMO."}

However, the two conditions are different and have different treatments.\nThere is no identifiable cause for NMO. The disease tends to develop in childhood or in a person's 40s. It may occur after an infection. People with a personal or family history of autoimmune disorders may also be at risk.\nThere are two main types of NMO:\nRelapsing NMO is the most common form. It has flare-ups that occur between periods of recovery. Women are more likely to get this form of NMO.\nMonophasic NMO is much less common and affects men and women equally. It involves a single attack that may last for 1 to 2 months and does not recur.\nSymptoms\nNMO may cause different symptoms that range in severity.\nOne main symptom is inflammation of one or both optic nerves (\noptic neuritis\n). Optic nerves transmit images from the eyes to the brain."}
