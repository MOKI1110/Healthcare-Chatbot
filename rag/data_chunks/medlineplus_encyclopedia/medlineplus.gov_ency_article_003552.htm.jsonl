Platelets are particles in the blood that help the blood clot. Sometimes the body may produce antibodies that affect its own platelets.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nAn antibody is a protein produced by your body's immune system to attack harmful substances, called antigens. Examples of antigens include bacteria and viruses. Autoimmune antibodies can be mistakenly directed against one's own cells and produce various diseases.\nAntibodies may be produced when your immune system mistakenly considers healthy tissue to be a harmful substance."}

In the case of anti-platelet antibodies, your body creates antibodies that attack or coat your own platelets. As a result, you will have a lower than normal number of platelets in your body. This condition is called\nthrombocytopenia\n, and it can cause bleeding.\nThis test is often ordered because you have a bleeding problem or a low platelet count.\nNormal Results\nA negative test is normal. This means that you do not have anti-platelet antibodies in your blood.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different lab. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results show that you have anti-platelet antibodies."}

Anti-platelet antibodies may appear in the blood due to any of the following:\nFor unknown reasons (idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, or\nITP\n)\nSide effect of certain medicines such as gold, heparin, quinidine, and quinine\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others. Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nThrombocytopenia - platelet antibody; Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura - platelet antibody\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nAbrams CS.
