Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nACL reconstruction\nACL reconstruction\nACL reconstruction is surgery to reconstruct the ligament in the center of your knee. The anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) connects your shin bone (tibia) to your thigh bone (femur). A tear of this ligament can cause your knee to give way during physical activity, most often during side-step or crossover movements.\nDescription\nMost people have\ngeneral anesthesia\nright before surgery. This means you will be asleep and pain-free. Other kinds of anesthesia, like regional anesthesia or a block, may also be used for this surgery.\nThe tissue to replace your damaged ACL will come from your own body or from a donor. A donor is a person who has died and chose to give all or part of their body to help others.\nTissue taken from your own body is called an autograft. The most common places to take tissue from are the knee cap tendon, quadriceps tendon, or hamstring tendon."}

The most common places to take tissue from are the knee cap tendon, quadriceps tendon, or hamstring tendon. Your hamstrings are the muscles behind your knee.\nTissue taken from a donor is called an allograft or cadaver graft.\nThe procedure is usually performed with the help of\nknee arthroscopy\n. With arthroscopy, a tiny camera is inserted into the knee through a small surgical cut. The camera is connected to a video monitor in the operating room. Your surgeon will use the camera to check the ligaments and other tissues of your knee.\nYour surgeon will make other small cuts around your knee and insert other medical instruments. Your surgeon will fix any other damage found, and then will replace your ACL by following these steps:\nThe torn ligament will be removed with a shaver or other instruments.\nIf your own tissue is being used to make your new ACL, your surgeon will make a larger cut. Then, the autograft will be removed through this cut.\nYour surgeon will make tunnels and sockets in your bone through which to bring the new tissue."}

This new tissue will be put at the same place as your old ACL.\nYour surgeon will attach the new ligament to the bone with screws or other devices to hold it in place. As it heals, the graft will remodel to become your new ligament.\nAt the end of the surgery, your surgeon will close your cuts with sutures (stitches) and cover the area with a dressing. You may be able to view pictures after the procedure of what the surgeon saw and what was done during the surgery.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nIf you do not have your ACL reconstructed, your knee may continue to be unstable. This increases the chance you may have a meniscus tear. ACL reconstruction may be used for these knee problems:\nKnee that gives way or feels unstable during daily activities\nKnee pain\nInability to return to sports or other activities\nWhen other ligaments are also injured\nWhen your meniscus is torn\nBefore surgery, talk to your health care provider about the time and effort you will need to recover."}

Your ability to return to full activity will depend on how well you follow the program.\nRisks\nThe risks from any anesthesia are:\nAllergic reactions to medicines\nBreathing problems\nThe risks from any surgery are:\nBleeding\nInfection\nOther risks from this surgery may include:\nBlood clot\nin the leg\nFailure of the ligament to heal\nFailure of the surgery to relieve symptoms\nInjury to a nearby blood vessel\nPain in the knee\nStiffness of the knee or lost range of motion\nWeakness of the knee\nBefore the Procedure\nAlways tell your provider what medicines you are taking, even medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\nDuring the 2 weeks before your surgery:\nYou may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot."}

You may have to wear a knee brace for the first 1 to 6 weeks. You also may need\ncrutches\nfor 1 to 6 weeks. How long you will need to use a crutch and brace will depend on the type of surgery you had and the extent of the reconstruction. Most people are allowed to move their knee right after surgery. This may help prevent stiffness. You may need medicine for your pain.\nPhysical therapy can help many people regain motion and strength in their knee."}

A full return to activities and sports will often take 4 to 6 months. Sports that involve quick changes in direction, such as soccer, basketball, and football, may require up to 9 to 12 months of rehabilitation.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people will have a stable knee that does not give way after ACL reconstruction.
