Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nVertebrobasilar circulatory disorders\nVertebrobasilar circulatory disorders\nVertebrobasilar circulatory disorders are conditions in which the blood supply to the back of the brain is disrupted.\nCauses\nIn the neck, two vertebral arteries join to form the basilar artery, which enters the skull. These are the main blood vessels that provide blood flow to the back of the brain.\nThe areas in the back of the brain that receive blood from these arteries are needed to keep a person alive. These areas regulate breathing, heart rate, swallowing, vision, movement, and posture or balance. All of the nervous system signals that connect the brain to the rest of the body pass through the back of the brain.\nMany different conditions may reduce or stop blood flow in the back part of the brain. The most common risk factors are smoking, high blood pressure,\ndiabetes\n, increased age, and a high cholesterol level."}

Treatment is similar to that for\nstroke\n. Depending on how long you have had symptoms among others, a medicine may be infused to break open any blood clots. A catheter may be inserted into a blood vessel to remove a clot."}

These include:\nBreathing (respiratory) failure (which may require the use of a machine to help the person breathe)\nLung problems (especially lung infections)\nHeart attack\nLack of fluids in the body (dehydration) and swallowing problems (sometimes requiring tube feeding)\nProblems with movement or sensation, including paralysis and numbness\nFormation of blood clots in the legs\nVision loss\nComplications caused by medicines or surgery may also occur.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall 911 or the local emergency number, or get to the emergency room if you have any symptoms of a vertebral or basilar circulatory disorder.\nAlternative Names\nVertebrobasilar insufficiency; Posterior circulation ischemia; Beauty parlor syndrome; TIA - vertebrobasilar insufficiency; Dizziness - vertebrobasilar insufficiency; Vertigo - vertebrobasi"}
