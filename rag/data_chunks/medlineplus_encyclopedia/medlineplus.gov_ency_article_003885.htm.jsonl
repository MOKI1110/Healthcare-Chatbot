Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSigmoidoscopy\nSigmoidoscopy\nSigmoidoscopy using a flexible scope is a procedure used to see inside the sigmoid colon and rectum. The sigmoid colon is the area of the large intestine nearest to the rectum and is about one third of the total colon.\nHow the Test is Performed\nDuring the test:\nYou lie on your left side with your knees drawn up to your chest.\nYour health care provider gently places a gloved and lubricated finger into your rectum to check for blockage and gently enlarge (dilate) the anus. This is called a\ndigital rectal exam\n.\nNext, the flexible sigmoidoscope is placed through the anus. The scope is a flexible tube with a camera at its end. The scope is gently moved into your colon. Air or carbon dioxide is inserted into the colon to enlarge the area and help the provider view the area better. The air may cause the urge to have a bowel movement or pass gas."}

Air or carbon dioxide is inserted into the colon to enlarge the area and help the provider view the area better. The air may cause the urge to have a bowel movement or pass gas. Suction may be used to remove fluid or stool.\nOften, the images are seen in high definition on a video monitor.\nYour provider may take tissue samples with a tiny\nbiopsy\ntool or a thin metal snare inserted through the scope. Heat (electrocautery) may be used to remove\npolyps\nif your colon has been properly prepared for this. Photos of the inside of your colon may be taken.\nSigmoidoscopy using a rigid scope may be done to treat problems of the anus or rectum but is not used to screen for colon cancer.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider will tell you how to prepare for the exam. You will use an enema to empty your bowels. This is usually done 1 hour before the sigmoidoscopy. Often, a second enema may be recommended or your provider may recommend a liquid laxative the night before.\nOn the morning of the procedure, you may be asked to fast with the exception of certain medicines. Be sure to discuss this with your provider well in advance."}

Again, discuss this with your provider well in advance of your test date.\nHow the Test will Feel\nDuring the exam you may feel:\nPressure during the digital rectal exam or when the scope is placed in your rectum.\nThe need to have a bowel movement.\nSome bloating or cramping caused by the air or by stretching of the bowel by the sigmoidoscope.\nAfter the test, your body will pass the air that was put into your colon.\nChildren may be given medicine to make them sleep lightly (sedated) for this procedure.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may recommend this test to look for the cause of:\nAbdominal pain\nDiarrhea\n, constipation, or other changes in bowel habits\nBlood, mucus, or pus in the stool\nWeight loss that can't be explained\nThis test can also be used to:\nConfirm findings of another test or\nx-rays\nScreen for\ncolorectal cancer\nor polyps\nTake a biopsy of a growth\nAll adults s"}
