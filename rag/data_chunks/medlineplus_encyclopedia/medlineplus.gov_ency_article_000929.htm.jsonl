But this only provides short-term relief. Not doing the obsessive rituals can cause great anxiety and distress.\nCauses\nHealth care providers do not know the exact cause of OCD. Factors that may play a role include prior head injury, infections, and abnormal function in certain areas of the brain. Genes (family history) seems to play a strong role. A history of physical or sexual abuse also appears to increase the risk for OCD.\nParents and teachers often recognize OCD symptoms in children. Most people are diagnosed by age 19 or 20, but some do not show symptoms until age 30.\nSymptoms\nPeople with OCD have repeated thoughts, urges, or mental images that cause anxiety."}

These are called compulsions.\nExamples include:\nChecking and rechecking actions (such as turning out the lights and locking the door)\nExcessive counting\nOrdering things in a certain way\nRepeatedly washing the hands to ward off infection\nRepeating words silently\nPraying silently over and over\nNot everyone who has habits or rituals they like to perform has OCD."}

A mental health assessment can rule out other mental disorders.\nQuestionnaires can help diagnose OCD and track the progress of treatment.\nTreatment\nOCD is treated using a combination of medicine and behavioral therapy.\nMedicines used include antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers.\nClomipramine has been shown to be effective for many with OCD.\nTalk therapy (cognitive behavioral therapy; CBT) has been shown to be effective for this disorder. During therapy, the person is exposed many times to a situation that triggers the obsessive thoughts and learns to gradually tolerate the anxiety and resist the urge to do the compulsion. Therapy can also be used to reduce stress and anxiety and resolve inner conflicts.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of having OCD by joining a support group."}

A completely symptom-free period is unusual. Most people improve with treatment.\nPossible Complications\nLong-term complications of OCD have to do with the type of obsessions or compulsions.
