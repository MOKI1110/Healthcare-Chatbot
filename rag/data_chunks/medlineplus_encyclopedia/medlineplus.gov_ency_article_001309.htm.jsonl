This type of transplant is called allogeneic. The new, transplanted cells regard the recipient's body as foreign. When this happens, the cells attack the recipient's body.\nGVHD does not occur when people receive their own cells. This type of transplant is called autologous.\nBefore a transplant, tissue and cells from possible donors are checked to see how closely they match the recipient. GVHD is less likely to occur, or symptoms will be milder, when the match is close. The chance of GVHD is:\nAround 35% to 45% when the donor and recipient are related\nAround 60% to 80% when the donor and recipient are not related\nSymptoms\nThere are two types of GVHD: acute and chronic."}

Symptoms in both acute and chronic GVHD range from mild to severe.\nAcute GVHD usually happens within days or as late as 6 months after a transplant. The immune system, skin, liver, and intestines are mainly affected. Common acute symptoms include:\nAbdominal pain or cramps, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea\nJaundice\n(yellow coloring of the skin or eyes) or other liver problems\nSkin rash,\nitching, redness on areas of the skin\nIncreased risk for infections\nChronic GVHD usually starts more than 3 months after a transplant, and can last a lifetime."}

This helps reduce the chances (or severity) of GVHD.\nYou'll continue taking the medicines until your transplant health care provider thinks the risk for GVHD is low. Many of these medicines have side effects, including kidney and liver damage. You'll have regular tests to watch for these problems.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook depends on the severity of GVHD. People who receive closely matched bone marrow tissue and cells usually do better.\nSome cases of GVHD can damage the liver, lungs, digestive tract, or other body organs. There is also a risk for severe infections.\nMany cases of acute or chronic GVHD can be treated successfully."}

But this doesn't guarantee that the transplant itself will succeed in treating the original disease.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIf you have had a bone marrow transplant, contact your transplant provider right away if you develop any symptoms of GVHD or other unusual symptoms.\nAlternative Names\nGVHD; Bone marrow transplant - graft-versus-host disease; Stem cell transplant - graft-versus-host disease; Allogeneic transplant - GVHD\nPatient Instructions\nBone marrow transplant - discharge\nImages\nAntibodies\nReferences\nChao NJ, Keating A.
