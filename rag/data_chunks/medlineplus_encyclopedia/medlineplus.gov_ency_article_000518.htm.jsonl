Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHydrocele\nHydrocele\nA hydrocele is a fluid-filled sac in the\nscrotum\n.\nCauses\nHydroceles are common in newborn infants.\nDuring a baby's development in the womb, the testicles descend from the abdomen through a tube into the scrotum. Hydroceles occur when this tube does not close after the testicle moves through it. Fluid drains from the abdomen through the open tube and gets trapped in the scrotum. This causes the scrotum to swell.\nMost hydroceles go away a few months after birth. Sometimes, a hydrocele may occur with an\ninguinal hernia\n.\nHydroceles may also be caused by:\nBuildup of the normal fluid around the testicle. This may occur because the body makes too much of the fluid or it does not drain well. (This type of hydrocele is more common in older men.)\nSwelling or injury of the testicle or epididymis.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom is a painless, round-oval shaped\nswollen scrotum\n, which feels like a water balloon. A hydrocele may occur on one or both sides. However, the right side is more commonly involved.\nExams and Tests\nYou will have a physical exam."}

A hydrocele may occur on one or both sides. However, the right side is more commonly involved.\nExams and Tests\nYou will have a physical exam. Your health care provider will find that the scrotum is swollen, but not painful to the touch. Often, the testicle cannot be felt because of the fluid around it. The size of the fluid-filled sac can sometimes be increased and decreased by putting pressure on the abdomen or the scrotum.\nIf the size of the fluid collection changes, it is more likely to be due to an inguinal hernia.\nHydroceles can be easily seen by shining a flashlight through the swollen part of the scrotum. If the scrotum is full of clear fluid, the scrotum will light up.\nYou may need an\nultrasound\nor\nCT scan\nto confirm the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nHydroceles are not harmful most of the time. They are treated only when they cause infection or discomfort.\nHydroceles from an inguinal hernia should be fixed with surgery as soon as possible. Hydroceles that do not go away on their own after a few months may need surgery. A surgical procedure called a\nhydrocelectomy\n(removal of sac lining) is often done to correct the problem."}

Needle drainage is an option, but the fluid will come back.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSimple hydroceles in children often go away without surgery. In adults, hydroceles usually do not go away on their own. If surgery is needed, it is an easy procedure with very good outcomes. After surgery, a hydrocele can sometimes reoccur.\nPossible Complications\nRisks from hydrocele surgery may include:\nBlood clots\nInfection\nInjury to the scrotum\nLoss of the testicle\nLong-term (chronic) pain\nContinuous swelling\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of hydrocele. It is important to rule out other causes of a\ntesticular lump\n.\nPain in the scrotum or testicles is an emergency. If you have pain and your scrotum is enlarged, seek medical help right away to prevent the loss of the testicle.\nAlternative Names\nProcessus vaginalis; Patent processus vaginalis\nImages\nMale reproductive anatomy\nHydrocele\nReferences\nAiken JJ.
