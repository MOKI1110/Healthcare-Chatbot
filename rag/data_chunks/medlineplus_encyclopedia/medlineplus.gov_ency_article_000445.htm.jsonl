It is rare.\nCauses\nThe cause of Felty syndrome is unknown. It is more common in people who have had rheumatoid arthritis (RA) for a long time. People with this syndrome are at risk for infection because they have a low white blood cell count.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nGeneral feeling of discomfort (\nmalaise\n)\nFatigue\nWeakness in leg or arm\nLoss of appetite\nUnintentional weight loss\nUlcers in the skin\nJoint swelling\n, stiffness, pain, and deformity\nRecurrent infections\nRed eye with burning or discharge\nExams and Tests\nphysical exam\nwill show:\nSwollen spleen\nJoints that show signs of RA\nPossibly swollen liver and lymph nodes\nA complete blood count (\nCBC\n) with differential will show a low number of white blood cells called neutrophils."}

Nearly all people with Felty syndrome have a positive test for rheumatoid factor.\nAn\nabdominal ultrasound\nmay confirm a swollen spleen.\nTreatment\nIn most cases, people who have this syndrome are not getting recommended treatment for RA. They may need other medicines to suppress their immune system and reduce the activity of their RA.\nMethotrexate may improve the low neutrophil count. The drug rituximab has been successful in people who do not respond to methotrexate.\nGranulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) may raise the neutrophil count.\nSome people benefit from removal of the spleen (\nsplenectomy\n).\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWithout treatment, infections may continue to occur.\nRA is likely to get worse.\nTreating the RA, however, should improve Felty syndrome.\nPossible Complications\nYou may have infections that keep coming back.\nSome people with Felty syndrome have increased numbers of large granular lymphocytes, also called LGL leukemia."}
