If the cause can be corrected, the outlook is often good. In this case, treatment with antipsychotic medicine may be brief.\nSome chronic conditions, such as schizophrenia, may need lifelong treatment with antipsychotic medicines to control symptoms.\nPossible Complications\nPsychosis can prevent people from functioning normally and caring for themselves. Left untreated, people can sometimes harm themselves or others.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider or mental health professional if you or a member of your family is losing contact with reality. If there is any concern about safety, take the person to the emergency room to be seen by a provider.\nPrevention\nPrevention depends on the cause. For example, avoiding alcohol prevents psychosis caused by alcohol use.\nReferences\nAmerican Psychiatric Association.
