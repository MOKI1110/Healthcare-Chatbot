Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBeriberi\nBeriberi\nBeriberi is a disease in which the body does not have enough\nthiamine\n(vitamin B1).\nCauses\nThere are two major types of beriberi:\nWet beriberi: Affects the cardiovascular system.\nDry beriberi and\nWernicke-Korsakoff syndrome\n: Affects the nervous system.\nBeriberi is rare in the United States. This is because many foods are now vitamin enriched. If you eat a normal, healthy diet, you should get enough thiamine. Today, beriberi occurs mostly in people who drink too much alcohol. Drinking heavily can lead to poor nutrition. Excess alcohol makes it harder for the body to absorb and store vitamin B1.\nIn rare cases, beriberi can be genetic. This condition is passed down through families. People with this condition lose the ability to absorb thiamine from foods. This can happen slowly over time. The symptoms occur when the person is an adult. However, this diagnosis is often missed."}

People with this condition lose the ability to absorb thiamine from foods. This can happen slowly over time. The symptoms occur when the person is an adult. However, this diagnosis is often missed. This is because health care providers may not consider beriberi in nonalcoholics.\nBeriberi can occur in infants when they are:\nBreastfed and the mother's body is lacking in thiamine\nFed unusual\nformulas\nthat don't have enough thiamine\nSome medical treatments that can raise your risk of beriberi are:\nGetting\ndialysis\nTaking high doses of diuretics (water pills)\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of dry beriberi include:\nDifficulty walking\nLoss of feeling (sensation)\nin hands and feet\nLoss of muscle function or paralysis of the lower legs\nMental\nconfusion\nPain\nSpeech difficulties\nStrange eye movements (nystagmus)\nTingling\nVomiting\nSymptoms of wet beriberi include:\nAwakening at night short of breath\nIncreased heart rate\nShortness of breath\nwith activity\nSwelling of the lower legs\nExams and Tests\nA physical examination may show signs of\ncongestive heart failure\n, including:\nDifficulty breathing, with neck veins that stick out\nEnlarged heart\nFluid in the lungs\nRapid heartbeat\nSwelling in both lower legs\nA p"}

The person may be less able to sense vibrations.\nA neurological exam may show signs of:\nChanges in walking\nCoordination problems\nDecreased reflexes\nDrooping of the eyelids\nThe following tests may be done:\nBlood tests to measure the amount of thiamine in the blood\nUrine tests to see if thiamine is passing through the urine\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to replace the thiamine your body is lacking. This is done with thiamine supplements. Thiamine supplements are given through a shot (injection) or taken by mouth.\nYour provider may also suggest other types of vitamins.\nBlood tests may be repeated after the treatment is started. These tests will show how well you are responding to the medicine.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nUntreated, beriberi can be fatal. With treatment, symptoms usually improve quickly.\nHeart damage is usually reversible. A full recovery is expected in these cases."}

However, if acute heart failure has already occurred, the outlook is poor.\nNervous system damage is also reversible, if caught early. If it is not caught early, some symptoms (such as memory loss or confusion) may remain, even with treatment.\nIf a person with Wernicke encephalopathy receives thiamine replacement, language problems, unusual eye movements, and walking difficulties may go away. However, Korsakoff syndrome (or Korsakoff psychosis) may develop as Wernicke symptoms go away.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nComa\nCongestive heart failure\nDeath\nPsychosis\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nBeriberi is extremely rare in the United States. However, contact your provider if:\nYou feel your family's diet is inadequate or poorly balanced\nYou or your children have any symptoms of beriberi\nPrevention\nEating a proper diet that is rich in vitamins will prevent beriberi. Nursing mothers should make sure that their diet contains all vitamins."}
