It removes harmful substances from the blood when the kidneys cannot.\nThis article focuses on peritoneal dialysis.\nDescription\nYour kidneys' main job is to remove toxins and extra fluid from your blood and regulate some aspects of your body's chemical balance. If waste products build up in your body, it can be dangerous and even cause death.\nKidney dialysis (peritoneal dialysis and other types of dialysis) does some of the job of the kidneys when they stop working well. This process:\nRemoves extra salt, water, and waste products so they do not build up in your body\nKeeps safe levels of minerals and vitamins in your body\nHelps control blood pressure\nHelps produce red blood cells\nWHAT IS PERITONEAL DIALYSIS?\nPeritoneal dialysis (PD) removes waste and extra fluid through the blood vessels that line the walls of your abdomen."}

A membrane called the peritoneum covers the walls of your abdomen.\nPD involves putting a soft, hollow tube (catheter) into your abdominal cavity and filling it with a cleansing fluid (dialysis solution). The solution contains a type of sugar that draws out waste and extra fluid. The waste and fluid passes from your blood vessels through the peritoneum and into the solution. After a set amount of time, the solution and waste is drained and thrown away.\nThe process of filling and draining your abdomen is called an exchange. The length of time the cleansing fluid remains in your body is called the dwell time.  The number of exchanges and the length of the dwell time depend on the method of PD you use and other factors.\nYour doctor (kidney specialist or surgeon) will perform surgery to place the catheter in your abdomen where it will stay. It is most often near your belly button.\nPD may be a good option if you want more independence and are able to learn to treat yourself."}

It is most often near your belly button.\nPD may be a good option if you want more independence and are able to learn to treat yourself. You will have a lot to learn and need to be responsible for your care. You and your caregivers must learn how to:\nPerform PD as prescribed\nUse the equipment\nBuy and keep track of supplies\nPrevent infection\nWith PD, it is important not to skip exchanges. Doing so can be dangerous to your health.\nSome people feel more comfortable having a trained medical provider do some of their PD treatment. You and your health care provider (kidney specialist) can decide what is best for you.\nTYPES OF PERITONEAL DIALYSIS\nPD gives you more flexibility because you do not have to go to a dialysis center. You can have treatments:\nAt home\nAt work\nWhile traveling\nThere are 2 types of PD:\nContinuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)\n. For this method, you fill your abdomen with fluid, then go about your daily routine until it is time to drain the fluid. You are not hooked up to anything during the dwell period, and you do not need a machine. You use gravity to drain the fluid."}

You are not hooked up to anything during the dwell period, and you do not need a machine. You use gravity to drain the fluid. The dwell time is usually about 4 to 6 hours, and you will need 3 to 4 exchanges each day. You will have a longer dwell time at night while you sleep.\nContinuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD)\n. With CCPD, you are connected to a machine that cycles through 3 to 5 exchanges at night while you sleep. You must be attached to the machine for 10 to 12 hours during this time. In the morning, you begin an exchange with a dwell time that lasts all day long. This allows you more time during the day without having to do exchanges.\nThe method you use depends on your:\nPreferences\nLifestyle\nMedical condition\nYou can also use some combination of the two methods. Your provider will help you find the method that works best for you.\nYour provider will monitor you to make sure the exchanges are removing enough waste products. You will also be tested to see how much sugar your body absorbs from the cleansing fluid."}

Depending on the results, you may need to make certain adjustments:\nTo do more exchanges per day\nTo use more cleansing fluid at each exchange\nTo decrease the dwell time so you absorb less sugar\nWHEN TO START DIALYSIS\nKidney failure is the last stage of\nlong-term (chronic) kidney disease\n. This is when your kidneys can no longer support your body's needs. Your provider will discuss dialysis with you before you need it. In most cases, you will go on dialysis when you have only 10% to 15% of your kidney function left.\nRisks\nThere is a risk for infection of the peritoneum (\nperitonitis\n) or the catheter site with PD. Your provider will show you how to clean and care for your catheter and prevent infection."}
