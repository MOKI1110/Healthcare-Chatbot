An example of fine motor control is picking up a small item with the index finger (pointer finger or forefinger) and thumb.\nThe opposite of fine motor control is gross (large, general) motor control. An example of\ngross motor control\nis waving an arm in greeting.\nProblems of the brain, spinal cord, peripheral nerves (nerves outside of the brain and spinal cord), muscles, or joints may all decrease fine motor control. People with Parkinson disease have trouble speaking, eating, and writing because they have lost fine motor control.\nThe amount of fine motor control in children is used to help figure out the child's developmental age. Children develop fine motor skills over time, by practicing and being taught."}
