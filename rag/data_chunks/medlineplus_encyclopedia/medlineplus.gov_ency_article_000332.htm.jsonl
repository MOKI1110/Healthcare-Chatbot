Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMilk-alkali syndrome\nMilk-alkali syndrome\nMilk-alkali syndrome is a condition in which there is a high level of calcium in the body (\nhypercalcemia\n). This causes a shift in the body's acid/base balance toward alkaline (metabolic alkalosis). As a result, there can be a\nloss of kidney function\n.\nCauses\nMilk-alkali syndrome is almost always caused by taking too many calcium supplements, usually in the form of calcium carbonate. Calcium carbonate is a common calcium supplement. It is often taken to prevent or treat bone loss (\nosteoporosis\n). Calcium carbonate is also an ingredient found in antacids (such as Tums).\nA high level of vitamin D in the body, such as from taking supplements, can worsen milk-alkali syndrome.\nCalcium deposits in the kidneys and in other tissues can occur in milk-alkali syndrome.\nSymptoms\nIn the beginning, the condition usually has no symptoms (asymptomatic)."}
