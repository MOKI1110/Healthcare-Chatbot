For this reason, little is known about which treatments work. Talk therapy may not be effective. This is because people with this disorder may have a hard time forming a good working relationship with a therapist.\nOne approach that seems to help is to put fewer demands for emotional closeness or intimacy on the person.\nPeople with schizoid personality disorder often do well in relationships that don't focus on emotional closeness. They tend to be better at handling relationships that focus on:\nWork\nIntellectual activities\nExpectations\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSchizoid personality disorder is a long-term (chronic) illness that usually does not improve much over time. Social isolation often prevents the person from asking for help or support.\nLimiting expectations of emotional intimacy may help people with this condition make and keep connections with other people.\nAlternative Names\nPersonality disorder - schizoid\nReferences\nAmerican Psychiatric Association."}
