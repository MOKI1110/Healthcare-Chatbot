Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nAST is an enzyme found in high levels in the liver, heart, and muscles. It is also found in lesser amounts in other tissues."}

This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nAST is an enzyme found in high levels in the liver, heart, and muscles. It is also found in lesser amounts in other tissues. An enzyme is a protein that causes a specific chemical change in the body.\nInjury to the liver results in release of AST into the blood.\nThis test is mainly done along with other tests (such as\nALT\n,\nALP\n, and\nbilirubin\n) to diagnose and monitor\nliver disease\n.\nNormal Results\nThe normal range is 8 to 33 U/L (0.13 to 0.55  µkat/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn increased AST level is often a sign of liver disease."}

Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn increased AST level is often a sign of liver disease. Liver disease is even more likely when the levels of substances checked by other liver blood tests have also increased.\nAn increased AST level may be due to any of the following:\nScarring of the liver (\ncirrhosis\n)\nDeath of liver tissue\nHeart attack\nToo much iron in the body (\nhemochromatosis\n)\nSwollen and inflamed liver (\nhepatitis\n)\nLack of blood flow to the liver (\nliver ischemia\n)\nLiver cancer\nor tumor\nUse of medicines and drugs that are toxic to the liver, especially alcohol or acetaminophen  use\nMononucleosis\n(mono)\nMuscle disease or trauma\nSwollen and inflamed pancreas (\npancreatitis\n)\nAST level may also increase after:\nBurns (deep)\nHeart procedures\nSeizures\nSurgery\nPregnancy and exercise may also cause an increased AST level.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
