This sugar is found in milk and other dairy products. If your body cannot break down this sugar, you are said to have\nlactose intolerance\n. This can cause gassiness, abdominal pain, cramps, and diarrhea.\nHow the Test is Performed\nTwo common methods include:\nLactose tolerance blood test\nHydrogen breath test\nThe hydrogen breath test is the preferred method. It measures the amount of hydrogen in the air you breathe out.\nYou will be asked to breathe into a balloon-type container.\nYou will then drink a flavored liquid containing lactose.\nSamples of your breath are taken at set times and the hydrogen level is checked.\nNormally, very little hydrogen is in your breath. But if your body has trouble breaking down and absorbing lactose, breath hydrogen levels increase.\nThe lactose tolerance blood test looks for glucose in your blood."}

Your body creates glucose when lactose breaks down.\nFor this test, several blood samples will be taken before and after you drink a liquid containing lactose.\nA blood sample will be taken from a vein in your arm (\nvenipuncture\n).\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou should not eat or do heavy exercise for 8 hours before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThere should not be any pain or discomfort when giving a breath sample.\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel slight pain, while others feel only a prick or stinging feeling."}

A rise of 20 to 30 mg/dL (1.1 to 1.6 mmol/L) is inconclusive.\nNote: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nThe examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nThe examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be a sign of lactose intolerance.\nA breath test result that shows a rise in hydrogen content of 20 ppm over your pre-test level is considered a positive test. This means you may have trouble breaking down lactose.\nThe blood test is considered abnormal if your glucose level rises less than 20 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L) within 2 hours of drinking the lactose solution.\nAn abnormal test should be followed by a\nglucose tolerance test\n. This will rule out a problem with the body's ability to absorb glucose.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
