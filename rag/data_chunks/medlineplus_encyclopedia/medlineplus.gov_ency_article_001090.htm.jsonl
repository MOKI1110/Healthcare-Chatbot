Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPulmonary arteriovenous fistula\nPulmonary arteriovenous fistula\nPulmonary arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal connection between an artery and vein in the lungs. As a result, blood passes through the lungs without receiving enough oxygen.\nCauses\nPulmonary arteriovenous fistulas are usually the result of abnormal development of the blood vessels of the lung. Most occur in people with\nhereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT)\n. These people often have abnormal blood vessels in many other parts of the body.\nFistulas also can be a complication of liver disease or lung injury, although these causes are much less common.\nSymptoms\nMany people have no symptoms. When symptoms occur, they can include:\nBloody sputum\nDifficulty breathing\nDifficulty exercising\nNosebleeds\nShortness of breath with exertion\nChest pain\n\nBlue skin (\ncyanosis\n)\nClubbing\nof the fingers\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you."}

For most people with fistulas, the treatment of choice is to block the fistula during an\narteriogram\n(embolization).\nSome people may need surgery to remove the abnormal vessels and nearby lung tissue.\nWhen arteriovenous fistulas are caused by liver disease, the treatment is a\nliver transplant\n.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook for people with HHT is not as good as for those without HHT. For people without HHT, surgery to remove the abnormal vessels usually has a good outcome, and the condition is not likely to return.\nFor people with liver disease as a cause, the prognosis depends on the liver disease.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nBleeding in the lung\nStroke\ndue to blood clot that travels from the lungs to the arms, legs, or brain (paradoxical venous embolism)\nInfection in the brain or heart valve, especially in people with HHT\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you often have nosebleeds or difficulty breathing, especially if you also ha"}
