It is used to monitor\ndehydration\nand the amount of blood flow to tissue.\nHow the Test is Performed\nPressure is applied to the nail bed until it turns white. This indicates that the blood has been forced from the tissue under the nail. It is called blanching. Once the tissue has blanched, pressure is removed.\nWhile the person holds their hand above their heart, the health care provider measures the time it takes for blood to return to the tissue. Return of blood is indicated by the nail turning back to a pink color.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nRemove colored nail polish before this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThere will be minor pressure to the bed of your nail. This should not cause discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nTissues need oxygen to survive."}

This should not cause discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nTissues need oxygen to survive. Oxygen is carried to various parts of the body by the blood (vascular) system.\nThis test measures how well the vascular system works in your hands and feet -- the parts of your body that are farthest from the heart.\nNormal Results\nIf there is good blood flow to the nail bed, a pink color should return in less than 2 seconds after pressure is removed.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nBlanch times that are greater than 2 seconds may indicate:\nDehydration\nHypothermia\nLow blood pressure\nPeripheral vascular disease\n(PVD)\nShock\nAlternative Names\nNail blanch test; Capillary refill time\nImages\nNail blanch test\nReferences\nMcGrath JL, Bachmann DJ.
