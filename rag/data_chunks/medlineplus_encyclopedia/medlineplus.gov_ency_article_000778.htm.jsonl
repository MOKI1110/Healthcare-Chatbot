Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAcoustic neuroma\nAcoustic neuroma\nAn acoustic neuroma is a slow-growing tumor of the nerve that connects the ear to the brain. This nerve is called the vestibular cochlear nerve. It is behind the ear, right under the brain.\nAn acoustic neuroma is a benign tumor. This means that it does not spread to other parts of the body. However, it can damage several important nearby nerves as it grows.\nCauses\nAcoustic neuromas have been linked with the genetic disorder\nneurofibromatosis type 2\n(NF2).\nAcoustic neuromas are uncommon.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms vary, based on the size and location of the tumor."}

Because the tumor grows so slowly, symptoms most often start after age 30.\nCommon symptoms include:\nAbnormal feeling of movement (\nvertigo\n)\nHearing loss\nin the affected ear that makes it hard to hear conversations\nRinging (\ntinnitus\n) in the affected ear\nLess common symptoms include:\nDifficulty understanding speech\nDizziness\nHeadache\nLoss of balance\nNumbness\nin the face or  one ear\nPain in the face\nor one ear\nWeakness of the face or facial asymmetry\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider may suspect an acoustic neuroma based on your medical history, an exam of your nervous system, or tests.\nOften, the physical exam is normal when the tumor is diagnosed. Sometimes, the following signs may be present:\nDecreased feeling on one side of the face\nDrooping\non one side of the face\nUnsteady walk\nThe most useful test to identify an acoustic neuroma is an\nMRI of the brain\n."}

Other tests to diagnose the tumor and tell it apart from other causes of dizziness or vertigo include:\nHearing test\nTest of equilibrium and balance (\nelectronystagmography\n)\nTest of hearing and brainstem function (brainstem auditory evoked response)\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the size and location of the tumor, your age, and your overall health. You and your provider must decide whether to watch the tumor without treatment, use radiation treatment to stop it from growing, or try to remove it.\nMany acoustic neuromas are small and grow very slowly. Small tumors with few or no symptoms may be watched for changes, especially in older people."}

Depending on the type of surgery performed, hearing can sometimes be preserved.\nThe surgical technique to remove an acoustic neuroma is called microsurgery. A special microscope and small, precise instruments are used. This technique offers a higher chance of cure.\nStereotactic radiosurgery\nfocuses high-powered x-rays on a small area.

It may be used to slow down or stop the growth of tumors that are hard to remove with surgery. It may also be done to treat people who are unable to have surgery, such as older adults or people who are very sick.\nRemoving an acoustic neuroma can damage the acoustic or other nerves. This may cause loss of hearing or weakness in the face muscles. This damage is more likely to occur when the tumor is large.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAn acoustic neuroma is not cancer. The tumor does not spread to other parts of the body. However, it may continue to grow and press on structures in the skull.\nPeople with small, slow-growing tumors may not need treatment.\nHearing loss present before treatment is not likely to return after surgery or radiosurgery.  In cases  of  smaller tumors, hearing loss that occurs after surgery may return.\nMost people with small tumors will have no permanent weakness of the face after surgery."}
