Congenital means it is present at birth.\nAcquired tracheomalacia\nis a related topic.\nCauses\nTracheomalacia in a newborn occurs when the cartilage in the windpipe has not developed properly. Instead of being rigid, the walls of the trachea are floppy. Because the windpipe is the main airway, breathing problems begin soon after birth.\nCongenital tracheomalacia is very uncommon.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms can range from mild to severe. Symptoms may include:\nBreathing noises that may change with position and improve during sleep\nBreathing problems that get worse with coughing, crying, feeding, or upper respiratory infections (such as cold)\nHigh-pitched breathing\nRattling or noisy breaths\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam confirms the symptoms. A chest x-ray will be done to rule out other problems."}

A chest x-ray will be done to rule out other problems. The x-ray may show narrowing of the trachea when breathing in.\nA procedure called laryngoscopy provides the most reliable diagnosis. In this procedure, an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat doctor, or ENT doctor) will look at the structure of the airway and determine how severe the problem is.\nOther tests may include:\nAirway fluoroscopy -- a kind of x-ray that shows the images on a screen\nBarium swallow\nBronchoscopy -- camera down the throat to see the airways and lungs\nCT scan\nLung function tests\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\nTreatment\nMost infants respond well to humidified air, careful feedings, and antibiotics for infections. Babies with tracheomalacia must be closely monitored when they have respiratory infections.\nOften, the symptoms of tracheomalacia improve as the infant grows.\nRarely, surgery is needed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nCongenital tracheomalacia most often goes away on its own by the age of 18 to 24 months."}

As the cartilage gets stronger and the trachea grows, the noisy and difficult breathing slowly improves. People with tracheomalacia must be monitored closely when they have respiratory infections.\nPossible Complications\nBabies born with tracheomalacia may have other congenital abnormalities, such as heart defects, developmental delay, or gastroesophageal reflux.\nAspiration pneumonia can occur from inhaling food into the lungs or windpipe.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if your child has breathing difficulties or noisy breathing.
