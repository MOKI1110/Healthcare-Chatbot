The excess copper damages the liver and nervous system.\nCauses\nWilson disease is a rare inherited disorder. If both parents carry a non-working (variant) gene for Wilson disease, there is a 25% chance in each pregnancy that the child will have the disorder.\nWilson disease causes the body to take in and keep too much copper. The copper deposits in the liver, brain, kidneys, and eyes. This causes tissue damage, tissue death, and scarring. The affected organs stop working normally.\nThis condition is most common in eastern Europeans, Sicilians, and southern Italians, but it may occur in any group. Wilson disease symptoms typically appear in people under 40 years old."}

This is done by a procedure called chelation. Certain medicines are given that bind to copper and help remove it through the kidneys or gut. Treatment must be lifelong.\nThe following medicines may be used:\nPenicillamine (such as Cuprimine, Depen) binds to copper and leads to increased release of copper in the urine.\nTrientine (such as Syprine) binds (chelates) the copper and increases its release through the urine.\nZinc acetate (such as Galzin) blocks copper from being absorbed in the intestinal tract.\nVitamin E supplements may also be used.\nSometimes, medicines that chelate copper (such as penicillamine) can affect the function of the brain and nervous system (neurological function). Other medicines under investigation may bind copper without affecting neurological function.\nA low-copper diet may also be recommended. Foods to avoid include:\nChocolate\nDried fruit\nLiver\nMushrooms\nNuts\nShellfish\nYou may want to drink distilled water because some tap water flows through copper pipes. Avoid using copper cooking utensils.\nSymptoms may be managed with exercise or physical therapy."}
