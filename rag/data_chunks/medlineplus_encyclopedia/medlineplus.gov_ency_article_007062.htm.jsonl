A rise in this hormone signals the ovary to release the egg. This at-home test is often used by women to help predict when an egg release is likely. This is when pregnancy is most likely to occur. These kits can be bought at most drug stores.\nLH urine tests are not the same as at home fertility monitors. Fertility monitors are digital handheld devices. They predict ovulation based on electrolyte levels in saliva, LH levels in urine, or your basal body temperature. These devices can store ovulation information for several menstrual cycles.\nHow the Test is Performed\nOvulation prediction test kits most often come with five to seven sticks. You may need to test for several days to detect a surge in LH.\nThe specific time of month that you start testing depends on the length of your menstrual cycle."}

You may need to test for several days to detect a surge in LH.\nThe specific time of month that you start testing depends on the length of your menstrual cycle. For example, if your normal cycle is 28 days, you'll need to begin testing on day 11 (That is, the 11th day after you started your period.). If you have a different cycle interval than 28 days, talk to your health care provider about the timing of the test. In general, you should begin testing 3 to 5 days prior to the expected date of ovulation.\nYou will need to urinate on the test stick, or place the stick into urine that has been collected into a sterile container. The test stick will turn a certain color or display a positive sign if a surge is detected.\nA positive result means you should ovulate in the next 24 to 36 hours, but this may not be the case for all women. The booklet that is included in the kit will tell you how to read the results.\nYou may miss your surge if you miss a day of testing."}

You may also not be able to detect a surge if you have an irregular menstrual cycle.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nDO NOT drink large amounts of fluids before using the test.\nDrugs that can decrease LH levels include estrogens, progesterone, and testosterone. Estrogens and progesterone may be found in birth control pills and hormone replacement therapy.\nThe drug clomiphene citrate (Clomid) can increase LH levels. This drug is used to help trigger ovulation.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves normal urination. There is no pain or discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is most often done to determine when a woman will ovulate to assist her in getting pregnant."}

For women with a 28-day menstrual cycle, this release normally occurs between days 11 and 14.\nIf you have an irregular menstrual cycle, the kit can help you tell when you are ovulating.\nThe ovulation home test may also be used to help you adjust doses of certain medicines such as infertility drugs.\nNormal Results\nA positive result indicates an \"LH surge.\" This is a sign that ovulation may soon occur.\nRisks\nRarely, false positive results can occur. This means the test kit may falsely predict ovulation.\nConsiderations\nTalk to your provider if you are unable to detect a surge or do not become pregnant after using the kit for several months. You may need to see an infertility specialist.\nAlternative Names\nLuteinizing hormone urine test (home test); Ovulation prediction test; Ovulation predictor kit; Urinary LH immunoassays; At-home ovulation prediction test; LH urine test\nReferences\nJeelani R, Bluth MH.
