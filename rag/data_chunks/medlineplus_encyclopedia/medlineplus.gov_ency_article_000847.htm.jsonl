If either parent has NF1, each of their children has a 50% chance of having the disease.\nNF1 also appears in families with no history of the condition. In these cases, it is caused by a new gene change (variant or mutation) in the sperm or egg. NF1 is caused by problems with a gene for a protein called neurofibromin.\nSymptoms\nNF1 causes tissue along the nerves to grow uncontrollably. This growth can put pressure on affected nerves.\nIf the growths are in the skin, there can be cosmetic issues. If the growths are in other nerves or parts of the body, they can cause pain, severe nerve damage, and loss of function in the area the nerve affects."}

If the growths are in other nerves or parts of the body, they can cause pain, severe nerve damage, and loss of function in the area the nerve affects. Problems with feeling or movement can occur, depending on which nerves are affected.\nThe condition can be very different from person to person, even among people in the same family who have the same NF1 gene change.\n\"Coffee-with-milk\" (\ncafÃ© au lait\n) spots are the hallmark symptom of NF1. Many healthy people have one or two small cafÃ© au lait spots. However, adults who have six or more spots that are bigger than 1.5 cm in diameter (0.5 cm in children) could have NF1. In some people with the condition, these spots may be the only symptom.\nOther symptoms may include:\nTumors of the eye, such as\noptic glioma\nSeizures\nFreckles in the underarm or groin\nLarge, soft tumors called plexiform neurofibromas, which may have a dark color and may spread under the surface of the skin\nPain (from affected nerves)\nSmall, rubbery tumors of the skin called nodular neurofibromas\nExams and Tests\nA health care provider who treats NF1 will diagnose this condition."}

The drug selumetinib (Koselugo) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2020 for use in children with severe tumors.\nSome children with learning disorders may need special schooling.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with neurofibromatosis and their families can be found at:\nChildren's Tumor Foundation -\nwww.ctf.org\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf there are no complications, the life expectancy of people with NF1 is almost normal. With the right education, people with NF1 can live a normal life.\nAlthough mental impairment is generally mild, NF1 is a known cause of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Learning disabilities are a common problem.\nSome people are treated differently because they have hundreds of tumors on their skin.\nPeople with NF1 have an increased chance of developing severe tumors."}
