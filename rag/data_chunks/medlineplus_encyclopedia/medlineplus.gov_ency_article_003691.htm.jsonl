Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nParathyroid hormone-related protein blood test\nParathyroid hormone-related protein blood test\nThe parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTH-rP) test measures the level of a hormone in the blood, called parathyroid hormone-related protein.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample is needed\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to find out whether a\nhigh blood calcium level\nis caused by an increase in PTH-related protein.\nNormal Results\nNo detectable (or minimal) PTH-like protein is normal.\nWomen who are breastfeeding may have detectable PTH-related protein values.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens."}

Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn increased level of PTH-related protein with a high blood calcium level is usually caused by cancer.\nPTH-related protein can be produced by many different kinds of cancers, including those of the lung, breast, head, neck, bladder, and ovaries. In about two thirds of people with cancer who have a high calcium level, a high level of PTH-related protein is the cause. This condition is called humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy (HHM) or  paraneoplastic hypercalcemia.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other."}
