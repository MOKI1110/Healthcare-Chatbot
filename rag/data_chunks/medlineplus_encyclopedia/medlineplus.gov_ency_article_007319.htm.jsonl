Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAortopulmonary window\nAortopulmonary window\nAortopulmonary window is a rare heart defect in which there is a hole connecting the major artery taking blood from the heart to the body (the aorta) and the one taking blood from the heart to the lungs (pulmonary artery). The condition is congenital, which means it is present at birth.\nCauses\nNormally, blood flows through the pulmonary artery into the lungs, where it picks up oxygen. Then the blood travels back to the heart and is pumped to the aorta and the rest of the body.\nBabies with an aortopulmonary window have a hole in between the aorta and pulmonary artery. Because of this hole, blood from the aorta flows into the pulmonary artery, and as a result too much blood flows to the lungs. This causes high blood pressure in the lungs (a condition called pulmonary hypertension) and congestive heart failure."}

This causes high blood pressure in the lungs (a condition called pulmonary hypertension) and congestive heart failure. The bigger the defect, the more blood that is able to enter the pulmonary artery.\nThe condition occurs when the aorta and pulmonary artery do not divide normally as the baby develops in the womb.\nAortopulmonary window is very rare. It accounts for less than 1% of all congenital heart defects.\nThis condition can occur on its own or with other heart defects such as:\nTetralogy of Fallot\nPulmonary atresia\nTruncus arteriosus\nAtrial septal defect\nPatent ductus arteriosus\nInterrupted aortic arch\nFifty percent of people usually have no other heart defects.\nSymptoms\nIf the defect is small, it may not cause any symptoms."}

However, most defects are large.\nSymptoms can include:\nDelayed growth\nHeart failure\nIrritability\nPoor eating and lack of weight gain\nRapid breathing\nRapid heartbeat\nRespiratory infections\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will usually hear an abnormal heart sound (murmur) when listening to the child's heart with a stethoscope.\nThe provider may order tests such as:\nCardiac catheterization -- a thin tube inserted into blood vessels and/or arteries around the heart to view the heart and blood vessels and directly measure pressure in the heart and lungs.\nChest x-ray\n.\nEchocardiogram\n.\nMRI of the heart\n.\nTreatment\nThe condition usually requires open heart surgery to repair the defect. Surgery should be done as soon as possible after the diagnosis is made. In most cases, this is when the child is still a newborn.\nDuring the procedure, a heart-lung machine takes over for the child's heart."}

The surgeon opens the aorta and closes the defect with a patch made either from a piece of the sac that encloses the heart (the pericardium) or a man-made material.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSurgery to correct aortopulmonary window is successful in most cases. If the defect is treated quickly, the child should not have any lasting effects.\nPossible Complications\nDelaying treatment can lead to complications such as:\nCongestive heart failure\nPulmonary hypertension or\nEisenmenger syndrome\nDeath\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your child has symptoms of aortopulmonary window. The sooner this condition is diagnosed and treated, the better the child's prognosis.\nPrevention\nThere is no known way to prevent aortopulmonary window.\nAlternative Names\nAortopulmonary septal defect; Aortopulmonary fenestration; Congenital heart defect - aortopulmonary window; Birth defect heart - aortopulmonary window\nImages\nAortopulmonary window\nReferences\nBernstein D."}
