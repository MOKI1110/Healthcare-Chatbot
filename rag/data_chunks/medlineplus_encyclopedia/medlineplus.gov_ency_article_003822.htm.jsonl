The procedure is\nnoninvasive\n. The instruments do not directly touch the heart.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is done while you are resting.\nThe health care provider will inject a small amount of radioactive material called technetium into your vein. This substance attaches to red blood cells and passes through the heart.\nThe red blood cells inside the heart that carry the material form an image that a special camera can pick up. These scanners trace the substance as it moves through the heart area. The camera is timed with an\nelectrocardiogram\n. A computer then processes the images to make it appear as if the heart is moving.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be told not to eat or drink for several hours before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel a brief sting or pinch when the IV is inserted into your vein. Most often, a vein in the arm is used."}

Most often, a vein in the arm is used. You may have trouble staying still during the test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test will show how well the blood is pumping through different parts of the heart.\nNormal Results\nNormal results show that the heart squeezing function is normal. The test can check the overall squeezing strength of the heart (ejection fraction). A normal value is above 50% to 55%.\nThe test also can check the motion of different parts of the heart."}

If one part of the heart is moving poorly while the others move well, it may mean that there has been damage to that part of the heart.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be due to:\nBlockages in the coronary arteries (\ncoronary artery disease\n)\nHeart valve disease\nOther cardiac disorders that weaken the heart muscle (reduced pumping function)\nPast heart attack (\nmyocardial infarction\n)\nThe test may also be performed for:\nDilated cardiomyopathy\nHeart failure\nIdiopathic cardiomyopathy\nPeripartum cardiomyopathy\nIschemic cardiomyopathy\nTesting whether a medicine has affected heart function\nRisks\nNuclear imaging tests carry a very low risk.
