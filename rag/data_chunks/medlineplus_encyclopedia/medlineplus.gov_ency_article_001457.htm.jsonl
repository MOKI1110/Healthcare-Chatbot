It is passed down in families.\nCauses\nThere are 3 main types of EB. They are:\nDystrophic epidermolysis bullosa\nEpidermolysis bullosa simplex\nJunctional epidermolysis bullosa\nEB can vary in severity from minor to fatal. The minor forms cause blistering of the skin. The fatal forms affect other organs. Most types of this condition start at birth or soon after. It can be hard to identify the exact type of EB a person has, although specific genetic markers are now available for most.\nFamily history is a risk factor. The risk is higher if a parent has this condition.\nAnother rare type of EB is called epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. This form develops after birth."}

Other treatment will depend on how bad the condition is.\nHOME CARE\nFollow these guidelines at home:\nTake good care of your skin to prevent infections.\nFollow your provider's advice if blistered areas become crusted or raw. You might need regular whirlpool therapy and to apply antibiotic ointments to wound-like areas. Your provider will let you know if you need a bandage or a dressing, and if so, what type to use.\nYou may need to use oral steroid medicines for short periods of time if you have\nswallowing problems\n. You may also need to take medicine if you get a candida (yeast) infection in the mouth or throat.\nTake good care of your oral health and get regular dental check-ups."}

A nutritionist can help you with your diet.\nDo exercises a physical therapist shows you to help keep your joints and muscles mobile.\nSURGERY\nSurgery to treat this condition may include:\nSkin grafting\nin places where sores are deep\nDilation (widening) of the esophagus if there is a narrowing\nRepair of hand deformities\nRemoval of any\nsquamous cell carcinoma\n(a type of skin cancer) that develops\nOTHER TREATMENTS\nOther treatments for this condition may include:\nMedicines that suppress the immune system may be used for the autoimmune form of this condition.\nProtein and gene therapy and the use of the medicine interferon are being studied.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook depends on the severity of the illne"}

If you have a family history of EB and plan to have children, you may want to have genetic counseling.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling is recommended for prospective parents who have a family history of any form of EB.\nDuring pregnancy, a test called\nchorionic villus sampling\nmay be used to test the baby. For couples at high risk of having a child with EB, the test can be done as early as week 8 to 10 of pregnancy. Talk to your provider.\nTo prevent skin damage and blistering, wear padding around injury-prone areas such as the elbows, knees, ankles, and buttocks. Avoid contact sports.\nIf you have EB acquisita and are on steroids for longer than 1 month, you may need calcium and vitamin D supplements."}
