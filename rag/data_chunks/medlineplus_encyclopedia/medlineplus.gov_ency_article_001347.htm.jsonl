This disease causes skin sores, nerve damage, and muscle weakness that gets worse over time.\nCauses\nAlthough leprosy is due to an infection, it does not spread easily. It also takes a long time before symptoms appear, which makes it hard to know where or when someone caught the disease. Children are more likely than adults to get the disease.\nMost people who come in contact with the bacteria don't develop the disease. This is because their immune system is able to fight off the bacteria. Experts believe that the bacteria spread when a person breathes in tiny airborne droplets released when someone with leprosy coughs or sneezes. The bacteria may also be passed through contact with the nasal fluids of a person with leprosy. Leprosy has two common forms: tuberculoid and lepromatous. Both forms produce sores on the skin. However, the lepromatous form is more severe."}

Leprosy has two common forms: tuberculoid and lepromatous. Both forms produce sores on the skin. However, the lepromatous form is more severe. It causes large lumps and bumps (\nnodules\n).\nLeprosy is common in many countries worldwide including India, Brazil and Indonesia. It is also found in temperate, tropical, and subtropical climates. About 170 to 200 cases per year are diagnosed in the United States. Most new cases in the United States were in:\nFlorida\nCalifornia\nHawaii\nNew York\nOregon\nTexas\nDrug-resistant\nMycobacterium leprae\nand an increased numbers of cases worldwide have led to global concern for this disease.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nSkin lesions\nthat are lighter than your normal skin color\nLesions that have decreased sensation to touch, heat, or pain\nLesions that do not heal after several weeks to months\nMuscle weakness\nNumbness\nor lack of feeling in the hands, arms, feet, and legs\nExams and Tests\nTests that are done include:\nSkin lesion biopsy\nSkin scraping examination\nThe\nlepromin skin test\ncan be used to tell the two different forms of leprosy apart."}

This test is not used to diagnose the disease.\nTreatment\nSeveral antibiotics are used to kill the bacteria that cause the disease. These include:\nDapsone\nRifampin\nClofazimine\nFluoroquinolones\nMacrolides\nMinocycline\nMore than one antibiotic is often given together, and usually for months.\nAspirin, prednisone, or thalidomide may be used to control inflammation.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nDiagnosing the disease early is important. Early treatment helps:\nLimit the damage\nPrevent a person from spreading the disease\nReduce long-term complications\nPossible Complications\nHealth problems that may result from leprosy include:\nDisfigurement\nMuscle weakness\nPermanent nerve damage in the arms and legs\nLoss of sensation\nPeople with long-term leprosy may lose the use of their hands or feet."}

This is due to repeated injury because they lack feeling in those areas.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have symptoms of leprosy, especially if you have had contact with someone who has the disease. Cases of leprosy in the United States must be reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nPrevention\nPeople on long-term medicine become noninfectious. This means they do not transmit the organism that causes the disease.\nAlternative Names\nHansen disease\nReferences\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention website. Hansen's disease (leprosy).
