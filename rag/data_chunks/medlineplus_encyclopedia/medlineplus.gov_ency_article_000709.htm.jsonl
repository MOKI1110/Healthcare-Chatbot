In most people, a throbbing pain is felt only on one side of the head.\nCauses\nA migraine headache is caused by abnormal brain activity. This activity can be triggered by many things. But the exact chain of events remains unclear. Most medical experts believe the attack begins in the brain and involves nerve pathways and chemicals. The changes affect blood flow in the brain and surrounding tissues.\nMigraine headaches tend to first appear between the ages of 10 and 45. Sometimes, they begin earlier or later. Migraines may run in families. Migraines occur more often in women than men."}

Sometimes, they begin earlier or later. Migraines may run in families. Migraines occur more often in women than men. Some women, but not all, have fewer migraines when they are pregnant.\nMigraine attacks may be triggered by any of the following:\nCaffeine withdrawal\nChanges in hormone levels during a woman's menstrual cycle or with the use of birth control pills\nChanges in sleep patterns, such as not getting enough sleep\nDrinking alcohol\nExercise or other physical stress\nLoud noises or bright lights\nMissed meals\nOdors or perfumes\nSmoking or exposure to smoke\nStress and anxiety\nMigraines can also be triggered by certain foods."}

Only your health care provider can determine if your symptoms are due to a migraine disorder or other condition.\nSymptoms\nThere are two main types of migraines:\nMigraine with aura (classic migraine)\nMigraine without aura (common migraine)\nAn aura is a group of nervous system (neurologic) symptoms. These symptoms are considered a warning sign that a migraine is coming."}

Most often, the vision is affected and can include any or all of the following:\nTemporary blind spots or colored spots\nBlurred vision\nEye pain\nSeeing stars, zigzag lines, or flashing lights\nTunnel vision (only able to see objects close to the center of the field of view)\nOther nervous system symptoms include yawning, difficulty concentrating, nausea, trouble finding the right words, dizziness, weakness, numbness, and tingling. Some of these symptoms are much less common with migraine headaches. If you have any of these symptoms, your provider will likely order tests to find the cause.\nAn aura often occurs 10 to 15 minutes before the headache, but can occur just a few minutes to 24 hours before."}

Other medicines are taken at the first sign of a migraine attack. Over-the-counter (OTC) pain medicines, such as acetaminophen, naproxen, ibuprofen, or aspirin are often helpful when your migraine is mild. Be aware that:\nTaking pain medicines more than 3 days a week may lead to rebound headaches. These are headaches that keep coming back due to overuse of pain medicine.\nTaking too much acetaminophen can damage your liver.\nToo much naproxen, ibuprofen or aspirin can irritate your stomach or damage your kidneys.\nIf these treatments do not help, ask your provider about prescription medicines. These include nasal sprays, suppositories, or injections. The group of medicines most often used is called triptans.\nSome migraine medicines narrow the blood vessels."}

They may be used alone or along with the other medicines that treat the migraine itself.\nFeverfew is an herb that may be used for migraines. It can be effective for some people.
