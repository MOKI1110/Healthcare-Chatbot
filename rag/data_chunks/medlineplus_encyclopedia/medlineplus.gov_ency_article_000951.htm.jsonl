Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBarbiturate intoxication and overdose\nBarbiturate intoxication and overdose\nBarbiturates are medicines that cause relaxation and sleepiness. A barbiturate overdose occurs when someone takes more than the normal or recommended amount of this medicine. This can be by accident or on purpose. An overdose is life threatening.\nAt fairly low doses, barbiturates may make you seem drunk or intoxicated.\nBarbiturates are addictive. People who use them become physically dependent on them. Stopping them suddenly (withdrawal) can be life-threatening. Tolerance to the mood-altering effects of barbiturates develops rapidly with repeated use. But, tolerance to the lethal effects develops more slowly, and the risk of severe poisoning increases with continued use.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose."}
