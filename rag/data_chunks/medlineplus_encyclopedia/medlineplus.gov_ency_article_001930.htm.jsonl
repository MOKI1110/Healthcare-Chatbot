It opens up many options for a young person, but it also carries risks. Young people from ages 15 to 24 have the highest rate of auto-related deaths. The rate is the highest for young men.\nParents and teens should be aware of problem areas and take steps to avoid hazards.\nInformation\nMAKE A COMMITTMENT TO SAFETY\nTeens also need to commit to being safe and responsible drivers in order to improve the odds in their favor.\nReckless driving is still a danger to teens -- even with automobile safety features.\nAll new drivers should take a driver's education course. These courses can reduce the risk of crashes.\nDrivers and passengers should use automobile safety features at all times. These include seat belts, shoulder straps, and headrests. Only drive cars that have air bags, padded dashes, safety glass, collapsible steering columns, and anti-lock brakes.\nAuto accidents are also a leading cause of death in infants and children."}

Do not use cell phones for talking, texting, or email when you are driving.\nMobile phones should be turned off when driving so you are not tempted to make calls, send or read texts, or answer the phone.\nIf phones are left on for emergency use, pull off of the road before answering or texting.\nOther tips include:\nAvoid putting on makeup while driving. Even when stopped at a light or stop sign, it can be dangerous.\nFinish eating before starting your car and driving.\nDriving with friends can lead to accidents.\nTeens are safer driving alone or with family."}

Do not rush. It is safer to be late.\nAvoid driving at nighttime. Your driving skills and reflexes are just developing during the first months of driving. Darkness adds an extra factor to cope with.\nWhen drowsy, stop driving until fully alert. Sleepiness may cause more accidents than alcohol.\nNever drink and drive.\nDrinking slows reflexes and hurts judgment. These effects happen to anyone who drinks. So, NEVER drink and drive."}
