Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nVirtual colonoscopy\nVirtual colonoscopy\nA virtual colonoscopy (VC) is an imaging or x-ray test that looks for\ncancer\n,\npolyps\n, or other disease in the large intestine (colon). The medical name of this test is CT colonography.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA VC is different from a regular\ncolonoscopy\n. A regular colonoscopy uses a long, lighted tool called a colonoscope that is inserted into the rectum and large intestine.\nA VC is done in the radiology department of a hospital or medical center. No sedatives are needed and no colonoscope is used.\nThe exam is done as follows:\nYou lie on your left side on a narrow table that is connected to a\nCT\n(computerized tomography) machine.\nYour knees are drawn up toward your chest.\nA small, flexible tube is inserted into the rectum. Air or carbon dioxide is pumped through the tube to make the colon bigger and easier to see.\nYou then lie on your back.\nThe table slides into a large tunnel in the CT machine."}

Air or carbon dioxide is pumped through the tube to make the colon bigger and easier to see.\nYou then lie on your back.\nThe table slides into a large tunnel in the CT machine. X-rays of your colon are taken.\nX-rays are also taken while you lie on your stomach.\nYou must stay very still during this procedure, because movement can blur the x-rays. You may be asked to hold your breath briefly while each x-ray is taken.\nA computer combines all the images to form three-dimensional pictures of the colon. The radiologist can view the images on a video monitor.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour bowels need to be completely empty and clean for the exam. A problem in your large intestine that needs to be treated may be missed if your intestines are not cleaned out.\nYour health care provider will give you the steps for cleansing your bowel. This is called bowel preparation. Steps may include:\nUsing enemas\nNot eating solid foods for 1 to 3 days before the test.  Typically you are on clear liquids for 1 day before the test.\nTaking laxatives\nYou need to drink plenty of clear liquids for 1 to 3 days before the test."}

Examples of clear liquids are:\nClear coffee or tea\nFat-free bouillon or broth\nGelatin\nSports drinks\nStrained fruit juices\nWater\nKeep taking your medicines unless your provider tells you otherwise.\nYou will need to stop taking iron pills or liquids a few days before the test, unless your provider tells you it is OK to continue. Iron can make your stool dark black. This makes it harder for the radiologist to view inside your bowel.\nCT scanners are very sensitive to metals. Do not wear jewelry the day of your exam. You will be asked to change out of your street clothes and wear a hospital gown for the procedure.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe x-rays are painless."}

Pumping air into the colon may cause cramping or gas pains.\nAfter the exam:\nYou may feel bloated and have mild abdominal cramping and pass a lot of gas.\nYou should be able to return to your regular activities.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nVC may be done for the following reasons:\nScreening for colorectal cancer in average risk people (should be done every 5 years)\nIn uncommon situations when a colonoscopy that cannot be performed or completed safely\nYour provider may recommend a regular colonoscopy instead of a VC. One reason is that VC does not allow removing tissue samples or polyps. It does not allow treatment of any problems discovered. Another reason is that CT scans require radiation, which a colonoscopy does not."}

This is particularly true if virtual colonoscopy is to be performed multiple times at the recommended every 5 years.\nColonoscopy is the preferred test in people who have had colon polyps, colon cancer, or are at higher risk of these because of other conditions.\nNormal Results\nNormal findings are images that show a healthy intestinal tract.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal test results may mean any of the following:\nColorectal cancer\nAbnormal pouches on the lining of the intestines, called\ndiverticulosis\nColitis\n(a swollen and inflamed intestine) due to\nCrohn disease\n,\nulcerative colitis\n, infection, or lack of blood flow\nLower gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding\nPolyps\nTumor\nA regular colonoscopy may be done (on a different day) after a VC if:\nNo cause for bleeding or other symptoms were found."}

This is not as easy with a regular colonoscopy.\nVC does not require sedation. You can usually go back to your normal activities right away after the test. A regular colonoscopy uses sedation and often the loss of a work day.\nVC using CT scanners expose you to radiation.\nRegular colonoscopy has a small risk for bowel perforation (creating a small tear). There is almost no such risk from a VC.\nVC is often not able to detect polyps smaller than 10 millimeters (mm)."}
