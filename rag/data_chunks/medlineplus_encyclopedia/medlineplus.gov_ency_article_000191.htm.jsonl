Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCoarctation of the aorta\nCoarctation of the aorta\nThe aorta is a larger artery that carries blood from the heart to the vessels that supply the rest of the body with blood. If part of the aorta is narrowed, it is hard for blood to pass through the artery. This is called coarctation of the aorta. It is a type of birth defect.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of coarctation of the aorta is unknown. It results from abnormalities in development of the aorta prior to birth.\nAortic coarctation is more common in people with certain genetic disorders, such as\nTurner syndrome\n.\nAortic coarctation is one of the more common heart conditions that are present at birth (congenital heart defects). This abnormality accounts for about 5% of all congenital heart defects. It is most often diagnosed in children or adults under age 40.\nPeople who have this problem with their aorta may also have a weak area in the wall of blood vessels in their brain. This weakness causes the blood vessel to bulge or balloon out. This is known as a berry aneurysm."}

This weakness causes the blood vessel to bulge or balloon out. This is known as a berry aneurysm. These may rupture causing a certain type of stroke (due to bleeding).\nCoarctation of the aorta may be seen with other congenital heart defects, such as:\nBicuspid aortic valve\nAortic stenosis\nVentricular septal defect\nPatent ductus arteriosus\nSymptoms\nSymptoms depend on how much blood can flow through the artery. Other heart defects may also play a role.\nAbout half of newborns with this problem will have symptoms in the first few days of life. These can include breathing fast, problems eating, increased irritability, and increased sleepiness or becoming poorly responsive. In severe cases, the infant may develop heart failure and shock.\nIn milder cases, symptoms may not develop until the child has reached adolescence."}

Sometimes, the femoral pulse may not be able to be felt at all.\nThe blood pressure in the legs is usually less than in the arms. Blood pressure is usually higher in the arms after infancy.\nThe provider will use a stethoscope to listen to the heart and check for murmurs. People with aortic coarctation often have a harsh-sounding murmur that can be heard underneath the left collar bone or from the back."}

Other types of murmurs may also be present.\nCoarctation is often discovered during a newborn's first exam or a well-baby exam. Taking the pulse in an infant is an important part of the exam, because there may not be any other symptoms until the child is older.\nTests to diagnose this condition may include:\nCardiac catheterization\nand\naortography\nChest x-ray\nEchocardiography\nis the most common test to diagnose this condition, and it may also be used to monitor the person after surgery\nHeart CT\nmay be needed in older children\nMRI\nor\nMR angiography\nof the chest may be needed in older children\nBoth Doppler ultrasound and catheterization can be used to see if there are any differences in blood pressure in different areas of the aorta.\nTreatment\nMost newborns with symptoms will have surgery either right after birth or soon afterward. They will first  receive medicines to stabilize them.\nChildren who are diagnosed when they are older will also need surgery."}

In most cases, the symptoms are not as severe, so more time can be taken to plan for surgery.\nDuring surgery, the narrowed part of the aorta will be removed or opened.\nIf the problem area is small, the two free ends of the aorta may be reconnected. This is called an end-to-end\nanastomosis\n.\nIf a large part of the aorta is removed, a graft or one of the patient's own arteries may be used to fill the gap. The\ngraft\nmay be man-made or be taken from a cadaver.\nSometimes, doctors will try to stretch open the narrowed part of the aorta by using a balloon that is widened inside the blood vessel. This type of procedure is called a\nballoon angioplasty\n. It may be done instead of surgery, but it has a higher rate of failure.\nOlder children usually need medicines to treat high blood pressure after surgery.
