Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCranial mononeuropathy III\nCranial mononeuropathy III\nCranial mononeuropathy III is a nerve disorder. It affects the function of the third cranial nerve. As a result, the person may have double vision and eyelid drooping.\nCauses\nMononeuropathy\nmeans that only one nerve is affected. This disorder affects the third cranial nerve in the skull. This is one of the cranial nerves that control eye movement. Causes may include:\nBrain aneurysm\nInfections\nAbnormal blood vessels (vascular malformations)\nCavernous sinus thrombosis\nTissue damage from loss of blood flow (infarction)\nTrauma (from head injury or caused accidentally during surgery)\nTumors or other growths (especially tumors at the base of the brain and pituitary gland)\nRarely, third nerve palsy can be present at birth (congenital)\nIncreased brain pressure (brain herniation)\nIn rare cases, people with\nmigraine\nheadaches have a temporary problem with the oculomotor nerve. This is probably due to a spasm of the blood vessels."}

Decreasing alertness is serious, because it could be a sign of brain damage or impending death.\nExams and Tests\nAn eye examination may show:\nEnlarged (dilated) pupil of the affected eye\nEye movement abnormalities\nEyes that are not aligned\nDrooping eye lid\nYour health care provider will do a complete examination to find out if other parts of the nervous system are affected."}

Treating the cause (if it can be found) may relieve the symptoms.\nOther treatments to relieve symptoms may include:\nCorticosteroid medicines to reduce swelling and relieve pressure on the nerve (when caused by a tumor or injury)\nEye patch or glasses with prisms to reduce double vision\nPain medicines\nSurgery to treat eyelid drooping or eyes that are not aligned\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSome people will respond to treatment."}
