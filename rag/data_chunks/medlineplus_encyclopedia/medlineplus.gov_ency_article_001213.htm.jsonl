The thyroid gland is located in the front of your lower neck.\nCauses\nThyroid cancer can occur in people of any age.\nRadiation to the thyroid increases the risk of developing thyroid cancer. Exposure may occur from:\nRadiation therapy\nto the neck (especially in childhood)\nRadiation exposure from nuclear plant disasters\nOther risk factors are a family history of thyroid cancer and chronic\ngoiter\n(enlarged thyroid). Being overweight or having obesity may be a risk factor for papillary carcinoma of the thyroid.\nThere are several types of thyroid cancer:\nAnaplastic carcinoma\n(also called giant and spindle cell cancer) is the most dangerous form of thyroid cancer. It is rare, and spreads quickly.\nFollicular carcinoma is more likely to come back and spread.\nMedullary carcinoma\nis a cancer of non-thyroid hormone-producing cells that are normally present in the thyroid gland."}

This form of thyroid cancer tends to occur in families.\nPapillary carcinoma\nis the most common type, and it usually affects women of childbearing age. It spreads slowly and is the least dangerous type of thyroid cancer.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms vary depending on the type of thyroid cancer, but may include:\nCough\nDifficulty swallowing\nEnlargement of the thyroid gland\nHoarseness or changing voice\nNeck swelling\nThyroid lump (nodule)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

This may reveal a lump in your thyroid or swollen lymph nodes in your neck.\nThe following tests may be done:\nCalcitonin\nblood test to check for medullary thyroid cancer\nAn examination of the airway with a fiberoptic scope (\nlaryngoscopy\n) may show a paralyzed vocal cord.\nThyroid biopsy, which may include genetic testing of the cells obtained in the biopsy\nThyroid scan\nTSH\n, free\nT4\n(blood tests for thyroid function)\nUltrasound of the thyroid\nand the lymph nodes of the neck\nCT scan\nof the neck (to determine the extent of the cancerous mass)\nPET scan\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the type of thyroid cancer. Treatment of most thyroid cancer types is effective if diagnosed early.\nSurgery is most often the initial treatment. All or part of the\nthyroid gland may be removed\n. If your provider suspects that the cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the neck, these will also be removed."}

All or part of the\nthyroid gland may be removed\n. If your provider suspects that the cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the neck, these will also be removed. If some of your thyroid gland remains, you will need follow-up ultrasound and possibly other studies to detect any regrowth of thyroid cancer.\nRadiation therapy may be done with or without surgery. It may be performed by:\nTaking radioactive iodine by mouth\nAiming external beam (x-ray) radiation at the thyroid\nAfter treatment for thyroid cancer, you must take thyroid hormone pills for the rest of your life. The dosage is usually slightly higher than what your body needs. This helps keep the cancer from coming back. The pills also replace the thyroid hormone your body needs to function normally.\nIf the cancer does not respond to surgery or radiation, and has spread to other parts of the body,\nchemotherapy\nor\ntargeted therapy\nmay be used. These are only needed by a small number of people.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\ncancer support group\n."}
