It is the last stage of chronic liver disease.\nCauses\nCirrhosis is most often the end result of chronic liver damage caused by long-term (chronic) liver disease. Common causes of chronic liver disease in the United States are:\nHepatitis B\nor\nhepatitis C\ninfection.\nAlcohol overuse\n.\nBuildup of fat in the liver that is NOT caused by drinking too much alcohol\n(called metabolic associated steatotic liver disease [MASLD] or metabolic associated steatohepatitis [MASH]). It is closely related to being overweight, having high blood pressure, diabetes or pre-diabetes, and high cholesterol.\nLess common causes of cirrhosis include:\nWhen immune cells mistake the liver's normal cells for harmful invaders and attack them\n, called autoimmune hepatitis (AH)\nBile duct disorders\nSome medicines\nLiver diseases passed down in families\nSymptoms\nThere may be no symptoms, or symptoms may come on slowly, depending on how well the liver is working."}
