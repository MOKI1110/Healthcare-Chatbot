Salt contains sodium.\nFunction\nThe body uses sodium to control blood pressure and blood volume. Your body also needs sodium for your muscles and nerves to work properly.\nFood Sources\nSodium occurs naturally in most foods. The most common form of sodium is sodium chloride, which is table salt. Milk, beets, and celery also naturally contain sodium. Drinking water also contains sodium, but the amount depends on the source.\nSodium is also added to many food products. Some of these added forms are monosodium glutamate (MSG), sodium nitrite, sodium saccharin, baking soda (sodium bicarbonate), and sodium benzoate. These are in items such as Worcestershire sauce, soy sauce, onion salt, garlic salt, and bouillon cubes.\nProcessed meats like bacon, sausage, and ham, along with canned soups and vegetables also contain added sodium. Processed baked goods such as packaged cookies, snack cakes, and doughnuts are also often high in sodium."}

Processed baked goods such as packaged cookies, snack cakes, and doughnuts are also often high in sodium. Fast foods are generally very high in sodium.\nSide Effects\nToo much sodium in the diet may lead to:\nHigh blood pressure in some people\nA serious buildup of fluid in people with\nheart failure\n,\ncirrhosis\nof the liver, or kidney disease\nRecommendations\nSodium in the diet (called dietary sodium) is measured in milligrams (mg). Table salt is 40% sodium. One teaspoon (5 milliliters) of table salt contains 2,300 mg of sodium.\nHealthy adults should limit sodium intake to 2,300 mg per day. Adults with high blood pressure should have no more than 1,500 mg per day. Those with congestive heart failure, liver cirrhosis, and kidney disease may need much lower amounts.\nThere are no specific sodium restrictions for infants, children, and teens. However, certain levels of daily adequate intake for healthy growth have been established."}
