Because it's impossible to know exactly when conception occurs,\ngestational age\nis measured from the first day of the mother's last menstrual cycle to the current date. It is measured in weeks.\nThis means that during weeks 1 and 2 of pregnancy, a woman is not yet pregnant. This is when your body is preparing for a baby. A normal gestation lasts anywhere from 37 to 42 weeks.\nWeek 1 to 2\nThe first week of pregnancy starts with the first day of a woman's menstrual period. She is not yet pregnant.\nDuring the end of the second week, an egg is released from an ovary. This is when you are most likely to conceive if you have unprotected intercourse.\nWeek 3\nDuring intercourse, sperm enters the vagina after the man ejaculates."}

This is when you are most likely to conceive if you have unprotected intercourse.\nWeek 3\nDuring intercourse, sperm enters the vagina after the man ejaculates. The strongest sperm will travel through the cervix (the opening of the womb, or uterus), and into the fallopian tubes.\nA single sperm and the mother's egg cell meet in the fallopian tube. When the single sperm enters the egg, conception occurs. The combined sperm and egg is called a zygote.\nThe zygote contains all of the genetic information (DNA) needed to become a baby. Half the DNA comes from the mother's egg and half from the father's sperm.\nThe zygote spends the next few days traveling down the fallopian tube. During this time, it divides to form a ball of cells called a blastocyst.\nA blastocyst is made up of an inner group of cells with an outer shell.\nThe inner group of cells will become the embryo."}

The embryo is what will develop into your baby.\nThe outer group of cells will become structures, called membranes, which nourish and protect the embryo.\nWeek 4\nOnce the blastocyst reaches the uterus, it buries itself in the uterine wall.\nAt this point in the mother's menstrual cycle, the lining of the uterus is thick with blood and ready to support a baby.\nThe blastocyst sticks tightly to the wall of the uterus and receives nourishment from the mother's blood.\nWatch this video about:\nCell division\nWeek 5\nWeek 5 is the start of the \"embryonic period.\" This is when all the baby's major systems and structures develop.\nThe embryo's cells multiply and start to take on specific functions."}
