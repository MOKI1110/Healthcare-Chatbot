This is the space between the lining of the outside of the lungs (pleura) and the wall of the chest. When fluid collects in the pleural space, the condition is called\npleural effusion\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA procedure called\nthoracentesis\nis used to get a sample of pleural fluid. Your health care provider tests the sample to look for:\nCancerous (malignant) cells\nOther types of cells (for example blood cells)\nLevels of glucose, protein and other chemicals\nBacteria, fungi, mycobacteria, viruses, and other germs that can cause infections\nInflammation\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed before the test."}

An\nultrasound\n,\nCT scan\n, or\nchest x-ray\nwill be performed before and after the test.\nDo not cough, breathe deeply, or move during the test to avoid injury to the lung.\nTell your provider if you take medicines to thin the blood.\nHow the Test will Feel\nFor thoracentesis, you sit on the edge of a chair or bed with your head and arms resting on a table. Your provider cleans your skin around the insertion site. Numbing medicine (anesthetic) is injected into your skin.\nA needle is placed through the skin and muscles of your chest wall into the pleural space. As fluid drains into a collection bottle, you may cough a bit. This is because your lung re-expands to fill the space where fluid had been."}

This sensation may last for a few hours after the test.\nDuring the test, tell your provider if you have sharp chest pain or shortness of breath.\nUltrasound is often used to decide where to insert the needle and to get a better view of the fluid in your chest.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is performed to determine the cause of a pleural effusion. It is also done to relieve the shortness of breath that a large pleural effusion can cause.\nNormal Results\nNormally the pleural space contains less than 20 milliliters (4 teaspoons) of clear, yellowish (serous) fluid.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may indicate possible causes of pleural effusion, such as:\nCancer\nCirrhosis\nHeart failure\nInfection\nSevere\nmalnutrition\nVery low protein (albumin) in the blood\nTrauma\nAbnormal connections between the pleural space and other organs (for example, the esophagus)\nIf your provider suspects an infection, a\nculture of the fluid\nis done to check for bacteria and other microbes.\nThe test ma"}
