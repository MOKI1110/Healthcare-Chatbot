The faster a person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\nSwallowing this type of poison can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Extensive damage to the mouth, throat, eyes, lungs, esophagus, nose, and stomach are possible.\nThe outcome depends on the extent of this damage. Damage continues to occur to the esophagus and stomach for several weeks after the poison was swallowed. Perforation (holes) may develop in these organs, leading to serious bleeding and infection. Death may occur up to a month later. Treatment may require removal of part of the esophagus and stomach.\nReferences\nHoyte C. Caustics.
