It may also occur on the:\nCheek lining\nFloor of the mouth\nGums (gingiva)\nRoof of the mouth (palate)\nMost oral cancers are a type called squamous cell carcinoma. These cancers tend to spread quickly.\nSmoking and other tobacco use\nare linked to most cases of oral cancer. Heavy\nalcohol use\nalso increases the risk for oral cancer.\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) infection (the same virus that causes\ngenital warts\n) account for a larger number of oral cancers than in the past."}

One type of HPV, type 16 or HPV-16, is much more commonly associated with almost all oral cancers.\nOther factors that may increase the risk for oral cancer include:\nLong-term (chronic) rubbing, such as from rough teeth, dentures, or fillings\nTaking medicines (immunosuppressants) that weaken the immune system\nPoor dental and oral hygiene\nSome oral cancers begin as a white plaque (\nleukoplakia\n) or as a\nmouth ulcer\n.\nMen develop oral cancer twice as often as women do."}

The amount of tissue and the number of lymph nodes that are removed depend on how far the cancer has spread.\nSurgery may be used together with\nradiation therapy\nand\nchemotherapy\nfor larger tumors.\nOther treatments may include:\nTargeted therapy\n, which uses drugs to stop cancer from growing and spreading .\nImmunotherapy\n, which uses substances made by the body or in a lab to help the immune system work harder or in a more targeted way to fight cancer .\nDepending on what type of treatment you require, supportive treatments that may be needed include:\nSpeech therapy.\nTherapy to help with\nchewing and swallowing\n.\nLearning to eat\nenough protein and calories to keep your weight up\n."}

Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAbout one half of people with oral cancer will live more than 5 years after they are diagnosed and treated. If the cancer is found early, before it has spread to other tissues, the cure rate ranges from 59% to 94% depending on where the cancer is located. More than half of oral cancers have spread when the cancer is detected. Most have spread to the throat or neck.\nCancers that test positive for HPV appear to respond better to treatment and may have a better outlook."}
