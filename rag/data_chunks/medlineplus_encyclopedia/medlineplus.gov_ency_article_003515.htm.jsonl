It measures substances (proteins), called\nantibodies\n, which your body may produce if you have been infected with the bacteria that cause syphilis.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is most often done using a blood sample. It can also be done using a sample of\nspinal fluid\n. This article discusses the blood test.\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people may feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is used to screen for syphilis. The bacteria that cause syphilis is called\nTreponema pallidum\n.\nYour health care provider may order this test if you have signs and symptoms of a sexually transmitted illness (STI).\nSyphilis screening is a routine part of prenatal care during pregnancy.\nThis test is similar to the\nrapid plasma reagin\n(RPR) test.\nNormal Results\nA negative test is normal."}

It means that no antibodies to syphilis have been seen in your blood sample.\nThe screening test is most likely to be positive in the secondary and latent stages of syphilis. This test may give a false-negative result during early- and late-stage syphilis. This test must be confirmed with another blood test to make the diagnosis of syphilis.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA positive test result means you may have syphilis. If the test is positive, the next step is to confirm the results with an\nFTA-ABS\ntest, which is a more specific syphilis test.\nThe VDRL test's ability to detect syphilis depends on the stage of the disease."}

The test's sensitivity to detect syphilis nears 100% during the secondary and latent stages; it is less sensitive during the earlier and later stages.\nSome conditions may cause a false-positive test, including:\nHIV/AIDS\nLyme disease\nCertain types of pneumonia\nMalaria\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\nThe body does not always produce antibodies specifically in response to the syphilis bacteria, so this test is not always accurate.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.
