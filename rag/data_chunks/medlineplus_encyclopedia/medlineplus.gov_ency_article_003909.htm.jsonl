Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTesticular self-exam\nTesticular self-exam\nTesticular self-exam is an examination of the testicles that you do on yourself.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe testicles (also called the testes) are the male reproductive organs that produce sperm and the hormone testosterone. They are located in the scrotum under the penis.\nYou can do this test during or after a shower. This way, the scrotal skin is warm and relaxed. It is best to do the test while standing.\nGently feel your scrotal sac to locate a testicle.\nUse one hand to stabilize the testicle. Use your fingers and thumb of the other hand to firmly but gently feel the testicle. Feel the entire surface.\nCheck the other testicle in the same way.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA testicular self-exam is done to check for\ntesticular cancer\n.\nTesticles have blood vessels and other structures that can make the exam confusing."}

If you notice any lumps or changes in a testicle, contact your health care provider right away.\nYour provider may recommend that you do a testicular self-exam every month if you have any of the following risk factors:\nFamily history of testicular cancer\nPast testicular tumor\nUndescended testicle\nHowever, if a man has no risk factors or symptoms, experts do not know if doing testicular self-exam lowers the chance of dying of this cancer. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against testicular exams in men with no symptoms and no risk factors for testicular cancer.\nNormal Results\nEach testicle should feel firm, but not rock hard."}

One testicle may be lower or slightly larger than the other.\nTalk to your provider if you have questions.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf you find a small, hard lump (like a pea), have an enlarged testicle, or notice any other differences that do not seem normal, see your provider right away.\nContact your provider if:\nYou cannot find one or both testicles. The testicles may not have descended properly in the scrotum.\nThere is a soft collection of thin tubes above the testicle. This may be a collection of widened veins (\nvaricocele\n).\nYou have pain or swelling in the scrotum. This may be an infection or a fluid-filled sac (\nhydrocele\n) causing a blockage of blood flow to the area. It may be difficult to feel the testicle if there is fluid in the scrotum.\nSudden, severe (acute) pain in the scrotum or testicle that lasts for more than a few minutes is an emergency."}

Most testicular cancers are very treatable.
