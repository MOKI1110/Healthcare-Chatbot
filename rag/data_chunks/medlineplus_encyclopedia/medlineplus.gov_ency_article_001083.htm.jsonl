Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHydrocarbon pneumonia\nHydrocarbon pneumonia\nHydrocarbon pneumonia is caused by drinking or breathing in\ngasoline\n,\nkerosene\n,\nfurniture polish\n, paint thinner, or other oily materials or solvents. Many of these hydrocarbons are thin liquids. If you drank one of these hydrocarbons, it is likely some will slip down your windpipe and into your lungs (aspiration) rather than going down your food pipe (esophagus) and into your stomach. This can easily happen if you try to siphon gas out of a gas tank with a hose and your mouth.\nHydrocarbons may be inhaled intentionally for intoxication, especially by adolescents."}

The minimum observation period after inhalation of a hydrocarbon is 6 hours.\nPeople with moderate and severe symptoms are usually admitted to the hospital, occasionally to an intensive care unit (ICU).\nHospital treatment will likely include continuing some or all of the interventions started in the emergency department. Treatment is mainly supportive to treat any symptoms as there is no antidote that treats hydrocarbon pneumonia.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost children who drink or inhale hydrocarbon products and develop\nchemical pneumonitis\n(lung inflammation without infection) recover fully following treatment. Highly toxic hydrocarbons may rapidly cause\nrespiratory\nfailure and death."}
