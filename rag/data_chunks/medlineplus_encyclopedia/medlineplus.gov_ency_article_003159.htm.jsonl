Ask your child to urinate right after the bath.\nUse only plain warm water. DO NOT add baking soda, colloidal oats or oat extracts, or anything else to the bathwater.\nDO NOT let soap float in the bathwater. If you need to shampoo their hair, do so at the end of the bath.\nTeach your child to keep the genital area clean and dry.

Doing so will help prevent small balls of tissue from breaking off.\nMove toilet tissue from front to back (vagina to anus) after urinating or having a bowel movement.\nYour child should:\nWear cotton panties."}
