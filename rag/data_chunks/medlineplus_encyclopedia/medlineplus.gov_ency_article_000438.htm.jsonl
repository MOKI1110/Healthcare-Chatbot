The top part of the arm bone (humerus) forms a joint with the shoulder blade (scapula). The rotator cuff holds the head of the humerus into the scapula. It also controls movement of the shoulder joint.\nTENDINITIS\nThe tendons of the rotator cuff pass underneath a bony area on their way to attaching the top part of the arm bone. When these tendons become inflamed, they can become more inflamed over this area during shoulder movements. Sometimes, a bone spur narrows the space even more.\nRotator cuff tendinitis is also called impingement syndrome."}

Sometimes, a bone spur narrows the space even more.\nRotator cuff tendinitis is also called impingement syndrome. Causes of this condition include:\nKeeping the arm in the same position for long periods, such as doing computer work or hairstyling\nSleeping on the same arm each night\nPlaying sports requiring the arm to be moved overhead repeatedly such as in tennis, baseball (particularly pitching), swimming, and lifting weights overhead\nWorking with the arm overhead for many hours or days, such as in painting and carpentry\nPoor posture over many years\nAging\nRotator cuff tears\nTEARS\nRotator cuff tears may occur in two ways:\nA sudden acute tear may happen when you fall on your arm while it is stretched out. Or, it can occur after a sudden, jerking motion when you try to lift something heavy.\nA chronic tear of the rotator cuff tendon occurs slowly over time. It is more likely when you have chronic tendinitis or impingement syndrome."}

It is more likely when you have chronic tendinitis or impingement syndrome. At some point, the tendon wears down and tears.\nThere are two types of rotator cuff tears:\nA partial tear occurs when a tear does not completely sever the attachments to the bone.\nA complete, full thickness tear means that the tear goes all the way through the tendon. It may be as small as a pinpoint, or the tear may involve the entire tendon. With complete tears, the tendon has come off (detached) from where it was attached to the bone. It can also be retracted and be pulled away from the bone. This kind of tear does not heal on its own.\nSymptoms\nTENDINITIS\nEarly on, pain is mild and occurs with overhead activities and lifting your arm to the side. Activities include brushing your hair, reaching for objects on shelves, or playing an overhead sport.\nPain is more likely in the front of the shoulder and may travel to the side of the arm. The pain always stops before the elbow."}

The pain always stops before the elbow. If the pain goes down the arm to the elbow and hand, this may indicate a pinched nerve in the neck.\nThere may also be pain when you lower the shoulder from a raised position.\nOver time, there may be pain at rest or at night, such as when lying on the affected shoulder. You may have weakness and loss of motion when raising the arm above your head. Your shoulder can feel stiff with lifting or movement. It may become more difficult to place the arm behind your back.\nROTATOR CUFF TEARS\nThe pain with a sudden tear after a fall or injury is usually intense. Right after the injury, you will likely have weakness of the shoulder and arm. It may be hard to move your shoulder or raise your arm above the shoulder. You may also feel snapping when trying to move the arm.\nWith a chronic tear, you often do not notice when it began. This is because symptoms of pain, weakness, and stiffness or loss of motion worsen slowly over time.\nRotator cuff tendon tears often cause pain at night."}

During the day, the pain is more tolerable, and usually only hurts with certain movements, such as overhead or reaching toward the back.\nOver time, the symptoms become much worse and are not relieved by medicines, rest, or exercise.\nExams and Tests\nA physical examination may reveal tenderness over the shoulder. Pain may occur when the shoulder is raised overhead. There is often weakness of the shoulder when it is placed in certain positions.\nX-rays of the shoulder may show a bone spur or change in the position of the shoulder. It can also check for other causes of shoulder pain, such as arthritis.\nYour health care provider may order other tests:\nAn\nultrasound test\nuses sound waves to create an image of the shoulder joint. It can show a tear in the rotator cuff.\nMRI of the shoulder\nmay show swelling or a tear in the rotator cuff.\nWith a joint x-ray (\narthrogram\n), the provider injects contrast material (dye) into the shoulder joint."}

This may take weeks or months. Some people may need to change or reduce the amount of time they play certain sports to remain pain-free.\nWith rotator cuff tears, treatment often relieves symptoms. But outcome depends on the size of the tear and how long the tear has been present, the person's age, and how active the person was before the injury.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider for an appointment if you have ongoing  shoulder pain. Also contact your provider if symptoms do not improve with treatment.\nPrevention\nAvoid repetitive overhead movements. Exercises to strengthen shoulder and arm muscles can also help prevent rotator cuff problems."}
