If your body makes too much of this hormone, you may have unwanted hair growth.\nIn most cases, the exact cause is never known. The condition often runs in families.\nA common cause of hirsutism is polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)."}

This method is expensive, and multiple treatments are needed. Swelling, scarring, and redness of the skin may occur.\nLaser energy directed at the dark color (melanin) in the hairs -- This method is best for a large area of very dark hair. It does not work on blond or red hair.\nTemporary options include:\nShaving -- Although this does not cause more hair to grow, it may make hair look thicker.\nChemicals, plucking, and waxing -- These options are safe and inexpensive. However, chemical products may irritate the skin.\nFor women who are overweight, weight loss may be able to help reduce hair growth.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHair follicles grow for about 6 months before falling out. Therefore, it takes many months of taking medicine before you will notice a decrease in hair growth.\nMany women get good results with temporary steps to remove hair or lighten it.\nPossible Complications\nMost of the time, hirsutism does not cause health problems."}
