Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCerebral angiography\nCerebral angiography\nCerebral angiography is a procedure that uses a special dye (contrast material) and x-rays to see how blood flows through the brain.\nHow the Test is Performed\nCerebral angiography is done in the hospital or radiology center.\nYou lie on an x-ray table.\nYour head is held still using a strap, tape, or sandbags, so you do not move it during the procedure.\nBefore the test starts, you are given a mild sedative to help you relax.\nAn\nelectrocardiogram\n(ECG) monitors your heart activity during the test. Sticky patches, called leads, will be placed on your arms and legs. Wires connect the leads to the ECG machine.\nAn area of your body, usually the groin or wrist, is cleaned and numbed with a numbing medicine (local anesthetic). A thin, hollow tube called a catheter is placed through an artery. The catheter is carefully moved up through the main blood vessels into an artery in the neck."}

A thin, hollow tube called a catheter is placed through an artery. The catheter is carefully moved up through the main blood vessels into an artery in the neck. X-rays help your health care provider (usually a specially trained radiologist) guide the catheter to the correct position.\nOnce the catheter is in place, dye is sent through the catheter. X-ray images are taken to see how the dye moves through the artery and blood vessels of the brain. The dye helps highlight any blockages in blood flow.\nSometimes, a computer removes the bones and tissues on the images being viewed, so that only the blood vessels filled with the dye are seen. This is called digital subtraction angiography (DSA).\nAfter the x-rays are taken, the catheter is withdrawn. Pressure is applied on the leg or wrist at the site of insertion for 10 to 15 minutes to stop the bleeding or a device is used to close the tiny hole. A tight bandage is then applied. Your leg should be kept straight for 2 to 6 hours after the procedure. Watch the area for bleeding for at least the next 12 hours.\nAngiography with a catheter is used less often now."}

This is because\nmagnetic resonance angiography\n(MRA) and\nCT angiography\ngive clearer images and do not require placing a catheter.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nBefore the procedure, your provider will examine you and may order blood tests.\nTell your provider if you:\nHave a history of bleeding problems or take medicines that are blood thinners\nHave had an allergic reaction to x-ray contrast dye or any iodine substance\nMay be pregnant\nHave kidney function problems\nYou may be told not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 8 hours before the test.\nWhen you arrive at the testing site, you will be given a hospital gown to wear. You must remove all jewelry.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe x-ray table may feel hard and cold. You may ask for a blanket or pillow.\nSome people feel a sting when the numbing medicine (anesthetic) is given. You will feel a brief, sharp pain and pressure as the catheter is moved into the body."}

You may ask for a blanket or pillow.\nSome people feel a sting when the numbing medicine (anesthetic) is given. You will feel a brief, sharp pain and pressure as the catheter is moved into the body. Once the initial placement is complete, you will not feel the catheter any longer.\nThe contrast may cause a warm or burning feeling of the skin of the face or head. This is normal and usually goes away within a few seconds.\nYou may have slight tenderness and bruising at the site of the injection after the test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nCerebral angiography is most often used to identify or confirm problems with the blood vessels in or around the brain.\nYour provider may order this test if you have symptoms or signs of:\nAbnormal blood vessels in the brain (vascular malformation)\nBulging blood vessel in the brain (\naneurysm\n)\nNarrowing of the arteries in the brain\nInflammation of the blood vessels in the brain (vasculitis)\nIt is sometimes used to:\nLook at blood flow to a tumor.\nEvaluate the arteries of the head and neck before surgery.\nFind a clot that may have caused a\nstroke\n.\nIn some cases, this procedure may be used to get more detailed information after something abnormal has been"}
