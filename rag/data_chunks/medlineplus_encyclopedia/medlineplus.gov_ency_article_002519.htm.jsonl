In rare cases, antidotes need to be used. There may be a more serious outcome if there has been prolonged coma or respiratory depression, or shock (extremely low blood pressure, leading to damage to multiple internal organs). Although deaths have been reported, most people who receive prompt treatment recover well.\nReferences\nBluth MH, Pincus MR, Abraham NZ. Toxicology and therapeutic drug monitoring."}
