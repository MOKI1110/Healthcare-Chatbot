The medical name for ringworm is tinea.\nCauses\nRingworm is common, especially among children. But, it can affect people of all ages. It is caused by a fungus, not a worm like the name suggests.\nMany bacteria, fungi, and yeast live on your body. Some of these are useful, while others can cause infections. Ringworm occurs when a type of fungus grows and multiplies on your skin.\nRingworm can spread from one person to another. You can catch ringworm if you touch someone who has the infection, or if you come in contact with items contaminated by the fungus, such as combs, unwashed clothing, and shower or pool surfaces. You can also catch ringworm from pets. Cats are common carriers.\nThe fungus that causes ringworm thrives in warm, moist areas."}
