Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEpley maneuver\nEpley maneuver\nThe Epley maneuver is a series of head movements to relieve symptoms of\nbenign positional vertigo\n. Benign positional vertigo is also called benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV). BPPV is caused by a problem in the inner ear. Vertigo is the feeling that you are spinning or that everything is spinning around you.\nDescription\nBPPV occurs when small pieces of bone-like calcium (canaliths) break free and float inside small canals in your inner ear. This sends confusing messages to your brain about your body's position, which causes vertigo.\nThe Epley maneuver is used to move the canaliths out of the canals so they stop causing symptoms.\nTo perform the maneuver, your health care provider will:\nTurn your head toward the side that causes vertigo.\nQuickly lay you down on your back with your head in the same position just off the edge of the table. You will likely feel more intense vertigo symptoms at this point.\nSlowly move your head to the opposite side.\nTurn your body so that it is in line with your head."}

You will be lying on your side with your head and body facing to the side.\nSit you upright.\nYour provider may need to repeat these steps a few times.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nYour provider will use this procedure to reposition the canaliths to treat BPPV.\nRisks\nDuring the procedure, you may experience:\nIntense vertigo symptoms\nNausea\nVomiting (less common)\nIn a few people, the canaliths may move into another canal in the inner ear and continue to cause vertigo.\nBefore the Procedure\nTell your provider about any medical conditions that you may have. The procedure may not be a good choice if you have had recent neck or spine problems or a detached retina.\nFor severe vertigo, your provider may give you medicines to reduce nausea or anxiety before starting the procedure.\nAfter the Procedure\nThe Epley maneuver often works quickly. For the rest of the day, avoid bending over."}

For the rest of the day, avoid bending over. For several days after treatment, avoid sleeping on the side that triggers symptoms.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost of the time, treatment will cure BPPV. Sometimes, vertigo may return after a few weeks. About half the time, BPPV will come back. If this happens, you'll need to be treated again. Your provider may teach you how to perform the maneuver at home.\nYour provider may prescribe medicines that can help relieve spinning sensations. However, these medicines often do not work well for treating vertigo.\nAlternative Names\nCanalith repositioning maneuvers (CRP); Canalith-repositioning maneuvers; CRP; Benign positional vertigo - Epley; Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo - Epley; BPPV - Epley; BPV - Epley\nImages\nVertigo\nReferences\nChang TP, Zee DS, Kheradmand A.
