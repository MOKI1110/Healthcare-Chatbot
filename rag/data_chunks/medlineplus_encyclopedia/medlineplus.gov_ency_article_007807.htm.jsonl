The artificial joint is called a\nprosthesis\n. Over time some or all parts of a prosthesis may wear out due to several reasons. The prosthesis may also loosen up with trauma or infection. When this happens, another surgery is needed to replace or repair the artificial hip joint. This is called total hip joint replacement revision.\nDescription\nThe results of hip replacement surgery are often excellent. Most artificial hip joints last 15 to 20 years before they loosen and need to be replaced again. Revision of hip joint replacement may either require replacement of the whole prosthesis or some of its parts.\nYou will not feel any pain during the surgery."}

You will also get medicine to make you sleepy. And you may get medicine that will make you forget about the procedure, even though you will not be fully asleep.\nAfter you receive anesthesia, your surgeon will:\nMake an incision following the same line used for the primary (initial) hip replacement surgery.\nAssess the soft tissues for any infection.\nExamine all the parts of the prosthesis to check if any part is worn, loose, or dislocated.\nRemove the existing implant, if required.\nRemove cement, if it was used in the primary surgery.\nRemove the metal stem from the thigh bone (femur), if required.\nPrepare the bone surfaces in the pelvis and femur for the revision implant.\nUse metal parts (augments) or a\nbone graft\nfor bone reconstruction, if there"}
