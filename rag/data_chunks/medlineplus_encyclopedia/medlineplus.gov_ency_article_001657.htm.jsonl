It is remarkable because its symptoms strongly resemble normal human aging, but it occurs in young children. In most cases, it is not passed down through families. It is rarely seen in more than one child in a family.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nGrowth failure during the first year of life\nNarrow, shrunken or wrinkled face\nBaldness\nLoss of eyebrows and eyelashes\nShort stature\nLarge head for size of face (\nmacrocephaly\n)\nOpen soft spot of the skull (fontanelle)\nSmall jaw (\nmicrognathia\n)\nDry, scaly, thin skin\nLimited range of motion\nTeeth - delayed or absent formation\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and order laboratory tests."}

This may show:\nInsulin resistance\nSkin changes similar to that seen in scleroderma (the connective tissue becomes tough and hardened)\nGenerally normal cholesterol and triglyceride levels\nCardiac stress testing may reveal signs of early atherosclerosis of blood vessels.\nGenetic testing can detect changes in the gene (\nLMNA\n) that causes progeria.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for progeria. Aspirin and statin medicines may be used to protect against a heart attack or stroke.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with Progeria and their families can be found at:\nProgeria Research Foundation, Inc. --\nwww.progeriaresearch.org\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nProgeria causes early death. People with the condition most often only live to their teenage years (average lifespan of 14 years). However, some can live into their early 20s."}
