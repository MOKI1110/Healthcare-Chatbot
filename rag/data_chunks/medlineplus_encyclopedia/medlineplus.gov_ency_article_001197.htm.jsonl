Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPyruvate kinase deficiency\nPyruvate kinase deficiency\nPyruvate kinase deficiency is an inherited lack of the\nenzyme\npyruvate kinase, which is used by red blood cells. Without this enzyme, red blood cells break down too easily, resulting in a low level of these cells (\nhemolytic anemia\n).\nCauses\nPyruvate kinase deficiency (PKD) is passed down as an\nautosomal recessive\ntrait. This means that a child must receive a non-working gene from each parent to develop the disorder.\nThere are many different types of enzyme-related defects of the red blood cell that can cause hemolytic anemia. PKD is the second most common cause, after\nglucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase\n(G6PD) deficiency.\nPKD is found in people of all ethnic backgrounds."}

But, certain populations, such as the Amish, are more likely to develop the condition.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of PKD include:\nLow count of healthy red blood cells (\nanemia\n)\nSwelling of the spleen (\nsplenomegaly\n)\nYellow color of the skin, mucous membranes, or white part of the eyes (\njaundice\n)\nNeurologic condition, called\nkernicterus\n, that affects the brain\nFatigue, lethargy\nPale skin (\npallor\n)\nIn infants, not gaining weight and growing as expected (\nfailure to thrive\n)\nGallstones, usually in the teens and older\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about and check for symptoms such as an\nenlarged spleen\n. If PKD is suspected, tests that will likely be ordered include:\nBilirubin\nin the blood\nCBC blood test\nGenetic testing for changes in the pyruvate kinase gene\nHaptoglobin blood test\nOsmotic fragility\nPyruvate kinase\nactivity\nStool urobilinogen\nTreatment\nPeople with severe anemia may need blood transfusions."}

Removing the spleen (\nsplenectomy\n) may help reduce the destruction of red blood cells. But, this does not help in all cases. In newborns with a dangerous level of jaundice, the provider may recommend an\nexchange transfusion\n. This procedure involves slowly removing the infant's blood and replacing it with fresh donor blood or plasma.\nSomeone who had a splenectomy should receive the\npneumococcal vaccine\nat recommended intervals. They also should receive preventive antibiotics until age 5.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with PKD condition and their families can be found at:\nNational Library of Medicine - MedlinePlus --\nmedlineplus.gov/genetics/condition/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/\nNational Organization for Rare Disorders --\nrarediseases.org/rare-diseases/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/\nNIH Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center --\nrarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/7514/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome varies."}

Some people have few or no symptoms. Others have severe symptoms. Treatment can usually make symptoms less severe.\nPossible Complications\nGallstones are a common problem. They are made of too much bilirubin, which is produced during hemolytic anemia. Severe pneumococcal disease is a possible complication after splenectomy.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nSee your provider if:\nYou have jaundice or anemia.\nYou have a family history of this disorder and are planning to have children.\nGenetic counseling\ncan help you know how likely it will be that your child would have PKD. You can also learn about tests that check for genetic disorders, such as PKD, so that you can decide if you'd like to have these tests.\nAlternative Names\nPK deficiency; PKD\nImages\nSplenomegaly\nReferences\nGallagher PG.
