Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nArm CT scan\nArm CT scan\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the arm is an imaging method that uses x-rays to make cross-sectional pictures of the arm.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will be asked to lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner.\nOnce you are inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you. Modern \"spiral\" scanners can perform the exam without stopping.\nA computer creates separate images of the arm area, called slices. These images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, or printed on film. Three-dimensional models of the arm can be created by adding the slices together.\nYou must be still during the exam. Movement can cause blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time.\nThe scan should take only 10 to 15 minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nFor some tests, you will need to have a special dye, called contrast, to be delivered into the body before the test starts."}

Contrast helps certain areas show up better on the x-rays.\nContrast can be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. If contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.\nLet your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test in order to safely receive contrast.\nBefore receiving the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes drug metformin (Glucophage). You may need to take special steps if you are on this medicine.\nIf you weigh more than 300 pounds (135 kilograms), find out if the CT machine has a weight limit."}

Too much weight can cause damage to the scanner's working parts.\nYou will be asked to remove jewelry and wear a hospital gown during the study as metal can affect the CT images.\nHow the Test will Feel\nSome people may have discomfort from lying on the hard table.\nContrast given through an IV may cause a slight burning sensation, a metallic taste in the mouth, and a warm flushing of the body. These feelings are normal. They will go away within a few seconds.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nCT rapidly creates detailed pictures of the body, including the arms."}

Having many x-rays or CT scans over time may increase your risk for cancer. However, the risk from any one scan is small. You and your provider should weigh this risk against the benefits of getting a correct diagnosis for a medical problem.\nSome people have allergies to contrast dye. Let your provider know if you have ever had an allergic reaction to injected contrast dye.\nThe most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. A person with an iodine allergy may have nausea or vomiting, sneezing, itching, or hives if given this type of contrast.\nIf contrast is needed, you may get antihistamines (such as Benadryl) or steroids before the test.\nThe kidneys help remove iodine out of the body. Those with kidney disease or diabetes may need to get extra fluids after the test to help flush the iodine out of the body.\nRarely, the dye may cause a life-threatening allergic response called anaphylaxis."}
