Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nProgressive supranuclear palsy\nProgressive supranuclear palsy\nProgressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) is a movement disorder that occurs from damage to certain nerve cells in the brain.\nCauses\nPSP is a condition that causes symptoms similar to those of\nParkinson disease\n.\nIt involves damage to many cells of the brain. Many areas are affected, including the part of the brainstem where cells that control eye movement are located. The area of the brain that controls steadiness when you walk is also affected. The frontal lobes of the brain are also affected, leading to personality changes.\nThe cause of the damage to the brain cells is unknown. PSP gets worse over time.\nPeople with PSP have deposits in brain tissues that look like those found in people with\nAlzheimer disease\n."}

PSP gets worse over time.\nPeople with PSP have deposits in brain tissues that look like those found in people with\nAlzheimer disease\n. There is a loss of tissue in most areas of the brain and in some parts of the spinal cord.\nThe disorder is most often seen in people over 60 years old, and is somewhat more common in men.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nLoss of balance, repeated falls\nLunging forward when moving, or fast walking\nBumping into objects or people\nChanges in expressions of the face\nDeeply lined face\nEye and vision problems such as\ndifferent sized pupils\n, difficulty moving the eyes (\nsupranuclear ophthalmoplegia\n), lack of control over the eyes, problems keeping the eyes open\nDifficulty swallowing\nTremors, jaw or face jerks or spasms\nMild-to-moderate\ndementia\nPersonality changes\nSlow or stiff movements\nSpeech difficulties, such as low voice volume, not able to say words clearly, slow speech\nStiffness and rigid movement in the neck, middle of the body, arms, and legs\nExams and Tests\nAn exam of the nervous system (neurologic exam) may show:\nDementia that is getting worse\nDifficulty walking"}

There is no known cure for PSP.\nMedicines such as levodopa  (combined with carbidopa) may be tried. These medicines raise the level of a brain chemical called dopamine. Dopamine is involved in the control of movement. The medicines may reduce some symptoms, such as rigid limbs or slow movements for a time."}

Dopamine is involved in the control of movement. The medicines may reduce some symptoms, such as rigid limbs or slow movements for a time. But they are usually not as effective as they are for Parkinson disease.\nMany people with PSP will eventually need around-the-clock care and monitoring as they lose brain functions.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nTreatment sometimes can reduce symptoms for a while, but the condition will get worse. Brain function will decline over time. Death commonly occurs in 5 to 7 years.\nNewer medicines are being studied to treat this condition.\nPossible Complications\nComplications of PSP include:\nBlood clot in veins (\ndeep vein thrombosis\n) due to limited movement\nInjury from falling\nLack of control over vision\nLoss of brain functions over time\nPneumonia\ndue to  trouble swallowing\nPoor nutrition (malnutrition)\nSide effects from medicines\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you often fall, and if you have a stiff neck/body, and vision problems.\nAlso, call if a loved one has been diagnosed with PSP and the condition has declined so much that you can no longer care for the person at"}
