A sample from this swab is applied in a very thin layer to a microscope slide. A series of stains called a Gram stain is applied to the specimen.\nThe stained smear is then examined under the microscope for the presence of bacteria. The color, size, and shape of the cells help identify the type of bacteria causing the infection.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThis test is often performed in the health care provider's office.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel pressure or burning when the cotton swab touches the urethra.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is performed when an abnormal urethral discharge is present. It may be performed if a sexually transmitted infection is suspected.\nNormal Results\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}
