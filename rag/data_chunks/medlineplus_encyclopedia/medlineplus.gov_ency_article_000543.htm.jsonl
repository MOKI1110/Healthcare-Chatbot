Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEssential thrombocythemia\nEssential thrombocythemia\nEssential thrombocythemia (ET) is a condition in which the bone marrow produces too many platelets. Platelets are particles in the blood that aid in blood clotting.\nWatch this video about:\nBlood clotting\nCauses\nET results in an overproduction of platelets. The higher number of platelets may increase the risk of clotting. However, bleeding may occur with very high platelet count because blood clots use up the body's platelets. Untreated, ET worsens over time.\nET is part of a group of conditions known as myeloproliferative disorders. Others include:\nChronic myelogenous leukemia\n(an overproduction of white blood cells that starts in the bone marrow)\nPolycythemia vera\n(bone marrow disease that leads to an abnormal increase in the number of red blood cells)\nPrimary\nmyelofibrosis\n(disorder of the bone marrow in which the marrow is replaced by fibrous scar tissue)\nMany people with ET have a variation of a gene (JAK2, CALR, or MPL).\nET is most common in middle- to older-age people."}

It quickly reduces the number of platelets in the blood.\nLong-term, medicines are used to decrease the platelet count to avoid complications. The most common medicines used include hydroxyurea, interferon-alpha, or anagrelide.\nAspirin at a low dose (81 to 100 mg once or twice per day) may decrease clotting episodes.\nMany people do not need any treatment, but they must be followed closely by their health care provider.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nOutcomes may vary. Most people can go for long periods without complications and have a normal lifespan."}
