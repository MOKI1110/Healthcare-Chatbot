Contact local emergency services.\nFIRST AID STEPS\nImmediately get out of the water and into a safe environment and wash the area with salt water.\nNext soak the wound with hot water. The water should be around 100 °F to 113 °F (40 °C to 45 °C) or as hot as can be comfortably tolerated. Soak for 30 to 90 minutes, periodically checking to make sure the water is still warm. Soaking in hot water helps to inactivate the venom and relieve pain.\nAfter soaking, gently wash the wound with mild soap and clean water to remove any dirt, debris, or venom that may be present.\nBefore Calling Emergency\nHave this information ready:\nPerson's age, weight, and condition\nTime of the sting\nType of fish if known\nLocation of the sting\nPoison Control\nYour local\npoison control center\ncan be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.
