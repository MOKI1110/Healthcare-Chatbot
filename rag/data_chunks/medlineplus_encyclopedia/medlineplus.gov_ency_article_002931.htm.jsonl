Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nParathyroid gland removal\nParathyroid gland removal\nParathyroidectomy is surgery to remove the parathyroid glands or parathyroid tumors. The parathyroid glands are right behind your thyroid gland in your neck. These glands help your body regulate the calcium level in your blood.\nDescription\nYou will receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n(asleep and pain-free) for this surgery.\nUsually the parathyroid glands are removed using a 2 to 4 inch (in) or 5 to 10 centimeters (cm) surgical cut on your neck. During surgery:\nThe cut is usually made in the center of your neck just under your Adam's apple.\nYour surgeon will look for the four parathyroid glands and remove any that are diseased.\nYou may have a special blood test during surgery that will tell if all the diseased glands were removed.\nIn rare cases, when all four of these glands need to be removed, part of one is transplanted into the forearm. Or, it is transplanted into a muscle in the front of your neck next to the thyroid gland."}

Or, it is transplanted into a muscle in the front of your neck next to the thyroid gland. This helps ensure your body's calcium level stays at a healthy level.\nThe specific type of surgery depends on where the diseased parathyroid glands are. Types of surgery include:\nMinimally invasive parathyroidectomy. You may receive a shot of a very small amount of radioactive tracer before this surgery. This helps highlight the diseased glands. If you have this shot, your surgeon will use a special probe, like a Geiger counter, to locate the parathyroid gland. Your surgeon will make a small cut (1 to 2 in; or 2.5 to 5 cm) on one side of your neck, and then remove the diseased gland through it. This procedure takes about 1 hour.\nVideo-assisted parathyroidectomy. Your surgeon will make two small cuts in your neck. One is for instruments, and the other is for a scope with a camera. Your surgeon will use the camera to view the area and will remove the diseased glands with the instruments.\nEndoscopic parathyroidectomy."}

Your surgeon will use the camera to view the area and will remove the diseased glands with the instruments.\nEndoscopic parathyroidectomy. Your surgeon will make two or three small cuts in the front of your neck and one cut above the top of your collarbone. This reduces visible scarring, pain, and recovery time. This cut is less than 2 in (5 cm) long. The procedure to remove any diseased parathyroid glands is similar to video-assisted parathyroidectomy.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nYour health care provider may recommend this surgery if one or more of your parathyroid glands is producing too much parathyroid hormone. This condition is called\nhyperparathyroidism\n. It is often caused by a small non-cancerous (benign) tumor called an adenoma.\nYour surgeon will consider many factors when deciding whether to do surgery and what type of surgery would be best for you."}

This can lead to low calcium levels that are dangerous to your health.\nInjury to the nerves going to the muscles that move your vocal cords. You may have a hoarse or weaker voice which could be temporary or permanent.\nDifficulty breathing. This is not common and usually goes away several weeks or months after surgery.\nBefore the Procedure\nParathyroid glands are very small. You may need to have tests that show exactly where your glands are. This will help your surgeon find your parathyroid glands during surgery."}

Sometimes your surgeon will order a nuclear medicine scan, known as a Sestamibi scan prior to your surgery to locate all of the parathyroid glands.\nTell your surgeon or nurse if:\nYou are or could be pregnant\nYou are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\nDuring the week before your surgery:\nYou may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E."}

You can start your everyday activities in a few days. It will take about 1 to 3 weeks for you to fully heal.\nThe surgery area must be kept clean and dry. You may need to drink liquids and eat soft foods for a day.\nContact your surgeon if you have any numbness or tingling around your mouth in the 24 to 48 hours after surgery. This is caused by low calcium. Follow instructions about how to take your calcium supplements.\nAfter this procedure, you should have periodic blood tests to check your calcium level.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPeople usually recover soon after this surgery."}
