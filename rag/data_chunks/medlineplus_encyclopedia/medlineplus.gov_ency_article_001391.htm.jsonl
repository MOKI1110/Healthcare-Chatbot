Cattle usually carry\nTaenia saginata\n(\nT saginata\n). Pigs carry\nTaenia solium (T solium)\n.\nIn the human intestine, the young form of the tapeworm from the infected meat (larva) develops into the adult tapeworm. A tapeworm can grow to longer than 12 feet (3.5 meters) and can live for years.\nTapeworms have many segments. Each segment is able to produce eggs. The eggs are spread alone or in groups and can pass out with the stool or through the anus.\nAdults and children with pork tapeworm can infect themselves if they have poor hygiene."}

They can ingest tapeworm eggs they pick up on their hands while wiping or scratching their anus or the skin around it.\nThose who are infected can expose other people to\nT solium\neggs, usually through food handling.\nSymptoms\nTapeworm infection usually does not cause any symptoms. Some people may have abdominal discomfort.\nPeople often realize they are infected when they pass segments of the worm in their stool, especially if the segments are moving.\nExams and Tests\nTests that may be done to confirm diagnosis of an infection include:\nCBC\n, including\ndifferential count\nStool exam\nfor eggs of\nT solium\nor\nT saginata\n, or the worm itself\nTreatment\nTapeworms are treated with medicines taken by mouth, usually in a single dose. The drug of choice for tapeworm infections is praziquantel."}

The drug of choice for tapeworm infections is praziquantel. Niclosamide can also be used, but this medicine is not available in the United States.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWith treatment, the tapeworm infection goes away.\nPossible Complications\nIn rare cases, worms can cause a\nblockage in the intestine\n.\nIf pork tapeworm larvae move out of the intestine, they can cause local growths and damage tissues such as the brain, eye, or heart. This condition is called\ncysticercosis\n. Infection of the brain (neurocysticercosis) can cause\nseizures\nand other nervous system problems.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider for an appointment if you pass something in your stool that looks like a white worm.\nPrevention\nIn the United States, laws on feeding practices and the inspection of domestic food animals have largely eliminated tapeworms.\nMeasures you can take to prevent tapeworm infection include:\nDo not eat raw meat.\nCook whole cut meat to 145 °F (63 °C) and ground meat to 160 °F (71 °C)."}
