The condition may appear in the first few hours of life, or it can appear after the first day. The condition can last for several days.\nAlthough erythema toxicum is harmless, it can be of great concern to the new parent. Its cause is unknown, but thought to be related to the immune system.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom is a rash of small, yellow-to-white-colored bumps (papules) surrounded by red skin. There may be a few or several papules. They are usually on the face and in the middle of the body. They can also be seen on the upper arms and thighs.\nThe rash can change rapidly, appearing and disappearing in different areas over hours to days.\nExams and Tests\nYour baby's health care provider can often make a diagnosis during a routine exam after birth. Testing is usually not needed."}
