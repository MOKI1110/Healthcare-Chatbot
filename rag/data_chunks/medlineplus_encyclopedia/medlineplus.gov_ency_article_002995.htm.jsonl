Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nVasectomy\nVasectomy\nA vasectomy is surgery to cut the vas deferens. These are the tubes that carry sperm from the testicles to the urethra. After a vasectomy, sperm cannot move out of the\ntestes\n. A man who has had a successful vasectomy cannot make a woman pregnant.\nWatch this video about:\nVasectomy\nDescription\nVasectomy is most often done in the surgeon's office using local anesthesia. You will be awake, but not feel any pain.\nAfter your scrotum is shaved and cleaned, the surgeon will inject numbing medicine into the area.\nThe surgeon will make a small cut in the upper part of your\nscrotum\n. The vas deferens will then be tied off or clipped and cut apart.\nThe wound will be closed with stitches or surgical glue.\nYou may have a vasectomy without a surgical cut. This is called a no-scalpel vasectomy (NSV)."}

This is called a no-scalpel vasectomy (NSV). For this procedure:\nThe surgeon will find the vas deferens by feeling your scrotum.\nYou will get numbing medicine.\nThe surgeon will then make a tiny hole in the skin of your scrotum and then tie off and cut a part of the vas deferens.\nIn a regular vasectomy, a small incision is made on each side of the scrotum. In a no-scalpel vasectomy, a sharp instrument is used to pierce the skin and make a single opening. A stitch or surgical glue is used to seal the openings in both forms of the procedure.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nVasectomy may be recommended for men who are sure they do not want to get a woman pregnant in the future. A vasectomy makes a man sterile (unable to get a woman pregnant).\nA vasectomy is not recommended as a short-term form of birth control."}

This includes men who are divorced, widowed, or separated.\nRisks\nThere is no serious risk to vasectomy. Your semen will be tested in the months after the operation to make sure it does not contain sperm.\nAs with any surgical procedure, infection, swelling, or prolonged pain can occur. Careful following of aftercare instructions reduces these risks significantly.\nVery rarely, the vas deferens can grow back together again. If this happens, sperm can mix with semen."}

This would make it possible for you to make a woman pregnant.\nBefore the Procedure\nTwo weeks before your vasectomy, tell your health care provider about medicines you take, including those bought without a prescription and vitamins, supplements, and herbs.\nYou may need to limit or stop taking aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and other medicines that affect blood clotting for 10 days before your surgery.\nOn the day of your surgery, wear loose, comfortable clothes. Clean your scrotum area well. Take the medicines your provider told you to take.\nBring a scrotal support with you to the surgery.\nAfter the Procedure\nYou should be able to return home as soon as you feel well. You can return to work the next day if you do not do heavy physical work. Most men return to work within 2 to 3 days. You should be able to return to your normal physical activities in 3 to 7 days. It is normal to have some swelling and bruising of the scrotum after the procedure."}

Pain medicine, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), may help relieve discomfort. You can have sexual intercourse as soon as you feel ready, most often about a week after the surgery. You must use some form of birth control to prevent unwanted pregnancy until you know your semen is free of sperm.\nThe vasectomy is considered successful only after your semen has been tested to make sure no more sperm are in it. It is safe to stop using other forms of birth control at this point.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nVasectomy does not affect a man's ability to have an erection or orgasm, or to ejaculate semen. A vasectomy does not prevent the spread of sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\nA vasectomy does not increase your risk of prostate cancer or testicular disease.\nYour sperm count gradually decreases after a vasectomy."}

Most couples enjoy not having to use birth control.\nAlternative Names\nSterilization surgery - male; No-scalpel vasectomy; NSV; Family planning - vasectomy; Contraception - vasectomy\nImages\nBefore and after vasectomy\nSperm\nVasectomy  - series\nReferences\nBrugh VM.
