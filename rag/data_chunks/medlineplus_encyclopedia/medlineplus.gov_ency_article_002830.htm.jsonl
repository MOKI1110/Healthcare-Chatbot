The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery. Damage can continue to occur for several weeks after swallowing soldering flux.\nSwallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue necrosis, resulting in infection, shock, and death, even several months after the substance was first swallowed. Scars may form in these tissues, leading to long-term difficulties with breathing, swallowing, and digestion.\nAlternative Names\nFluxes; Flux poisoning\nReferences\nAronson JK. Organic solvents.
