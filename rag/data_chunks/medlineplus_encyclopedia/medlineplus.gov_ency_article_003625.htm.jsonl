Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCSF cell count\nCSF cell count\nA CSF cell count is a test to measure the number of red and white blood cells that are in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is a clear fluid that is in the space around the spinal cord and brain.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA sample of CSF is needed [1 to 5 milliliters (ml)]. A\nlumbar puncture\n(spinal tap) is the most common way to collect this sample. Rarely, other methods are used for collecting CSF such as:\nCisternal puncture\nVentricular puncture\nRemoval of CSF from a tube that is already in the CSF, such as a shunt or ventricular drain\nAfter the sample is taken, it is sent to a lab for evaluation.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe CSF cell count may help detect:\nMeningitis\nand infection of the brain or spinal cord\nTumor\n,\nabscess\n, or area of tissue death (infarct)\nInflammation\nBleeding into the spinal fluid (secondary to\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage\n)\nNormal Results\nThe normal white blood cell count is from 0 to 5. The normal red blood cell count is 0.\nNote: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs."}

The normal red blood cell count is 0.\nNote: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nThe examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn increase of white blood cells indicates infection, inflammation, or bleeding into the cerebrospinal fluid. Some causes include:\nAbscess\nEncephalitis\nHemorrhage\nMeningitis\nMultiple sclerosis\nOther infections\nTumor\nNeurosarcoidosis\nFinding red blood cells in the CSF may be a sign of bleeding. However, red blood cells in the CSF may also be due to the spinal tap needle hitting a blood vessel.\nAdditional conditions which this test may help diagnose include:\nArteriovenous malformation (cerebral)\nCerebral aneurysm\nDelirium\nGuillain-BarrÃ© syndrome\nStroke\nNeurosyphilis\nPrimary lymphoma of the brain\nSeizure disorders, including\nepilepsy\nSpinal tumor\nLyme disease\nImages\nCSF cell count\nReferences\nDe Luca GC, Griggs RC, Johnston SC."}
