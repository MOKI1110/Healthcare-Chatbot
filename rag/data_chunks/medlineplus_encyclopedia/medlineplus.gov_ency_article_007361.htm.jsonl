Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nKnee MRI scan\nKnee MRI scan\nA knee MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan uses energy from strong magnets to create pictures of the knee joint and muscles and tissues.\nAn MRI does not use radiation (x-rays). Single MRI images are called slices. The images can be stored on a computer or printed on film. One exam produces many images.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will wear a hospital gown or clothes without metal zippers or snaps (such as sweatpants and a t-shirt). Please remove your watches, glasses, jewelry, and wallet. MRI can pull on any metal objects. Certain types of metal can cause blurry images.\nYou will lie on a narrow table that slides into a large tunnel-like scanner.\nSome exams use a special dye (contrast). Most of the time, you will get the dye through a vein (IV) in your arm or hand before the test. Sometimes, the dye is injected into a joint. The dye helps the radiologist see certain areas more clearly.\nDuring the MRI, the person who operates the machine will watch you from another room."}

The test most often lasts 30 to 60 minutes, but may take longer. It can be loud. The technician can give you some ear plugs if needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the scan.\nTell your health care provider if you are afraid of closed spaces (have claustrophobia). You may be given a medicine to help you feel sleepy and less anxious."}

The machine makes loud thumping and humming noises when turned on. You can wear ear plugs to help block out the noise.\nAn intercom in the room allows you to speak to someone at any time. Some MRIs have televisions and special headphones to help the time pass.\nThere is no recovery time, unless you were given a medicine to relax."}

There have been no reported side effects from the magnetic fields and radio waves.\nThe most common type of contrast (dye) used is gadolinium. It is very safe. Allergic reactions to the substance are rare. However, gadolinium can be harmful to people with kidney problems that need dialysis. If you have kidney problems, please tell your provider before the test.\nThe strong magnetic fields created during an MRI can cause heart pacemakers and other implants to not work as well. It can also cause small pieces of metal inside your body to move or shift."}
