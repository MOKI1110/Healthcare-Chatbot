Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFluoride in diet\nFluoride in diet\nFluoride occurs naturally in the body as calcium fluoride. Calcium fluoride is mostly found in the bones and teeth.\nFunction\nSmall amounts of fluoride help reduce\ntooth decay\n. Adding fluoride to tap water (called fluoridation) helps reduce cavities in children by more than half.\nFood Sources\nFluoridated water is found in most community water systems. Well water often does not contain enough fluoride to prevent tooth decay.\nFood prepared in fluoridated water contains fluoride. Natural sodium fluoride is in the ocean, so most seafood contains fluoride. Tea and gelatin also contain fluoride.\nInfants can only get fluoride through drinking infant formulas. Breast milk has a negligible amount of fluoride in it.\nSide Effects\nA lack (deficiency) of fluoride may lead to increased cavities, and weak bones and teeth.\nToo much fluoride in the diet is very rare. Rarely, infants who get too much fluoride before their teeth have broken through the gums have changes in the enamel that covers the teeth."}

Faint white lines or streaks may appear, but they are usually not easy to see.\nRecommendations\nThe Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine recommends the following dietary intake for fluoride:\nThese values are adequate intakes (AI), meaning that there is insufficient evidence to establish exact recommendations, so they are best estimates of what most people need.\nInfants\n0 to 6 months: 0.01 milligrams per day (mg/day)\n7 to 12 months: 0.5 mg/day\nChildren\n1 to 3 years: 0.7 mg/day\n4 to 8 years: 1.0 mg/day\n9 to 13 years: 2.0 mg/day\nAdolescents and adults\nMales ages 14 to 18 years: 3.0 mg/day\nMales over 18 years: 4.0 mg/day\nFemales over 14 years: 3.0 mg/day\nThe best way to get the daily requirement of essential vitamins is to eat a balanced diet that contains a variety of foods from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) MyPlate food guide  [\nwww.myplate.gov/\n].\nSpecific recommendations depend on age and sex."}
