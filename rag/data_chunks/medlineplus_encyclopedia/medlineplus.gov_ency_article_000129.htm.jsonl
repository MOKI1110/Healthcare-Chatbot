Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCor pulmonale\nCor pulmonale\nCor pulmonale is a condition that causes the right side of the heart to fail. Long-term high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries of the lung and right ventricle of the heart can lead to cor pulmonale.\nCauses\nHigh blood pressure\nin the pulmonary arteries of the lungs is called\npulmonary hypertension\n. It is the most common cause of cor pulmonale.\nIn people who have pulmonary hypertension, changes in the small blood vessels inside the lungs can lead to increased blood pressure in the right side of the heart. This makes it harder for the heart to pump blood to the lungs. If this high pressure continues, it puts a strain on the right side of the heart. That strain can cause cor pulmonale.\nLung conditions that cause a low blood oxygen level in the blood over a long time can also lead to cor pulmonale. Some of these are:\nAutoimmune diseases\nthat damage the lungs, such as\nscleroderma\nChronic obstructive pulmonary disease\n(COPD)\nChronic blood clots in the lungs\nCystic fibrosis\n(CF)\nSevere bronchiectasis"}

You may also have a fast heartbeat and feel like your heart is pounding.\nOver time, symptoms occur with lighter activity or even while you are at rest. Symptoms you may have are:\nFainting spells during activity\nChest discomfort, usually in the front of the chest\nChest pain\nSwelling of the feet or ankles\nSymptoms of lung disorders, such as\nwheezing\nor coughing or phlegm production\nBluish lips and fingers\n(cyanosis)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms."}

It is important to treat medical problems that cause pulmonary hypertension, because they can lead to cor pulmonale.\nMany treatment options are available. In general, the cause of your cor pulmonale will determine which treatment you receive.\nIf your  provider prescribes medicines, you may take them by mouth (oral), receive them through a vein (\nintravenous\nor IV), or breathe them in (inhaled). You will be closely monitored during treatment to watch for side effects and to see how well the medicine works for you. Never stop taking your medicines without first talking to your provider.\nOther treatments may include:\nBlood thinners to reduce the risk of blood clots\nMedicines to manage heart failure symptoms\nOxygen therapy at home\n(as in most cases of cor pulmonale, oxygen is low)\nA lung or heart-lung transplant, if medicine does not work\nImportant tips to follow:\nAvoid strenuous activities and heavy lifting.\nAvoid traveling to high altitudes.\nGet a yearly\nflu vaccine\n, as well as other vaccines, such as the\npneumococcal (pneumonia) vaccine\n, and the\nCOVID-19 vaccine\n.\nIf you\nsmoke, stop\n.\nLimit how much salt you eat."}
