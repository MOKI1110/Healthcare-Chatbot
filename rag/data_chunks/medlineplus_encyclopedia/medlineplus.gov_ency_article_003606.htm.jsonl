The test helps detect if nutrients are being properly absorbed.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test requires a blood and urine sample. These tests include:\nClean catch urine specimen\nVenipuncture (blood draw)\nThere are several ways to perform this test. A typical procedure is described below, but make sure you follow the specific instructions you are given.\nYou will be asked to drink 8 ounces (240 ml) of water that contains 5 teaspoons (25 grams) of a sugar called d-xylose. The amount of d-xylose that comes out in your urine over the next 5 hours will be measured. You may have a blood sample collected at 1 and 3 hours after drinking the liquid. In some cases, the sample may be collected every hour. The amount of urine you produce over a 5-hour period is also checked."}

In some cases, the sample may be collected every hour. The amount of urine you produce over a 5-hour period is also checked. Your health care provider will tell you how to collect all of the urine during a 5-hour period.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nDo not eat or drink anything (even water) for 8 to 12 hours before the test. Your provider will ask you to rest during the test. A failure to restrict activity may affect test results.\nYour provider may tell you to stop taking certain medicines that can affect test results. Medicines that can affect test results include aspirin, atropine, indomethacin, isocarboxazid, and phenelzine. DO NOT stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, you may feel moderate pain, or only a prick or stinging sensation."}

Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nUrine is collected as part of normal urination with no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order this test if you have:\nPersistent diarrhea\nSigns of malnutrition\nUnexplained weight loss\nThis test is primarily used to check if nutrient absorption problems are due to a disease of the intestines. It is performed much less often than in the past.\nNormal Results\nA normal result depends on how much D-xylose is given. In most cases, the test results are either positive or negative. A positive result means that D-xylose is found in the blood or urine and is therefore being absorbed by the intestines.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}
