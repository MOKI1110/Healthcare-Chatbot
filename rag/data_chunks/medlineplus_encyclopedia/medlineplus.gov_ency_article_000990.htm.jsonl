It leads to wheezing, shortness of breath, chest tightness, and coughing.\nCauses\nAsthma is caused by swelling (inflammation) in the airways. During an asthma attack, the muscles surrounding the airways tighten. The lining of the air passages swells. As a result, less air is able to pass through.\nAsthma is often seen in children. It is a leading cause of missed school days and hospital visits for children. An allergic reaction is a key part of asthma in children. Asthma and allergies often occur together.\nIn children who have sensitive airways, asthma symptoms can be triggered by breathing in substances called\nallergens\n, or\ntriggers\n.\nCommon asthma triggers include:\nAnimals (hair or dander)\nDust, mold, and pollen\nAspirin and other medicines\nChanges in weather (most often cold weather)\nChemicals in the air or in food\nTobacco smoke\nExercise\nStrong emotions\nViral infections, such as the\ncommon cold\nSymptoms\nBreathing problems are common."}

They can include:\nShortness of breath\nFeeling out of breath\nGasping for air\nTrouble breathing out (exhaling)\nBreathing faster than normal\nWhen your child is having a hard time breathing, the skin of the chest and neck may suck inward.\nOther symptoms of asthma in children include:\nCoughing that sometimes wakes the child up at night (it may be the only symptom).\nDark bags under the eyes.\nFeeling tired.\nIrritability.\nTightness in the chest.\nA whistling sound made when breathing (\nwheezing\n). You may notice it more when your child breathes out.\nYour child's asthma symptoms may vary. Symptoms may appear often or develop only when triggers are present. Some children are more likely to have asthma symptoms at night.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will use a stethoscope to listen to your child's lungs. The provider may be able to hear asthma sounds."}

The provider may be able to hear asthma sounds.

Peak flow meters can tell how well the child can blow air out of the lungs. If the airways are narrow due to asthma, peak flow values drop.\nYou and your child will learn to measure peak flow at home.\nYour child's provider may order the following tests:\nAllergy testing on the\nskin\n, or a\nblood test\nto see if your child is allergic to certain substances\nChest x-ray\nLung function tests\nTreatment\nYou and your child's providers should work together as a team to create and carry out an asthma action plan.\nThis plan will tell you how to:\nAvoid asthma triggers\nMonitor symptoms\nMeasure peak flow\nTake medicines\nThe plan should also tell you when to call the provider."}

(You may need to sign a consent form.)\nHaving asthma does not mean your child cannot exercise. Coaches, gym teachers, and your child should know what to do if your child has asthma\nsymptoms caused by exercise\n.\nASTHMA MEDICINES\nThere are two basic kinds of medicine used to treat asthma.\nLong-term control medicines are taken every day to prevent asthma symptoms.

Children take them when they are coughing, wheezing, having trouble breathing, or having an asthma attack.\nSome of your child's asthma medicines can be taken using an\ninhaler\n.\nChildren who use an inhaler should use a\nspacer device\n. This helps them get the medicine into the lungs properly.\nIf your child uses the inhaler the wrong way, less medicine gets into the lungs. Have your provider show your child how to correctly use an inhaler.\nYounger children can use a\nnebulizer\ninstead of an inhaler to take their medicine."}

Avoiding them is the first step toward helping your child feel better.\nKeep pets outdoors, or at least away from the child's bedroom.\nNo one should\nsmoke\nin a house or around a child with asthma.\nGetting rid of tobacco smoke in the home is the single most important thing a family can do to help a child with asthma.\nSmoking outside the house is not enough. Family members and visitors who smoke carry the smoke inside on their clothes and hair. This can trigger asthma symptoms.\nDo not use indoor fireplaces.\nKeep the house clean. Keep food in containers and out of bedrooms. This helps reduce the possibility of cockroaches, which can trigger asthma attacks. Cleaning products in the home should be unscented.\nMONITOR YOUR CHILD'S ASTHMA\nChecking peak flow is one of the best ways to control asthma. It can help you keep your child's asthma from getting worse."}

It can help you keep your child's asthma from getting worse. Asthma attacks usually do not happen without warning.\nChildren under age 5 may not be able to use a peak flow meter well enough for it to be helpful. However, a child should start using the peak flow meter at a young age to get used to it. An adult should always watch for a child's asthma symptoms.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWith proper treatment, most children with asthma can live a normal life. When asthma is not well controlled, it can lead to missed school, problems playing sports, missed work for parents, and many visits to the provider's office and emergency room.\nAsthma symptoms often lessen or go away completely as the child gets older. Asthma that is not well controlled can lead to lasting lung problems.\nIn rare cases, asthma is a life-threatening disease. Families need to work closely with their providers to develop a plan to care for a child with asthma.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your child's provider if you think your child has new symptoms of asthma."}
