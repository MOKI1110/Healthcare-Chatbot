Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTrisomy 13\nTrisomy 13\nTrisomy 13 (also called Patau syndrome) is a genetic disorder in which a person has 3 copies of genetic material from\nchromosome\n13, instead of the usual 2 copies. Rarely, the extra material may be attached to another chromosome (translocation).\nCauses\nTrisomy 13 occurs when extra DNA from chromosome 13 appears in some or all of the body's cells.\nTrisomy 13: the presence of an extra (third) chromosome 13 in all of the cells.\nMosaic trisomy 13: the presence of an extra chromosome 13 in some of the cells.\nPartial trisomy 13: the presence of a part of an extra chromosome 13 in the cells.\nThe extra material interferes with normal development.\nTrisomy 13 occurs in about 1 out of every 10,000 newborns. Most cases are not passed down through families (inherited)."}
