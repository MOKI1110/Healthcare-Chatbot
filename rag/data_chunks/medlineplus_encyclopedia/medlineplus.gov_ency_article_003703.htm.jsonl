Cortisol is a  glucocorticoid  (steroid) hormone produced by the\nadrenal gland\n.\nCortisol can also be measured using a\nblood\nor saliva test.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA 24-hour urine sample is needed. You will need to\ncollect your urine over 24 hours\nin a container provided by the laboratory. Your health care provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly.\nBecause cortisol production by the adrenal gland can vary, the test may need to be done three or more separate times over a few weeks to months to get a more accurate picture of average cortisol production.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may be asked not to do any vigorous exercise the day before the test.\nYou may also be told to temporarily stop taking medicines that can affect the test, including:\nAnti-seizure medicines\nEstrogen\nHuman-made (synthetic) glucocorticoids, such as hydrocortisone, prednisone, and prednisolone\nAndrogens\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves onl"}

There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is done to check for increased or decreased cortisol production. Cortisol is a glucocorticoid (steroid) hormone released from the adrenal gland in response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (\nACTH\n). This is a hormone released from the pituitary gland in the brain. Cortisol affects many different body systems. It plays a role in:\nBone growth\nBlood pressure control\nImmune system function\nMetabolism of fats, carbohydrates, and protein\nNervous system function\nStress response\nDifferent diseases, such as\nCushing syndrome\nand\nAddison disease\n, can lead to either too much or too little production of cortisol. Measuring urine cortisol levels can help diagnose these conditions.\nNormal Results\nNormal range is less than 45 mcg/24 hours (124 nmol/24 hours) for women and less than 60 mcg/24 hours (165 nmol/24 hours).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}

Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA higher than normal level may indicate:\nCushing disease\n, in which the pituitary gland makes too much ACTH because of excess growth of the pituitary gland or a tumor in the pituitary gland\nEctopic Cushing syndrome\n, in which a tumor outside the pituitary or adrenal glands makes too much ACTH\nSevere depression\nTumor of the adrenal gland\nthat is producing too much cortisol\nSevere stress\nRare genetic disorders\nA lower than normal level may indicate:\nAddison disease in which the adrenal glands do not produce enough cortisol\nHypopituitarism\nin which the pituitary gland does not signal the adrenal gland to produce enough cortisol\nSuppression of normal pituitary or adrenal function by glucocorticoid medicines including pills, skin creams, eyedrops, inhalers, joint injections, chemotherapy\nRisks\nThere are no risks with this tes"}
