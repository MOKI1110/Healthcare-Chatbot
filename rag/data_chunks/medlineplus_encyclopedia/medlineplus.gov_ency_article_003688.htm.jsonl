Do not stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.\nSome medicines that can increase T3RU levels include:\nAnabolic steroids\nHeparin\nPhenytoin\nSalicylates (high dose)\nWarfarin\nSome medicines that can decrease T3RU levels include:\nAntithyroid medicines\nBirth control pills\nEstrogen\nThiazides\nOpioids and methadone\nPregnancy can also decrease T3RU levels.\nThese conditions can decrease TBG levels (see below section Why the Test is Performed for more about TBG):\nSerious illness\nKidney disease when protein is lost in the urine (nephrotic syndrome)\nOther medicines that bind to protein in the blood can also affect test results.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to check your thyroid function."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to check your thyroid function. Thyroid function depends on the action of many different hormones, including thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), T3, and T4.\nThis test helps check the amount of T3 that TBG is able to bind. TBG is a protein that carries most of the T3 and T4 in the blood.\nYour provider may recommend a T3RU test if you have signs of a thyroid disorder, including:\nOveractive thyroid (\nhyperthyroidism\n)\nUnderactive thyroid (\nhypothyroidism\n)\nMuscle weakness caused by high levels of thyroid hormone in the blood (\nthyrotoxic periodic paralysis\n)\nNormal Results\nNormal values range from 25% to 38%.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nHigher-than-normal levels may indicate:\nKidney failure\nOveractive thyroid (hyperthyroidism)\nNephrotic syndrome\nProtein malnutrition\nChronic liver disease\nLower-than-normal levels may indicate:\nAcute\nhepatitis\n(liver disease)\nPregnancy\nHypothyroidism\nUse of estrogen, opioids or methadone\nAbnormal results may also be due to an inherited condition of high TBG levels. Usually thyroid function is normal in people with this condition.\nThis test may also be done for:\nChronic thyroiditis\n(swelling or inflammation of the thyroid gland, including Hashimoto disease)\nDrug-induced hypothyroidism\nGraves disease\nSubacute thyroiditis\nThyrotoxic periodic paralysis\nToxic nodular goiter\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.
