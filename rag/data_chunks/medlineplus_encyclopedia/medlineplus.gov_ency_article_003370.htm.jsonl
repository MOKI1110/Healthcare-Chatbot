Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCSF myelin basic protein\nCSF myelin basic protein\nCSF myelin basic protein is a test to measure the level of myelin basic protein (MBP) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\nCSF is a clear liquid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord.\nMBP is found in the material that covers many of your nerves.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA sample of spinal fluid is needed. This is done using a\nlumbar puncture\n.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to see if myelin is breaking down.\nMultiple sclerosis\nis the most common cause for this, but other causes may include:\nBleeding in the\ncentral nervous system\nCentral nervous system trauma\nCertain brain diseases (encephalopathies)\nInfection of the central nervous system\nStroke\nTraumatic brain injury\nNormal Results\nIn general, there should be less than 4 ng/mL of myelin basic protein in the CSF.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nThe example above shows the common measurement result for this test."}

Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nThe example above shows the common measurement result for this test. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nMyelin basic protein levels from 4 to 8 ng/mL may be a sign of a long-term (\nchronic\n) breakdown of myelin. It may also indicate recovery from an\nacute\nepisode of myelin breakdown.\nIf the myelin basic protein level is 9 ng/mL or greater, myelin is actively breaking down.\nImages\nLumbar puncture (spinal tap)\nReferences\nFabian MT, Krieger SC, Lublin FD.
