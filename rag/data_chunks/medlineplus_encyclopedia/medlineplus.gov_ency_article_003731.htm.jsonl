Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSmall intestine aspirate and culture\nSmall intestine aspirate and culture\nSmall intestine aspirate and culture is a lab test to check for infection in the small intestine.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA sample of fluid from the small intestine is needed. A sample is taken during an upper endoscopy (\nesophagogastroduodenoscopy\n, also called an EGD).\nThe fluid is placed in a special dish in the laboratory. It is watched for growth of bacteria or other organisms. This is called a culture.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou are not involved in the test once the sample is taken.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour health care provider may order this test if you have signs of too much bacteria growing in the intestinal tract. In most cases, other tests are done first. This test is rarely done outside of a research setting. In most cases, it has been replaced by a breath test that checks for excess bacteria in the small bowel.\nNormally, small amounts of bacteria are present in the small intestine and they do not cause disease."}

However, the test may be done when your provider suspects that excess growth of intestinal bacteria is causing diarrhea.\nNormal Results\nNo bacteria should be found.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be a sign of infection.\nRisks\nThere are no risks associated with a laboratory culture. The risks of the EGD procedure include:\nBleeding\nPerforation of (poking a hole in) the gastrointestinal tract by the scope\nInfection\nSome people may not be able to have this test because of other medical conditions.\nImages\nDuodenal tissue culture\nReferences\nHÃ¶egenauer C, Hammer HF.
