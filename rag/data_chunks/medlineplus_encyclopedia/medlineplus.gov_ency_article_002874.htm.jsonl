Pokeweed poisoning occurs when someone eats pieces of this plant.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\nPoisonous Ingredient\nPoisonous ingredients include:\nPhytolaccatoxin\nPhytolaccigenin\nWhere Found\nAll parts of the Pokeweed plant are toxic to humans. The highest amounts of poison are found in the roots, leaves, and stems. Small amounts are in the fruit.\nCooked berries and leaves (cooked twice in separate water) can technically be eaten. However, this is never recommended because there is no guarantee that they are safe."}
