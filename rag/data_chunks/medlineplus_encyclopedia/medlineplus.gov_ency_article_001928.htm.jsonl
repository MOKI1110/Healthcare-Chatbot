This is because development is faster during these years.\nEach visit includes a physical exam. At this exam, your child's health care provider will check your child's growth and development in order to find or prevent problems.\nYour provider will record your child's height, weight, and other important information. Hearing, vision, and other screening tests will be part of some visits. So will immunizations.\nEven if your child is healthy, well-child visits are a good time to focus on your child's wellness. Talking about ways to improve care and prevent problems helps keep your child healthy.\nInformation\nAt your well-child visits, you will get information on topics such as:\nSleep\nSafety\nChildhood diseases\nWhat to expect as your child grows\nWrite down your questions and concerns and bring them with you."}

Your child's height, weight, and head circumference are recorded on a\ngrowth chart\n. This chart remains part of your child's medical record. Talking about your child's growth is a good place to begin a discussion about your child's general health. Ask your provider about the body mass index (BMI) curve, which is the most important tool for identifying and preventing obesity.\nYour provider will also talk about other wellness topics such as family relationship issues, school, and access to community services.\nThere are several schedules for routine well-child visits."}
