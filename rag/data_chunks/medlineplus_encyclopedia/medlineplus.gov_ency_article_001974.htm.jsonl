Children who go to day care are often around other kids who may be sick. However, being around the large number of germs in day care may actually improve your child's immune system in the long run.\nInfection is spread most often by children putting dirty toys in their mouth. So, check your day care's cleaning practices. Teach your child to wash their hands before eating and after using the toilet. Keep your own children at home if they are sick.\nINFECTIONS AND GERMS\nDiarrhea and gastroenteritis are common at day care centers. These infections cause vomiting, diarrhea, or both.\nThe infection is spread easily from child-to-child or from caregiver-to-child. It is common among children because they are less likely to wash their hands after using the toilet.\nChildren who are attending day care may also get\ngiardiasis\n, which is caused by a parasite."}

This infection causes diarrhea, stomach cramps, and gas.\nEar infections, colds, coughs, sore throats, and runny noses are common in all children, especially in the day care setting.\nChildren attending day care are at risk of getting\nhepatitis A\n. Hepatitis A is irritation and swelling (inflammation) of the liver caused by the hepatitis A virus.\nIt is spread by poor or no hand washing after using the toilet or changing a diaper, and then preparing food.\nIn addition to good hand washing, day care staff and children should get the hepatitis A vaccine.\nBug infections, such as\nhead lice\nand\nscabies\n, are other common health problems that occur in day care centers.\nYou can do a number of things to keep your child safe from infections. One is to keep your child up-to-date with routine vaccines (\nimmunizations\n) to prevent both common and serious infections:\nTo see the current recommendations, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website --\nwww.cdc.gov/vaccines/\n."}
