But, when a baby cries a lot, it may be a sign of something that needs treatment.\nConsiderations\nInfants normally cry about 1 to 3 hours a day. It is perfectly normal for an infant to cry when hungry, thirsty, tired, lonely, or in pain. It is also normal for a baby to have a fussy period in the evening.\nBut, if an infant cries too often, there might be a health problem that needs attention.\nCauses\nInfants may cry because of any of the following:\nBoredom or loneliness\nColic\nDiscomfort or irritation from a wet or dirty diaper, excessive gas, or feeling cold\nHunger or thirst\nIllness\nInfection (a likely cause if the crying is accompanied by irritability,\nlethargy\n,\npoor appetite\n, or\nfever\n. You should contact your baby's health care provider)\nMedicines\nNormal muscle jerks and twitches that disturb the sleep\nPain\nTeething\nHome Care\nHome care depends on the causes."}

Follow your provider's advice.\nIf the infant seems constantly hungry despite short, frequent feedings, talk to your provider about normal growth and feeding times.\nIf crying is due to boredom or loneliness, it may be helpful to touch, hold, and talk to the infant more and place the infant within sight. Place baby-safe toys where the child can see them. If crying is due to sleep disturbance, wrap the baby firmly in a blanket before putting the infant to bed.\nFor excessive crying in infants due to cold, dress the infant warmly or adjust the temperature of the room. If adults are cold, the baby is also likely cold.\nAlways check for possible causes of pain or discomfort in a crying baby. When cloth diapers are used, look for diaper pins that have become loose or loose threads that have become tightly wrapped around fingers or toes. Diaper rashes also can be uncomfortable.\nTake your baby's temperature to check for fever. Check your baby head-to-toe for any injuries."}
