This is when your kidneys can no longer support your body's needs.\nEnd-stage kidney disease is also called end-stage renal disease (ESRD).\nCauses\nThe kidneys remove waste and excess water from the body. ESRD occurs when the kidneys are no longer able to work at a level needed for day-to-day life.\nThe most common causes of ESRD in the United States are\ndiabetes\nand\nhigh blood pressure\n. These conditions can damage your kidneys.\nESRD almost always comes after chronic kidney disease."}

The kidneys may slowly stop working during a period of 10 to 20 years before end-stage disease results.\nSymptoms\nCommon symptoms may include:\nGeneral ill feeling\nand\nfatigue\nItching (\npruritus\n) and dry skin\nHeadache\nWeight loss without trying\nLoss of appetite\nNausea\nOther symptoms may include:\nAbnormally dark or light skin\nNail changes\nBone pain\nDrowsiness\nand\nconfusion\nProblems concentrating or thinking\nNumbness in the hands, feet, or other areas\nMuscle twitching\nor cramps\nBreath odor\nEasy bruising, nosebleeds, or blood in the stool\nExcessive thirst\nFrequent hiccups\nProblems with sexual function\nMenstrual periods stop (amenorrhea)\nSleep problems\nSwelling of the feet and hands (\nedema\n)\nVomiting, often in the morning\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and order blood tests."}

People receiving dialysis will need these and other tests done often:\nPotassium\nSodium\nAlbumin\nPhosphorous\nCalcium\nCholesterol\nMagnesium\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nElectrolytes\nThis disease may also change the results of the following tests:\nVitamin D\nParathyroid hormone\nBone density test\nTreatment\nESRD may need to be treated with\ndialysis\nor\nkidney transplant\n."}

Dialysis removes waste from your blood when your kidneys can no longer do their job.\nUsually, you will go on dialysis when you have only 10% to 15% of your kidney function left.\nEven people who are waiting for a kidney transplant may need dialysis while waiting.\nTwo different methods are used to perform dialysis:\nDuring\nhemodialysis\n, your blood passes through a tube into an artificial kidney, or filter."}

The solution remains in your abdomen for period of time and then is removed. This method can be done at home, at work, or while traveling.\nKIDNEY TRANSPLANT\nA kidney transplant is surgery to place a healthy kidney into a person with kidney failure. Your provider will refer you to a transplant center. There, you will be seen and evaluated by the transplant team.
