To help\nmanage your blood sugar\n, follow a meal plan that has:\nFood from all the food groups\nFewer calories\nAbout the same amount of\ncarbohydrates\nat each meal and snack\nHealthy fats\nAlong with healthy eating, you can help keep your blood sugar in target range by maintaining a healthy weight. People with type 2 diabetes are often\noverweight or obese\n. Losing even 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms) can help you manage your diabetes better.

Eating healthy foods and staying active (for example, 150 total minutes of walking or other activity per week) can help you meet and maintain your weight loss goal. Activity lets your muscles use sugar from the blood without needing insulin to move the sugar into the muscle cells.\nHOW CARBOHYDRATES AFFECT BLOOD SUGAR\nCarbohydrates in food give your body energy. You need to eat carbohydrates to maintain your energy. But carbohydrates also raise your blood sugar higher and faster than other kinds of food.\nThe main kinds of carbohydrates are starches, sugars, and fiber. Learn which foods have carbohydrates. This will help with meal planning so that you can keep your blood sugar in your target range. Not all carbohydrates can be broken down and absorbed by your body. Foods with more non-digestible carbohydrates, or fiber, are less likely to increase your blood sugar out of your goal range. These include foods such as beans and whole grains.\nMEAL PLANNING FOR CHILDREN WITH TYPE 2 DIABETES\nMeal plans should consider the amount of calories children need to grow. In general, three small meals and three snacks a day can help meet calorie needs."}

In general, three small meals and three snacks a day can help meet calorie needs. Many children with type 2 diabetes are overweight. The goal should be able to reach a healthy weight by eating healthy foods and getting more activity (60 minutes per day).\nWork with a registered dietitian to design a meal plan for your child. A registered dietitian is an expert in food and nutrition.\nThe following tips can help your child stay on track:\nNo food is off-limits. Knowing how different foods affect your child's blood sugar helps you and your child keep blood sugar in target range.\nHelp your child learn how much food is a healthy amount. This is called portion control.\nHave your family gradually switch from drinking soda and other sugary drinks, such as sports drinks and juices, to plain water or low-fat milk.\nPLANNING MEALS\nEveryone has individual needs."}

Work with your health care provider, registered dietitian, or diabetes educator to develop a meal plan that works for you.\nWhen shopping,\nread food labels\nto make better food choices.\nA good way to make sure you get all the nutrients you need during meals is to use the plate method. This is a visual food guide that helps you choose the best types and right amounts of food to eat. It encourages larger portions of non-starchy vegetables (half the plate) and moderate portions of protein (one quarter of the plate) and starch (one quarter of the plate).\nEAT A VARIETY OF FOODS\nEating a wide variety of foods helps you stay healthy.  Try to include foods from all the food groups at each meal."}

Try to include foods from all the food groups at each meal. A detailed calculator of recommended amounts is available at\nwww.myplate.gov/eat-healthy\nbut general guidelines are:\nVEGETABLES (2 to 3 cups [360 to 550 grams] per day for women, 2 ½ to 4 c per day [450 to 720 g] per day for men with the lower end for those age 60 or older)\nChoose fresh or frozen vegetables without added sauces, fats, or salt. Non-starchy vegetables include dark green and deep yellow vegetables, such as cucumber, spinach, broccoli, romaine lettuce, cabbage, chard, and bell peppers. Starchy vegetables include corn, green peas, lima beans, carrots, yams and taro. Note that potato should be considered a pure starch, like white bread or white rice, instead of a vegetable.\nFRUITS (1 ½ to 2 c [240 to 320 g] per day for women, 2 to 2 ½ c [320 to 400 g] per day for men with the lower end for those age 60 or older)\nChoose fresh, frozen, canned (without added sugar or syrup), or unsweetened dried fruits."}

Try apples, bananas, berries, cherries, fruit cocktail, grapes, melon, oranges, peaches, pears, papaya, pineapple, and raisins. Drink juices that are 100% fruit with no added sweeteners or syrups.\nGRAINS (5 to 8 ounces [135 to 216 g] per day for women, 6 to 10 oz [162 to 270 g] per day for men with the lower end for those age 60 or older)\nThere are 2 types of grains:\nWhole grains are unprocessed and have the entire grain kernel. Examples are whole-wheat flour, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, amaranth, barley, brown and wild rice, buckwheat, and quinoa.\nRefined grains have been processed (milled) to remove the bran and germ. Examples are white flour, de-germed cornmeal, white bread, and white rice.\nGrains have starch, a type of carbohydrate. Carbohydrates raise your blood sugar level. For healthy eating, make sure half of the grains you eat each day are whole grains. Whole grains have lots of fiber."}

Eat fish and poultry more often. Remove the skin from chicken and turkey. Select lean cuts of beef, veal, pork, or wild game. Trim all visible fat from meat. Bake, roast, broil, grill, or boil instead of frying. When frying proteins, use healthy oils such as olive oil.\nDAIRY (3 c or 738 g a day)\nChoose low-fat dairy products. Be aware that milk, yogurt, and other dairy foods have natural sugar, even when they do not contain added sugar. Take this into account when planning meals to stay in your blood sugar target range. Some non-fat dairy products have a lot of added sugar."}

Oils are different from fats in that oils remain liquid at room temperature. Fats remain solid at room temperature.\nLimit your intake of fatty foods, especially those high in saturated fat, such as hamburgers, deep-fried foods, bacon, and butter.\nInstead, choose foods that are high in polyunsaturated or monounsaturated fats. These include fish, nuts, and vegetable oils.\nOils can raise your blood sugar, but not as fast as starch. Oils are also high in calories. Try to use no more than the recommended daily limit of 7 tsp (35 ml).\nWHAT ABOUT ALCOHOL AND SWEETS?\nIf you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount and have it with a meal.
