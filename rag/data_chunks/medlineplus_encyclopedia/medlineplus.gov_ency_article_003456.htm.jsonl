The proteins work with your immune system and play a role to protect the body from infections, and to remove dead cells and foreign material. Rarely, people may inherit deficiency of one or more complement proteins. These people are prone to certain infections or autoimmune disorders.\nThere are nine major complement proteins. They are labeled C1 through C9. This article describes the test that measures total complement activity.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. This is most often taken through a vein. The procedure is called a\nvenipuncture\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no special preparation.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel slight pain. Others may feel only a prick or sting."}

Others may feel only a prick or sting. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nTotal complement activity (CH50, CH100) looks at the overall activity of the complement system. In most cases, other tests that are more specific for the suspected disease are done first. C3 and C4 are the complement components measured most often.\nA complement test may be used to monitor people with an\nautoimmune disorder\n. It is also used to see if treatment for their condition is working. For example, people with active\nlupus erythematosus\nmay have lower-than-normal levels of the complement proteins\nC3\nand\nC4\n.\nComplement activity varies throughout the body. For example, in people with\nrheumatoid arthritis\n, complement activity in the blood may be normal or higher-than-normal, but much lower-than-normal in the joint fluid.\nPeople with some bacterial blood infections and\nshock\noften have very low C3 and components of what's known as the alternative pathway."}
