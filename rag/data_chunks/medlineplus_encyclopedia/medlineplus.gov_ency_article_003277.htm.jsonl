An abdominal hernia occurs when there is a weak spot in the abdominal wall. This allows the internal organs to bulge through the muscles of the abdomen. A hernia may appear after you strain, or lift something heavy, or after a long period of coughing.\nThere are several types of hernias, based on where they occur:\nInguinal hernia appears as a bulge in the groin or scrotum. This type is more common in men than women.\nIncisional hernia can occur through a scar if you have had abdominal surgery.\nUmbilical hernia\nappears as a bulge around the belly button."}

The surgery may be done through a large surgical cut, or through a smaller cut into which the surgeon inserts a camera and other instruments.\nAlternative Names\nAbdominal hernia; Hernia - abdominal; Abdominal wall defects; Lump in the abdominal wall; Abdominal wall mass\nReferences\nBall JW, Dains JE, Flynn JA, Solomon BS, Stewart RW.
