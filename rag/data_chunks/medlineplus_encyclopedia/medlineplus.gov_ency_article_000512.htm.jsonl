Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAcute tubular necrosis\nAcute tubular necrosis\nAcute tubular necrosis (ATN) is a kidney disorder involving damage to the tubule cells of the kidneys, which can lead to\nacute kidney failure\n. The tubules are tiny ducts in the kidneys that help filter the blood when it passes through the kidneys.\nCauses\nATN is often caused by a lack of blood flow and oxygen to the kidney tissues (ischemia of the kidneys). It may also occur if the kidney cells are damaged by a poison or harmful substance.\nThe internal structures of the kidney, particularly the tissues of the kidney tubule, become damaged or destroyed. ATN is one of the most common structural changes that can lead to acute kidney failure.\nATN is a common cause of kidney failure in people who are in the hospital."}

ATN is one of the most common structural changes that can lead to acute kidney failure.\nATN is a common cause of kidney failure in people who are in the hospital. Risks for ATN include:\nBlood transfusion reaction\nInjury or trauma that damages the muscles\nLow blood pressure (hypotension) that lasts longer than 30 minutes\nRecent major surgery\nSeptic shock\n(serious condition that occurs when a body-wide infection leads to dangerously low blood pressure)\nLiver disease and kidney damage caused by diabetes (\ndiabetic nephropathy\n) may make a person more prone to develop ATN.\nATN can also be caused by medicines that are toxic to the kidneys. These medicines include aminoglycoside antibiotics and the antifungal drug amphotericin.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nDecreased consciousness\n, coma,\ndelirium\nor\nconfusion\n, drowsiness, and lethargy\nDecreased urine output\nor no urine output\nGeneral swelling, fluid retention\nNausea, vomiting\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. Your provider may hear abnormal sounds when listening to the heart and lungs with a stethoscope."}

The goal of treatment is to prevent life-threatening complications of acute kidney failure\nTreatment focuses on preventing the buildup of fluids and wastes, while allowing the kidneys to heal.\nTreatment may include any of the following:\nIdentifying and treating the underlying cause of the problem\nRestricting fluid intake\nTaking medicines to help control the potassium level in the blood\nMedicines taken by mouth or through an IV to help remove fluid from the body\nTemporary\ndialysis\ncan remove excess waste and fluids.

Kidney function often returns to normal, but there may be other serious problems and complications.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your urine output decreases or stops, or if you develop other symptoms of ATN.\nPrevention\nPromptly treating conditions that can lead to decreased blood flow as well as decreased oxygen to the kidneys can reduce the risk for ATN.\nBlood transfusions are crossmatched to reduce the risk of incompatibility reactions.\nDiabetes, liver disorders, and heart problems need to be managed well to reduce the risk for ATN.\nIf you know you're taking medicine that can injure your kidneys, ask your provider about having your blood level of the medicine checked regularly.\nDrink a lot of fluids after having any contrast dyes to allow them to be removed from the body and reduce the risk for kidney damage.\nAlternative Names\nNecrosis - renal tubular; ATN; Necrosis - acute tubular\nImages\nKidney anatomy\nKidney - blood and urine flow\nReferences\nGunni"}
