They can be felt in your chest, throat, or neck.\nYou may:\nHave an unpleasant awareness of your own heartbeat\nFeel like your heart skipped or stopped beats\nYour heart's rhythm may be normal or abnormal when you have palpitations.\nConsiderations\nNormally the heart beats 60 to 100 times per minute. The rate may drop below 60 beats per minute in people who exercise regularly or take medicines that slow the heart.\nIf your heart rate is fast (over 100 beats per minute), this is called tachycardia. A heart rate slower than 60 is called bradycardia. An occasional extra heartbeat out of rhythm is known as\nextrasystole\n.\nPalpitations are not serious most of the time."}
