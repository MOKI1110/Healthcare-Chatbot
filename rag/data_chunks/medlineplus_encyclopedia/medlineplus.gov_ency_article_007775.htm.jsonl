These vaccines teach your body how to defend against the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19.\nCOVID-19 vaccines have been shown to do a very good job of:\nPreventing infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19\nProtecting against serious illness, hospitalization, and death from COVID-19\nReducing the risk of people spreading COVID-19\nmRNA VACCINES\nThe mRNA vaccines approved in the United States work differently from many other vaccines.\nCOVID-19 mRNA vaccines use messenger RNA (mRNA) to tell cells in the body how to briefly create a harmless piece of spike protein that is unique to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Cells then get rid of the mRNA.\nThis spike protein triggers an immune response inside your body, making antibodies that protect against COVID-19."}

Your immune system then learns to attack the SARS-CoV-2 virus if you are ever exposed to it.\nThere are two mRNA COVID-19 vaccines currently approved for use in the United States, the Pfizer-BioNTech and the Moderna COVID-19 vaccines.\nThe COVID-19 mRNA vaccine is given as an injection (shot) in the arm. The 2024-2025 mRNA vaccines protect against the current strains of the COVID-19 virus.\nSUBUNIT VACCINE\nThe Novavax vaccine is a protein subunit vaccine. The vaccine includes harmless pieces of the spike protein that causes COVID-19. The vaccine triggers the body to develop antibodies to protect you from the virus. The 2024-2025 Novavax vaccine also protects against current strains of the COVID-19 virus.\nVACCINATION SCHEDULE\nThe vaccination schedule is based on your age, vaccination history, and whether you are moderately or severely immunocompromised.\nEveryone ages 5 years and older\nshould get 1 dose of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccine."}

Talk with your health care provider about additional doses.\nChildren ages 6 months and older\nmay need multiple doses of the 2024-2025 Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines, depending on their COVID-19 vaccination history. Talk with your provider about what is right for your child.\nPeople ages 12 years and older\nalso have the option to get the 2024-2025 Novavax vaccine. You will get 1 dose of the vaccine unless you have never received any COVID-19 vaccine before. In that case, you will need 2 doses of the 2024-2025 Novavax vaccines to be up to date. People age 65 and older need a 3rd vaccine dose of any type 6 months later.\nPeople who recently had COVID-19 may delay getting a COVID-19 vaccine for 3 months."}

You may choose to get the vaccine sooner if you or someone in your family are at severe risk of illness or if there are high local rates of COVID-19.\nVACCINE MYTHS\nCOVID-19 vaccines:\nDo not\ncontain any live virus, and they cannot give you COVID-19\nDo not\naffect or interfere with your genes (DNA)\nDo not\naffect or interfere with pregnancy, nor do they make you infertile\nTo get up-to-date accurate information about COVID-19 vaccines, go to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website:\nCOVID-19 vaccines -\nwww.cdc.gov/covid/vaccines/index.html\nVACCINE SIDE EFFECTS\nWhile COVID-19 vaccines will not make you sick, they may cause certain side effects and flu-like symptoms.

They continue to be closely monitored to ensure they are safe and effective.\nThere have been reports of some people who have had an allergic reaction to the current vaccines. So it is important to follow certain precautions:\nIf you have ever had a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a particular type of COVID-19 vaccine, you should not get that vaccine.

Your provider will help you decide if it is safe to get vaccinated.\nSerious health events from COVID-19 vaccines, such as an allergic reaction, are rare.

Studies show that this rare risk may be reduced by waiting 8 weeks between the first and second dose.\nWith proper care and rest, most people who had the reaction got better quickly without any lasting effects.\nFor people who had this rare reaction, it is important to talk with a cardiologist (heart doctor) about how and when to return to exercise and sports.\nSymptoms of myocarditis and pericarditis include:\nChest pain\nShortness of breath\nFast-beating heart, fluttering, or pounding heart\nIf your child or teenager has any of these symptoms, get medical help right away.\nAll these associations are so rare that they should not cause hesitation in receiving any of these vaccines.\nCDC recommends that people may still get vaccinated if they have a history of:\nSevere allergic react"}
