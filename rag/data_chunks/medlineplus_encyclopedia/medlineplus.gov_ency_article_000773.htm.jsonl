This nerve is called the facial or seventh cranial nerve.\nDamage to this nerve causes weakness or paralysis of these muscles.\nParalysis\nmeans that you cannot use the muscles at all.\nCauses\nBell palsy can affect people of any age, most commonly those over age 65 years. It can also affect children younger than 10 years. Males and females are equally affected.\nBell palsy is thought to be due to\nswelling\n(inflammation) of the facial nerve in the area where it travels through the bones of the skull. This nerve controls movement of the muscles of the face.\nThe cause is often not clear. A type of herpes infection called herpes simplex or\nherpes zoster\nmight be involved."}

Other conditions that may affect the seventh cranial nerve include:\nHIV/AIDS infection\nLyme disease\nMiddle\near infection\nSarcoidosis\n(inflammation of the lymph nodes, lungs, liver, eyes, skin, or other tissues)\nHaving diabetes and being pregnant may increase the risk for Bell palsy.\nSymptoms\nSometimes, you may have a cold shortly before the symptoms of Bell palsy begin.\nSymptoms most often start suddenly, but may take 2 to 3 days to become fully developed. They do not become more severe after that.\nSymptoms are almost always on one side of the face only. They may range from mild to severe.\nMany people feel discomfort behind the ear before weakness is noticed. The face feels stiff or pulled to one side and may look different."}

Symptoms often begin to improve right away. But, it may take weeks or even months for the muscles to get stronger.\nYour provider may give you lubricating eye drops or eye ointments to keep the surface of the eye moist if you can't close it completely. You may need to wear an eye patch while you sleep.\nOften, medicines may be used to improve the chances of recovery, but they must be started right away."}

Common medicines are:\nCorticosteroids, which may reduce swelling around the facial nerve\nMedicines such as valacyclovir to fight the virus that may be causing Bell palsy\nSurgery to relieve pressure on the nerve (decompression surgery) has not been shown to benefit most people with Bell palsy.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost cases go away completely within a few weeks to months.\nIf you did not lose all of your nerve function and symptoms began to improve within 3 weeks, you are more likely to regain all or most of the strength in your facial muscles.\nSometimes, the following symptoms may still be present:\nLong-term changes in taste\nSpasms of muscles or eyelids\nWeakness that remains in facial muscles\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nEye surface becoming dry, leading to eye sores, infections, and vision loss\nSwelling in the muscles due to loss of nerve function\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider right away if your face droops or you have other symptoms"}
