The term acquired means these conditions are not present at birth.\nCauses\nPlatelet disorders can affect the number of platelets, how well they function, or both. A platelet disorder impairs normal blood clotting.\nDisorders that can cause a reduced number of platelets or affect platelet function include:\nIdiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura\n(bleeding disorder in which the immune system destroys platelets)\nChronic myelogenous leukemia\n(blood cancer that starts inside bone marrow)\nMultiple myeloma\n(blood cancer that starts in the plasma cells in the bone marrow)\nPrimary\nmyelofibrosis\n(bone marrow disorder in which the marrow is replaced by fibrous scar tissue)\nPolycythemia vera\n(bone marrow disease that leads to an abnormal increase in the number of blood cells)\nPrimary thrombocythemia\n(bone marrow disorder in which the marrow produces too m"}
