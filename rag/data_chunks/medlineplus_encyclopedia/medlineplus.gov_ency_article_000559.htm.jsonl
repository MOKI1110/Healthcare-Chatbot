Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCongenital protein C or S deficiency\nCongenital protein C or S deficiency\nCongenital protein C or S deficiency is a lack of proteins C or S in the fluid part of the blood. The proteins are natural substances that help prevent\nblood clots\n.\nCauses\nCongenital protein C or S deficiency is an inherited disorder. This means it is passed down through families. Congenital means it is present at birth.\nThe disorder causes abnormal blood clotting.\nOn average, 1 in 350 people has one normal gene and one variant gene for protein C deficiency.\nProtein S deficiency is rare and its prevalence is unknown.\nSymptoms\nIf you have this condition, you are more likely to develop blood clots, especially at a younger age or in unusual areas, such as the veins in the abdominal cavity."}

The symptoms are the same as for\ndeep vein thrombosis\n, and include:\nPain or tenderness in the affected area\nRedness or\nswelling\nin the affected area\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history and symptoms.\nLab tests will be done to check the levels of proteins C and S.\nTreatment\nBlood-thinning medicines are used to treat and prevent blood clots.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome is usually good with treatment, but symptoms may return, especially if blood-thinning agents are stopped.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nChildhood\nstroke\nMore than one pregnancy loss (recurrent\nmiscarriage\n)\nRecurrent clots in the veins\nPulmonary embolism\n(blood clot in a lung artery)\nIn rare cases, using warfarin to thin the blood and prevent clots can cause brief increased clotting and severe skin wounds."}

People with these conditions are at risk if they are not treated with the blood-thinning medicine heparin before taking warfarin.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have symptoms of clotting in a vein (swelling and redness of the leg).\nPrevention\nIf your provider diagnoses you with this disorder, you should be careful to prevent clots from forming. This can occur when the blood moves slowly in the veins, such as from prolonged bed rest during an illness, surgery, pregnancy or hospital stay. It may also occur after long airplane or car trips.\nAlternative Names\nProtein S deficiency; Protein C deficiency\nImages\nBlood clot formation\nBlood clots\nReferences\nAnderson JAM, Weitz JI.
