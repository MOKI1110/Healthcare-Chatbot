Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAnti-DNase B blood test\nAnti-DNase B blood test\nAnti-DNase B is a blood test to look for antibodies to a substance (protein) produced by group A streptococcus\n.\nThis is the bacteria that cause\nstrep throat\n.\nWhen used together with the\nASO titer test\n, more than 90% of past streptococcal infections can be identified.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample is needed\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is most often done to tell if you have previously had a strep infection and if you might have\nrheumatic fever\nor kidney problems (\nglomerulonephritis\n) due to that infection.\nNormal Results\nA negative test is normal. Some people have low concentrations of antibodies, but they have not had a recent strep infection."}

Some people have low concentrations of antibodies, but they have not had a recent strep infection. Therefore, normal values in different age groups are:\nAdults: less than 85 units/milliliter (mL)\nSchool-age children: less than 170 units/mL\nPreschool children: less than 60 units/mL\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different specimens. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIncreased levels of DNase B levels indicate exposure to group A streptococcus.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
