Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nIntrauterine growth restriction\nIntrauterine growth restriction\nIntrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) refers to the poor growth of a baby while in the mother's womb during pregnancy.\nCauses\nMany different things can lead to IUGR. An unborn baby may not get enough oxygen and nutrition from the placenta during pregnancy because of:\nMother living at high altitude\nMultiple pregnancy, such as twins or triplets\nPlacenta problems\nPreeclampsia\nor\neclampsia\nProblems at birth (congenital abnormalities) or chromosome problems are often associated with below-normal weight. Infections during pregnancy can also affect the weight of the developing baby."}

Infections during pregnancy can also affect the weight of the developing baby. These include:\nCytomegalovirus\nRubella\nSyphilis\nToxoplasmosis\nRisk factors in the mother that may contribute to IUGR include:\nAlcohol abuse\nSmoking\nIllicit drug use\nClotting disorders\nHigh blood pressure or heart disease\nDiabetes\nKidney disease\nPoor nutrition\nThyroid disease\nAnemia\nUterine malformations\nMultiple gestation\nOther chronic disease\nIf the mother is small, it may be normal for her baby to be small, and this is not due to IUGR.\nDepending on the cause of IUGR, the developing baby may be small all over. Or, the baby's head may be normal size while the rest of the body is small.\nSymptoms\nA pregnant woman may feel that her baby is not as big as it should be. The measurement from the mother's pubic bone to the top of the uterus will be smaller than expected for the baby's gestational age. This measurement is called the uterine fundal height.\nExams and Tests\nIUGR may be suspected if the size of the pregnant woman's uterus is small."}

This measurement is called the uterine fundal height.\nExams and Tests\nIUGR may be suspected if the size of the pregnant woman's uterus is small. The condition is most often confirmed by\nultrasound\n.\nMore tests may be needed to screen for infection or genetic problems if IUGR is suspected.\nTreatment\nIUGR increases the risk that the baby will die inside the womb before birth. If your health care provider thinks you might have IUGR, you will be monitored closely. This will include regular pregnancy ultrasounds to measure the baby's growth, movements, blood flow, and fluid around the baby.\nNonstress testing will also be done. This involves listening to the baby's heart rate for a period of 20 to 30 minutes.\nDepending on the results of these tests, your baby may need to be delivered early.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAfter delivery, the newborn's growth and development depends on the severity and cause of IUGR. Discuss the baby's outlook with your providers.\nPossible Complications\nIUGR increases the risk of pregnancy and newborn complications, depending on the cause."}
