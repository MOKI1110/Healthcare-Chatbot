It is most often done with other tests to measure\nesophageal function.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is done in a gastroenterology laboratory. A nasogastric (NG) tube is passed through one side of your nose and into your esophagus. Mild hydrochloric acid will be sent down the tube, followed by salt water (saline) solution. This process may be repeated several times.\nYou will be asked to tell the health care team about any pain or discomfort you have during the test.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will be asked not to eat or drink anything for 8 hours before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may have a gagging feeling and some discomfort when the tube is put in place. The acid may cause symptoms of heartburn. Your throat may be sore after the test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test tries to reproduce symptoms of\ngastroesophageal reflux\n(stomach acids coming back up into the esophagus)."}
