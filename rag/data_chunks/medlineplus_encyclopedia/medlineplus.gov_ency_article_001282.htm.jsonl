Normally, it moves forward and out of the penis through the urethra during ejaculation.\nCauses\nRetrograde ejaculation is uncommon. It most often occurs when the opening of the bladder (bladder neck) does not close. This causes semen to go backward into the bladder rather than forward out of the penis.\nRetrograde ejaculation may be caused by:\nDiabetes\nSome medicines, including medicines used to treat\nhigh blood pressure\nand some mood-altering medicines\nMedicines or surgery to treat prostate or urethra problems\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nCloudy urine after orgasm\nLittle or no semen is released during ejaculation\nExams and Tests\nurinalysis\nthat is taken soon after ejaculation will show a large amount of sperm in the urine.\nTreatment\nYour health care provider may recommend that you stop taking any medicines that may cause retrograde ejaculation."}

This can make the problem go away.\nRetrograde ejaculation that is caused by diabetes or surgery may be treated with medicines such as pseudoephedrine or imipramine.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf the problem is caused by a medicine, normal ejaculation will often come back after the medicine is stopped. Retrograde ejaculation caused by surgery or diabetes often can't be corrected. This is most often not a problem unless you are trying to conceive. Some men do not like how it feels and seek treatment. Otherwise, there is no need for treatment.\nPossible Complications\nThe condition may cause\ninfertility\n."}
