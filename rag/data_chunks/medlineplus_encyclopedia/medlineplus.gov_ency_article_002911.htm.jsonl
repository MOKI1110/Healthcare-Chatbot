It is also called a cesarean delivery.\nDescription\nA C-section delivery is done when it is not possible or safe for the mother to deliver the baby through the vagina.\nThe procedure is most often done while the woman is awake. The body is numbed from the chest to the feet using epidural or spinal anesthesia.\n1. The surgeon makes a cut across the belly just above the pubic area.\n2. The womb (uterus) and amniotic sac are opened.\n3. The baby is delivered through this opening.\nThe health care team clears fluids from the baby's mouth and nose. The umbilical cord is cut. The  health care provider will make sure that the infant's breathing is normal and other vital signs are stable.\nThe mother is awake during the procedure so she will be able to hear and see her baby."}

The decision will depend on your provider, where you are having the baby, your previous deliveries, and your medical history.\nProblems with the baby may include:\nAbnormal heart rate\nAbnormal position\nin the womb, such as crosswise (transverse) or feet-first (breech)\nDevelopmental problems, such as hydrocephalus or spina bifida\nMultiple pregnancy (twins, triplets, or more)\nHealth problems in the mother may include:\nActive genital herpes infection\nLarge uterine fibroids near the cervix\nHIV infection in the mother\nPast C-section\nPast surgery on the uterus\nSevere illness, such as heart disease,\npreeclampsia\nor\neclampsia\nProblems at the time of labor or delivery may include:\nBaby's head is too large to pass t"}

The rate of serious complications is very low. However, certain risks are higher after C-section than after vaginal delivery. These include:\nInfection of the bladder or uterus\nInjury to the urinary tract\nHigher average blood loss\nMost of the time, a blood transfusion is not needed, but risk of transfusion is higher.\nA C-section may also cause problems in future pregnancies."}

Take advantage of the time to bond with your baby, get some rest, and receive some help with breastfeeding and caring for your baby.\nRecovery takes longer than it would from a vaginal birth. You should walk around after the C-section to speed recovery. Pain medicines taken by mouth can help ease discomfort.\nRecovery after a C-section at home\nis slower than after a vaginal delivery. You may have bleeding from your vagina for up to 6 weeks."}

Not all hospitals or providers offer the option of VBAC. There is a small risk of uterine rupture, which can harm the mother and the baby.
