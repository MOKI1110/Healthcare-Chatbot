Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLeft heart catheterization\nLeft heart catheterization\nLeft heart catheterization is the passage of a thin flexible tube (catheter) into the left side of the heart. It is done to diagnose or treat certain heart problems.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou may be given a mild medicine (sedative) before the procedure starts. The medicine is to help you relax. The health care provider will place an IV into your arm to give medicines. You will lie on a padded table. Your doctor (most often a heart specialist called a cardiologist) will make a small puncture on your body near one of your arteries. A flexible tube (catheter) is inserted into and threaded through the artery. It will be placed in your wrist, arm or your upper leg (groin). You will most likely be awake during the procedure.\nLive x-ray pictures are used to help guide the catheters up into your heart and arteries. Dye (sometimes called \"contrast\") will be injected into your body. This dye will highlight blood flow through the arteries."}

Dye (sometimes called \"contrast\") will be injected into your body. This dye will highlight blood flow through the arteries. This helps show blockages in the blood vessels that lead to your heart.\nThe catheter is then moved through the aortic valve into the left side of your heart. The pressure is measured in the heart in this position. Other procedures can also be done at this time, such as:\nVentriculography\nto check the heart's pumping function.\nCoronary angiography\nto look at the coronary arteries.\nAngioplasty\n, with or without stenting, to correct blockages in the arteries is then performed.\nThe procedure may last from less than 1 hour to several hours.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nIn most cases, you should not eat or drink for 8 hours before the test. (your cardiologist may give you different directions.)\nThe procedure will take place in the hospital. You may be admitted the night before the test, but it is more common to come to the hospital the morning of the procedure."}

In some cases, this procedure is done after you have already been admitted to the hospital possibly on an emergency basis.\nYou will wear a hospital gown. Your cardiologist will explain the procedure and its risks. You must sign a consent form.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe sedative will help you relax before the procedure. However, you will be awake and able to follow instructions during the test.\nYou will be given local numbing medicine (anesthesia) before the catheter is inserted. You will feel some pressure as the catheter is inserted. However, you should not feel any pain."}
