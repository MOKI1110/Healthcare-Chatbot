This problem may occur in one kidney.\nCauses\nHydronephrosis (kidney swelling) occurs as the result of a disease. It is not a disease itself. Conditions that may lead to hydronephrosis include:\nBlockage of a ureter due to scarring caused by prior infections, surgeries, or radiation treatments\nBlockage from an enlarged uterus during pregnancy\nBirth defects of the urinary system\nBack flow of urine from bladder to kidney, called vesicoureteral reflux\n(may occur as a birth defect or due to an enlarged prostate or narrowing of the urethra)\nKidney stones\nCancers or tumors that occur in the ureter, bladder, pelvis or abdomen\nProblems with the nerves that supply the bladder\nThe blockage and swelling of the kidney may occur suddenly or may develop slowly.\nSymptoms\nCommon symptoms include:\nFlank pain\nAbdominal mass\n, especially in children\nNausea and vomiting\nUrinary tract infection (UTI)\nFever\nPainful urination (dysuria)\nIncreased ur"}

Treatment may include:\nPlacing a stent (tube) through the bladder and ureter to allow urine to flow from the kidney into the bladder\nPlacing a tube into the kidney through the skin\nto allow the blocked urine to drain out of the body into a drainage bag\nAntibiotics for infections\nSurgery to correct the blockage or reflux\nRemoval of any stone that is causing blockage\nPeople who have only one kidney, who have a weakened immune system (such as due to diabetes or HIV), or who have had a kidney transplant will need treatment right away.\nPeople who have long-term hydronephrosis may need antibiotics to reduce the risk o"}

Kidney failure is rare if the other kidney is working normally. However,\nkidney failure\nwill occur if there is only one functioning kidney. UTI and pain may also occur.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have ongoing or severe flank pain, or fever, or if you think you may have hydronephrosis.\nPrevention\nPrevention of the disorders that cause this condition will prevent it from occurring.\nAlternative Names\nHydronephrosis; Chronic hydronephrosis; Acute hydronephrosis; Urinary obstruction; Unilateral hydronephrosis; Nephrolithiasis - hydronephrosis; Kidney stone - hydronephrosis; Renal calculi - hydronephrosis; Ureteral calculi - hydronephrosis; Vesicoureteral reflux - hydronephrosis; Obstructive uropathy - hydronephrosis\nImages\nFe"}
