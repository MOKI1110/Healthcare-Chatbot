Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nDextrocardia\nDextrocardia\nDextrocardia is a condition in which the heart is pointed toward the right side of the chest. Normally, the heart points toward the left. The condition is present at birth (congenital).\nCauses\nDuring the early weeks of pregnancy, the baby's heart develops. Sometimes, it turns so that it points to the right side of the chest instead of the left side. The reasons for this are unclear.\nThere are several types of dextrocardia. Many types involve other defects of the heart and abdomen area.\nIn the simplest type of dextrocardia, the heart is a mirror image of the normal heart and there are no other problems. This condition is rare. When this occurs, the organs of the abdomen and the lungs will often also be arranged in a mirror image. For example, the liver will be on the left side instead of the right.\nSome people with mirror-image dextrocardia have a problem with the fine hairs (cilia) that filter the air going into their nose and air passages."}

This condition is called Kartagener syndrome.\nIn the more common types of dextrocardia, other heart defects are also present. The most common of these include:\nDouble outlet right ventricle\n(the aorta connects to the right ventricle instead of to the left ventricle)\nEndocardial cushion defect\n(the walls separating all 4 chambers of the heart are poorly formed or absent)\nPulmonary stenosis\n(narrowing of the pulmonary valve) or\natresia\n(pulmonary valve does not form properly)\nSingle ventricle (instead of two ventricles, there is a single ventricle)\nTransposition of the great vessels\n(the aorta and pulmonary artery are switched)\nVentricular septal defect\n(hole in the wall that separates the right and left ventricles of the heart)\nThe abdominal and chest organs in babies with dextrocardia may be abnormal and may not work correctly. A very serious syndrome that appears with dextrocardia is called heterotaxy."}

A very serious syndrome that appears with dextrocardia is called heterotaxy. In this condition, many of the organs are not in their usual places and may not work properly. For example, the spleen may be completely missing. The spleen is an important part of the immune system, so babies born without this organ are in danger of severe bacterial infections and death. In another form of heterotaxy, several small spleens exist, but they may not work correctly.\nHeterotaxy may also include:\nAbnormal gallbladder system\nProblems with the lungs\nProblems with the structure or position of the intestines\nSevere heart defects\nAbnormalities of the blood vessels\nPossible risk factors for dextrocardia include a family history of the condition.\nSymptoms\nThere are no symptoms of dextrocardia if the heart is normal.\nConditions that may include dextrocardia may cause the following symptoms:\nBluish skin (\ncyanosis\n)\nDifficulty breathing\nFailure to grow and gain weight\nFatigue\nYellow skin and eyes (\njaundice\n)\nPale skin (\npallor\n)\nRepeated sinus or lung infections\nExams and Tests\nYou"}

It is important, however, to let your child's provider know the heart is on the right side of the chest. This information can be important in some exams and tests.\nThe type of treatment needed depends on the heart or physical problems the infant may have in addition to dextrocardia.\nIf heart defects are present with dextrocardia, the baby will most likely need surgery.
