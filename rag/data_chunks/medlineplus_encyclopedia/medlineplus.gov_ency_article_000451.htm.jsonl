They are long-term (chronic) diseases that cause joint pain and swelling. The names describing this group of conditions has changed over the past several decades as more is learned about the condition.\nCauses\nThe cause of JIA is not known. It is thought to be an\nautoimmune illness\n. This means the body attacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake.\nJIA most often develops before age 16. Symptoms may start as early as 6 months old.\nThe International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) has proposed the following way of grouping this type of childhood arthritis:\nSystemic-onset JIA. Involves joint swelling or pain, fevers, and rash. It is the least common type but it can be the most severe. It appears to be different than the other types of JIA and is similar to Adult Onset Stills Disease.\nPolyarthritis. Involves many joints."}

It is the least common type but it can be the most severe. It appears to be different than the other types of JIA and is similar to Adult Onset Stills Disease.\nPolyarthritis. Involves many joints. This form of JIA may turn into rheumatoid arthritis. It may involve 5 or more large and small joints of the legs and arms, as well as the jaw and neck. Rheumatoid factor may be present.\nOligoarthritis (persistent and extended). Involves 1 to 4 joints, most often the wrists, or knees. It also affects the eyes.\nEnthesitis-related arthritis. Resembles spondyloarthritis in adults and often involves the sacroiliac joint.\nPsoriatic arthritis. Diagnosed in children who have arthritis and psoriasis or nail disease, or have a close family member with psoriasis.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of JIA may include:\nSwollen, red, or warm joint\nLimping or problems using a limb\nSudden high fever, which may come back\nRash (on trunk and extremities) that comes and goes with fever\nStiffness, pain, and\nlimited movement\nof a joint\nLow back pain that does not go away\nBodywide symptoms such as pale skin, swollen lymph gland, and a sick appearance\nJIA can also cause eye problems called\nuveitis\n, iridocyclitis, or iritis."}

There may be no eye symptoms. When eye symptoms occur, they can include:\nRed eyes\nEye pain\n, which may get worse when looking at light (\nphotophobia\n)\nVision changes\nExams and Tests\nThe physical exam may show swollen, warm, and tender joints that hurt to move. The child may have a rash. Other signs include:\nSwollen liver\nSwollen spleen\nSwollen lymph nodes\nBlood tests may include:\nRheumatoid factor\nAnti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (\nESR\n)\nAntinuclear antibody (\nANA\n)\nComplete blood count (\nCBC\n)\nHLA-B27\nAny or all of these blood tests may be normal in children with JIA.\nThe health care provider may place a small needle into a swollen joint to remove fluid. This can help to find the cause of the arthritis. It can also help relieve pain."}

Because of their toxicity, long-term use of these medicines should be avoided in children.\nChildren who have arthritis in many joints, or who have fever, rash, and swollen glands may need other medicines. These are called disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). They can help reduce swelling in the joints or body."}
