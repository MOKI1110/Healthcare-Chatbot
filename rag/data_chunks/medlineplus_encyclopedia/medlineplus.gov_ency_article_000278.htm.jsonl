The virus is present about 15 to 45 days before symptoms occur and during the first week of illness.\nYou can catch hepatitis A if:\nYou eat or drink food or water that has been contaminated by stools (feces) containing the hepatitis A virus. Unpeeled and uncooked fruits and vegetables, shellfish, ice, and water are common sources of the disease.\nYou come in contact with the stool or blood of a person who currently has the disease.\nA person with hepatitis A passes the virus to an object or food due to poor hand-washing after using the toilet.\nYou take part in sexual practices that involve oral-anal contact.\nNot everyone has symptoms with hepatitis A infection."}

Therefore, many more people are infected than are diagnosed or reported.\nRisk factors include:\nOverseas travel, especially to Asia, South or Central America, Africa and the Middle East\nInjection drug use\nLiving in a nursing home\nWorking in a health care, daycare, food, or sewage industry\nEating raw shellfish such as oysters and clams\nOther common hepatitis virus infections include hepatitis B and hepatitis C. Hepatitis A is the least serious and mildest of these diseases, but can still be a dangerous illness.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms most often show up 2 to 6 weeks after being exposed to the hepatitis A virus."}

Nearly all people get better within 6 months. There is no lasting damage once you've recovered."}

Travelers should peel all fresh fruits and vegetables themselves.\nDO NOT buy food from street vendors.\nGet vaccinated against hepatitis A (and possibly hepatitis B) if traveling to countries where outbreaks of the disease occur.\nUse only carbonated bottled water for brushing teeth and drinking.
