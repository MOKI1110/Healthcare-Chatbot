Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBlood pressure measurement\nBlood pressure measurement\nBlood pressure is a measurement of the force on the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps blood through your body.\nYou can measure your blood pressure at home. You can also have it checked at your health care provider's office, many pharmacies, or even at some fire stations.\nHow the Test is Performed\nSit in a chair with your back supported. Your legs should be uncrossed, and your feet on the floor.\nYour arm should be supported so that your upper arm is at heart level. Roll up your sleeve so that your arm is bare. Be sure the sleeve is not bunched up and squeezing your arm. If it is, take your arm out of the sleeve, or remove the shirt entirely.\nYou or your provider will wrap the blood pressure cuff snugly around your upper arm. The lower edge of the cuff should be 1 inch (2.5 cm) above the bend of your elbow.\nThe cuff will be inflated quickly. This is done either by pumping the squeeze bulb or pushing a button on the device attached to the cuff."}

This is done either by pumping the squeeze bulb or pushing a button on the device attached to the cuff. You will feel tightness around your arm.\nNext, the valve of the cuff is opened slightly, allowing the pressure to slowly fall. This happens automatically with most devices used at home.\nAs the pressure falls, the reading when the sound of blood pulsing is first heard is recorded. This is the systolic pressure.\nAs the air continues to be let out, the sounds will disappear. The point at which the sound stops is recorded. This is the diastolic pressure.\nInflating the cuff too slowly or not inflating it to a high enough pressure may cause a false reading."}

If you loosen the valve too much, you will not be able to measure your blood pressure.\nThe procedure should be done two or more times.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nBefore you measure your blood pressure:\nRest for at least 5 minutes, 10 minutes is better, before blood pressure is taken.\nDO NOT take your blood pressure when you are under stress, have had caffeine or used tobacco in the past 30 minutes, or have exercised recently.\nTake 2 or 3 readings at a sitting. Take the readings 1 minute apart. Remain seated. When checking your blood pressure on your own, note the time of the readings."}

Take the readings 1 minute apart. Remain seated. When checking your blood pressure on your own, note the time of the readings. Your provider may suggest that you do your readings at certain times of the day.\nA typical approach is to take your blood pressure before breakfast and dinner for 5 days.\nThis will give you at least 10 readings and will help your provider make decisions about your blood pressure treatment.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will feel slight discomfort when the blood pressure cuff is inflated to its highest level.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nHigh blood pressure has no symptoms (except in rare, extreme situations), so you may not know if you have this problem. High blood pressure is often discovered during a visit to your provider for another reason, such as a routine physical exam.\nFinding high blood pressure and treating it early can help prevent heart disease,\nstroke\n, eye problems, or\nchronic kidney disease\n."}

In people with very high blood pressure, this is when they are most at risk for a heart attack and stroke.\nBlood pressure readings taken at home are usually a better measure of your current blood pressure than those taken at your provider's office.\nMake sure your home blood pressure monitor is accurate.\nAsk your provider to compare your home readings with those taken in the office.\nMany people get nervous at their provider's office and have higher readings than they have at home.
