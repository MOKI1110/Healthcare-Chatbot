It can occur in people who have a very high blood\ntriglyceride level\n. These people also frequently have\ndiabetes\n.\nCauses\nEruptive xanthomatosis is a rare skin condition caused by an excessively high triglyceride level in the blood. It can occur in people with poorly-controlled diabetes or in people who take some medicines, such as isotretinoin, estrogens, and cyclosporine, which can increase the triglyceride levels.\nCholesterol and triglycerides are types of fats that naturally occur in your blood. High levels increase the risk for heart disease and other health problems.\nWhen diabetes is not well-controlled, the insufficient insulin level makes it harder for the body to break down fats in the blood. This increases the level of fats in the blood."}
