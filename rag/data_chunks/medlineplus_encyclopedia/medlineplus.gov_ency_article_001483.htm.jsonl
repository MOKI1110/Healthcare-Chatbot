The problem most often develops after uterine surgery.\nCauses\nAsherman syndrome is a rare condition. In most cases, it occurs in women who have had several\ndilatation and curettage\n(D&C) procedures.\nA severe pelvic infection unrelated to surgery may also lead to Asherman syndrome.\nAdhesions in the uterine cavity can also form after infection with tuberculosis or schistosomiasis. These infections are rare in the United States. Uterine complications related to these infections are even less common.\nSymptoms\nThe adhesions may cause:\nAmenorrhea\n(lack of menstrual periods)\nRepeated miscarriages\nInfertility\nHowever, such symptoms could be related to several conditions."}

They are more likely to indicate Asherman syndrome if they occur suddenly after a D&C or other uterine surgery.\nExams and Tests\nA pelvic exam does not reveal problems in most cases.\nTests may include:\nHysterosalpingography\nHysterosonogram\nTransvaginal ultrasound examination\nHysteroscopy\nBlood tests or other laboratory examinations to detect tuberculosis or schistosomiasis\nTreatment\nTreatment involves surgery to cut and remove the adhesions or scar tissue. This can most often be done with hysteroscopy. This uses small instruments and a camera placed into the uterus through the cervix.\nAfter scar tissue is removed, the uterine cavity must be kept open while it heals to prevent adhesions from returning. Your health care provider may place a small balloon inside the uterus for several days."}

Your health care provider may place a small balloon inside the uterus for several days. You may also need to take estrogen while the uterine lining heals.\nYou may need to take antibiotics if there is an infection.\nSupport Groups\nThe stress of illness can often be helped by joining a support group. In such groups, members share common experiences and problems.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAsherman syndrome can often be cured with surgery. Sometimes more than one procedure will be necessary.\nWomen who are infertile because of Asherman syndrome may be able to have a baby after treatment. Successful pregnancy depends on the severity of Asherman syndrome and the difficulty of the treatment. Other factors that affect fertility and pregnancy may also be involved.\nPossible Complications\nComplications of hysteroscopic surgery are uncommon."}
