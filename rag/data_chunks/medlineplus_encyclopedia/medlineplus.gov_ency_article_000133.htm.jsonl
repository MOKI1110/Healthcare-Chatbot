It is a good idea to spend a few days ascending to 9850 feet (3000 meters)."}

It is a good idea to spend a few days ascending to 9850 feet (3000 meters). Above this point ascend very slowly so that the elevation at which you sleep does not increase more than 990 feet to 1640 feet (300m to 500m) per night.\nYou are at higher risk for acute mountain sickness if:\nYou live at or near sea level and travel to a high altitude.\nYou have had the illness before.\nYou ascend quickly.\nYou have not acclimatized appropriately to the altitude.\nAlcohol or other substances have interfered with acclimatization.\nYou have medical problems involving the heart, nervous system, or lungs.\nIf you have anemia\nSymptoms\nYour symptoms will also depend on the speed of your climb and how hard you push (exert) yourself. Symptoms range from mild to life-threatening. They can affect the nervous system, lungs, muscles, and heart.\nIn most cases, symptoms are mild."}

Acute mountain sickness is easier to treat in the early stages.\nThe main treatment for all forms of mountain sickness is to climb down (descend) to a lower altitude as rapidly and safely as possible. You should not continue climbing up if you develop symptoms.\nExtra oxygen should be given, if available.\nPeople with severe mountain sickness may need to be admitted to a hospital.\nA medicine called acetazolamide (Diamox) may be given to help you breathe better. It can help reduce symptoms. This medicine can make you urinate more often. Make sure you drink plenty of fluids and avoid alcohol when taking this medicine."}
