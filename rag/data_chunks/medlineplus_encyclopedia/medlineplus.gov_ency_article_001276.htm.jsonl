Its exact cause is unknown. However, certain risk factors include:\nUncircumcised men who don't keep the area under the foreskin clean. This leads to buildup of smegma, a cheese-like, foul-smelling substance under the foreskin.\nHistory of\ngenital warts\n, or human papillomavirus (HPV).\nSmoking.\nInjury to the penis.\nThe cancer usually affects middle age and older men.\nSymptoms\nEarly symptoms may include:\nSore, bump, rash, or swelling at the tip or on the shaft of the penis\nFoul-smelling discharge beneath the foreskin\nAs the cancer advances, symptoms may include:\nPain and bleeding from the penis (may occur with advanced disease)\nLumps in the groin area from spread of the cancer to the groin lymph nodes\nWeight loss\nDifficulty in passing urine\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your health history and symptoms.\nbiopsy\nof the growth is needed to"}

Depending on the exact location, this is called a glansectomy or partial penectomy. Laser surgery may be used to treat some tumors.\nFor more severe tumors, total removal of the penis (total penectomy) is often needed. A new opening will be created in the groin area to allow urine to exit the body. This procedure is called a urethrostomy.\nChemotherapy may be used along with surgery.\nRadiation therapy may be used along with surgery. A type of radiation therapy called external beam therapy is often used."}

This therapy is most often performed 5 days a week for 6 to 8 weeks.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome can be good with early diagnosis and treatment. Urination and sexual function can often be maintained.\nPossible Complications\nUntreated, penile cancer can spread to other parts of the body (\nmetastasize\n) early in the disease.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if symptoms of penile cancer develop.\nPrevention\nPenile cancer is very rare. Circumcision may decrease the risk of penile cancer and of developing penile cancer due to HPV infection."}
