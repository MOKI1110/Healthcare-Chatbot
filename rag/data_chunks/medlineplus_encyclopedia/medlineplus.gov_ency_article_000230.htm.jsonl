Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFecal impaction\nFecal impaction\nA fecal impaction is a large lump of dry, hard stool that stays stuck in the rectum. It is most often seen in people who are constipated for a long time.\nCauses\nConstipation is when you are not passing stool as often or as easily as is normal for you. Your stool becomes hard and dry. This makes it difficult to pass.\nFecal impaction often occurs in people who have had constipation for a long time.\nYou are at more risk for chronic constipation and fecal impaction if:\nYou do not move around much and spend most of your time in a chair or bed.\nYou have a disease of the brain or nervous system that damages the nerves that go to the muscles of the intestines.\nCertain medicines slow the passage of stool through the bowels:\nAnticholinergics, which affect the interaction between nerves and muscles of the bowel\nMedicines used to treat diarrhea, if they are taken too often\nNarcotic pain medicine, such as methadone, codeine, and oxycodone\nSymptoms\nCommon symptoms include:\nAbdominal cramping and bloating\nLeakage of liquid or sudden episodes"}

The rectal exam will show a hard mass of stool in the rectum.\nYou may need to have a\ncolonoscopy\nif there has been a recent change in your bowel habits. This is done to check for colon or rectal cancer.\nTreatment\nTreatment for the condition starts with removal of the impacted stool. This is called disimpaction. After that, steps are taken to prevent future fecal impactions.\nA warm tap water enema is often used to soften and lubricate the stool. You may need more than one enema to help.\nThe mass may have to be broken up by hand."}

This is called manual removal:\nA provider will need to insert one or two fingers into the rectum and slowly break up the mass into smaller pieces so that it can come out.\nThis process must be done in small steps to avoid causing injury to the rectum.\nSuppositories inserted into the rectum may be given between attempts to help clear the stool.\nSurgery is rarely needed to treat a fecal impaction. An overly widened colon (megacolon) or complete blockage of the bowel may require emergency removal of the impaction.\nMost people who have had a fecal impaction will need a bowel retraining program."}
