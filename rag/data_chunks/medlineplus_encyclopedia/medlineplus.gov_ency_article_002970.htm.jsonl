Hospital stays, if any, are short.\nTendon repair can be performed using:\nLocal anesthesia (immediate area of the surgery is pain-free)\nRegional anesthesia (local and surrounding areas are pain-free)\nGeneral anesthesia\n(asleep and pain-free)\nThe surgeon makes a cut on the skin over the injured tendon. The damaged or torn ends of the tendon are sewn together.\nIf the tendon has been severely injured, a tendon graft may be needed.\nIn this case, a piece of tendon from another part of the body or an artificial tendon is used.\nIf needed, tendons are reattached to the surrounding tissue.\nYour surgeon examines the area to see if there are any injuries to nerves and blood vessels.\nWhen the repair is complete, the wound is closed and bandaged.\nIf the tendon damage is too severe, the repair and reconstruction may have to be done at different times. Your surgeon will perform one surgery to repair part of the injury."}

Your surgeon will perform one surgery to repair part of the injury. Another surgery will be done at a later time to finish repairing or reconstructing the tendon.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThe goal of tendon repair is to bring back normal function of joints or surrounding tissues following a tendon injury or tear.\nRisks\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general include:\nBreathing problems\nReactions to medicines\nBleeding, blood clots, infection\nRisks of this procedure include:\nScar tissue that prevents smooth movements\nPain that does not go away\nPartial loss of function in the involved joint\nStiffness of the joint\nThe tendon tears again\nBefore the Procedure\nTell your surgeon or nurse if:\nYou are or could be pregnant\nYou are taking any medicines, including medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription\nDuring the week before your surgery:\nYou may be asked to temporarily stop taking medicines that keep your blood from clotting. These medicines are called blood thinners."}

These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of surgery.\nOn the day of the surgery:\nFollow instructions about not drinking or eating anything before the procedure.\nTake the medicines you were told to take with a small sip of water.\nArrive at the hospital on time.\nAfter the Procedure\nHealing may take 6 to 12 weeks. During that time:\nThe injured part may need to be kept in a splint or cast. Later, a brace that allows movement may be used.\nYou'll be taught exercises to help the tendon heal and limit scar tissue.\nIt is important to give the tendon time to recover."}
