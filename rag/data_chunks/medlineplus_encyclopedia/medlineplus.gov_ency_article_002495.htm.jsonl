Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCobalt poisoning\nCobalt poisoning\nCobalt is a naturally occurring element in the earth's crust. It is a very small part of our environment. Cobalt is a component of vitamin B12, which supports the production of red blood cells. Very small amounts are needed for animals and humans to stay healthy. Cobalt poisoning can occur when you are exposed to large amounts of it. There are three ways that cobalt can cause poisoning. You can swallow it, breathe it into your lungs, or have it come in prolonged contact with your skin.\nCobalt poisoning can also occur from the wear and tear of some cobalt/chromium metal-on-metal hip implants. This type of implant is an artificial hip socket that is created by fitting a metal ball into a metal cup. Sometimes, metal particles (cobalt) are released as the metal ball grinds against the metal cup when you walk. These metal particles can get released into the hip socket and sometimes the bloodstream, causing cobalt toxicity.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure."}

It caused a condition called beer-drinker's heart, which resulted in heart muscle weakness.\nThis list may not be all inclusive.\nSymptoms\nUsually you have to be exposed to high levels of cobalt for weeks to months to have symptoms."}

However, it is possible to have some symptoms if you swallow a large amount of cobalt at one time.\nThe most worrisome form of cobalt poisoning occurs when you breathe it into your lungs. This usually will only happen in industrial settings where large amounts of drilling, polishing, or other processes release fine particles containing cobalt into the air. Breathing in this cobalt dust can lead to chronic lung problems. If you breathe in this substance for long periods, you will likely develop breathing problems that are similar to\nasthma\nor pulmonary fibrosis, such as shortness of breath and decreased exercise tolerance.\nCobalt poisoning that occurs from prolonged contact with your skin will likely cause irritation and rashes that go away slowly.\nSwallowing a large amount of absorbable cobalt at one time is very rare and is likely not very dangerous. It may cause nausea and vomiting."}

The area will be washed and a skin cream may be prescribed.\nTreatment for lung involvement\n: Breathing problems will be treated based on your symptoms. Breathing treatments and medicines to treat swelling and inflammation in your lungs may be prescribed.

In the rare case that you have a high level of cobalt in your blood, you may need\nhemodialysis\n(kidney machine) and get medicines (antidotes) to reverse the effects of the poison.\nTreatment for signs of cobalt toxicity from a metal-on-metal hip implant may include removing the implant and replacing it with a traditional hip implant.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPeople who get sick from being exposed to large amounts of cobalt on one single occasion usually recover and have no long-term complications.\nThe symptoms and problems associated with long-term cobalt poisoning are rarely reversible. People who have such poisoning will likely have to take medicine for the rest of their life to control the symptoms.\nAlternative Names\nCobalt chloride; Cobalt oxide; Cobalt sulfate\nReferences\nAronson JK.
