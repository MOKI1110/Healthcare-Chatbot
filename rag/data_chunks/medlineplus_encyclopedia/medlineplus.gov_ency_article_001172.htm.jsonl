The cancer cells produce and release a male sex hormone called testosterone.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of this tumor is not known. Changes (alterations) in genes may play a role.\nSLCT occur most often in young women 20 to 30 years old. But the tumor can occur at any age.\nSymptoms\nThe Sertoli cells are normally located in the male reproductive glands (the testes). They feed sperm cells. The Leydig cells, also located in the testes, release a male sex hormone.\nThese cells are also found in a woman's ovaries, and in very rare cases lead to cancer. SLCT starts in the female ovaries, mostly in one ovary. The cancer cells release a male sex hormone. As a result, the woman may develop symptoms such as:\nA deep voice\nEnlarged clitoris\nFacial hair\nLoss in breast size\nStopping of menstrual periods\nPain in the lower belly (pelvic area) is another symptom."}

It occurs due to the tumor pressing on nearby structures.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and a pelvic exam, and ask about your symptoms.\nTests will be ordered to check the levels of female and male hormones, including\ntestosterone\n.\nAn\nultrasound\nor\nCT scan\nwill likely be done to find out where the tumor is and its size and shape.\nTreatment\nSurgery is done to remove one or both ovaries.\nIf the tumor is at an advanced stage,\nchemotherapy\nor\nradiation therapy\nmay be done after surgery.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nEarly treatment results in a good outcome. Feminine characteristics usually return after surgery. But male characteristics resolve more slowly.\nFor more advanced stage tumors, outlook is less positive.\nAlternative Names\nSertoli-stromal cell tumor; Arrhenoblastoma; Androblastoma; Ovarian cancer - Sertoli-Leydig cell tumor\nImages\nMale reproductive system\nReferences\nBeffa LB, Sung CJ, DiSilvestro PA.
