It can cause severe illness in the heart, joints, skin, and brain.\nCauses\nRheumatic fever is still common in countries that have a lot of poverty and poor health systems. It does not often occur in the United States and other developed countries. When rheumatic fever does occur in the United States, it is most often in small outbreaks. The latest outbreak in the United States  was in the 1980s.\nRheumatic fever occurs after infections with a germ or bacteria called\nStreptococcus pyogenes\nor group A streptococcus. This germ appears to trick the immune system into attacking healthy tissues in the body. These tissues become swollen or inflamed.\nThis abnormal reaction seems to almost always occur with strep throat or scarlet fever."}

These tissues become swollen or inflamed.\nThis abnormal reaction seems to almost always occur with strep throat or scarlet fever. Strep infections that involve other parts of the body do not seem to trigger rheumatic fever.\nSymptoms\nRheumatic fever mainly affects children ages 5 to 15 who have had strep throat or scarlet fever. If it occurs, it develops about 14 to 28 days after these illnesses.\nSymptoms can affect many systems in the body. General symptoms may include:\nFever\nNosebleeds\nPain in the abdomen\nHeart problems, which may have no symptoms, or may lead to shortness of breath and chest pain\nSymptoms in the joints can:\nCause pain, swelling, redness, and warmth\nMainly occur in the knees, elbows, ankles, and wrists\nChange or move from one joint to another\nSkin changes may also occur, such as:\nRing-shaped or snake-like skin rash on the trunk and upper part of the arms or legs\nSkin lumps or nodules\nA condition that affects the brain and nervous system, called\nSydenham chorea\n, can also occur."}

The goal of this treatment is to remove all of the strep bacteria from the body.\nAfter the first treatment is complete, more antibiotics are prescribed. The goal of these medicines is to prevent rheumatic fever from recurring.\nAll children will continue the antibiotics until age 21.\nTeenagers and young adults will need to take antibiotics for at least 5 years.\nIf you or your child had heart problems when the rheumatic fever occurred, antibiotics may be needed for even longer, perhaps for life.\nTo help manage swelling of inflamed tissues during acute rheumatic fever, medicines such as aspirin or corticosteroids may be needed.\nFor problems with abnormal movements or abnormal behaviors, medicines often used to treat seizures may be prescribed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nRheumatic fever can cause severe heart problems and heart damage.\nP"}
