The exact cause of endometrial cancer is not known. An increased level of estrogen hormone may play a role. This stimulates the buildup of the lining of the uterus. This can lead to abnormal overgrowth of the endometrium and\ncancer\n.\nMost cases of endometrial cancer occur between the ages of 60 and 70."}

Some can be done in your health care provider's office. Others may be done at a hospital or surgical center:\nEndometrial biopsy\n: Using a small or thin catheter (tube), tissue is taken from the lining of the uterus (endometrium). The cells are examined under a microscope to see if any appear to be abnormal or cancerous.\nHysteroscopy\n: A thin telescope-like device is inserted through the vagina and the opening of the cervix. It lets the provider view the inside of the uterus.  Tissue can also be removed for analysis during the exam.\nUltrasound\n: Sound waves are used to make a picture of the pelvic organs. The ultrasound may be performed abdominally or vaginally."}

An ultrasound can determine if the lining of the uterus appears abnormal or thickened.\nSonohysterography: Fluid is placed in the uterus through a thin tube, while vaginal ultrasound images are made of the uterus. This procedure can be done to determine the presence of any abnormal uterine mass which may be an indication of cancer.\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI)\n: In this imaging test, powerful magnets are used to create images of internal organs.\nIf cancer is found, imaging tests may be done to see if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. This is called staging.\nStages of endometrial cancer are:\nStage 1: The cancer is only in the uterus.\nStage 2: The cancer is in the uterus and\ncervix\n.\nStage 3: The cancer has spread outside of the uterus, but not beyond the true pelvis area."}

Grade 1 is the least aggressive, and grade 3 is the most aggressive. Aggressive means that the cancer grows and spreads quickly.\nTreatment\nTreatment options include:\nSurgery\nRadiation therapy\nChemotherapy\nSurgery to remove the uterus (\nhysterectomy\n) may be done in women with early stage 1 cancer.
