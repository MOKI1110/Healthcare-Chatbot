The scrotum is the flesh-covered sac that hangs between the legs at the base of the penis and contains the testicles.\nThe testicles are the male reproductive organs that produce sperm and the hormone\ntestosterone\n. They are located in the\nscrotum\n, along with other small organs, blood vessels, and a small tube called the vas deferens.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will lie on your back with your legs spread. The health care provider drapes a cloth across your thighs under the scrotum or applies wide strips of adhesive tape to the area. The scrotal sac will be slightly raised with the testicles lying side by side.\nA clear gel is applied to the scrotal sac to help transmit the sound waves. A handheld probe (the ultrasound transducer) is then moved over the scrotum by the technologist. The ultrasound machine sends out high-frequency sound waves."}

These waves reflect off areas in the scrotum to create a picture.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThere is little discomfort. The conducting gel may feel slightly cold and wet.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA testicle ultrasound is done to:\nHelp determine why one or both testicles have become larger or smaller\nLook at a mass or lump in one or both of the testicles\nFind the reason for pain in the testicles\nShow how blood flows through the testicles\nNormal Results\nThe testicles and other areas in the scrotum appear normal.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nPossible causes of abnormal results include:\nCollection of very small veins, called a\nvaricocele\nInfection or\nabscess\nNoncancerous (benign)\ncyst\nTwisting of the testicle that blocks blood flow, called\ntesticular torsion\nTesticular\ntumor\nTesticular atrophy (shrinkage)\nRisks\nThere are no known risks."}

You will not be exposed to radiation with this test.\nConsiderations\nIn certain cases, Doppler ultrasound may help identify blood flow inside the scrotum. This method can be helpful in cases of testicular torsion because blood flow to the twisted testicle may be reduced.\nAlternative Names\nTesticular  ultrasound; Testicular sonogram\nImages\nMale reproductive anatomy\nTesticular ultrasound\nReferences\nGilbert BR, Fulgham PF.
