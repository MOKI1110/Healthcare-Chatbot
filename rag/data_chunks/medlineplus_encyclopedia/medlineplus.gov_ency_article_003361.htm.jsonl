Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPlasma amino acids\nPlasma amino acids\nPlasma amino acids is a screening test, usually done on infants that looks at the amounts of\namino acids\nin the blood. Amino acids are the building blocks for proteins in the body.\nHow the Test is Performed\nMost of the time, blood is drawn from a vein located on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\nIn infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin.\nThe blood collects in a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip.\nA bandage is put over the spot to stop any bleeding.\nThe blood sample is sent to a lab. There are several types of methods used to determine the individual amino acid levels in the blood.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThe person having the test may be asked not to eat 3 or more hours before the test. Check with your child's health care provider for specific advice.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThere might be slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn."}

You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn. The needle stick will probably cause an infant or child to cry.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to measure the level of amino acids in the blood.\nAn increased level of a particular amino acid shows that there is a problem with the body's ability to break down (metabolize) that amino acid.\nThe test may also be used to look for decreased levels of amino acids in the blood.\nIncreased or decreased levels of amino acids in the blood may occur with fevers, inadequate nutrition, and certain medical conditions.\nNormal Results\nAll measurements are in micromoles per liter ( µmol/L). Normal values may vary between different laboratories."}
