The procedure is performed in the following way:\nThe surgeon makes a small cut (incision) below the belly button.\nA needle or hollow tube called a trocar is inserted into the incision. Carbon dioxide gas is passed into the abdomen through the needle or tube. The gas helps expand the area, giving the surgeon more room to work, and helps the surgeon see the organs more clearly.\nA tiny video camera (laparoscope) is then placed through the trocar and is used to see the inside of your pelvis and abdomen."}

More small cuts may be made if other instruments are needed to get a better view of certain organs.\nIf you are having gynecologic laparoscopy, dye may be injected into your cervix so the surgeon can view the fallopian tubes.\nAfter the exam, the gas, laparoscope, and instruments are removed, and the cuts are closed. You will have bandages over those areas.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nFollow instructions  on not eating and drinking before surgery.\nYou may need to stop taking medicines, including narcotic pain relievers, on or before the day of the exam. Do not change or stop taking any medicines without first talking to your surgeon.\nFollow any other instructions for how to prepare for the procedure.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will feel no pain during the procedure. Afterward, the incisions may be sore. Your surgeon may prescribe a pain reliever.\nYou may also have shoulder pain for a few days."}

Afterward, the incisions may be sore. Your surgeon may prescribe a pain reliever.\nYou may also have shoulder pain for a few days. The gas used during the procedure can irritate the diaphragm, which shares some of the same nerves as the shoulder. You may also have an increased urge to urinate, since the gas can put pressure on the bladder.\nYou will recover for a few hours at the hospital before going home. You will probably not stay overnight after a laparoscopy.\nYou will not be allowed to drive home. Someone must be available to take you home after the procedure.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nDiagnostic laparoscopy is often done for the following:\nFind the cause of pain or a growth in the abdomen and pelvic area when\nx-ray\nor\nultrasound\nresults aren't clear.\nAfter an accident to see if there is injury to any organs in the abdomen.\nBefore procedures to treat cancer to find out if the\ncancer\nhas spread. If so, treatment will change.\nNormal Results\nThe laparoscopy is normal if there is no blood in the abdomen, no\nhernias\n, no intestinal obstruction, and no cancer in any visible organs."}

The uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries are of normal size, shape, and color. The liver is normal.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be due to a number of different conditions, including:\nScar tissue inside the abdomen or pelvis (\nadhesions\n)\nAppendicitis\nCells from inside the uterus growing in other areas (\nendometriosis\n)\nInflammation of the gallbladder (\ncholecystitis\n)\nOvarian cysts\nor cancer of the ovary\nInfection of the uterus, ovaries, or fallopian tubes (\npelvic inflammatory disease\n)\nSigns of injury\nSpread of cancer\nTumors\nNoncancerous tumors of the uterus such as\nfibroids\nRisks\nThere is a risk for infection. You may get antibiotics to prevent this complication.\nThere is a risk of puncturing an organ. This could cause the contents of the intestines to leak. There may also be bleeding into the abdominal cavity."}
