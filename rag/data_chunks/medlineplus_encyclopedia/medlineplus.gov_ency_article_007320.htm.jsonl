It most often develops in the first days and weeks of life.\nCauses\nA lack of vitamin K may cause severe bleeding in newborn babies. Vitamin K plays an important role in blood clotting.\nBabies often have a low level of vitamin K for a variety of reasons. Vitamin K does not move easily across the placenta from the mother to the baby. As a result, a newborn does not have much vitamin K stored up at birth. Also, the bacteria that help make vitamin K are not yet present in a newborn's gastrointestinal tract."}

As a result, a newborn does not have much vitamin K stored up at birth. Also, the bacteria that help make vitamin K are not yet present in a newborn's gastrointestinal tract. Finally, there is not much vitamin K in mother's milk.\nYour baby may develop this condition if:\nA preventive vitamin K shot is not given at birth (if vitamin K is given by mouth instead of as a shot, it must be given more than once, and it does not appear to be as effective as the shot).\nThe mother takes certain anti-seizure or blood-thinning drugs.\nThe condition is grouped into three categories:\nImmediate-onset VKDB is very rare. It occurs within the first 48 hours after birth and is usually a result of anti-seizure medicines or some other medicines, including a blood thinner called warfarin (Coumadin), taken by mothers during pregnancy.\nEarly-onset (formerly called \"classic-onset\") disease is also rare. It occurs between 1 to 14 days after birth. It is usually seen in breastfed infants who did not receive a vitamin K shot.\nLate-onset VKDB is seen in infants between 2 weeks and 6 months old."}

(If the deficiency is not severe, the PT may not be abnormal.)\nTreatment\nVitamin K is given if bleeding occurs.  Babies with severe bleeding may need plasma or blood transfusions.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook tends to be worse for babies with late-onset hemorrhagic disease than other forms."}

There is a higher rate of bleeding inside the skull (intracranial hemorrhage) associated with the late-onset condition.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nBleeding inside the skull (intracranial hemorrhage), with possible brain damage\nDeath\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if your baby has:\nAny unexplained bleeding\nSeizures\nAbdominal behavior\nGet emergency medical care right away if the symptoms are severe.\nPrevention\nThe early onset form of the disease may be prevented by giving vitamin K shots to pregnant women who take anti-seizure medicines. To prevent the classic and late-onset forms, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends giving every baby a shot of vitamin K immediately after birth. Because of this practice, vitamin K deficiency is now rare in the United States except for those babies who do not receive the vitamin K shot.\nAlternative Names\nHemorrhagic disease of the newborn (HDN)\nReferences\nGreenbaum LA."}
