It occurs in some people with a weakened immune system.\nCauses\nMucormycosis is caused by different kinds of fungi often found in decaying organic matter. These include spoiled bread, fruit, and vegetables, as well as soil and compost piles. Most people come in contact with the fungus in the environment.\nPeople with a weakened immune system are more likely to develop mucormycosis. These include people with any of the following conditions:\nAIDS\nBurns\nDiabetes\n(usually poorly controlled)\nLeukemia\nand\nlymphoma\nLong-term steroid use\nMetabolic acidosis\nPoor nutrition (malnutrition)\nUse of some medicines that suppress the immune system\nMucormycosis may involve:\nA sinus and brain infection called rhinocerebral infection:\nIt may start as a sinus infection, and then lead to the swelling of the nerves that come from the brain."}

A biopsy is the removal of a small piece of tissue for lab examination to identify the fungus and invasion into host tissue.\nTreatment\nSurgery should be done right away to remove all dead and infected tissues. Surgery can lead to disfiguration because it may involve removal of the palate, parts of the nose, or parts of the eye. But, without such aggressive surgery, chances of survival are greatly decreased.\nYou will also receive antifungal medicine, usually amphotericin B, through a vein."}

After the infection is under control, you may be switched to a different medicine such as posaconazole or isavuconazole.\nIf you have diabetes, it will be important to get your blood sugar in the normal range.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMucormycosis has a very high death rate, even when aggressive surgery is done. The risk of death depends on the area of the body involved and your overall health.\nPossible Complications\nThese complications may occur:\nBlindness (if the optic nerve is involved)\nClotting or blockage of brain or lung blood vessels\nDeath\nNerve damage\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nPeople with weakened immune systems and immune disorders (including diabetes) should seek medical attention if they develop:\nFever\nHeadache\nSinus pain\nEye swelling\nAny of the other symptoms listed above\nPrevention\nBecause the fungi that cause mucormycosis are widespread, the best way to prevent this infection is to improve control of the illnesses associated with mucormycosis.\nAlternative Names\nFun"}
