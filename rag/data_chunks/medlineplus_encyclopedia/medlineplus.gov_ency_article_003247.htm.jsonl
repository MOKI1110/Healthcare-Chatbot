These lines can occur after illness, injury to the nail, eczema around the nail, during chemotherapy for cancer, or when you do not get enough nutrition.\nBrittle nails are often a normal result of aging. They can also be due to certain diseases and conditions.\nKoilonychia is an abnormal shape of the fingernail. The nail has raised ridges and is thin and curved inward. This disorder is associated with\niron deficiency anemia\n.\nLeukonychia is white streaks or spots on the nails often due to drugs or disease.\nPitting is the presence of small depressions on the nail surface. Sometimes the nail is also crumbling. The nail can become loose and sometimes falls off."}

Pitting is associated with psoriasis and alopecia areata.\nRidges are tiny, raised lines that develop across or up and down the nail.\nCauses\nInjury:\nCrushing the base of the nail or the nail bed may cause a permanent deformity.\nChronic picking or rubbing of the skin behind the nail can cause median nail dystrophy, which gives a lengthwise split or ridged appearance of the thumbnails.\nLong-term exposure to moisture or nail polish can cause nails to peel and become brittle.\nInfection:\nFungus or yeast cause changes in the color, texture, and shape of the nails.\nBacterial infection may cause a change in nail color or painful areas of infection under the nail or in the surrounding skin. Severe infections may cause nail loss."}

Subungual melanoma is a potentially deadly cancer that will normally appear as a dark streak down the length of the nail.\nHutchinson sign is a darkening of the cuticle associated with a pigmented streak and may be a sign of an aggressive\nmelanoma\n.\nPoisons:\nArsenic poisoning may cause white lines and horizontal ridges.\nSilver intake can cause a blue nail.\nMedicines:\nCertain antibiotics can cause lifting of the nail from the nail bed.\nChemotherapy medicines can affect nail growth.\nNormal aging affects the growth and development of the nails.\nHome Care\nTo prevent nail problems:\nDO NOT bite, pick, or tear at your nails (in severe cases, some people may need counseling or encouragement to stop these behaviors).\nKeep hangnails clipped.\nWear shoes that do not squeeze the toes together, and always cut toenails straight across along the top.\nTo"}
