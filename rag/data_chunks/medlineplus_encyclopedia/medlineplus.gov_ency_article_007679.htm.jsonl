Most of the time, the enzymes are only active after they reach the small intestine.\nWhen these enzymes become active inside the pancreas, they digest the tissue of the pancreas. This causes swelling, bleeding and damage to the organ and its blood vessels."}

This causes swelling, bleeding and damage to the organ and its blood vessels. This condition is called pancreatitis.\nCommon causes of pancreatitis in children include:\nTrauma to the belly, such as from a bicycle handlebar injury\nBlocked bile duct\nSide effects\nof medicine, such as anti-seizure medicines, chemotherapy, or some antibiotics\nViral infections, including\nmumps\nand coxsackie B\nHigh blood levels of a fat in the blood, called\ntriglycerides\nOther causes include:\nAfter an organ or bone marrow transplant\nCystic fibrosis\nCrohn disease and other disorders, when the body's\nimmune system\nattacks and destroys healthy body tissue by mistake\nType 1 diabetes that is uncontrolled\nOveractive parathyroid gland\ncausing very high calcium levels\nKawasaki disease\nSometimes, the cause is unknown.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom of pancreatitis in children is severe pain in the upper abdomen. Sometimes the pain may spread to the back, lower abdomen, and front part of the chest."}

Sometimes the pain may spread to the back, lower abdomen, and front part of the chest. The pain may increase after meals.\nOther symptoms may include:\nCough\nNausea and vomiting\nSwelling in the abdomen\nFever\nYellowing of the skin, called\njaundice\nLoss of appetite\nIncreased pulse\nExams and Tests\nYour child's health care provider will do a physical exam, which may show:\nAbdominal tenderness or lump (mass)\nFever\nLow blood pressure\nFast heart rate\nFast breathing rate\nThe provider will perform lab tests to check the release of pancreatic enzymes. These include tests to check the:\nBlood amylase level\nBlood lipase level\nUrine amylase level\nOther blood tests include:\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nPanel or group of\nblood tests that provide an overall picture of your body's chemical balance\nImaging tests that can show inflammation of the pancreas include:\nUltrasound of the abdomen\n(most common).\nCT scan of the abdomen\n.\nMRI of the abdomen\n. A special MRI, called MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography), is sometimes needed.\nEndoscopic ultrasound (EUS)."}

A special MRI, called MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography), is sometimes needed.\nEndoscopic ultrasound (EUS). This is an internal ultrasound and needed in special cases.\nTreatment\nTreatment may require a stay in the hospital. It may involve:\nPain medicines\nStopping food or fluids by mouth\nFluids given through a vein (IV)\nAnti-nausea medicines for nausea and vomiting\nLow-fat diet\nThe provider may insert a tube through the child's nose or mouth to remove contents of the stomach. The tube will be left in for one or more days. This may be done if vomiting and severe pain don't improve. The child also may be given food through a vein (IV) or a feeding tube.\nThe child can be given solid food once they stop vomiting. Most children are able to take solid food within 1 or 2 days after an attack of acute pancreatitis.\nIn some cases, therapy is needed to:\nDrain fluid that has collected in or around the pancreas\nRemove\ngallstones\nRelieve blockages of the pancreatic duct\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost cases go away in a week. Children usually recover completely.\nChronic pancreatitis is rarely seen in children."}

Children usually recover completely.\nChronic pancreatitis is rarely seen in children. When it occurs, it is most often due to genetic defects or birth defects of the pancreas or biliary ducts.\nPossible Complications\nSevere irritation of the pancreas, and pancreatitis due to blunt trauma, such as from a bike handle bar, can cause complications. These may include:\nCollection of fluid around the\npancreas\nBuildup of fluid in the abdomen (\nascites\n)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact the provider if your child shows symptoms of pancreatitis. Also contact the provider if your child has these symptoms:\nIntense, constant abdominal pain\nDevelops other symptoms of acute pancreatitis\nSevere upper abdominal pain and vomiting\nPrevention\nMost of the time, there is no way to prevent pancreatitis.\nReferences\nKliegman RM, St. Geme JW, Blum NJ, et al.
