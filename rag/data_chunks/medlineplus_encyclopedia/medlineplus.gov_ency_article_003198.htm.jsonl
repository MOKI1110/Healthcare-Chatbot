Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMovement - uncoordinated\nMovement - uncoordinated\nUncoordinated movement is due to a muscle control problem that causes an inability to coordinate movements. It leads to a jerky, unsteady, to-and-fro motion of the middle of the body (trunk) and an\nunsteady gait\n(walking style). It can also affect the limbs.\nThe medical name of this condition is ataxia.\nConsiderations\nSmooth graceful movement requires a balance between different muscle groups. A part of the brain called the cerebellum manages this balance. If this does not happen properly, ataxia often results.\nAtaxia can severely affect daily living activities.\nCauses\nDiseases that damage the cerebellum, spinal cord, or\nperipheral\nnerves can interfere with normal muscle movement."}

A home safety evaluation by a physical therapist may be helpful.\nTake measures to make it easier and safer to move around at home. For example, get rid of clutter, leave wide walkways, and remove throw rugs or other objects that might cause slipping or falling. Make sure there is adequate lighting at night.\nPeople with this condition should be encouraged to take part in normal activities. Family members need to be patient with a person who has poor coordination. Take time to show the person ways to do tasks more easily. Take advantage of the person's strengths while avoiding their weaknesses.\nAsk your health care provider whether walking aids, such as a cane or walker, would be helpful.\nPeople with ataxia are prone to falls.
