This vision loss may happen suddenly or over a period of time.\nSome types of vision loss never lead to complete blindness.\nCauses\nVision loss has many causes."}

You can make\nchanges in your home and routines\nthat help you stay safe and independent. Many services will provide you with the training and support you need to live independently, including the use of low vision aids.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nSudden vision loss is always an emergency, even if you have not completely lost vision. You should never ignore vision loss, thinking it will get better.\nContact an ophthalmologist or go to the emergency room immediately. Most serious forms of vision loss are painless, and the absence of pain in no way diminishes the urgent need to get medical care."}
