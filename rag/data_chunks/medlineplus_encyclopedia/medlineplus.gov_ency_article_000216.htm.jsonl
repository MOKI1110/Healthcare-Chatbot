Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHepatitis D (Delta agent)\nHepatitis D (Delta agent)\nHepatitis D is a viral infection caused by the hepatitis D virus (previously called the Delta agent). It causes symptoms only in people who also have\nhepatitis B\ninfection.\nCauses\nHepatitis D virus (HDV) is found only in people who carry the hepatitis B virus. It can occur with a new infection of hepatitis B (coinfection) or on top of a hepatitis B infection (superinfection). HDV may make liver disease worse in people who have either recent (acute) or long-term (chronic) hepatitis B. It can even cause symptoms in people who carry\nhepatitis B\nvirus, but who never had symptoms.\nHepatitis D infects about 15 million people worldwide. It occurs in a small number of people who carry hepatitis B.\nRisk factors include:\nBeing infected while pregnant (the mother can pass the virus to the baby).\nCarrying the hepatitis B virus.\nBeing in a high-risk group for getting hepatitis B or D."}

Examples include sharing body fluids such as through sexual contact, household blood or saliva contact, or sharing needles/drug equipment.\nReceiving many blood transfusions. The US blood supply is screened for hepatitis virus, so this is uncommon.\nUsing intravenous (IV) or injection drugs.\nRarely, a baby can get hepatitis D from a mother with hepatitis D.\nSymptoms\nHepatitis D may make the symptoms of hepatitis B worse.\nSymptoms may include:\nAbdominal pain\nDark-colored urine\nFatigue\nJaundice\nJoint pain\nLoss of appetite\nNausea\nVomiting\nExams and Tests\nYou may need the following tests:\nAnti-hepatitis D antibody\n."}

Blood tests for hepatitis B will also be done.\nLiver biopsy\nis occasionally done.\nLiver enzymes\n(blood test) and other bloodwork to check for other liver diseases and see how damaged the liver is.\nImaging tests such as an abdominal ultrasound or a special ultrasound called elastography, to look at the liver and see how damaged it is.\nEvaluation for liver cancer.\nTreatment\nMany of the medicines used to treat hepatitis B are not helpful for treating hepatitis D.\nYou may receive a once weekly injectable medicine called pegylated alpha interferon for up to 12 months if you have a long-term HDV infection. A liver transplant for end-stage chronic hepatitis B may be effective.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPeople with an\nacute\nHDV infection most often get better over 2 to 3 weeks."}

If you inject drugs, avoid sharing needles.\nGet vaccinated against hepatitis B.\nAdults who are at high risk for hepatitis B infection and all children should get this vaccine.
