This test can also detect damage to the cornea. The cornea is the outer surface of the eye.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA piece of blotting paper containing the dye is touched to the surface of your eye. Sometimes the dye comes in a drop form which also contains anesthetic. You are asked to blink. Blinking spreads the dye and coats the tear film covering the surface of the cornea. The tear film contains water, oil, and mucus to protect and lubricate the eye.\nThe health care provider then shines a blue light at your eye."}

Any problems on the surface of the cornea will be stained by the dye and appear green under the blue light.\nThe provider can determine the location and likely cause of the cornea problem depending on the size, location, and shape of the staining.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will need to remove your eyeglasses or contact lenses before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nIf your eyes are very dry, the blotting paper may be slightly scratchy."}

The dye may cause a mild and brief stinging sensation if there is no anesthetic used.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is to:\nFind scratches or other problems with the surface of the cornea\nReveal foreign bodies on the eye surface\nDetermine if there is irritation of the cornea after contacts are prescribed\nNormal Results\nIf the test result is normal, the dye remains in the tear film on the surface of the eye but does not show any abnormal areas.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may point to:\nAbnormal tear production (dry eye)\nBlocked tear duct\nCorneal abrasion\n(a scratch on the surface of the cornea)\nForeign bodies, such as eyelashes or dust (\nforeign object in eye\n)\nInfection\nInjury or trauma\nSevere dry eye associated with arthritis (\nkeratoconjunctivitis sicca\n)\nOften the test is done to check for any of the conditions listed above.\nRisks\nIf the dye touches the skin, there may be a slight, brief, discoloration."}
