Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTracheal rupture\nTracheal rupture\nA tracheal or bronchial rupture is a tear or break in the windpipe (trachea) or bronchial tubes, the major airways leading to the lungs. A tear can also occur in the tissue lining the windpipe.\nCauses\nThe injury may be caused by:\nInfections\nSores (ulcerations) due to foreign objects\nTrauma, such as a gunshot wound or automobile accident\nInjuries to the trachea or bronchi also may occur during medical procedures (for example,\nbronchoscopy\nor placement of a breathing tube). However, this is very uncommon.\nSymptoms\nPeople with trauma who develop a tracheal or bronchial rupture often have other injuries.\nSymptoms may include:\nCoughing up blood\nBubbles of air that can be felt underneath the skin of the chest, neck, arms, and trunk (\nsubcutaneous emphysema\n)\nDifficulty breathing\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

Close attention will be paid to the symptoms of the rupture.\nTests that may be done include:\nNeck and\nchest CT scan\nChest x-ray\nBronchoscopy\nCT angiography\nLaryngoscopy\nContrast\nesophagography\nand\nesophagoscopy\nTreatment\nPeople who have had a trauma will need to have their injuries treated. Injuries to the trachea often need to be repaired during surgery. Injuries to the smaller bronchi can sometimes be treated without surgery. A\ncollapsed lung\nis treated with a chest tube connected to suction, which re-expands the lung.\nFor people who have breathed a foreign body into the airways, bronchoscopy may be used to take out the object.\nAntibiotics are used in people with an infection in the part of the lung around the injury.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook of an injury due to trauma depends on the severity of other injuries. Operations to repair these injuries often have good results. The outlook is always better if the person does not have many chronic medical conditions."}

The outlook is good for people whose tracheal or bronchial disruption is due to causes such as a foreign object, which tend to have a good outcome.\nIn the months or years after the injury, scarring at the injury site may cause problems, such as narrowing, which require other tests or procedures.\nPossible Complications\nMajor complications after surgery for this condition include:\nInfection\nLong-term need of a ventilator\nNarrowing of the airways\nScarring\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have:\nHad a major injury to the chest\nInhaled a foreign body\nSymptoms of a chest infection\nThe feeling of air bubbles underneath your skin and trouble breathing\nAlternative Names\nTorn tracheal mucosa; Bronchial rupture\nImages\nLungs\nReferences\nCarmichael SP, Mowery NT, Martin RS, Meredith JW.
