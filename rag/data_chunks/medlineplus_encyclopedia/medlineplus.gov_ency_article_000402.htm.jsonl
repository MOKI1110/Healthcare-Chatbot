It causes high amounts of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood.\nCauses\nA genetic variant causes this condition. The variant results in the buildup of large lipoprotein particles that contain both cholesterol and a type of fat called triglycerides. The disease is linked to variants in the gene for apolipoprotein E.\nHypothyroidism\n,\nobesity\n, or\ndiabetes\ncan make the condition worse."}
