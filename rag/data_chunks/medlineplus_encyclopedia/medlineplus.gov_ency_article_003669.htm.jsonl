Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPlatelet aggregation test\nPlatelet aggregation test\nThe platelet aggregation blood test checks how well platelets, a part of blood, clump together and cause blood to clot.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nThe lab specialist will look at how the platelets spread out in the liquid part of the blood (plasma) and whether they form clumps after a certain chemical or medicine is added. When platelets clump together, the blood sample is clearer. A machine measures the changes in cloudiness and prints a record of the results.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour health care provider may tell you to temporarily stop taking medicines that may affect the test results. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take."}

Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take. These include:\nAntibiotics\nAntihistamines\nAntidepressants\nBlood thinners, such as aspirin, that make it hard for the blood to clot\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs)\nStatin medicines for cholesterol\nAlso, tell your provider about any vitamins or herbal remedies you take.\nDo not stop taking any medicine without first talking to your provider.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order this test if you have signs of a\nbleeding disorder\nor a low\nplatelet count\n. It may also be ordered if a member of your family is known to have a bleeding disorder due to platelet dysfunction.\nThe test can help diagnose problems with platelet function."}

It may also be ordered if a member of your family is known to have a bleeding disorder due to platelet dysfunction.\nThe test can help diagnose problems with platelet function. It may determine whether the problem is due to your genes, another disorder, or a side effect of the medicine.\nNormal Results\nThe normal time it takes for platelets to clump depends on temperature, and may vary from lab to lab.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different lab. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nDecreased platelet aggregation may be due to:\nAutoimmune disorders\nthat produce antibodies against platelets\nFibrin degradation products\nInherited platelet function defects\nMedicines that block platelet aggregation\nBone marrow disorders\nUremia\n(a result of\nkidney failure\n)\nVon Willebrand disease\n(a bleeding disorder)\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other."}
