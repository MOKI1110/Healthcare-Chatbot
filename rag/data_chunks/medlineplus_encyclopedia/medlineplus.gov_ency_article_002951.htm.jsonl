You have one of these arteries on each side of your neck. Blood flow in this artery can become partly or totally blocked by fatty material called plaque. This can reduce the blood supply to your brain and cause a\ntransient ischemic attack\n(TIA) or\nstroke\n.\nCarotid artery surgery is done to restore proper blood flow to the brain. There are two procedures to treat a carotid artery that has plaque buildup in it. This article focuses on a surgery called carotid endarterectomy. The other method is called\nangioplasty with stent placement\n.\nDescription\nDuring carotid endarterectomy:\nYou receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n. You are asleep and pain free. Some hospitals use local anesthesia instead. Only the part of your body being worked on is numbed with medicine so that you do not feel pain."}

You are asleep and pain free. Some hospitals use local anesthesia instead. Only the part of your body being worked on is numbed with medicine so that you do not feel pain. You are also given a medicine to help you relax.\nYou lie on your back on an operating table with your head turned to one side. The side your blocked carotid artery is on faces up.\nThe surgeon makes a cut (incision) on your neck over your carotid artery. A flexible tube (catheter) is put in the artery. Blood flows through the catheter around the blocked area during surgery.\nYour carotid artery is opened. The surgeon removes the plaque inside the artery.\nAfter the plaque is removed, the artery is closed with stitches or a patch from one of your veins or synthetic material. Blood now flows through the artery to your brain.\nYour heart activity is monitored closely during surgery.\nThe surgery takes about 2 hours. After the procedure, your surgeon may do a test to confirm that the artery has been opened.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThis procedure is done if your health care provider has found narrowing or a blockage in your carotid artery."}

Be sure to arrive on time.\nAfter the Procedure\nYou may have a drain in your neck that goes into your incision. It will drain fluid that builds up in the area.
