They are usually used to help diagnose the cause of anemia, a condition in which there are too few red blood cells.\nThe indices include:\nAverage red blood cell size (MCV)\nHemoglobin\namount per red blood cell (MCH)\nThe amount of hemoglobin relative to the size of the cell (hemoglobin concentration) per red blood cell (MCHC)\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nHemoglobin transports oxygen. RBCs carry hemoglobin and oxygen to our body's cells. The RBC indices test measures the size and hemoglobin of the RBCs."}

This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nHemoglobin transports oxygen. RBCs carry hemoglobin and oxygen to our body's cells. The RBC indices test measures the size and hemoglobin of the RBCs. The results are used to diagnose different types of\nanemia\n.\nNormal Results\nThese test results are in the normal range:\nMCV: 80 to 100 femtoliter\nMCH: 27 to 31 picograms/cell\nMCHC: 32 to 36 grams/deciliter (g/dL) or 320 to 360 grams per liter (g/L)\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThese test results indicate the type of anemia:\nMCV below normal. Microcytic anemia (may be due to low iron levels, lead poisoning, or\nthalassemia\n).\nMCV normal. Normocytic anemia (may be due to sudden blood loss, long-term diseases,\nkidney failure\n,\naplastic anemia\n, or man-made heart valves).\nMCV above normal."}
