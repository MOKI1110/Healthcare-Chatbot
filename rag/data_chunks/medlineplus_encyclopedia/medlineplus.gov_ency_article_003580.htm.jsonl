Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nUrine protein dipstick test\nUrine protein dipstick test\nThe urine protein dipstick test measures the presence of all proteins, including albumin, in a urine sample.\nAlbumin and protein can also be measured using a\nblood test\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nAfter you provide a urine sample, it is tested. The health care provider uses a dipstick made with a color-sensitive pad. The color on the dipstick tells the provider the level of protein in your urine.\nIf needed, your provider may ask you to\ncollect your urine at home over 24 hours\n. Your provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nDifferent medicines can change the result of this test. Before the test, tell your provider which medicines you are taking."}

Before the test, tell your provider which medicines you are taking. DO NOT stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.\nThe following may also interfere with test results:\nDehydration\nDye (contrast media) if you have a radiology scan within 3 days before the urine test\nFluid from the vagina that gets into the urine\nStrenuous exercise\nUrinary tract infection\nHow the Test Will Feel\nThe test only involves normal urination. There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is most often done when your provider suspects you have kidney disease. It may also be used as a screening test for\nkidney disease\n, for example in people with\ndiabetes\n.\nAlthough small amounts of protein are normally present in urine, a routine dipstick test may not detect them. A urine microalbumin test can be performed to detect small amounts of albumin in the urine that may not be detected on dipstick testing."}

A urine microalbumin test can be performed to detect small amounts of albumin in the urine that may not be detected on dipstick testing. If the kidney is diseased, proteins may be detected on a dipstick test, even if blood protein levels are normal.\nNormal Results\nFor a random urine sample, normal values are 0 to 14 mg/dL.\nFor a 24-hour urine collection, the normal value is less than 80 mg per 24 hours.\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}
