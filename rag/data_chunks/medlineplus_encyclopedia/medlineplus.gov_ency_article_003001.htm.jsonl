It may involve:\nPart of one kidney removed (partial nephrectomy).\nAll of one kidney removed (simple nephrectomy).\nRemoval of one entire kidney, surrounding fat, and the adrenal gland (radical nephrectomy). In these cases, neighboring lymph nodes are sometimes removed.\nDescription\nThis surgery is done in the hospital while you are asleep and pain-free (general anesthesia). The procedure can take 3 or more hours.\nSimple nephrectomy or open kidney removal:\nYou will be lying on your side. Your surgeon will make an incision (cut) up to 12 inches or 30 centimeters (cm) long. This cut will be on your side, just below the ribs or right over the lowest ribs.\nMuscle, fat, and tissue are cut and moved. Your surgeon may need to remove a rib to do the procedure.\nThe tube that carries urine from the kidney to the bladder (ureter) and blood vessels are cut away from the kidney."}

The surgeon will use tiny probes and a camera to do the surgery.\nTowards the end of the procedure, your surgeon will make one of the cuts larger (about 4 inches or 10 cm) to take out the kidney.\nThe surgeon will cut the ureter, place a bag around the kidney, and pull it through the larger cut.\nThis surgery may take longer than an open kidney removal. However, most people recover faster and feel less pain after this type of surgery when compared to the pain and recovery period following open surgery.\nSometimes, your surgeon may make a cut in a different place than described above.\nSome hospitals and medical centers are doing this\nsurgery using robotic tools\n.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nKidney removal may be recommended for:\nSomeone donating a kidney\nBirth defects\nKidney cancer\nor suspected kidney cancer\nA kidney damaged by infection,\nkidney stones\n, or other problems\nTo help control\nhigh blood pressure\nin someone who has problems with the blood supply to their kidney\nVery bad injury"}
