Working out when you have not had enough fluids (dehydration) or when you have low levels of minerals such as sodium, potassium, or calcium can also make you more likely to have a muscle spasm.\nMuscle cramps can occur while you play tennis or golf, bowl, swim, or do any other exercise.\nThey can also be triggered by:\nAlcoholism\nHypothyroidism\n(underactive thyroid)\nKidney failure\nMedicines\nMenstruation\nPregnancy\nHome Care\nIf you have a muscle cramp, stop your activity and try stretching and massaging the muscle.\nHeat will relax the muscle when the spasm begins, but ice may be helpful when the pain has improved.\nIf the muscle is still sore, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines can help with pain. If the muscle cramps are severe, your health care provider can prescribe other medicines.\nThe most common cause of muscle cramps during sports activity is not getting enough fluids. Often, drinking water will ease the cramping. However, water alone does not always help."}
