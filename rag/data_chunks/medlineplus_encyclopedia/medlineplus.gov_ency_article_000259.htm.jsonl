Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPseudomembranous colitis\nPseudomembranous colitis\nPseudomembranous colitis refers to swelling or inflammation of the large intestine (colon) due to an overgrowth of\nClostridioides difficile\n(\nC difficile\n) bacteria.\nThis infection is a common cause of diarrhea after antibiotic use. Not all cases of diarrhea associated with antibiotic use are due to\nC difficile\nor will progress to pseudomembranous colitis.\nCauses\nThe\nC difficile\nbacteria normally lives in the intestine. However, too much of these bacteria may grow when you take antibiotic medicines. The bacteria give off a strong toxin that causes inflammation and bleeding in the lining of the colon.\nAny antibiotic can cause this condition. The medicines responsible for the problem most of the time are ampicillin, clindamycin, fluoroquinolones, and cephalosporins.\nHealth care providers in the hospital may pass this bacteria from one patient to another.\nPseudomembranous colitis is uncommon in children, and rare in infants. It is most often seen in people who are in the hospital."}

In rare cases, surgery is needed to treat infections that get worse or do not respond to antibiotics.\nLong term antibiotics may be needed if the\nC difficile\ninfection returns. A treatment called fecal microbiota transplant (\"stool transplant\") has also been effective for infections that come back.\nYour provider may also suggest that you take probiotics if the infection returns.\nAn antibody treatment may be needed in patients with very high risk of recurrent\nC difficile\nto lessen the risk of recurrence.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook is good in most cases, if there are no complications."}
