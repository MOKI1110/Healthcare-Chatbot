It is twice as common in girls as in boys.\nSymptoms\nSkin symptoms are most often visible by the time a child is about 2 years old.\nOther symptoms develop as the child grows, and may include:\nCrossed eyes\n(strabismus)\nHearing problems\nIncreased body hair (\nhirsutism\n)\nScoliosis\nSeizures\nStreaked, whorled or mottled patches of skin on the arms, legs, and middle of the body\nIntellectual disability, including\nautism spectrum disorder\nand learning disability\nMouth or tooth problems\nExams and Tests\nUltraviolet light (\nWood lamp\n) examination of the skin lesions may help confirm the diagnosis.\nTests that may be done include any of the following:\nCT\nor\nMRI\nscan of the head for a child with seizures"}

Cosmetics or clothing may be used to cover the patches. Seizures, scoliosis, and other problems are treated as needed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook depends on the type and severity of symptoms that develop. In most cases, skin color eventually turns to normal.\nPossible Complications\nProblems that may result from HMI include:\nDiscomfort and walking problems due to scoliosis\nEmotional distress, related to the physical appearance\nIntellectual disability\nInjury from seizures\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your child has an unusual pattern of the color of the skin.  However, any unusual patterns are likely to have another cause than HMI.\nAlternative Names\nIncontinentia pigmenti achromians; HMI; Ito hypomelanosis\nReferences\nJoyce JC."}
