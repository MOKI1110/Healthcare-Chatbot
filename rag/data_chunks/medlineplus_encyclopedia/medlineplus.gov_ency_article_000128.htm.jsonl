Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nInterstitial lung disease\nInterstitial lung disease\nInterstitial lung disease (ILD) is a group of lung disorders in which the lung tissues become inflamed and then damaged.\nCauses\nThe lungs contain tiny air sacs (alveoli), which is where oxygen is absorbed. These air sacs expand with each breath.\nThe tissue around these air sacs is called the interstitium. In people with interstitial lung disease, this tissue becomes inflamed, stiff, or scarred, and the air sacs are not able to expand as much. As a result, not as much oxygen can get to the body.\nILD can occur without a known cause."}

As a result, not as much oxygen can get to the body.\nILD can occur without a known cause. This is called idiopathic ILD.\nIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosis\n(IPF) is the most common disease of this type.\nThere are also dozens of known causes of ILD, including:\nAutoimmune diseases (in which the immune system attacks the body) such as lupus,\nrheumatoid arthritis\n,\nsarcoidosis\n, and\nscleroderma\n.\nLung inflammation due to breathing in a foreign substance such as certain types of dust, fungus, or mold (\nhypersensitivity pneumonitis\n).\nMedicines (such as nitrofurantoin, sulfonamides, bleomycin, amiodarone, methotrexate, gold, infliximab, etanercept, and other chemotherapy medicines).\nRadiation\ntreatment to the chest.\nWorking with or around asbestos, coal dust, cotton dust, and silica dust (called occupational lung disease).\nInfection and partial recovery from diseases like COVID-19.\nCigarette smoking may increase the risk of developing some forms of ILD and may cause the disease to be more severe.\nSymptoms\nShortness of breath\nis a main symptom of ILD."}

You may breathe faster or need to take deep breaths:\nAt first, shortness of breath may not be severe and is only noticed with exercise, climbing stairs, and other activities.\nOver time, it can occur with less strenuous activity such as bathing or dressing, and as the disease worsens, even with eating or talking.\nMost people with this condition also have a dry cough. A dry cough means you do not cough up any mucus or sputum.\nOver time, weight loss, fatigue, and muscle and joint pain are also present.\nPeople with more advanced ILD may have:\nAbnormal enlargement and curving of the base of the fingernails (\nclubbing\n).\nBlue color of the lips, skin, or fingernails due to low blood oxygen levels (\ncyanosis\n).\nSymptoms of the other diseases such as arthritis or trouble swallowing (scleroderma), associated with ILD.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

These jobs include coal mining, sand blasting, and working on a ship.\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the cause and duration of the disease. Medicines that suppress the immune system and reduce swelling in the lungs are prescribed if an autoimmune disease is causing the problem."}
