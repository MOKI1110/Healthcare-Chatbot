Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNasal septal hematoma\nNasal septal hematoma\nA nasal septal hematoma is a collection of blood within the septum of the nose. The septum is the part of the nose between the nostrils. An injury disrupts the blood vessels so that fluid and blood may collect under the lining.\nCauses\nA septal hematoma can be caused by:\nA broken nose\nInjury to the soft tissue of the area\nSurgery\nTaking blood-thinning medicines\nThe problem is more common in children because their septums are thicker and have a more flexible lining.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nBlockage in breathing\nNasal congestion\nPainful swelling of the nasal septum\nChange in the shape of the nose\nFever\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will look into your nose to see if there is swelling of the tissue between the nostrils. The provider will touch the area with an applicator or a cotton swab. If there is a hematoma, the area will be soft and able to be pressed down. The nasal septum is normally thin and rigid.\nTreatment\nYour provider will make a small cut to drain the blood."}

Gauze or cotton will be placed inside the nose after the blood is removed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nYou should heal fully if the injury is treated quickly.\nPossible Complications\nIf you have had the hematoma for a long time, it may become infected and will be painful. You may develop a septal\nabscess\nand fever.\nAn untreated septal hematoma may lead to a hole in the area separating the nostrils, called a septal perforation. This can cause nasal congestion. Or, the area may collapse, leading to a deformity of the outer nose called a saddle nose deformity.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider for any nasal injury resulting in nasal congestion or pain. You may be referred to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist.\nPrevention\nRecognizing and treating the problem early can prevent complications and allow the septum to heal.\nReferences\nBohm LA, Roby B.
