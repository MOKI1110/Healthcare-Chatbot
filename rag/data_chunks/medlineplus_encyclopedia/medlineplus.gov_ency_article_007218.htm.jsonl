This may happen from injury, an infection, or other causes. You have a higher risk for gangrene if you have:\nA serious injury\nA blood vessel disease (such as arteriosclerosis, also called hardening of the arteries, in your arms or legs)\nDiabetes\nA suppressed immune system (for example, from HIV/AIDS or chemotherapy)\nSurgery\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms depend on the location and cause of the gangrene."}

In general, dead tissue should be removed to allow healing of the surrounding living tissue and prevent further infection."}
