A vaginal cyst occurs on or under the lining of the vagina.\nCauses\nThere are several types of vaginal cysts.\nVaginal inclusion cysts are the most common. These may form due to injury to the vaginal walls during the birth process or after surgery.\nGartner duct cysts develop on the side walls of the vagina. The Gartner duct is present while a baby is developing in the womb. However, this most often disappears after birth. If parts of the duct remain, they may collect fluid and develop into a vaginal wall cyst later in life.\nBartholin cyst or abscess\nforms when fluid or pus builds up and forms a lump in one of the Bartholin glands. These glands are found on each side of the vaginal opening.\nEndometriosis may appear as small cysts in the vagina. This is uncommon.\nBenign tumors of the vagina are uncommon."}

These glands are found on each side of the vaginal opening.\nEndometriosis may appear as small cysts in the vagina. This is uncommon.\nBenign tumors of the vagina are uncommon. These tumors are most often composed of cysts.\nCystoceles and rectoceles are bulges in the vaginal wall from the adjacent bladder or rectum. This happens when the muscles surrounding the vagina become weak, most commonly due to childbirth. These are not really cysts, but can look and feel like cystic masses in the vagina.\nSymptoms\nMost vaginal cysts usually do not cause symptoms. In some cases, a soft lump can be felt in the vaginal wall or protruding from the vagina. Cysts range in size from the size of a pea to that of an orange.\nHowever, Bartholin cysts can become infected, swollen and painful.\nSome women with vaginal cysts may have discomfort during sex or trouble inserting a tampon.\nWomen with cystoceles or rectoceles may feel a protruding bulge, pelvic pressure or have difficulty with urination or defecation.\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam is essential to determine what type of cyst or mass you may have.\nA mass or bulge of the vaginal wall may be seen during a pelvic exam."}

You may need a biopsy to rule out vaginal cancer, especially if the mass appears to be solid.\nIf the cyst is located under the bladder or urethra, x-rays may be needed to see if the cyst extends into these organs.\nTreatment\nFollow-up exams to check the size of the cyst and look for any changes may be the only treatment needed.\nBiopsies or minor surgeries to remove the cysts or drain them are typically simple to perform and resolve the issue.\nBartholin gland cysts often need to be drained. Sometimes, antibiotics are prescribed to treat them as well.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost of the time, the outcome is good. Cysts often remain small and do not need treatment. When surgically removed, the cysts most often do not return.\nBartholin cysts can sometimes recur and need ongoing treatment.\nPossible Complications\nIn most cases, there are no complications from the cysts themselves. A surgical removal carries a small risk for complication."}
