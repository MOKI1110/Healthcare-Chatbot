These changes can also help you lose weight and lower your chance of heart disease and stroke.\nYour health care provider can refer you to a dietitian who can help you create a healthy meal plan. Ask what your blood pressure target is. Your target will be based on your risk factors and other medical problems.\nDASH DIET\nThe low-salt\nDietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH)\ndiet is proven to help lower blood pressure. Its effects on blood pressure are sometimes seen within a few weeks.\nThis diet is rich in important nutrients and fiber. It also includes foods that are higher in potassium, calcium, and magnesium and lower in sodium (salt) than the typical American diet.\nThe goals of the DASH diet are:\nLimit sodium to no more than 2,300 mg a day (eating only 1,500 mg a day is an even more effective goal).\nReduce saturated fat to no more than 6% of daily calories and total fat to 27% of daily calories."}

Low-fat dairy products appear to be especially beneficial for lowering systolic blood pressure.\nWhen choosing fats, select monounsaturated oils, such as olive or canola oil.\nChoose whole grains over white flour or pasta products.\nChoose fresh fruits and vegetables every day. Many of these foods are rich in potassium, fiber, or both.\nEat nuts, seeds, or legumes (dried beans or peas) daily.\nChoose modest amounts of protein (no more than 18% of total daily calories). Fish, skinless poultry, and soy products are the best healthy protein sources.\nOther daily nutrient goals in the DASH diet include limiting carbohydrates to 55% of daily calories and dietary cholesterol to 150 mg. Try to get at least 30 grams (g) of daily fiber.\nCheck with your provider before you increase the\npotassium in your diet\nor use salt substitutes (which often contain potassium)."}

These include whole grains, fruits, and vegetables.\nLook at\nfood labels\n. Pay special attention to the level of saturated fat.\nAvoid or limit foods that are high in\nsaturated fat\n(more than 20% of the total fat). Eating too much saturated fat is one of the major risk factors for heart disease. Food high in this type of fat include: egg yolks, hard cheeses, whole milk, cream, ice cream, butter, and fatty meats (and large portions of meats).\nChoose lean protein foods. These include soy, fish, skinless chicken, very lean meat, and fat-free or 1% fat dairy products.\nLook for the words \"hydrogenated\" or \"partially hydrogenated\" on food labels. Do not eat foods with these ingredients."}

They may contain a lot of saturated fats or trans fats.\nPay attention to how foods are prepared. Healthy ways to cook fish, chicken, and lean meats are broiling, grilling, poaching, and baking.
