It disrupts familiar routines and imposes new demands. Planning ahead, and involving children in the planning, may lessen the stress of travel.\nRecommendations\nTalk to your child's health care provider before traveling with a child. Children may have special medical concerns. Your child's provider can also talk to you about any medicines you might need if your child becomes ill.\nKnow your child's dosage of common medicines for\ncolds\n,\nallergic reactions\n, or\nflu\n. If your child has a long-term (chronic) illness, consider bringing a copy of recent medical reports and a list of all medicines your child is taking.\nPLANES, TRAINS, BUSES\nBring snacks and familiar foods with you. This helps when travel delays meals or when the available meals do not suit your child's needs. Small crackers, unsugared cereals, and string cheese make good snacks. Some children can eat fruit without problems."}

Cookies and sugared cereals make for sticky children.\nWhen flying with babies and infants:\nIf you are not breastfeeding, bring powdered formula and get water after you get through security.\nIf you are breastfeeding, you can bring breast milk in larger quantities than 3 ounces (90 milliliters), as long as you tell security people and let them inspect it.\nSmall jars of baby food travel well. They make little waste and you can dispose of them easily.\nAir travel tends to dehydrate (dry out) people. Drink plenty of water. Women who are nursing need to drink more fluids.\nFLYING AND YOUR CHILD'S EARS\nChildren often have trouble with pressure changes at takeoff and landing. The pain and pressure will almost always go away in a few minutes. If your child has a cold or ear infection, the discomfort may be greater.\nYour provider may suggest not flying if your child has an ear infection or a lot of fluid behind the eardrum."}

If your child has a cold or ear infection, the discomfort may be greater.\nYour provider may suggest not flying if your child has an ear infection or a lot of fluid behind the eardrum. Children who have had ear tubes placed should do fine.\nSome tips to prevent or treat ear pain:\nHave your child chew sugar-free gum or suck on hard candy when taking off and landing. It helps with ear pressure. Most children can learn to do this at about age 3.\nBottles (for infants), breastfeeding, or sucking on pacifiers can also help prevent ear pain.\nGive your child plenty of fluids during the flight to help unclog the ears.\nAvoid letting your child sleep during takeoff or landing. Children swallow more often when they are awake. Also, waking up with ear pain can be frightening for your child.\nGive your child acetaminophen or ibuprofen about 30 minutes before takeoff or landing. Or, use nasal spray or drops before takeoff or landing. Follow package instructions exactly about how much medicine to give your child.\nAsk your provider before using cold medicines that contain antihistamines or decongestants.\nEATING OUT\nTry to maintain your normal meal schedule."}

Ask that your child be served first (you can also bring something for your child to munch on). If you call ahead, some airlines may be able to prepare special kid's meals.\nEncourage children to eat normally, but realize that a poor diet won't hurt for a few days.\nBe aware of\nfood safety\n. For example, do not eat raw fruits or vegetables. Eat only food that is hot and has been cooked thoroughly. And, drink bottled water not tap water.\nADDITIONAL HELP\nMany travel clubs and agencies offer suggestions for traveling with children. Check with them. Remember to ask airlines, train, or bus companies and hotels for guidance and assistance.\nFor foreign travel, check with your provider about vaccines or medicines to prevent travel-related illness. Also check with embassies or consulate offices for general information."}
