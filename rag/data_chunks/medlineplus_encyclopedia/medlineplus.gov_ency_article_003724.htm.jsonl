This makes you cough more deeply and produce sputum.\nIf you still do not produce enough sputum, you might have a procedure called a\nbronchoscopy\nto collect a sputum sample.\nTo increase the accuracy, this test is sometimes done 3 times, often 3 days in a row.\nThe test sample is examined under a microscope. This sputum stain test can give your health care provider a quick answer. Another test, called a\nculture\n, is done to confirm the results. A culture test may take several (6 to 10) weeks to get results.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nDrinking fluids the night before the test helps your lungs produce phlegm."}
