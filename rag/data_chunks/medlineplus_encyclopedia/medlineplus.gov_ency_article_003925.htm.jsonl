Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCarpal tunnel biopsy\nCarpal tunnel biopsy\nCarpal tunnel biopsy is a test in which a small piece of tissue is removed from the carpal tunnel (part of the wrist).\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe skin of your wrist is  cleansed and injected with medicine that numbs the area. Through a small cut, a sample of tissue is removed from the carpal tunnel. This is done by direct removal of tissue or by needle\naspiration\n.\nSometimes this procedure is  done at the same time as\ncarpal tunnel release\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nFollow instructions for not eating or drinking anything for a few hours before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel some stinging or burning when the numbing medicine is injected. You may also feel some pressure or tugging during the procedure. Afterward, the area may be tender or sore for a few days.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is often done to see if you have a condition called\namyloidosis\n. It is not usually done to relieve\ncarpal tunnel syndrome\n."}

It is not usually done to relieve\ncarpal tunnel syndrome\n. However, a person with amyloidosis can have carpal tunnel syndrome.\nCarpal tunnel syndrome is a condition in which there is excessive pressure on the median nerve. This is the nerve in the wrist that allows feeling and movement to parts of the hand. Carpal tunnel syndrome can lead to numbness, tingling, weakness, or muscle damage in the hand and fingers. Some of these injuries can be permanent, so it is important to have the condition addressed early.\nNormal Results\nNo abnormal tissues are found.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result means that you have amyloidosis. Other medical treatment and diagnostic tests will be needed for this condition.\nRisks\nRisks of this procedure include:\nBleeding\nDamage to the nerve in this area\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nBiopsy - carpal tunnel\nImages\nCarpal tunnel syndrome\nSurface anatomy - normal palm\nSurface anatomy - normal wrist\nCarpal biopsy\nReferences\nBuxbaum JN.
