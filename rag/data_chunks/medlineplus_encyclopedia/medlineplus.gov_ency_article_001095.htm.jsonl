They often occur in pregnant women and in people with liver disease. They can appear in both children and adults. They get their name because the mark looks similar to a red spider.\nThey appear most often on the face, neck, upper part of the trunk, arms, and fingers.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom is a blood vessel spot that:\nMay have a red dot in the center\nHas reddish extensions that reach out from the center\nDisappears when pressed on and comes back when pressure is released\nIn rare cases, bleeding occurs in a spider angioma.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine the spider angioma on your skin. You may be asked if you have any other symptoms.\nMost of the time, you do not need tests to diagnose the condition. But sometimes, a\nskin biopsy\nis needed to confirm the diagnosis."}

Untreated, spider angiomas tend to last in adults.\nTreatment is often successful.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nLet your provider know if you have a new spider angioma so they can check for other related medical conditions.\nAlternative Names\nNevus araneus; Spider telangiectasia; Vascular spider; Spider nevus; Arterial spiders\nReferences\nDinulos JGH.
