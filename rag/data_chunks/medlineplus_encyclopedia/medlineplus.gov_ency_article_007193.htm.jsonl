However, they are very often more severe and debilitating. They also include at least one mood-related symptom. Symptoms occur during the week just before menstrual bleeding. They most often get better within a few days after the period starts.\nHere is a list of common PMDD symptoms:\nLack of  interest in daily activities and relationships\nFatigue or low energy\nSadness or hopelessness, possibly thoughts of suicide\nAnxiety\nOut of control feeling\nFood cravings or binge eating\nMood swings sometimes with bouts of crying\nPanic attacks\nIrritability or anger that affects other people\nBloating, breast tenderness, headaches, and joint or muscle pain\nProblems sleeping\nTrouble concentrating\nExams and Tests\nNo physical exam or lab tests can diagnose PMDD."}

A complete history, physical exam (including a pelvic exam), thyroid testing, and psychiatric evaluation should be done to check for other conditions.\nKeeping a calendar or diary of symptoms can help women identify the most troublesome symptoms and the times when they are likely to occur. This information may help your health care provider diagnose PMDD and determine the best treatment.\nTreatment\nA healthy lifestyle is the first step to managing PMDD.\nEat healthy foods with whole grains, vegetables, fruit, and little or no salt, sugar, alcohol, and caffeine.\nGet regular aerobic exercise throughout the month to reduce the severity of PMS symptoms.\nIf you have problems sleeping, try changing your sleep habits before taking medicines for insomnia.\nKeep a diary or calendar to record:\nThe type of symptoms you are having\nHow severe they are\nHow long they last\nSome antidepressants may be helpful.\nThe first option is most often an antidepressant known as a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibito"}

Ask your provider what would be best for you.\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) may be used either with or instead of antidepressants. During CBT, you have about 10 visits with a mental health professional over several weeks to months to learn how to apply this therapy to your needs.\nOther treatments that may help include:\nBirth control pills which typically help reduce PMS symptoms.
