Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe antibody level (titer) in the blood tells your health care provider whether or not you have been exposed to an\nantigen\n, or something that the body thinks is foreign."}

The body uses antibodies to attack and remove foreign substances.\nIn some situations, your provider may check your antibody titer to see if you had an infection in the past (for example, chickenpox or measles) or to decide which vaccines you need.\nThe antibody titer is also used to determine:\nThe strength of an immune response to the body's own tissue in diseases such as\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\n(SLE) and other\nautoimmune disorders\nIf you need a booster vaccine\nWhether a vaccine you had before helped your immune system protect you against the specific disease\nIf you have had a recent or past infection, such as\nmononucleosis\nor\nviral hepatitis\nNormal Results\nNormal values depend on the antibody being tested.\nIf the test is being done to look for antibodies against your own body tissues, the normal value would be zero or negative."}

In some cases, a normal level is below a specific number.\nIf the test is being done to see if a vaccine fully protects you against a disease, the normal result depends on the specific value for that immunization.\nNegative antibody tests can help rule out certain infections.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results depend on which antibodies are being measured.\nAbnormal results may be due to:\nAutoimmune disease\nFailure of a vaccine to fully protect you against a certain disease\nImmune deficiency\nViral infections\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
