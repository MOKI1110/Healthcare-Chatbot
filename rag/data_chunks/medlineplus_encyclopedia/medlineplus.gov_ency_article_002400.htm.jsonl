Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nVitamin A\nVitamin A\nVitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that is stored in the liver.\nThere are two types of vitamin A that are found in the diet.\nPreformed vitamin A is found in animal products such as meat, fish, poultry, and dairy foods.\nPrecursors to vitamin A, also known as provitamin A, are found in plant-based foods such as fruits and vegetables. The most common type of provitamin A is beta-carotene.\nVitamin A is also available in dietary supplements. It most often comes in the form of retinyl acetate or retinyl palmitate (preformed vitamin A), beta-carotene (provitamin A) or a combination of preformed and provitamin A.\nFunction\nVitamin A helps form and maintain healthy teeth, skeletal and soft tissue, mucus membranes, and skin. It is also known as retinol because it produces the pigments in the\nretina\nof the eye.\nVitamin A promotes good eyesight, especially in low light."}

It is also known as retinol because it produces the pigments in the\nretina\nof the eye.\nVitamin A promotes good eyesight, especially in low light. It also has a role in healthy pregnancy and breastfeeding.\nSome research suggests that taking vitamin A may help reduce the risk of measles, but not death from measles, in children in low-income countries who are at high risk for vitamin A deficiency. Vitamin A deficiency is very rare in the United States. It is not recommended to take vitamin A to prevent measles. Taking too much vitamin A can cause serious illness.\nVitamin A is found in two forms in food:\nRetinol: Preformed retinol is an active form of vitamin A. It is found in animal liver, whole milk, and some fortified foods.\nProvitamin A carotenoids: Carotenoids are plant pigments (dyes). Once ingested, the body converts these compounds into vitamin A. There are more than 500 known carotenoids. One such carotenoid is beta-carotene.\nBeta-carotene is an antioxidant."}

Antioxidants protect cells from damage caused by substances called free radicals.\nFree radicals are believed to:\nContribute to certain long-term diseases\nPlay a role in aging\nEating food sources of beta-carotene may reduce the risk for cancer.\nBeta-carotene supplements do not reduce cancer risk. They may increase the risk of cancer in current and former smokers and in workers exposed to asbestos.\nFood Sources\nVitamin A is found in both plant and animal foods.\nFoods with the highest levels of vitamin A include:\nBeef liver and other organ meats (these are high in saturated fat and cholesterol, so limit the amount you eat)\nSome types of fish such as herring and salmon and cod fish oil\nEggs\nDairy products such as cheese and fortified milk (choose non-fat and low-fat dairy options)\nFortified breakfast cereals\nOrange and yellow vegetables and fruits, such as carrots, sweet potatoes, mangos, and cantaloupe\nBroccoli, spinach, and most dark green, leafy vegetables\nThe deeper or brighter the col"}

Vegetable sources of beta-carotene are fat- and cholesterol-free. Their absorption is improved if these sources are eaten with a small amount of fat.\nSide Effects\nDEFICIENCY:\nIf you do not get enough vitamin A, you have more risk of eye problems such as:\nReversible night blindness\nNon-reversible corneal damage known as\nxerophthalmia\nLack of vitamin A can also lead to hyperkeratosis or dry, scaly skin.\nHIGH INTAKE:\nIf you get too much vitamin A, you can\nbecome sick\n.  If you get more vitamin A than you need, it can build up in the body and cause serious health problems.\nLarge doses of vitamin A in pregnant women can also cause birth defects.\nAcute vitamin A poisoning most often occurs when an adult takes several hundred thousand IUs of vitamin A.\nChronic vitamin A poisoning may occur in adults who regularly take more than 33,000 IU a day.\nBabies and children are more sensitive to vitamin A."}

They can become sick after taking smaller doses of it. Swallowing products that contain vitamin A, such as skin cream with retinol in it, can also cause vitamin A poisoning.\nLarge amounts of beta-carotene will not make you seriously ill. However, high amounts of beta-carotene can turn the skin yellow or orange. The skin color will return to normal once you reduce your intake of beta-carotene.\nRecommendations\nRecommendations for vitamin A, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)\n: The average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people."}
