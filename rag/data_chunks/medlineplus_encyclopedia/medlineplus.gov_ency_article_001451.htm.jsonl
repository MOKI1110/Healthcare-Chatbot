It may begin in early childhood. The condition is inherited in an\nautosomal dominant\npattern. That means if you have the condition, your child has a 50% chance of getting the gene from you.\nThe condition is often more noticeable in the winter. It may occur along with other skin problems including\natopic dermatitis\n, asthma, keratosis pilaris (small bumps on the back of the arms and legs), or other skin disorders.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nDry skin\n, severe\nScaly skin (\nscales\n)\nPossible skin thickening\nMild itching of the skin\nThe dry, scaly skin is usually most severe on the legs. But it can also involve the arms, hands, and middle of the body. People with this condition may also have many fine lines on their palms.\nIn infants, the skin changes usually appear in the first year of life."}

People with this condition may also have many fine lines on their palms.\nIn infants, the skin changes usually appear in the first year of life. Early on, the skin is only slightly rough, but by the time a baby is about 3 months old, they begin appearing on the shins and back of the arms.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can usually diagnose this condition by looking at your skin. Tests may be done to check for other possible causes of dry, scaly skin.\nYour provider will ask if you have a family history of similar skin dryness.\nskin biopsy\nmay be performed.\nTreatment\nYour provider may ask you to use heavy-duty moisturizers. Creams and ointments work better than lotions. Apply these to moist skin immediately after bathing. You should use mild, non-drying soaps.\nYour provider may tell you to use hydrating-moisturizing creams that contain keratolytic chemicals such as lactic acid, salicylic acid, and urea. These chemicals help skin shed normally while retaining moisture.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIchthyosis vulgaris can be bothersome, but it rarely affects your overall health."}
