It  is contained in the amniotic sac.\nInformation\nWhile in the womb, the baby floats in the amniotic fluid. The amount of amniotic fluid is greatest at about 34 weeks into the pregnancy (34 weeks\ngestation\n), when it averages 800 milliliters (mL). About 600 mL of amniotic fluid surrounds the baby at full term (40 weeks gestation).\nThe amniotic fluid constantly moves (circulates) as the baby swallows and \"inhales\" the fluid, and then releases it.\nThe amniotic fluid helps:\nThe developing baby to move in the womb, which allows for proper bone growth\nThe lungs to develop properly\nPrevent pressure on the umbilical cord\nKeep a constant temperature around the baby, protecting from heat loss\nProtect the baby from outside injury by cushioning sudden blows or movements\nToo much amniotic fluid is called\npolyhydramnios\n."}

This condition may occur with late pregnancies, ruptured membranes,\nplacental dysfunction\n, or fetal abnormalities.\nAbnormal amounts of amniotic fluid may cause the health care provider to watch the pregnancy more carefully. Removing a sample of the fluid through\namniocentesis\ncan provide information about the sex, health, and development of the fetus.\nImages\nAmniocentesis\nAmniotic fluid\nPolyhydramnios\nAmniotic fluid\nReferences\nBurton GJ, Sibley CP, Jauniaux ERM.
