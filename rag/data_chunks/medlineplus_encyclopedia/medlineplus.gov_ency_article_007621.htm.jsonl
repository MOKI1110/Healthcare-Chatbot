It is one of the most common ways to quickly diagnose bacterial infection in the body.\nHow the Test is Performed\nHow the test is performed depends on what tissue or fluid from your body is being tested. The test may be quite simple, or you may need to prepare ahead of time.\nYou may need to provide a sputum, urine, or stool sample.\nYour health care provider may use a needle to take fluid from your body to test. This could be from a joint, from the sac around your heart, or from the space around your lungs.\nYour provider may need to take a tissue sample, such as from your cervix or skin.\nThe sample is sent to a laboratory.\nA small amount is spread in a very thin layer on a glass slide."}

This is called a smear.\nA series of stains are added to the sample.\nA lab team member examines the stained smear under the microscope, looking for bacteria.\nThe color, size, and shape of the cells help identify the specific type of bacteria.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider will tell you what to do to prepare for the test. For some types of tests, you will not need to do anything.\nHow the Test will Feel\nHow the test will feel depends on the method used to take a sample.

It can also identify the type of bacteria causing the infection.\nThis test can help find the cause of various health problems, including:\nIntestinal infection or illness\nSexually transmitted diseases (STDs)\nUnexplained swelling or joint pain\nSigns of a heart infection or fluid buildup in the thin sac that surrounds the heart (pericardium)\nSigns of infection of the space around the lungs (pleural space)\nCough that will not go away, or if you are coughing up material with a foul odor or odd color\nInfected skin sore\nNormal Results\nA normal result means that no bacteria or only friendly bacteria were found. Some types of bacteria normally live in certain areas of the body, such as the intestines. Bacteria normally don't live in other areas, such as the brain or spinal fluid.\nTalk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may indicate an infection."}
