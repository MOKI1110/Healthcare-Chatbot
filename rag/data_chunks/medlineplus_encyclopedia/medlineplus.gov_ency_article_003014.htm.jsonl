Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEardrum repair\nEardrum repair\nEardrum repair refers to one or more surgical procedures that are done to correct a tear or other damage to the eardrum (tympanic membrane).\nOssiculoplasty is the repair of the small bones in the middle ear.\nDescription\nMost adults (and all children) receive\ngeneral anesthesia\nfor this surgery. This means you'll be asleep and unable to feel pain. Sometimes, local anesthesia is used along with medicine that makes you sleepy.\nYour surgeon will make a cut behind the ear or inside the ear canal.\nDepending on the problem, your surgeon will:\nClean out any infection or dead tissue on the eardrum or in the middle ear.\nPatch the eardrum with a piece of the patient's own tissue taken from a vein or muscle sheath (called tympanoplasty). This procedure will usually take 2 to 3 hours.\nRemove, replace, or repair 1 or more of the 3 little bones in the middle ear (called ossiculoplasty).\nRepair smaller holes in the eardrum by placing either gel or a special paper over the eardrum (called myringoplasty)."}

This procedure will usually take 10 to 30 minutes.\nYour surgeon will use an operating microscope to view and repair the eardrum or the small bones.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThe eardrum is between the outer ear and the middle ear. It vibrates when sound waves strike it. When the eardrum is damaged or has a hole in it, hearing may be reduced and ear infections may be more likely.\nCauses of holes or openings in the eardrum include:\nA bad\near infection\nDysfunction of the eustachian tube\nSticking something inside the ear canal\nSurgery to place\near tubes\nTrauma\nIf the eardrum has a small hole, myringoplasty may work to close it."}

For infants, this includes breastfeeding.\nTake any needed medicines with a small sip of water.\nIf you or your child is ill on the morning of surgery, call the surgeon right away."}

The procedure will need to be rescheduled.\nArrive at the hospital on time.\nAfter the Procedure\nYou or your child may leave the hospital the same day as the surgery, but may need to stay the night in case of any complications.\nTo protect the ear after surgery:\nPacking will be placed in the ear for the first 5 to 7 days.\nSometimes a dressing covers the ear itself.\nUntil your provider says it is OK:\nDo not allow water to get into the ear. When showering or washing your hair, place cotton in the outer ear and cover it with petroleum jelly. An option to using cotton and petroleum jelly is to wear a shower cap pulled down to cover your ears.\nDo not \"pop\" your ears or blow your nose. If you need to sneeze, do so with your mouth. Draw any mucus in your nose back into your throat.\nAvoid air travel and swimming.\nGently wipe away any ear drainage on the outside of the ear. You may get eardrops the first week."}

Do not put anything else into the ear.\nIf you have stitches behind the ear and they get wet, gently dry the area. Do not rub.\nYou or your child may feel pulsing, or hear popping, clicking, or other sounds in the ear. The ear may feel full or as if it is filled with liquid. There may be sharp, shooting pains off and on soon after the surgery.\nTo avoid catching a cold, stay away from crowded places and people with cold symptoms.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn most cases, the pain and symptoms are completely relieved. Hearing loss is minor.\nThe outcome may not be as good if the bones in the middle ear need to be reconstructed, along with the eardrum.\nAlternative Names\nMyringoplasty; Tympanoplasty; Ossiculoplasty; Ossicular reconstruction; Tympanosclerosis - surgery; Ossicular discontinuity - surgery; Ossicular fixation - surgery\nImages\nEardrum repair  - series\nReferences\nAdams ME, El-Kashlan HK.
