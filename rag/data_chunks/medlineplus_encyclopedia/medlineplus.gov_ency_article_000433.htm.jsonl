This is the nerve that allows feeling and movement to parts of the hand. Carpal tunnel syndrome can lead to pain, numbness, tingling, weakness, or muscle damage in the hand and fingers.\nCauses\nThe median nerve typically provides feeling and movement to the thumb side of the hand. This includes the palm, thumb, index finger, middle finger, and thumb side of the ring finger.\nThe area in your wrist where the nerve enters the hand is called the carpal tunnel. This tunnel is normally narrow. A thick ligament (tissue) just under your skin (the carpal ligament) makes up the top of this tunnel. Any swelling can pinch the nerve and cause pain, numbness, tingling, or weakness. This is called carpal tunnel syndrome.\nSome people who develop carpal tunnel syndrome were born with a small carpal tunnel.\nCarpal tunnel syndrome can also be caused by making the same hand and wrist motion over and over."}

Using hand tools that vibrate may also lead to carpal tunnel syndrome.\nStudies have not proved that carpal tunnel is caused by typing on a computer, using a mouse, or repeating movements while working, playing a musical instrument, or playing sports. But, these activities may cause tendinitis or bursitis in the hand, which can narrow the carpal tunnel and lead to symptoms.\nCarpal tunnel syndrome occurs most often in people ages 30 to 60."}

For example, make sure the keyboard is low enough so that your wrists are not bent upward while typing. Your provider may suggest an occupational therapist.\nMaking changes in your work duties or home and sports activities.
