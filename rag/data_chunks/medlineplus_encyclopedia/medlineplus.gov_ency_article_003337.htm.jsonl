Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nX-ray\nX-ray\nX-rays are a type of electromagnetic radiation, just like visible light.\nAn x-ray machine sends individual x-ray waves through the body. The images are recorded on a computer or film.\nStructures that are dense (such as bone) will block most of the x-ray, and will appear white.\nMetal and contrast media (special dye used to highlight areas of the body) will also appear white.\nStructures containing air will be black, and muscle, fat, and fluid will appear as shades of gray.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is done in a hospital radiology department or in your health care provider's office. How you are positioned depends on the type of x-ray being done. Several different x-ray views may be needed.\nYou need to stay still when you are having an x-ray. Motion can cause blurry images."}

You may be asked to hold your breath or not move for a second or two when the image is being taken.\nThe following are common types of x-rays:\nAbdominal x-ray\nBarium x-ray\nBone x-ray\nChest x-ray\nDental x-ray\nExtremity x-ray\nHand x-ray\nJoint x-ray\nLumbosacral spine x-ray\nNeck x-ray\nPelvis x-ray\nSinus x-ray\nSkull x-ray\nThoracic spine x-ray\nUpper GI and small bowel series\nX-ray of the skeleton\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nBefore the x-ray, tell your health care team if you are pregnant or may be pregnant.\nYou will need to remove all jewelry. Metal can cause unclear images. You may need to wear a hospital gown.\nHow the Test will Feel\nX-rays are painless. Some body positions needed during an x-ray may be uncomfortable for a short time.\nRisks\nX-rays are monitored and regulated so you get the minimum amount of radiation exposure needed to produce the image.\nFor most x-rays, your risk for cancer, or if you are pregnant, the risk for birth defects in your unborn baby is very low."}
