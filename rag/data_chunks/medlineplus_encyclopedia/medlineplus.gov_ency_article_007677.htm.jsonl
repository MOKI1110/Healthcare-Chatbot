Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCT angiography - head and neck\nCT angiography - head and neck\nCT angiography (CTA) combines a CT scan with the injection of dye. CT stands for computed tomography. This technique is able to create pictures of the blood vessels in the head and neck.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will be asked to lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner.\nWhile inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you.\nA computer creates many separate images of the body area, called slices. These images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, or printed on film. Three-dimensional models of the head and neck area can be created by stacking the slices together.\nYou must be still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time.\nComplete scans can usually be completed in a few minutes or less."}

You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time.\nComplete scans can usually be completed in a few minutes or less. The newest scanners can image your entire body, head to toe, in less than 30 seconds.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nCertain exams require a special dye, called contrast, to be delivered into the body before the test starts. Contrast helps certain areas show up better on x-rays.\nContrast can be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. If contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.\nLet your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test in order to safely receive it.\nBefore receiving the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes medicine metformin (Glucophage). You may need to take extra precautions.\nThe contrast can worsen kidney function problems in people with poorly functioning kidneys. Talk to your provider if you have a history of kidney problems.\nToo much weight can damage the scanner."}

Having many x-rays or CT scans over time may increase your risk for cancer. However, the risk from any one scan is small. You and your provider should weigh this risk against the benefits of getting a correct diagnosis for a medical problem. Most modern scanners use techniques to use less radiation.\nSome people have allergies to contrast dye. Let your provider know if you have ever had an allergic reaction to injected contrast dye.\nThe most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine."}
