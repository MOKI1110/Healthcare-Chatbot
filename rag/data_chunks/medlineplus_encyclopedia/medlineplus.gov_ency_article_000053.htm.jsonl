That means electricity passes easily throughout the body. Direct contact with electrical current can be deadly. While some electrical\nburns\nlook minor, there may be serious internal damage, especially to the heart, muscles, or brain.\nElectric current can cause injury in four ways:\nCardiac arrest due to the electrical effect on the heart\nMuscle, nerve, and tissue destruction from a current passing through the body\nThermal burns from contact with the electrical source\nFalling or injury after contact with electricity\nCauses\nElectrical injury can be caused by:\nAccidental contact with power outlets, power cords, or exposed parts of electrical appliances or wiring\nFlashing of electric arcs from high-voltage power lines\nLightning\nMachinery or occupational-related exposures\nYoung children biting or chewing on electrical cords, or poking meta"}

Unplug the cord, remove the fuse from the fuse box, or turn off the circuit breakers. Simply turning off an appliance may not stop the flow of electricity. Do not attempt to rescue a person near active high-voltage lines.\nCall 911 or the local emergency number.\nIf the current can't be turned off, use a non-conducting object, such as a broom, chair, rug, or rubber doormat to push the person away from the source of the current. Do not use a wet or metal object. If possible, stand on something dry that doesn't conduct electricity, such as a rubber mat or folded newspapers.\nOnce the person is away from the source of electricity, check the person's airway, breathing, and pulse. If either has stopped or seems dangerously slow or shallow, start first aid.\nCPR\nshould be started if the person is unconscious and you can't feel a pulse. Perform rescue breathing on a person who is unconscious and not breathing or is breathing ineffectively.\nIf the person has a burn, remove any clothing that comes off easily and rinse the burned area with cool, running water until the pain subsides."}
