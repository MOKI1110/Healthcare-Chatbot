Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nErysipeloid\nErysipeloid\nErysipeloid is a rare and acute infection of the skin caused by a specific type of bacteria.\nCauses\nThe bacteria that cause erysipeloid are called\nErysipelothrix rhusiopathiae\n. This type of bacteria may be found in fish, birds, mammals, and shellfish. Erysipeloid usually affects people who work with these animals (such as farmers, butchers, cooks, grocers, fishermen, or veterinarians). Infection results when the bacteria enters the skin through small breaks.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may develop in 2 to 7 days after bacteria enter the skin. Usually, the fingers and hands are affected. But any exposed area of the body can get infected if there is a break in the skin. Symptoms may include:\nBright red skin in the infected area\nSwelling of the area\nThrobbing pain with itching or burning sensation\nFluid-filled\nblisters\nLow fever if the infection spreads\nSwollen lymph nodes\n(sometimes)\nThe infection may spread to other fingers. It usually doesn't spread past the wrist.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you."}

It usually doesn't spread past the wrist.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you. Your provider can often make the diagnosis by looking at the infected skin and by asking how your symptoms started.\nTests that may be done to confirm the diagnosis include:\nSkin biopsy\nand\nculture\nto check for the bacteria\nBlood tests to check for bacteria if the infection has spread\nTreatment\nAntibiotics, especially penicillin, are very effective to treat this condition.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nErysipeloid may get better on its own. It rarely spreads. If it does spread, the lining of the heart can become infected. This condition is called\nendocarditis\n.\nPrevention\nUsing gloves while handling or preparing fish or meat can prevent the infection.\nAlternative Names\nErysipelothricosis - erysipeloid; Skin infection - erysipeloid; Cellulitis - erysipeloid; Erysipeloid of Rosenbach; Diamond skin disease; Erysipelas\nReferences\nDinulos JGH.
