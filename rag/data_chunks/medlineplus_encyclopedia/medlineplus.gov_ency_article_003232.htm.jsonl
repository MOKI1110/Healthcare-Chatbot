A person with purpura may have a normal platelet count (non-thrombocytopenic purpuras) or a low platelet counts (\nthrombocytopenic\npurpuras).\nCauses\nNon-thrombocytopenic purpuras may be due to:\nAmyloidosis\n(disorder in which abnormal proteins build up in tissues and organs)\nBlood clotting disorders\nCongenital cytomegalovirus\n(condition in which an infant is infected with a virus called cytomegalovirus before birth)\nCongenital\nrubella\nsyndrome\nDrugs that affect platelet function or clotting factors\nFragile blood vessels seen in older people (senile purpura)\nHemangioma\n(abnormal buildup of blood vessels in the sk"}
