Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test may be performed if:\nYou have or are at risk for\ntype 1 diabetes\nYou appear to have an allergic response to insulin\nInsulin no longer seems to control your diabetes\nYou are taking insulin to control your diabetes and your blood sugar level varies a lot, with both high and low numbers that can't be explained by the food you are eating relative to the timing of your insulin injections\nNormal Results\nNormally, there are no antibodies against insulin in your blood. Antibodies can be found in the blood of many people who are taking insulin to control diabetes.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThe presence of IgG and IgM antibodies against insulin can be part of the testing that diagnoses you with type 1 diabetes.\nIf you develop anti-insulin antibodies, insulin may not work as well, or it may not work at all. As a result, your blood sugar can be very high. Or the antibodies can also put you at risk for low blood sugar.\nYour provider may suggest a different form of insulin to which your body may be less likely to form antibodies.\nIf the test shows a high level of IgE antibody against insulin, your body has developed an allergic response to the insulin.\nThis could put you at risk for skin reactions where you inject insulin. You can also develop more severe reactions that affect your blood pressure or breathing.\nMedicines, such as antihistamines or low-dose injectable steroids, may help."}

You can also develop more severe reactions that affect your blood pressure or breathing.\nMedicines, such as antihistamines or low-dose injectable steroids, may help. Or you may need a treatment process called desensitization or a treatment to remove the antibodies from your blood.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks of having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma\n(blood building up under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nInsulin antibodies - serum; Insulin Ab test; Insulin resistance - insulin antibodies; Diabetes - insulin antibodies\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nAtkinson MA, Mcgill DE, Dassau E, Laffel L.
