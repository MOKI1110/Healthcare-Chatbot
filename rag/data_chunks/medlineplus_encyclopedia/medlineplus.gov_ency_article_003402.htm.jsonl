Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nApgar score\nApgar score\nThe Apgar score is a quick test performed on a baby at 1 and 5 minutes after birth. The 1-minute score determines how well the baby tolerated the birthing process. The 5-minute score tells your health care provider how well the baby is doing outside the mother's womb.  It also helps measure how well the baby responds if resuscitation is needed right after birth.\nIn rare cases, the test will be done 10 minutes after birth.\nVirginia Apgar, MD (1909-1974) introduced the Apgar score in 1952.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe Apgar test is done by a doctor, midwife, or nurse. Your provider examines the baby's:\nBreathing effort\nHeart rate\nMuscle tone\nReflexes\nSkin color\nEach category is scored with 0, 1, or 2, depending on the observed condition.\nBreathing effort:\nIf the infant is not breathing, the respiratory score is 0.\nIf the respirations are slow or irregular, the infant scores 1 for respiratory effort.\nIf the infant cries well, the respiratory score is 2.\nHeart rate is evaluated by stethoscope."}

The higher the score, the better the baby is doing after birth.\nA score of 7, 8, or 9 is normal and is a sign that the newborn is in good health. A score of 10 is very unusual, since almost all newborns lose 1 point for blue hands and feet, which is normal for after birth.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAny score lower than 7 is a sign that the baby needs medical attention."}

Apgar scores are not usually measured after 5 minutes.\nA lower Apgar score does not mean a child will have serious or long-term health problems. The Apgar score is not designed to predict the future health of the child.\nIf the Apgar score is below 7 at the five-minute mark, some providers will check it a few minutes later to assess the effect of any action taken to correct any respiratory or cardiac concerns."}
