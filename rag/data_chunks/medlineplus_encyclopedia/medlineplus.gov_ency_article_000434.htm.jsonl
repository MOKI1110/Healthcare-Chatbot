Most people with psoriasis have thick, red, well-defined patches of skin with flaky, silver-white\nscales\n. This is called plaque psoriasis.\nCauses\nPsoriasis is common. Anyone can develop it, but it most often begins between ages 10 and 35, or as people get older.\nPsoriasis isn't contagious. This means it doesn't spread to other people.\nPsoriasis seems to be inherited through families, at least to some degree.\nNormal skin cells grow deep in the skin and rise to the surface about once a month. When you have psoriasis, on average this process takes place within 7 to14 days."}

When you have psoriasis, on average this process takes place within 7 to14 days. This results in dead skin cells building up on the skin's surface, forming the collections of scales.\nThe following may trigger an attack of psoriasis or make it harder to treat:\nInfections from bacteria or viruses, including\nstrep throat\nand upper respiratory infections\nDry air or dry skin\nInjury to the skin, including cuts, burns, insect bites, and other skin rashes\nSome medicines, including antimalaria medicines, beta-blockers, and lithium\nStress\nToo little sunlight\nToo much sunlight (sunburn)\nPsoriasis may be worse in people who have a weak immune system, including people with HIV/AIDS.\nSome people with psoriasis also have arthritis (\npsoriatic arthritis\n). People with psoriasis have an increased risk for\nfatty liver disease\nand cardiovascular disorders, such as heart disease and\nstroke\n.\nSymptoms\nPsoriasis can appear suddenly or slowly. Many times, it goes away and then comes back.\nThe main symptom of the condition is irritated, red, flaky plaques of skin."}

Many times, it goes away and then comes back.\nThe main symptom of the condition is irritated, red, flaky plaques of skin. Plaques are most often seen on the elbows, knees, and middle of the body. But they can appear anywhere, including on the scalp, palms, soles of the feet, and genitals.\nThe skin may be:\nItchy\nDry and covered with silver, flaky skin (scales)\nPink-red in color\nRaised and thick\nOther symptoms may include:\nJoint or tendon pain or aching\nNail changes\n, including thick nails, yellow-brown nails, small pits in the nail, and a lifting of the nail from the skin underneath\nSevere dandruff on the scalp\nThere are five main types of psoriasis:\nErythrodermic -- The skin redness is very intense and covers a large area.\nGuttate\n-- Small, pink-red spots appear on the skin. This form is often linked to strep infections, especially in children.\nInverse -- Skin redness and irritation occur in the armpits, groin, and in between overlapping skin rather than the more common areas of the elbows and knees.\nPlaque -- Thick, red patches of skin are covered by flaky, silver-white scales."}

If you have joint pain, your provider may order imaging studies.\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to regulate your symptoms and prevent infection.\nThree treatment options are available:\nSkin lotions, ointments, creams, and shampoos -- These are called topical treatments.\nPills or injections that affect the body's immune response, not just the skin -- These are called systemic or body-wide treatments.\nPhototherapy, which uses ultraviolet light to treat psoriasis.\nTREATMENTS USED ON THE SKIN (TOPICAL)\nMost of the time, psoriasis is treated with medicines that are placed directly on the skin or scalp."}
