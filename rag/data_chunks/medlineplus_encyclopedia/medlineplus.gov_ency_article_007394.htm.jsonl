Fatty deposits can build up inside the arteries and block them.\nA graft is used to replace or bypass the blocked part of the artery. The graft may be a plastic tube, or it may be a blood vessel (vein) taken from your body (most often the opposite leg) during the same surgery.\nDescription\nPeripheral artery bypass surgery can be done in one or more of the following blood vessels:\nAorta (the main artery that comes from your heart)\nArtery in your hip\nArtery in your thigh\nArtery behind your knee\nArtery in your lower leg\nArtery in your armpit\nDuring bypass surgery of any artery:\nYou will receive medicine (anesthesia) so that you do not feel pain."}

The kind of anesthesia you receive will depend on what artery is being treated.\nYour surgeon will make a cut over the part of the artery that is blocked.\nAfter moving skin and tissue out of the way, the surgeon will place clamps at each end of the blocked section of artery. The graft is then sewn in place.\nThe surgeon will make sure you have good blood flow in your extremity. Then your cut will be closed. You may have an x-ray called an\narteriogram\nto make sure that the graft is working.\nIf you are having bypass surgery to treat your aorta and iliac artery or your aorta and both femoral arteries (aortobifemoral):\nYou will probably have\ngeneral anesthesia\n. This will make you unconscious and unable to feel pain. Or, you may have epidural or spinal anesthesia instead."}

You will be unconscious and unable to feel pain. You may instead have an epidural or spinal anesthesia. The anesthesia doctor will inject your spine with medicine to make you numb from your waist down. Some people have local anesthesia and a medicine to relax them.

You may not need this surgery if you can still do most of your everyday activities. Your health care provider can try medicines and other treatments first.\nReasons for having arterial bypass surgery of the leg are:\nYou have symptoms that keep you from doing your everyday tasks.\nYour symptoms do not get better with other treatment.\nYou have skin ulcers (sores) or wounds on your leg that do not heal.\nYou have an infection or gangrene in your leg.\nYou have pain in your leg from your narrowed arteries, even when you are resting or at night.\nBefore having surgery, your surgeon will do special tests to see the extent of the blockage.\nRisks\nRisks for any anesthesia and surgery are:\nAllerg"}
