Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMesenteric angiography\nMesenteric angiography\nMesenteric angiography is a test used to look at the blood vessels that supply the stomach, small and large intestines, and other internal organs.\nAngiography is an imaging test that uses\nx-rays\nand a special dye to see the insides of the arteries. Arteries are blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis test is done in a hospital. You will lie on an x-ray table. You may ask for medicine to help you relax (sedative) if you need it.\nDuring the test, your blood pressure, heart rate, and breathing will be checked.\nThe health care provider will shave and clean the groin. A numbing medicine (anesthetic) is injected into the skin over an artery. A needle is inserted into an artery.\nA thin flexible tube called a catheter is passed through the needle. It is moved into the artery, and up through the main vessels of the belly area until it is properly placed into a mesenteric artery."}

It is moved into the artery, and up through the main vessels of the belly area until it is properly placed into a mesenteric artery. The doctor (usually a radiologist with special training in this technique) uses x-rays as a guide. The doctor can see live images of the area on a TV-like monitor.\nContrast dye is injected through this tube to see if there are any problems with the blood vessels. X-ray images are taken of the artery.\nCertain treatments can be done during this procedure. These items are passed through the catheter to the area in the artery that needs treatment. These include:\nDissolving a blood clot with medicine\nOpening a partially blocked artery with a balloon\nPlacing a small tube called a stent into an artery to help hold it open\nAfter the x-rays or treatments are finished, the catheter is removed. Pressure is applied to the puncture site for 20 to 45 minutes to stop the bleeding. After that time the area is checked and a tight bandage is applied. The leg where the needle was placed is most often kept straight for another 6 hours after the procedure."}

You should avoid strenuous activity, such as heavy lifting, for 24 to 48 hours.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou should not eat or drink anything for 6 to 8 hours before the test.\nYou will be asked to wear a hospital gown and sign a consent form for the procedure. Remove jewelry from the area being imaged.\nTell your provider:\nIf you are pregnant\nIf you have ever had any allergic reactions to x-ray contrast material, shellfish, or iodine substances\nIf you are allergic to any medicines\nWhich medicines you are taking (including any herbal preparations)\nIf you have ever had any bleeding problems\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel a brief sting when the numbing medicine is given. You will feel a brief sharp pain and some pressure as the catheter is placed and moved into the artery. In most cases, you will feel only a sensation of pressure in the groin area.\nAs the dye is injected, you will feel a warm, flushing sensation."}

The radiologist can then pinpoint and treat the source.\nNormal Results\nResults are normal if the examined arteries are normal in appearance.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA common abnormal finding is\nnarrowing and hardening of the arteries\nthat supply the large and small intestine."}

This can cause mesenteric ischemia in which the intestine does not receive enough blood to function normally. The problem occurs when fatty material (plaque) builds up on the walls of your arteries.\nAbnormal results may also be due to\nbleeding in the small and large intestine\n. This may be caused by:\nAngiodysplasia of the colon\nBlood vessel rupture from injury\nOther abnormal results may be due to:\nBlood clots\nCirrhosis\nTumors\nRisks\nThere is some risk of the catheter damaging the artery or knocking loose a piece of the artery wall. This can reduce or block blood flow and lead to tissue death."}
