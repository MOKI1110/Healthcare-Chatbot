Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAgranulocytosis\nAgranulocytosis\nWhite blood cells fight infections from bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other germs. One important type of white blood cell is the granulocyte, which is made in the bone marrow and travels in the blood throughout the body. Granulocytes sense infections, gather at sites of infection, and destroy the germs.\nWhen the body has too few granulocytes, the condition is called agranulocytosis. This makes it harder for the body to fight off germs. As a result, the person may get sick from infections.\nCauses\nAgranulocytosis may be caused by:\nAutoimmune disorders\nBone marrow diseases, such as myelodysplasia or large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia\nCertain medicines used to treat diseases, including\ncancer\nCertain street drugs\nPoor nutrition\nPreparation for\nbone marrow transplant\nBenign familial neutropenia\nGenetic variants, especially in people of certain African and Caribbean ethnicities\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of this condition may include:\nFever\nChills\nMalaise\nGeneral weakness\nSore throat\nMouth and throat\nulcers\nBone pain\nPneumonia\nShock\nExa"}

For example, if a medicine is the cause, stopping or changing to another medicine may help. In other cases, medicines to help the body make more white blood cells will be used. If the cause is due to normal genes, no treatment is required.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nTreating or removing the cause often results in a good outcome.\nPrevention\nIf you are having treatment or taking medicine that could cause agranulocytosis, your health care provider will use blood tests to monitor you.\nAlternative Names\nGranulocytopenia; Granulopenia; Neutropenia\nImages\nBlood cells\nReferences\nBerliner N.
