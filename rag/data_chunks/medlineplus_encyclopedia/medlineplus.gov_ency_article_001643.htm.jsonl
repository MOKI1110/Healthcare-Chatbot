This can be an urgent medical problem.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will check to see how your vocal cords move. Abnormal movement may mean that a laryngeal nerve is injured.\nTests may include:\nBronchoscopy\nCT scan\nof the chest\nLaryngoscopy\nMRI\nof the brain, neck, and chest\nX-ray\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the cause of the injury. In some cases, no treatment may be needed and the nerve may recover on its own. Voice therapy is useful in some cases.\nIf surgery is needed, the goal is to change the position of the paralyzed vocal cord to improve the voice. This can be done with:\nArytenoid adduction (stitches to move the vocal cord toward the middle of the airway)\nInjections of collagen, Gelfoam, or another substance\nThyroplasty\nIf both the left and right nerves are damaged, a hole may need to be cut into the windpipe (tracheotomy) right away to allow breathing. This is followed by another surgery at a later date.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook depends on the cause of the injury. In some cases, the nerve rapidly returns to normal."}
