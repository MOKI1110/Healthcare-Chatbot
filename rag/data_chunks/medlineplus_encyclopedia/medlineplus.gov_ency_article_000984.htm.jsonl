It can be a life-threatening medical condition.\nCauses\nRetropharyngeal abscess most often affects children under age 5, but it can occur at any age.\nInfected material (pus) builds up in the space around the tissues at the back of the throat. This can occur during or very soon after a throat infection.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nBreathing difficulty\nDifficulty swallowing\nDrooling\nHigh fever\nHigh-pitched sound when inhaling (\nstridor\n)\nMuscles between the ribs pull in when breathing (\nintercostal retractions\n)\nSevere throat pain\nDifficulty turning the head\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and look inside the throat. The provider may gently rub the back of the throat with a cotton swab. This is to take a sample of tissue to check it more closely."}

Corticosteroids are sometimes given to reduce airway swelling.

This condition can lead to blockage of the airway. This is a life-threatening medical emergency."}
