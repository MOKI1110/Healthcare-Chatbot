Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSodium urine test\nSodium urine test\nThe sodium urine test measures the amount of sodium the urine.\nSodium can also be measured in a\nblood sample\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nAfter you provide a urine sample, it is tested in the lab. If needed, the health care provider may ask you to\ncollect your urine at home over 24 hours\n. Your provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly so that the results are accurate.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider will ask you to temporarily stop taking any medicines that may affect the test result. Tell your provider about all the medicines you take, including:\nCorticosteroids\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nProstaglandins (used to treat conditions such as glaucoma or stomach ulcers)\nWater pills (diuretics)\nDO NOT stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination. There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is often used to help determine the cause of an abnormal sodium blood level."}

There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is often used to help determine the cause of an abnormal sodium blood level. It also checks whether your kidneys are removing sodium from the body. It may be used to diagnose or monitor many types of kidney diseases.\nNormal Results\nFor adults, normal urine sodium values are generally 20 mEq/L in a random urine sample and 40 to 220 mEq per day. Your result depends on how much fluid and sodium or salt you take in.\nThe examples above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test result.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA higher than normal urine sodium level may be due to:\nCertain medicines, such as water pills (diuretics)\nLow function of the\nadrenal glands\nInflammation of the kidney that results in salt loss (salt-losing nephropathy)\nToo much salt in the diet\nA lower than normal urine sodium level may be a sign of:\nAdrenal glands releasing too much aldosterone (\nhyperaldosteronism\n)\nNot enough fluid in the body (dehydration)\nDiarrhea and fluid loss\nHeart failure\nKidney problems, such as long-term (chronic) kidney disease or\nkidney failure\nScarring of the liver (\ncirrhosis\n)\nRisks\nThere are no risks with this test.\nAlternative Names\nUrinary 24 hours sodium; Urine Na+\nImages\nFemale urinary tract\nMale urinary tract\nReferences\nKamel KS, Halperin ML.
