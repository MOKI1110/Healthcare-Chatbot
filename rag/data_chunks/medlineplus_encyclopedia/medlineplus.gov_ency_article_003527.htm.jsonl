There it is examined for histoplasma antibodies using a laboratory method called\ncomplement\nfixation. This technique checks if your body has produced substances called\nantibodies\nto a specific foreign substance (\nantigen\n), in this case\nH capsulatum\n.\nAntibodies are specialized proteins that defend your body against bacteria, viruses, and fungi. If the antibodies are present, they stick, or \"fix\" themselves, to the antigen. This is why the test is called \"fixation.\"\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no special preparation for the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is done to detect histoplasmosis infection.\nNormal Results\nThe absence of antibodies (negative test) is normal.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may mean you have an active histoplasmosis infection or have had an infection in the past.\nDuring the early stage of an illness, few antibodies may be detected. Antibody production increases during the course of an infection. For this reason, this test may be repeated several weeks after the first test.\nPeople who have been exposed to\nH capsulatum\nin the past may have antibodies to it, often at low levels. But they may not have shown signs of illness.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other."}
