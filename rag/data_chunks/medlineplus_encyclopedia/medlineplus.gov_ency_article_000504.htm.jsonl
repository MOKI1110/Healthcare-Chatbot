It can also cause hearing loss and eye problems.\nCauses\nAlport syndrome is an inherited form of kidney inflammation (nephritis). It is caused by a defect (mutation) in a gene for a protein in the connective tissue, called collagen.\nThe disorder is rare. There are three genetic types:\nX-linked Alport syndrome (XLAS) -- This is the most common type. The disease is more severe in males than in females.\nAutosomal recessive Alport syndrome (ARAS) -- Males and females have equally severe disease.\nAutosomal dominant Alport syndrome (ADAS) -- This is the rarest type. Males and females have equally severe disease.\nWith all types of Alport syndrome, the kidneys are affected. The tiny blood vessels in the glomeruli of the kidneys are damaged. The glomeruli filter blood to make urine and remove waste products from the blood.\nAt first, there are no symptoms."}

The tiny blood vessels in the glomeruli of the kidneys are damaged. The glomeruli filter blood to make urine and remove waste products from the blood.\nAt first, there are no symptoms. Over time, as the glomeruli are more and more damaged, kidney function is lost and waste products and fluids build up in the body. The condition can progress to end-stage renal disease (\nESRD\n) at an early age, between adolescence and age 40. At this point,\ndialysis\nor a\nkidney transplant\nis needed.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom of Alport syndrome is blood in the urine that is often not visible and only detected under a microscope. This occurs from a young age. As the disease progresses, other symptoms may appear.\nKIDNEYS\nOther symptoms of kidney problems include:\nAbnormal urine color\nBlood in the urine that is visible during a cold or flu or exercise\nFlank pain\nHigh blood pressure\nSwelling throughout the body\n(edema)\nFatigue\nPoor appetite\nExcessive thirst\nEARS\nOver time, Alport syndrome also leads to hearing loss in both ears. By the early teens, it is common in males with XLAS, though in females, hearing loss is not as common and happens when they're adults."}

By the early teens, it is common in males with XLAS, though in females, hearing loss is not as common and happens when they're adults. With ARAS, boys and girls have hearing loss during childhood. With ADAS, it occurs later in life.\nHearing loss usually occurs before kidney failure.\nEYES\nAlport syndrome also leads to eye problems in those with XLAS and ARAS, including:\nAbnormal shape of the lens (anterior lenticonus), which can lead to a slow decline in vision as well as\ncataracts\n.\nCorneal erosion in which there is damage to the outer layer of the covering of the eyeball, leading to pain, itching, redness of the eye, or blurred vision.\nAbnormal coloring of the\nretina\n, a condition called dot-and-fleck retinopathy. It doesn't cause vision problems, but can help diagnose Alport syndrome.\nMacular hole in which there is thinning or a break in the macula. The macula is a part of the retina that makes central vision sharper and more detailed."}

Women with XLAS may or may not have kidney problems, but the risk increases with age.\nBoth males and females with ARAS will develop kidney failure by early adulthood.\nADAS progresses slowly in both males and females, and kidney failure may not occur until later in life.\nAs kidneys fail, dialysis or a kidney transplant will be needed. Kidney transplant is often very successful in people with Alport syndrome.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider for an appointment if:\nYou have symptoms of Alport syndrome.\nYou have a family history of Alport syndrome and you are planning to get pregnant.\nYour urine output decreases or stops or you see blood in your urine (this may be a symptom of chronic kidney disease).\nPrevention\nAwareness of risk factors, such as a family history of the disorder, may allow the condition to be detected early.\nAlternative Names\nHereditary nephritis; Hematuria - nephropathy - deafness; Hemorrhagic familial nephritis; Hereditary deafness and nephrop"}
