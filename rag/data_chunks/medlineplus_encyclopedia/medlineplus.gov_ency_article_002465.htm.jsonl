Eggs and dairy foods have the most B12, so people who follow a vegan diet may have a hard time getting enough. You can get B12 from these foods:\nEggs\nMilk, yogurt, low-fat cheese, cottage cheese, and other dairy products\nFoods that have B12 added to them (fortified), such as cereal and soy products\nNutritional yeast\nSeafood such as clams, salmon, and tuna (this only applies to those who follow a pescetarian or semi-vegetarian diet)\nVitamin D\n: You need this vitamin for bone health. You can get vitamin D from sun exposure. But you should limit sun exposure due to skin cancer concerns.

You can get zinc from these foods:\nBeans and legumes, such as chickpeas, kidney beans, and baked beans\nNuts and seeds, such as almonds, peanuts, and cashews\nSeafood, such as oysters, crab, and lobster (this only applies to those who follow a pescetarian or semi-vegetarian diet)\nYogurt and cheese\nFoods fortified with zinc, such as milk and cereals\nIron\n: You need iron for your red blood cells.

Dairy products have the highest amount of calcium. If you do not eat dairy, it can be hard to get enough. Oxalates, a substance found in plant foods inhibits calcium absorption.
