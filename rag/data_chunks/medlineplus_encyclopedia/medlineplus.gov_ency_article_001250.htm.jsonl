Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTakayasu arteritis\nTakayasu arteritis\nTakayasu arteritis is an inflammation of large arteries such as the aorta and\nits major branches\n. The aorta is the artery that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body.\nCauses\nThe cause of Takayasu arteritis is not known. The disease occurs mainly in children and women between the ages of 20 to 40. It is more common in people of East Asian, Indian or Mexican descent. However, it is now being seen more often in other parts of the world. Several genes that increase the chance of having this problem were recently found.\nTakayasu arteritis appears to be an autoimmune condition. This means the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in the blood vessel wall."}

This means the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue in the blood vessel wall. The condition may also involve other organ systems.\nThis condition has many features that are similar to giant cell arteritis or\ntemporal arteritis\nin older people.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nArm weakness or pain with use\nChest pain\nDizziness\nFatigue\nFever\nLightheadedness\nMuscle or joint pain\nSkin rash\nNight sweats\nVision changes\nWeight loss\nDecreased radial pulses (at the wrist)\nDifference in blood pressure between the two arms\nHigh blood pressure (\nhypertension\n)\nThere may also be signs of inflammation (\npericarditis\nor\npleuritis\n).\nExams and Tests\nThere is no blood test available to make a definite diagnosis."}

However, people who have the right treatment can improve. It is important to identify the condition early. The disease tends to be chronic, requiring long-term use of anti-inflammatory medicines.\nMEDICINES\nMost people are first treated with high doses of corticosteroids such as prednisone."}

The disease tends to be chronic, requiring long-term use of anti-inflammatory medicines.\nMEDICINES\nMost people are first treated with high doses of corticosteroids such as prednisone. As the disease is controlled the dose of prednisone is decreased.\nIn almost all cases, immunosuppressive medicines are added to reduce the need for long-term use of prednisone and yet maintain control of the disease.\nConventional immunosuppressive medicines such as methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate, cyclophosphamide, or leflunomide are often added.\nBiologic medicines may also be effective. These include TNF inhibitors such as infliximab, etanercept, and tocilizumab.\nSURGERY\nSurgery or angioplasty may be used to open up narrowed arteries\nto supply blood or open up the constriction.\nAortic valve replacement may be needed in some cases.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThis disease can be fatal without treatment.
