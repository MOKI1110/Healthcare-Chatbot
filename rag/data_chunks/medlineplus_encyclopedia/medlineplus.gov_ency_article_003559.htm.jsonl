Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nLAP is a type of protein called an enzyme. This enzyme is normally found in cells of the liver, bile, blood, urine and the placenta.\nYour health care provider may order this test to check if your liver is damaged.

Too much LAP is released into your blood when you have a liver tumor or damage to your liver cells.\nThis test is not done very often. Other tests, such as\ngamma-glutamyl transferase\n, are as accurate and easier to get.\nNormal Results\nNormal range is:\nMale: 80 to 200 U/mL\nFemale: 75 to 185 U/mL\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurement methods. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result may be a sign of:\nBile flow from the liver is blocked (\ncholestasis\n)\nScarring of the liver and poor liver function (\ncirrhosis\n)\nHeart Failure\nInflamed liver (\nhepatitis\n)\nLiver cancer or tumor\nReduced blood flow to the liver (liver ischemia)\nDeath of liver tissue (\nliver necrosis\n)\nUse of medicines that are toxic to the liver\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.
