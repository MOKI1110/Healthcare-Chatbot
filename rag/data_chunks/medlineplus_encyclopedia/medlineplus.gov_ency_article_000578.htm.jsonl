This causes red blood cells to break down earlier than normal, a process called hemolysis.\nCauses\nAnemia is a condition in which the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells. Red blood cells provide oxygen to body tissues.\nNormally, red blood cells last for about 120 days in the body. In people with hemolytic anemia, red blood cells in the blood are destroyed earlier than normal.\nIn some cases, a medicine can cause the immune system to mistake your own red blood cells for foreign substances. The body responds by making antibodies to attack the body's own red blood cells."}

Special blood transfusions may be needed to treat severe symptoms."}
