If this happens, surgery may be needed to remove the battery and reverse the blockage.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost swallowed batteries pass through the stomach and intestines without causing any serious damage.\nHow well someone does depends on the type of battery they swallowed and how quickly they receive treatment. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.\nBurns in the esophagus and stomach may result in ulcers and fluid leakage. This can lead to serious infection and possibly surgery. Complications become more likely the longer the battery is in contact with internal structures.\nAlternative Names\nSwallowing batteries\nReferences\nGoodloe JM, Soulek J. Foreign bodies.
