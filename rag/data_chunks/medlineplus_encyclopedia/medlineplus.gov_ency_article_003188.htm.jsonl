This type of atrophy can often be reversed with exercise and better nutrition. People who are most affected are those who:\nHave seated jobs, health problems that limit movement, or decreased activity levels\nAre bedridden\nCannot move their limbs because of stroke or other brain disease\nAre in a place that lacks gravity, such as during space flights\nPathologic atrophy is seen with aging, starvation, and diseases such as Cushing disease (because of taking too much medicines called corticosteroids or having overactive adrenal glands).\nNeurogenic atrophy is the most severe type of muscle atrophy. It can be from an injury to, or disease of a nerve that connects to the muscle."}

It can be from an injury to, or disease of a nerve that connects to the muscle. This type of muscle atrophy tends to occur more suddenly than physiologic atrophy.\nExamples of diseases affecting the nerves that control muscles:\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis\n(ALS, or Lou Gehrig disease)\nDamage to a single nerve, such as carpal tunnel syndrome\nGuillain-BarrÃ© syndrome\nNerve damage caused by injury, diabetes, toxins, or alcohol\nPolio (\npoliomyelitis\n)\nSpinal cord injury\nAlthough people can adapt to muscle atrophy, even minor muscle atrophy causes some loss of movement or strength.\nOther causes of muscle atrophy may include:\nBurns\nLong-term corticosteroid therapy\nMalnutrition\nMuscular dystrophy\nand other diseases of the muscle\nOsteoarthritis\nRheumatoid arthritis\nHome Care\nAn exercise program may help treat muscle atrophy. Exercises may include ones done in a swimming pool to reduce the muscle workload, and other types of rehabilitation."}

Your health care provider can tell you more about this.\nPeople who cannot actively move one or more joints can do exercises using braces or\nsplints\n.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider for an appointment if you have unexplained or long-term muscle loss. You can often see this when you compare one hand, arm, or leg to the other.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nYour provider will perform a\nphysical examination\nand ask about your medical history and symptoms, including:\nWhen did the muscle atrophy begin?\nIs it getting worse?\nWhat other symptoms do you have?\nThe provider will look at your arms and legs and measure muscle size."}
