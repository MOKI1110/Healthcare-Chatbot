Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBreast infection\nBreast infection\nA breast infection is an infection in the tissue of the breast.\nCauses\nBreast infections are usually caused by common bacteria (\nStaphylococcus aureus\n) found on normal skin. The bacteria enter through a break or crack in the skin, usually on the nipple.\nThe infection takes place in the fatty tissue of the breast and causes\nswelling\n. This swelling pushes on the milk ducts. The result is pain and lumps in the infected breast.\nBreast infections usually occur in women who are breastfeeding."}

Sometimes an ultrasound is done to check for an abscess.\nFor infections that keep returning, fluid from the nipple may be cultured."}

In women who are not breastfeeding, tests done may include:\nBreast biopsy\nBreast MRI\nBreast ultrasound\nMammogram\nTreatment\nSelf-care may include applying moist heat to the infected breast tissue for 15 to 20 minutes four times a day. You may also need to take pain relievers.\nAntibiotics are very effective in treating a breast infection. If you take antibiotics, you must continue to breastfeed or pump to relieve breast swelling from milk production.\nIf there is an abscess that does not go away, needle aspiration under ultrasound guidance is done, along with antibiotics. If this method fails to cure the abscess, then incision and drainage is the treatment of choice.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe condition usually clears quickly with antibiotic therapy.\nPossible Complications\nIn severe infections, an\nabscess\nmay develop. Abscesses need to be drained, either as an office procedure or with surgery. A wound dressing would be needed to help with healing after the procedure."}
