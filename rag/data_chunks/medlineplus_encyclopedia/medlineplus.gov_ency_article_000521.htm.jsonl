The infection can occur at different points in the urinary tract, including the:\nBladder -- An infection in the bladder is also called\ncystitis\nor a bladder infection.\nKidneys -- An infection of one or both kidneys is called\npyelonephritis\nor a kidney infection.\nUreters -- The tubes that take urine from each kidney to the bladder are rarely the only site of infection.\nUrethra -- An infection of the tube that empties urine from the bladder to the outside is called\nurethritis\n.\nCauses\nMost UTIs are caused by bacteria that enter the urethra and then the bladder. The infection most commonly develops in the bladder, but can spread to the kidneys. Most of the time, your body can get rid of these bacteria. However, certain conditions increase the risk for having UTIs.\nWomen tend to get them more often because their urethra is shorter and closer to the anus than in men."}

However, certain conditions increase the risk for having UTIs.\nWomen tend to get them more often because their urethra is shorter and closer to the anus than in men. Because of this, women are more likely to get an infection after sexual activity or when using a diaphragm for birth control. Menopause also increases the risk for a UTI.\nThe following also increase your chances of developing a UTI:\nDiabetes\nAdvanced age\nConditions that affect personal care habits (such as\nAlzheimer disease\nand\ndelirium\n)\nProblems emptying the bladder completely\nHaving a urinary catheter\nBowel incontinence\nEnlarged prostate\n,\nnarrowed urethra\n, or anything that blocks the flow of urine\nKidney stones\nStaying still (immobile) for a long period of time (for example, while you are recovering from a hip fracture)\nPregnancy\nSurgery or other procedure involving the urinary tract\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms of a bladder infection include:\nCloudy\nor bloody urine, which may have a foul or strong odor\nLow grade fever in some people\nPain or burning with\nurination\nPressure or cramping in the lower abdomen or back\nStrong need to urinate often, even right after the bladder has been emptied"}
