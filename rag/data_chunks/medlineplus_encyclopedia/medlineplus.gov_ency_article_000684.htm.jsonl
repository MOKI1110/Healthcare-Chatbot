Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nGuillain-Barre syndrome\nGuillain-Barre syndrome\nGuillain-BarrÃ© syndrome (GBS) is a serious health problem that occurs when the body's defense (immune) system mistakenly attacks part of the peripheral nervous system. This leads to nerve inflammation that causes muscle weakness or paralysis and other symptoms.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of GBS is unknown. It is thought that GBS is an\nautoimmune disorder\n. With an autoimmune disorder, the body's immune system attacks itself by mistake. The incidence of GBS increases with aging, but can occur at any age. People older than 50 years are at the greatest risk.\nGBS may occur following infections from viruses or bacteria, such as:\nInfluenza\nSome gastrointestinal illnesses, especially  Campylobacter jejunii infection\nMycoplasma pneumonia\nHIV, the virus that causes HIV/AIDS (very rare)\nHerpes simplex\nMononucleosis\nCOVID-19\nZika virus\nGBS may also occur with other medical conditions, such as:\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\nHodgkin disease\nAfter surgery\nGBS damages parts of nerves."}

This nerve damage causes tingling, muscle weakness, loss of balance, and paralysis. GBS most often affects the nerve covering (\nmyelin\nsheath). This damage is called demyelination. It causes nerve signals to move more slowly. Damage to other parts of the nerve can cause the nerve to stop working.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of GBS can get worse quickly. It may take only a few hours for the most severe symptoms to appear. But weakness that increases over several days is also common.\nMuscle weakness or loss of muscle function (paralysis) affects both sides of the body. In most cases, the muscle weakness starts in the legs and spreads to the arms."}

This is called ascending paralysis.\nIf the inflammation affects the nerves of the chest and diaphragm (the large muscle under your lungs that helps you breathe) and those muscles are weak, you may need\nbreathing assistance\n.\nOther typical signs and symptoms of GBS include:\nLoss of tendon reflexes in the arms and legs\nTingling or numbness\n(mild loss of sensation)\nMuscle tenderness or pain (may be a cramp-like pain)\nUncoordinated movement\n(cannot walk without help)\nLow blood pressure or poor blood pressure control\nAbnormal heart rate\nOther symptoms may include:\nBlurred vision\nand double vision\nClumsiness and falling\nDifficulty moving face muscles\nFeeling your heart beat (palpitations)\nEmergency symptoms (seek medical help right away):\nCannot take a deep breath\nDifficulty breathing\nDifficulty swallowing or choking on food or liquids\nDrooling\nFainting\nFeeling light headed when standing\nExams and Tests\nA history of increasing muscle weakness and paralysis over a short period of time may be"}

There may also be problems with blood pressure and heart rate. These are functions that are controlled automatically by the nervous system. The exam may also show that reflexes such as the ankle or knee jerk are decreased or missing.\nThere may be signs of decreased breathing caused by paralysis of the breathing muscles.\nThe following tests may be done:\nCerebrospinal fluid sample\n(spinal tap)\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG) to check the electrical activity in the heart\nElectromyography\n(EMG) to test the electrical activity in muscles\nNerve conduction velocity\ntest to measure how fast electrical signals move through a nerve\nPulmonary function tests\nto measure breathing capacity and how well the lungs are functioning\nTreatment\nWhile there is no cure for GBS, most people will notice improvement within days to weeks."}

Treatment is aimed at reducing symptoms, treating complications, and speeding up recovery.\nIn the early stages of the illness, a treatment called apheresis or plasmapheresis may be given. It involves removing the proteins, called\nantibodies\n, which attack the nerve cells. Another treatment is intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Both treatments lead to faster improvement, and both are equally effective. But there is no advantage to using both treatments at the same time.
