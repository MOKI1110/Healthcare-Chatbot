As little as 2 tablespoons (14.8 milliliters) of methanol can kill a child, while 2 to 8 ounces (59 to 236 mL) can be deadly for adults.\nHow well a person does depends on the amount of poison swallowed and how quickly treatment was received. The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.\nSwallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue necrosis, resulting in infection, shock and death, even several months after the substance was first swallowed. Scars may form in these tissues leading to long-term difficulties with breathing, swallowing, and digestion.\nReferences\nAronson JK. Aliphatic alcohols.
