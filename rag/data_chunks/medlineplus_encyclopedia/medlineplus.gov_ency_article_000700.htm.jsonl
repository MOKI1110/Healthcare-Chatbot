Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNeuropathy secondary to drugs\nNeuropathy secondary to drugs\nNeuropathy is injury to one or more peripheral nerves. These are nerves that are not in the brain or spinal cord. Neuropathy secondary to medicines causes a\nloss of sensation\nor movement in a part of the body due to nerve damage from taking a certain medicine, combination of medicines, or illicit (street) drugs.\nCauses\nThe damage is caused by the toxic effect of certain medicines or illicit (street) drugs on the peripheral nerves. There may be damage to the axon part of the nerve cell, which interferes with nerve signals. Or, the damage may involve the myelin sheath, which insulates the axons and increases the speed of transmission of signals through the axon.\nMost commonly, many nerves are involved (polyneuropathy). This usually causes sensation changes that begin in the outside parts of the body (\ndistal\n) and move toward the center of the body (\nproximal\n). There may also be changes in movement, such as weakness."}

If you have lost sensation, you may need to take safety measures to avoid injury.\nAsk your provider if there are exercises that can help relieve your symptoms.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMany people can partially or fully return to their normal function."}
