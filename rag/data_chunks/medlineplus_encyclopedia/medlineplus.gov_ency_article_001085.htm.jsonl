Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nParaquat poisoning\nParaquat poisoning\nParaquat (dipyridylium) is a highly toxic weed killer (herbicide). In the past, the United States encouraged Mexico to use it to destroy marijuana plants. Later, research showed this herbicide was dangerous to workers who applied it to the plants.\nThis article discusses the health problems that can occur from swallowing or breathing in paraquat.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\nCauses\nIn the United States, paraquat is classified as \"restricted commercial use.\" People must obtain a license to use the product.\nBreathing in paraquat may cause lung damage and can lead to a disease called paraquat lung. Paraquat causes damage to the body when it touches the lining of the mouth, stomach, or intestines."}

Paraquat causes damage to the body when it touches the lining of the mouth, stomach, or intestines. You can get sick if paraquat touches a cut on your skin. Paraquat may also damage the kidneys, liver, and esophagus (the tube that food goes down from your mouth to your stomach).\nIf paraquat is swallowed, death can quickly occur. Death may occur from a hole in the esophagus, or from severe inflammation of the area that surrounds the major blood vessels and airways in the middle of the chest (mediastinum).\nLong-term exposure to paraquat may cause scarring of the lungs called pulmonary fibrosis. This makes it hard to breathe.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of paraquat poisoning include:\nBurns and pain in the throat\nChoking\nComa (lack of responsiveness)\nDifficulty breathing\nNosebleed\nSeizures\nShock\n(extremely low blood pressure)\nShortness of breath\nStomach pain\nVomiting, including vomiting blood\nExams and Tests\nYou will be asked if you have been exposed to paraquat."}

Tests that may be done include:\nBlood and urine tests\nChest x-ray\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG)\nBronchoscopy\n(tube through the mouth and throat ) to view any lung damage\nEndoscopy\n(tube through the mouth and throat ) to look for any damage to the esophagus and stomach\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for paraquat poisoning. The goal is to relieve symptoms and treat complications. If you are exposed, first aid measures include:\nRemoving all contaminated clothing.\nIf the chemical touched your skin, wash the area with soap and water for 15 minutes."}

Do not scrub hard, because that could break your skin and let more of the paraquat absorb into your body.\nIf the paraquat got into your eyes, flush them with water for 15 minutes.\nIf you have swallowed paraquat, get treated with activated charcoal as quickly as possible in order to decrease the amount absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract. Sicker people may need a procedure called hemoperfusion, which filters the blood through charcoal to try to remove paraquat from the lungs.\nAt the hospital, you will likely receive:\nActivated charcoal by mouth or a tube through the nose into the stomach if the person presents for help within an hour of ingesting the poison\nBreathing support, including oxygen, tube through the mouth into the lungs, and breathing machine (ventilator)\nFluids through a vein (IV)\nMedicine to treat symptoms\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome depends on how severe the exposure is.
