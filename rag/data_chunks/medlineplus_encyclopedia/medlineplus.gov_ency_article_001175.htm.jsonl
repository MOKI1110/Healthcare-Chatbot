Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSheehan syndrome\nSheehan syndrome\nSheehan syndrome is a condition that can occur in a woman who bleeds severely during childbirth. Sheehan syndrome is a type of\nhypopituitarism\n.\nCauses\nSevere bleeding during childbirth can cause tissue in the pituitary gland to die. This prevents the pituitary gland from functioning normally.\nThe pituitary gland is at the base of the brain. It makes hormones that stimulate growth, production of breast milk, reproductive functions, the thyroid, and the adrenal glands. A lack of these hormones can lead to a variety of symptoms. Conditions that increase the risk of bleeding during childbirth and Sheehan syndrome include multiple pregnancy (twins or triplets) and problems with the placenta."}

Conditions that increase the risk of bleeding during childbirth and Sheehan syndrome include multiple pregnancy (twins or triplets) and problems with the placenta. The placenta is the organ that develops during pregnancy to feed the fetus.\nThe condition is rare today due to advances in obstetric care.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of Sheehan syndrome may include:\nInability to breastfeed (breast milk never \"comes in\")\nFatigue\nLack of menstrual bleeding\nLoss of pubic and armpit (axillary) hair\nLow blood pressure\nNote: Other than not being able to breastfeed, symptoms may not develop for several years after the delivery.\nExams and Tests\nTests done may include:\nBlood tests to measure\nhormone levels\nMRI of the head\nto check for other pituitary problems, such as a tumor\nTreatment\nTreatment involves estrogen and progesterone hormone replacement therapy. These hormones must be taken at least until the normal age of menopause. Thyroid and adrenal hormones must also be taken."}

Otherwise, Sheehan syndrome is not preventable.\nAlternative Names\nPostpartum hypopituitarism; Postpartum pituitary insufficiency; Hypopituitarism syndrome; Sheehan's syndrome\nImages\nEndocrine glands\nReferences\nErin K, Aliya K.
