They can also appear without cause.\nCauses\nWhen you have an allergic reaction to a substance, your body releases histamine and other chemicals into the blood. This causes itching, swelling, and other symptoms. Hives are a common reaction. People with other allergies, such as hay fever, often get hives.\nAngioedema is swelling of the deeper tissue that sometimes occurs with hives. Like hives,\nangioedema\ncan occur on any part of the body."}

When it occurs around the mouth or throat, the symptoms can be severe, including airway blockage.\nMany substances can trigger hives, including:\nAnimal dander (especially cats)\nInsect bites\nMedicines\nPollen\nShellfish, fish, nuts, eggs, milk, and other foods\nHives may also develop as a result of:\nEmotional stress\nExtreme cold or sun exposure\nExcessive perspiration\nIllness, including\nlupus\n, other\nautoimmune diseases\n, and\nleukemia\nInfections such as\nmononucleosis\nExercise\nExposure to water\nOften, the cause of hives is not known.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of hives may include any of the following:\nItching.\nSwelling of the surface of the skin into red- or skin-colored welts (called wheals) with clearly defined edges.\nWheals may get bigger, spread, and join together to form larger areas of flat, raised skin.\nWheals often change shape, disappear, and reappear within minutes or hours. It is unusual for a wheal to last more than 48 hours.\nDermatographism, or skin writing, is a type of hives."}

It is unusual for a wheal to last more than 48 hours.\nDermatographism, or skin writing, is a type of hives. It is caused by pressure on the skin and results in immediate hives in the area that has been pressed on or scratched.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can tell if you have hives by looking at your skin.\nIf you have a history of an allergy causing hives, for example, to strawberries, the diagnosis is even clearer.\nSometimes, a\nskin biopsy\nor blood tests are done to confirm that you had an allergic reaction, and to test for the substance that caused the allergic response. However, specific allergy testing is not useful in most cases of hives.\nTreatment\nTreatment may not be needed if the hives are mild. They may disappear on their own. To reduce itching and swelling:\nDo not take hot baths or showers.\nDo not wear tight-fitting clothing, which can irritate the area.\nYour provider may suggest that you take an antihistamine such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or cetirizine (Zyrtec)."}
