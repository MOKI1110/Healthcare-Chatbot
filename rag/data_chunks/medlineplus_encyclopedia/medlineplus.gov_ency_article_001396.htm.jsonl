It is caused when fluid fills a space, or sinus, left in the neck when a baby develops in the womb. After the baby is born, it appears as a lump in the neck or just below the jawbone.\nCauses\nBranchial cleft cysts form during development of the\nembryo\n. They occur when tissues in the neck area (branchial cleft) fail to develop normally.\nThe birth defect may appear as open spaces called cleft sinuses, which may develop on one or both sides of the neck. A branchial cleft cyst may form due to fluid in a sinus. The cyst or sinus can become infected.\nSymptoms\nThe cysts are most often seen in children."}
