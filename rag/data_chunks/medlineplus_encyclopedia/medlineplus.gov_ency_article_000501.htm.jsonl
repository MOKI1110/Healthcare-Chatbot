They include:\nAcute tubular necrosis\n(ATN; damage to the tubule cells of the kidneys)\nAutoimmune kidney disease\nBlood clot in the blood vessels to the kidneys\nDecreased blood flow from cholesterol (cholesterol emboli)\nDecreased blood flow due to very low blood pressure, which can result from\nburns\n,\ndehydration\n, hemorrhage, injury,\nseptic shock\n, serious illness, or surgery\nDisorders that cause clotting within the kidney blood vessels\nInfections that directly injure the kidney, such as acute\npyelonephritis\nor\nsepticemia\nPregnancy complications, including\nplacental abruption\nor\nplacenta previa\nUrinary tract blockage\nIllicit drugs such as cocaine and heroin\nMedicines including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), certain antibiotics and blood pressure medicines, intravenous contrast (dye), some ca"}

Usually, you will  have to stay overnight in the hospital for treatment.\nThe amount of liquid you drink will be limited to the amount of urine you can produce. You will be told what you may and may not eat to reduce the buildup of toxins that the kidneys would normally remove. Your diet may need to be high in\ncarbohydrates\nand low in\nprotein\n, salt, and potassium.\nYou may need antibiotics to treat or prevent infection. Water pills (diuretics) may be used to help remove fluid from your body.\nMedicines will be given through a vein to help control your blood potassium level.\nYou may need\ndialysis\n."}

This is a treatment that does what healthy kidneys normally do -- rid the body of harmful wastes, extra salt, and water. Dialysis can save your life if your potassium levels are dangerously high. Dialysis will also be used if:\nYour mental status changes\nYou develop\npericarditis\nYou retain too much fluid\nYou cannot remove nitrogen waste products from your body\nDialysis will most often be short term. In some cases, the kidney damage is so great that dialysis is needed permanently.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your urine output slows or stops or you have other symptoms of acute kidney failure.\nPrevention\nTo prevent acute kidney failure:\nHealth problems such as high blood pressure or diabetes should be well controlled.\nAvoid drugs and medicines that can cause kidney injury.\nAlternative Names\nKidney failure; Renal failure; Renal failure - acute; ARF; Kidney injury - acute\nImages\nKidney anatomy\nReferences\nAgarwal A, Barasch J.
