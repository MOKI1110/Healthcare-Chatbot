It is caused by bacteria or other germs.\nCauses\nA bone infection is most often caused by bacteria. But it can also be caused by fungi or other germs. When a person has osteomyelitis:\nBacteria or other germs may spread to a bone from infected skin, muscles, or tendons next to the bone. This may occur under a skin sore.\nThe infection can start in another part of the body and spread to the bone through the blood.\nThe infection can also start after bone surgery. This is more likely if the surgery is done after an injury or if metal rods or plates are placed in the bone.\nIn children, the\nlong bones\nof the arms or legs are most often involved. In adults, the feet, spine bones (vertebrae), and hips (pelvis) are most commonly affected.\nRisk factors are:\nDiabetes\nHemodialysis\nPoor blood supply\nRecent injury\nUse of injected illicit drugs\nSurgery involving bones\nWeakened immune system\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of osteomyelitis are often not specific and vary with age."}

The exam may show bone tenderness and possible swelling and redness in the area around the bone.\nTests may include:\nBlood culture\nBone biopsy\n(the sample is cultured and examined under a microscope)\nBone scan\nBone x-ray\nComplete blood count\n(CBC) with\ndifferential\nC-reactive protein\n(CRP)\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate\n(ESR)\nMRI\nof the bone\nNeedle\naspiration\nof the area of the affected bones\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to get rid of the infection and reduce damage to the bone and surrounding tissues.\nAntibiotics are given to destroy the bacteria causing the infection:\nYou may receive more than one antibiotic at a time.\nAntibiotics are taken for at least 4 to 6 weeks, often"}

This promotes resolution of the infection.\nInfection that occurs after joint replacement may require surgery. This is done to remove the replaced joint and infected tissue in the area. A new\nprosthesis\nmay be implanted in the same operation. More often, providers wait until the antibiotic course is finished and the infection has gone away.\nIf you have\ndiabetes\n, it will need to be well controlled."}

If there are\nproblems with blood supply\nto the infected area, such as the foot, surgery may be needed to improve blood flow in order to get rid of the infection.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWith treatment, the outcome for acute osteomyelitis is often good.\nThe outlook is worse for those with long-term (\nchronic\n) osteomyelitis. Symptoms may come and go for years, even with surgery. Amputation may be needed, especially in people with diabetes or poor blood circulation.\nThe outlook for people with an infection of a prosthesis depends partly on:\nThe person's health\nThe type of infection\nWhether the infected prosthesis can be safely removed\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you:\nDevelop symptoms of osteomyelitis\nHave osteomyelitis that continues even with treatment\nAlternative Names\nBone infection\nPatient Instructions\nOsteomyelitis - discharge\nImages\nX-ray\nSkeleton\nOsteomyelitis\nBacteria\nReferences\nMatteson EL, Osmon DR.
