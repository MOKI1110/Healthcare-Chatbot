Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour health care provider may order a D-dimer test if you are showing symptoms of blood clots or abnormal bleeding, such as:\nSwelling, pain, warmth, and changes in skin color of your leg or arm\nSharp chest pain, trouble breathing, coughing up blood, or fast heartbeat\nBleeding gums, nausea and vomiting, seizures, severe stomach and muscle pain, and decreased urine\nYour provider may also use the D-dimer test to see if treatment for DIC is working.\nNormal Results\nA normal test is negative. This means that you probably do not have problems with blood clotting.\nIf you are getting the D-dimer test to see if treatment is working for DIC, a normal or decreasing level of D-dimer means the treatment is working.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA positive test means that you may be making blood clots. The test does not tell where the clots are or why you are making clots."}

The test does not tell where the clots are or why you are making clots. Your provider may order other tests to see where clots are located.\nA positive test may be caused by other factors, and you may not have any clots. D-dimer levels can be positive due to:\nBeing over 80 years old\nHeart disease\nHigh blood lipid or triglyceride levels\nLiver disease\nPregnancy\nRecent surgery or trauma\nThis makes the test mostly useful when it is negative or when many of the above causes can be ruled out.\nRisks\nVeins vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
