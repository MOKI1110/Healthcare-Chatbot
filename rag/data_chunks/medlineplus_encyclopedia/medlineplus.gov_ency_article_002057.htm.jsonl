It can also make them less likely to cry and resist the procedure. Research shows that lowering anxiety can decrease the sensation of pain people feel during uncomfortable procedures. Even so, being prepared may not change the fact that your child will feel some discomfort or pain.\nBefore the test, understand that your child will probably cry. Demonstrate in advance what will happen during the test to learn about your child's fears and concerns. Using a doll or other object to act out the test may reveal worries your child may not be able to talk about, and may reduce your child's anxiety.\nMost people are frightened of the unknown. It helps if your child knows what to expect."}

It helps if your child knows what to expect. If your child's fears are not realistic, explaining what will actually happen can help. If your child is worried about a part of the test, do not downplay this concern. Reassure your child that you will be there to help as much as you can.\nMake sure your child understands that the procedure is not a punishment. Preschool-age children may believe that the pain they feel is a punishment for something they did.\nThe most important way you can help your child is to prepare properly, and provide support and comfort around the time of the procedure. Ask if the hospital has a child life specialist who can help you before and after the procedure.\nPREPARING BEFORE THE PROCEDURE:\nKeep your explanations about the procedure to 10 or 15 minutes. Preschoolers are able to listen and comprehend for only a short time."}

Explain the test or procedure right before it takes place so that your child doesn't worry about it for days or weeks in advance.\nHere are some general guidelines for preparing your child for a test or procedure:\nExplain the procedure in language your child understands, using plain words and avoiding abstract terms.\nUse play preparation to demonstrate the procedure to your child and identify concerns (see the next section).\nMake sure your child understands the body part involved in the test, and that the procedure will be limited to that area.\nDescribe as best as you can how the test will feel.\nBe honest with your child about any discomfort or pain the test may cause.\nIf the procedure affects a part of the body that your child needs for a certain function (such as speaking, hearing, or urinating), explain what changes will occur afterwards.\nLet your child know it's OK to yell, cry, or express pain in another way using sounds or words.\nAsk if your child has questions about something you"}

You may want to take your child for ice cream or some other treat afterwards, but do not make the treat a condition of being good for the test.\nPractice deep breathing and other comforting activities with your child."}

Tailor this technique to your child. Most health care facilities for children use play to prepare children for procedures.\nMany young children have a favorite toy or other important object that can be a tool for this process. It may be less threatening for your child to express concerns through the toy or object instead of directly."}

It may be less threatening for your child to express concerns through the toy or object instead of directly. For example, a child who is about to have blood drawn may be better able to understand if you discuss how the doll might feel during the test.\nToys or dolls can help you explain the procedure to your preschooler. Once you are familiar with the procedure, briefly demonstrate on the toy what your child will experience. Using the toy, show your child:\nBandages\nHow injections are given\nHow IVs are inserted\nHow surgical cuts are made\nStethoscopes\nWhat positions your child will be in\nAfterward, allow your child to play with some of the items (except for needles and other sharp items). Watch your child for clues about concerns or fears.\nNo matter what test is performed, your child will probably cry. This is a normal response to a strange place, new people, and being separated from you.

Knowing this from the beginning may help relieve some of your anxiety about what to expect.\nWHY RESTRAINTS?\nYour child may be restrained by hand or with physical devices. Young children lack the physical control and ability to follow commands that older children and adults usually have. Most tests and procedures require limited or no movement to ensure their accuracy. For example, to get clear results with x-rays, there must not be any movement.\nRestraints may also be used during a procedure or other situation to ensure your child's safety. Restraints may be used to keep your child safe when staff have to leave the room for a short time during x-ray and nuclear studies. They may also be used when a puncture is done to get a blood sample or start an IV. If your child moves, the needle could cause an injury.\nYour child's provider will use every method to make sure your child is safe and comfortable."}

Depending on the procedure, medicines may be used to sedate your child.\nYour job as a parent is to comfort your child.\nDURING THE PROCEDURE:\nYour presence may help your child during the procedure, especially if the procedure allows you to maintain physical contact. If the procedure is performed at the hospital or at your provider's office, you may be able to be there. If you are not sure, ask if you can be there.\nIf you think you may become ill or anxious, consider keeping your distance, but stay where your child can see you. If you cannot be present, leave a familiar object with your child for comfort.\nAvoid showing your anxiety. This will only make your child feel more upset. Research suggests that children are more cooperative if their parents take measures (such as acupuncture) to reduce their own anxiety.\nIf you're feeling stressed and anxious, consider asking friends and family members for help."}
