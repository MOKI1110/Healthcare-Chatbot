Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nOsteitis fibrosa\nOsteitis fibrosa\nOsteitis fibrosa is a complication of\nhyperparathyroidism\n, a condition in which overactive parathyroid glands cause certain bones to become abnormally weak and deformed.\nCauses\nThe parathyroid glands are 4 tiny glands in the neck. These glands produce parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH helps regulate calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the blood and is important for healthy bones.\nToo much parathyroid hormone (hyperparathyroidism) can lead to increased bone breakdown, which can cause bones to become weaker and more fragile. Many people with hyperparathyroidism eventually develop\nosteoporosis\n. Not all bones respond to PTH in the same way. Some develop abnormal areas where the bone is very soft and has almost no calcium in it. This is osteitis fibrosa.\nIn rare cases,\nparathyroid cancer\ncauses osteitis fibrosa.\nOsteitis fibrosa is now very rare in people who have hyperparathyroidism and good access to medical care."}

This is osteitis fibrosa.\nIn rare cases,\nparathyroid cancer\ncauses osteitis fibrosa.\nOsteitis fibrosa is now very rare in people who have hyperparathyroidism and good access to medical care. It is more common in people who develop hyperparathyroidism at a young age, or have untreated hyperparathyroidism for a long time.\nSymptoms\nOsteitis fibrosa may cause bone pain or tenderness. There may be fractures (breaks) in the arms, legs, or spine, or other bone problems.\nHyperparathyroidism itself may cause any of the following:\nNausea\nConstipation\nFatigue\nFrequent urination\nWeakness\nExams and Tests\nBlood tests show a high level of calcium, parathyroid hormone, and alkaline phosphatase (a bone chemical). Phosphorus level in the blood may be low.\nX-rays may show thin bones, fractures, bowing, and\ncysts\n.\nTeeth x-rays\nmay also be abnormal.\nbone x-ray\nor bone density test may be done. People with hyperparathyroidism are more likely to have osteopenia (thin bones) or osteoporosis (very thin bones) than to have full-blown osteitis fibrosa.\nTreatment\nMost of the bone problems from osteitis fibrosa can be reversed with surgery to remove the abnormal parathyroid gland(s)."}
