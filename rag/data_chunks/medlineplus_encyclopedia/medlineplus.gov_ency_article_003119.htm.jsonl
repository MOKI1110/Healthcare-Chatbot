Most pregnant women have at least some nausea, and about one third have vomiting.\nMorning sickness most often begins during the first month of pregnancy and continues through the 14th to 16th week (3rd or 4th month). Some women have nausea and vomiting through their\nentire pregnancy\n.\nMorning sickness does not hurt the baby in any way unless you lose weight, such as with\nsevere vomiting\n. Mild weight loss during the first trimester is not uncommon when women have moderate symptoms, and is not harmful to the baby.\nThe amount of morning sickness during one pregnancy does not predict how you will feel in future pregnancies.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of morning sickness is unknown. It may be caused by hormone changes or lower blood sugar during early pregnancy. Emotional stress, fatigue, traveling, or some foods can make the problem worse."}

Nausea in pregnancy is more common and can be worse with twins or triplets.\nHome Care\nTry to keep a positive attitude. Remember that in most cases morning sickness stops after the first 3 or 4 months of pregnancy. To reduce nausea, try:\nA few soda crackers or dry toast when you first wake up, even before you get out of bed in the morning.\nA small snack at bedtime and when getting up to go to the bathroom at night.\nAvoid large meals; instead, snack as often as every 1 to 2 hours during the day and drink plenty of fluids.\nEat foods high in protein and complex carbohydrates, such as peanut butter on apple slices or celery; nuts; cheese; crackers; milk; cottage cheese; and yogurt; avoid foods high in fat and salt, but low in nutrition.\nGinger products (proven effective against morning sickness) such as ginger tea, ginger candy, and ginger soda.\nHere are some more tips:\nAcupressure wrist bands or acupuncture may help."}

You can find these bands in drug, health food, and travel and boating stores. If you are thinking about trying acupuncture, talk to your health care provider and look for an acupuncturist who is trained to work with pregnant women.\nAvoid smoking and secondhand smoke.\nAvoid taking medicines for morning sickness. If you do, ask a provider first.\nKeep air flowing through rooms to reduce odors.\nWhen you feel nauseated, bland foods like gelatin, broth, ginger ale, and saltine crackers can soothe your stomach.\nTake your prenatal vitamins at night. Increase vitamin B6 in your diet by eating whole grains, nuts, seeds, and peas and beans (legumes). Talk to your provider about possibly taking vitamin B6 supplements. Doxylamine is another medicine that is sometimes prescribed and is known to be safe.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nMorning sickness does not improve, despite trying home remedies.\nNausea and vomiting continue beyond your 4th month of pregnancy."}
