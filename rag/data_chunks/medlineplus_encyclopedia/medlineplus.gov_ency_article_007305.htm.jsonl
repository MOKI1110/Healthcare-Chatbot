Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nGlomerular filtration rate\nGlomerular filtration rate\nGlomerular filtration rate (GFR) is a test used to check how well the kidneys are working. Specifically, it estimates how much blood passes through the glomeruli each minute. Glomeruli are the tiny filters in the kidneys that filter waste from the blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nThe blood sample is sent to a lab. There, the creatinine level in the blood sample is tested. Creatinine is a chemical waste product of creatine. Creatine is a chemical the body makes to supply energy, mainly to muscles.\nThe lab specialist combines your blood creatinine level with several other factors to estimate your GFR. Different formulas are used for adults and children."}

These include antibiotics and stomach acid medicines.\nBe sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take. Do not stop taking any medicine before talking to your provider.\nTell your provider if you are pregnant or think you might be. GFR is affected by pregnancy.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there might be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe GFR test measures how well your kidneys are filtering the blood."}

Your provider may order this test if there are signs that your kidneys are not working well. It may also be done to see how far kidney disease has progressed.\nThe GFR test is recommended for people with chronic kidney disease. It is also recommended for people who may develop kidney disease due to:\nDiabetes\nFamily history of kidney disease\nFrequent urinary tract infections\nHeart disease\nHigh blood pressure\nUrinary blockage\nNormal Results\nAccording to the National Kidney Foundation, normal results range from 90  to 120 mL/min/1.73 m\n2\n. Older people will have lower than normal GFR levels because GFR decreases with age.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nLevels below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for 3 or more months are a sign of chronic kidney disease."}

A GFR lower than 15 mL/min/1.73 m2 is a sign of kidney failure and requires immediate medical attention.\nLower than normal GFR may indicate:\nToo little blood flow to the kidneys\nLoss of body fluids (dehydration)\nHeart or liver disease leading to circulatory system changes that affect the kidneys\nDamage to the filtering units of the kidneys\nDamage to tubules or other tissues of the kidneys\nObstruction or blockage of the bladder or other parts of the urinary tract system\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.
