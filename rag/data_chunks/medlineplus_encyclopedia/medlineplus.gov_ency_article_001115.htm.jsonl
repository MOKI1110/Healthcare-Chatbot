Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTotal anomalous pulmonary venous return\nTotal anomalous pulmonary venous return\nTotal anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR) is a heart disease in which the 4 veins that take blood from the lungs to the heart do not attach normally to the left atrium (left upper chamber of the heart). Instead, they attach to another blood vessel or the wrong part of the heart. It is present at birth (\ncongenital heart disease\n).\nCauses\nThe cause of total anomalous pulmonary venous return is unknown.\nIn normal circulation, blood is sent from the right ventricle to pick up oxygen in the lungs. It then returns through the pulmonary (lung) veins to the left side of the heart, which sends blood out through the aorta and around the body.\nIn TAPVR, oxygen-rich blood returns from the lungs to the right atrium or to a vein flowing into the right atrium, instead of the left side of heart."}

In other words, blood simply circles to and from the lungs and never gets out to the body.\nFor the infant to live, an\natrial septal defect\n(ASD) or\npatent foramen ovale\n(passage between the left and right atria) must exist to allow oxygenated blood to flow to the left side of the heart and the rest of the body.\nHow severe this condition is depends on whether the pulmonary veins are blocked or obstructed as they drain."}

In surgery, the pulmonary veins are connected to the left atrium and the defect between the right and left atrium is closed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf this condition is not treated, the heart will get larger, leading to heart failure. Repairing the defect early provides excellent results if there is no blockage of the pulmonary veins at the new connection into the heart. Infants who have obstructed veins have worsened survival.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nBreathing difficulties\nHeart failure\nIrregular, fast heart rhythms (arrhythmias)\nLung infections\nPulmonary hypertension\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nThis condition may be apparent at the time of birth. However, symptoms may not be present until later.\nContact your health care provider if you notice symptoms of TAPVR. Prompt attention is required.\nPrevention\nWomen who plan to become pregnant should be immunized against rubella if they are not already immune."}

If you are not immune, avoid any possible exposure to rubella and get vaccinated right after delivery.\nPregnant women who have diabetes should try to get good control over their blood sugar level.\nSome inherited factors may play a role in congenital heart disease.
