Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRhinophyma\nRhinophyma\nRhinophyma is a large red-colored (ruddy) nose. The nose has a bulb shape.\nCauses\nRhinophyma was once thought to be caused by heavy alcohol use. This is not correct. Rhinophyma occurs equally in people who do not use alcohol and in those who drink heavily. The problem is much more common in men than in women.\nThe cause of rhinophyma is unknown. It may be a severe form of a skin disease called\nrosacea\n. It is an uncommon disorder.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include changes in the nose, such as:\nBulb-like (bulbous) shape\nMany oil glands\nReddish color (possible)\nThickening of the skin\nWaxy, yellow surface\nExams and Tests\nMost of the time, your health care provider can diagnose rhinophyma without any tests. Sometimes a\nskin biopsy\nmay be needed.\nTreatment\nThe most common treatment is surgery to reshape the nose. Surgery may be done with a\nlaser\n, scalpel, or rotating brush (\ndermabrasion\n). Certain acne medicines may also help treat the condition.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nRhinophyma can be corrected with surgery."}
