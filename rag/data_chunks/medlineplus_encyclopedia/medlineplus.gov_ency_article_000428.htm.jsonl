These diseases lead to muscle weakness, swelling, tenderness, and tissue damage. They are part of a larger group of diseases called myopathies, more specifically inflammatory myopathies.\nCauses\nPolymyositis affects the skeletal muscles. It is also known as idiopathic inflammatory myopathy. The exact cause is unknown, but it may be related to an\nautoimmune\nreaction or infection.\nPolymyositis can affect people at any age. It is most common in adults between ages 50 and 60, and in older children. It affects women twice as often as men. It is more common in African Americans than white people.\nSymptoms\nPolymyositis is a systemic disease. This means it affects the whole body. Muscle weakness and tenderness can be signs of polymyositis. A rash is a sign of a related condition,\ndermatomyositis\n.\nCommon symptoms include:\nMuscle weakness in the shoulders and hips."}

The dose of medicine is slowly tapered off as muscle strength improves. Medicines to suppress the immune system may be used to replace the corticosteroids. These medicines may include azathioprine, methotrexate, rituximab (Rituxan), or mycophenolate.\nFor disease that remains active in spite of corticosteroids, intravenous gamma globulin can be given. It is important to check for other conditions in people who do not respond to treatment. A repeat muscle biopsy may be needed to make this diagnosis.\nIf the condition is associated with a\ntumor\n, it may improve if the tumor is removed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nResponse to treatment varies, based on the complications. As many as 1 in 5 people may die within 5 years of developing the condition.\nMany people, especially children, recover from the illness and do not need ongoing treatment."}
