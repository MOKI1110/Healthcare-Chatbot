This area is called the pleural space. Cytology means the study of cells.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA sample of fluid from the pleural space is needed. The sample is taken using a procedure called\nthoracentesis\n.\nThe procedure is done in the following way:\nYou sit on a bed or on the edge of a chair or bed. Your head and arms rest on a table.\nA small area of skin on your back is cleaned. Numbing medicine (local anesthetic) is injected in this area.\nYour health care provider inserts a needle or a temporary catheter through the skin and muscles of the chest wall into the pleural space.\nFluid is collected.\nThe needle is removed. A bandage is placed on the skin.\nThe fluid sample is sent to a lab."}

A bandage is placed on the skin.\nThe fluid sample is sent to a lab. There, it is examined under the microscope to determine what the cells look like and whether they are abnormal.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed before the test. A\nchest x-ray\nor\nultrasound\nwill likely be done before and after the test.\nDo not cough, breathe deeply, or move during the test to avoid injury to the lung.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will feel stinging when the local anesthetic is injected. You may feel pain or pressure when the needle is inserted into the pleural space.\nTell your provider if you feel short of breath or have chest pain.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA cytology exam is used to look for cancer and precancerous cells. It may also be done for other conditions, such as identifying\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\ncells. Occasionally, microorganisms can be seen in cytology too, but in general, they are best identified by culture.\nYour provider may order this test if you have signs of fluid buildup in the pleural space."}

This condition is called\npleural effusion\n. The test may also be done if you have signs of lung cancer.\nNormal Results\nNormal cells are seen.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIn an abnormal result, there are cancerous (malignant) cells. This may mean there is a cancerous\ntumor\n. This test most often detects:\nBreast cancer\nLymphoma (cancer of the lymph system)\nLung cancer\nOvarian cancer\nStomach cancer\nRisks\nRisks are related to thoracentesis and may include:\nBleeding\nInfection\nCollapse of the lung (\npneumothorax\n)\nDifficulty breathing\nAlternative Names\nPleural fluid cytology; Lung cancer - pleural fluid\nReferences\nBlok BK.
