Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEllis-van Creveld syndrome\nEllis-van Creveld syndrome\nEllis-van Creveld syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects bone growth.\nCauses\nEllis-van Creveld is passed down through families (inherited). It is caused by defects in 1 of 2 Ellis-van Creveld syndrome genes (\nEVC\nand\nEVC2\n). These genes are positioned next to each other on the same chromosome.\nThe severity of the disease varies from person to person. The highest rate of the condition is seen among the Old Order Amish population of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania."}

The highest rate of the condition is seen among the Old Order Amish population of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. It is fairly rare in the general population.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nCleft lip or palate\nEpispadias\nor\nundescended testicle\n(cryptorchidism)\nExtra fingers (\npolydactyly\n)\nLimited range of motion\nNail problems\n, including missing or deformed nails\nShort arms and legs, especially forearm and lower leg\nShort height, between 3.5  to 5 feet (1  to 1.5 meters) tall\nSparse, absent, or fine textured hair\nTooth abnormalities, such as\npeg teeth\n,\nwidely-spaced teeth\nTeeth present at birth (\nnatal teeth\n)\nDelayed or missing teeth\nExams and Tests\nSigns of this condition include:\nGrowth hormone deficiency\nHeart defects, such as a hole in the heart (\natrial septal defect\n), occur in about half of all cases\nTests include:\nChest x-ray\nEchocardiogram\nGenetic testing may be performed for genetic variants in one of the two EVC genes\nSkeletal\nx-ray\nUltrasound\nUrinalysis\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on which body system is affected and the severity of the problem."}

If you have a family history of EVC syndrome and your child has any symptoms, visit your provider.\nGenetic counseling can help families understand the condition and how to care for the person.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling is recommended for prospective parents from a high-risk group, or who have a family history of EVC syndrome.\nAlternative Names\nChondroectodermal dysplasia; EVC\nImages\nPolydactyly - an infant's hand\nChromosomes and DNA\nReferences\nChitty LS, Wilson LC, Ushakov F.
