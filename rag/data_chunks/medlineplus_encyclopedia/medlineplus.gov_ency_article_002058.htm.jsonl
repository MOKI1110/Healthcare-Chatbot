Even if you prepare, your child may feel some discomfort or pain. Try using play to demonstrate what will happen during the test. Doing so may help reveal your child's concerns about the test.\nThe most important way you can help is by preparing your child ahead of time, and providing support for your child during the procedure. Explaining the procedure may help reduce your child's anxiety. Let your child participate and make as many decisions as possible.\nPREPARING FOR THE PROCEDURE\nLimit explanations about the procedure to 20 minutes. Use several sessions, if needed. Since school-age children have a good concept of time, it is OK to prepare your child before the procedure."}

Use several sessions, if needed. Since school-age children have a good concept of time, it is OK to prepare your child before the procedure. The older your child, the earlier you can begin to prepare.\nHere are some general guidelines for preparing your child for a test or procedure:\nExplain the procedure in language your child understands, and use real terms.\nMake sure your child understands the exact body part involved, and that the procedure will be done only on that area.\nDescribe as best as you can how the test will feel.\nIf the procedure affects a part of the body your child needs for a certain function (such as speaking, hearing, or urinating), explain what changes will occur afterward. Discuss how long these effects will last.\nLet your child know it's OK to yell, cry, or express pain in another way using sounds or words.\nAllow your child to practice the positions or movements that will be needed for the procedure, such as the fetal position for a\nlumbar puncture\n(spinal tap).\nStress the benefits of the procedure and talk about things your child may like afterwards, such as feeling better or going home."}

After the test, you may want to take your child for ice cream or some other treat, but do not make the treat a condition of being good for the test.\nSuggest ways to stay calm, such as counting, deep breathing, singing, blowing bubbles, and relaxing by thinking pleasant thoughts.\nAllow your child to participate in simple tasks during the procedure, if appropriate.\nInclude your child in the decision-making process, such as the time of day or the site on the body where the procedure is performed (this depends on the type of procedure being performed).\nEncourage your child's participation during the procedure, such as holding an instrument, if allowed.\nLet your child hold your hand or the hand of someone else who is helping with the procedure. Physical contact can help reduce pain and anxiety.\nDistract your child with books, bubbles, games, hand-held video games, or other activities.\nPLAY PREPARATION\nChildren often avoid responding when asked direct questions about their feelings."}

Some children who are happy to share their feelings withdraw as their anxiety and fear increase.\nPlay can be a good way to demonstrate the procedure for your child. They can also help reveal your child's concerns.\nThe play technique should be tailored to your child. Most health care facilities that treat children (such as a children's hospital) will use a play technique to prepare your child. This involves using an object or toy that is important to your child. It may be less threatening for your child to communicate concerns through the toy or object than to express them directly. For example, a child may be better able to understand a blood test if you discuss how the doll might feel during the test.\nOnce you are familiar with the procedure, demonstrate on the object or toy what your child will experience."}

For example, show positions, bandages, stethoscopes, and how the skin is cleaned.\nMedical toys are available, or you can ask your child's health care provider to share some of the items used in the test for your demonstration (except for needles and other sharp items). Afterward, allow your child to play with some of the safe items. Watch your child for clues to concerns and fears.\nFor younger school-age children, the play technique is appropriate. Older school-age children might view this approach as childish. Consider your child's intellectual needs before using this type of communication.\nOlder children may benefit from videos that show children of the same age explaining, demonstrating, and going through the same procedure. Ask your provider if such videos are available for your child to watch.\nDrawing is another way for children to express themselves. Ask your child to draw the procedure after you have explained and demonstrated it."}

Ask your child's provider if you are not sure. If your child does not want you to be there, it is best to honor this wish.\nOut of respect for your child's growing need for privacy, do not allow peers or siblings to view the procedure unless your child allows them or asks for them to be there.\nAvoid showing your anxiety. This will only make your child feel more upset. Research suggests that children are more cooperative if their parents take measures (such as acupuncture) to reduce their own anxiety. If you're feeling stressed or anxious, consider asking friends and family members for help."}
