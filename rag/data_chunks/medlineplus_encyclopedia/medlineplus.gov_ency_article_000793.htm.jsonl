Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nIncreased intracranial pressure\nIncreased intracranial pressure\nIncreased intracranial pressure is a rise in the pressure inside the skull that can result from or cause brain injury.\nCauses\nIncreased intracranial pressure can be due to a rise in the pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid. This is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. An increase in intracranial pressure can also be due to a rise in pressure within the brain itself. This can be caused by a mass (such as a tumor), bleeding into the brain or fluid around the brain, or swelling of the brain.\nAn increase in intracranial pressure may be a serious and life-threatening medical problem. The pressure can damage the brain or spinal cord by pressing on important structures and by restricting blood flow into the brain.\nMany conditions can increase intracranial pressure."}
