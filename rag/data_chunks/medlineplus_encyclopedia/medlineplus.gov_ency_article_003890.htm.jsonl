Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAnoscopy and high-resolution anoscopy\nAnoscopy and high-resolution anoscopy\nAnoscopy is a method to look at the:\nAnus\nAnal canal\nLower rectum\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe procedure is usually done in a health care provider's office.\nA digital anorectal examination (DARE) is done first. Then, a lubricated instrument called an anoscope is placed a few inches or centimeters into the rectum. You will feel some discomfort when this is done.\nThe anoscope has a light on the end, so your health care provider can see the entire area. High-resolution anoscopy (HRA) uses an additional magnifying device called a colposcope. This device allows for a closer examination of the tissues to detect small changes. HRA may be used to help detect abnormal cells in your anal lining.\nA sample for\nbiopsy\ncan be taken, if needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nOften, there is no preparation needed. Or, you may receive a laxative, enema, or other preparation to empty your bowel. You should empty your bladder before the procedure."}
