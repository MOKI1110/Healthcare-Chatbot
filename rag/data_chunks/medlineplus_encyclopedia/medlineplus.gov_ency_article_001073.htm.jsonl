Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBursitis of the heel\nBursitis of the heel\nBursitis of the heel is swelling of the fluid-filled sac (bursa) at the back of the heel bone.\nCauses\nA bursa acts as a cushion and lubricant between tendons or muscles sliding over bone. There are bursas around most large joints in the body, including the ankle.\nThe retrocalcaneal bursa is located in the back of the ankle by the heel. It is under the large Achilles tendon that connects the calf muscles to the heel bone.\nRepeated or too much use of the ankle can cause this bursa to become irritated and inflamed. It may be caused by too much walking, running, or jumping.\nThis condition is very often linked to\nAchilles tendinitis\n."}

It may be caused by too much walking, running, or jumping.\nThis condition is very often linked to\nAchilles tendinitis\n. Sometimes retrocalcaneal bursitis may be mistaken for Achilles tendinitis.\nRisks for this condition include:\nStarting a very intense workout schedule\nSuddenly increasing activity level without the right conditioning\nIncrease or decrease in activity level\nHistory of arthritis that is caused by inflammation\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nPain at the back of the heel, especially with walking, running, or when the area is touched\nPain may get worse when standing on tiptoes\nRed, warm skin over the back of the heel\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will take a history to find out if you have symptoms of retrocalcaneal bursitis. An exam will be done to find the location of the pain. The provider will also look for tenderness and redness in the back of the heel.\nThe pain may be worse when your ankle is bent upward (dorsiflex)."}

The provider will also look for tenderness and redness in the back of the heel.\nThe pain may be worse when your ankle is bent upward (dorsiflex). Or, the pain may be worse when you rise on your toes.\nMost of the time, you will not need imaging studies such as x-ray and\nmagnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI) at first. You may need these tests later if the first treatments do not lead to improvement. Inflammation may show on an MRI.\nTreatment\nYour provider may recommend that you do the following:\nAvoid activities that cause pain.\nPut ice on the heel several times a day.\nTake nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen.\nTry using over-the-counter or custom heel wedges in your shoe to help decrease stress on the heel.\nTry ultrasound treatment during physical therapy to reduce inflammation.\nHave physical therapy to improve flexibility and strength around the ankle. The focus will be on stretching your Achilles tendon. This can help the bursitis improve and prevent it from coming back.\nIf these treatments do not work, your provider may inject a small amount of steroid medicine into the bursa."}

After the injection, you should avoid overstretching the tendon because it can tear (rupture).\nIf the condition is connected to Achilles tendinitis, you may need to wear a cast on the ankle for several weeks. Very rarely, surgery may be needed to remove the inflamed bursa.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThis condition most often gets better in several weeks with the proper treatment.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have heel pain or symptoms of retrocalcaneal bursitis that do not improve with rest.\nPrevention\nThings you can do to prevent the problem include:\nMaintain good flexibility and strength around the ankle to help prevent this condition.\nStretch the Achilles tendon to help prevent injury.\nWear shoes with enough arch support to decrease the amount of stress on the tendon and inflammation in the bursa.\nUse proper form when exercising.\nAlternative Names\nInsertional heel pain; Retrocalcaneal bursitis\nImages\nFlexibility exercise\nRetrocalcaneal bursitis\nRefere"}
