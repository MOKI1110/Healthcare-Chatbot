Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEosinophilic esophagitis\nEosinophilic esophagitis\nEosinophilic esophagitis involves a buildup of a specific type of white blood cells, called eosinophils, in the lining of your esophagus. The esophagus is the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. The buildup of eosinophils that causes eosinophilic esophagitis is due to a reaction to foods or allergens.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of eosinophilic esophagitis is not known. It is believed that an immune reaction to certain foods leads to a buildup of eosinophils. As a result, the lining of the esophagus becomes swollen and inflamed.\nMost people with this disorder have a family or personal history of allergies or asthma."}

Triggers such as mold, pollen, and dust mites may also play a role.\nSymptoms\nEosinophilic esophagitis can affect both children and adults.\nSymptoms in children include:\nProblems feeding or eating\nAbdominal pain\nVomiting\nProblems swallowing\nFood getting stuck in the esophagus\nPoor weight gain or weight loss, poor growth, and malnutrition\nSymptoms in adults include:\nFood getting stuck when swallowing (dysphagia)\nChest pain\nHeartburn\nUpper abdominal pain\nBackflow of undigested food (regurgitation)\nReflux in the esophagus that does not get better with medicine\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will take a detailed history and perform a physical exam."}

Treatment involves managing your diet and taking medicines.\nIf you test positive for food allergies, you may be told to avoid those foods. Or you may avoid all foods that are known to trigger this problem. Common foods that cause eosinophilic esophagitis include seafood, eggs, nuts, soy, wheat, and dairy. Allergy testing may discover specific foods to avoid, but is not always helpful. Talk to your provider about what foods to avoid.\nProton pump inhibitors can help control symptoms."}

They may also help treat inflammation of the esophagus.\nYour provider may prescribe topical steroids taken orally or inhaled. You also may take oral steroids for a short time. Topical steroids don't have the same side effects as oral steroids. You must rinse your mouth after using topical steroids.\nIf you develop narrowing or strictures, a procedure to open up or dilate the area may be needed. This is done during an endoscopy.\nNew medicines have been approved to help with eosinophilic esophagitis. They may be used by mouth or injected.\nYou and your provider will work together to find a treatment plan that works best for you.\nSupport Groups\nSupport groups such as\nAmerican Partnership for Eosinophilic Disorders\ncan help you understand more about eosinophilic esophagitis."}
