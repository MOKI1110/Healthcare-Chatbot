Your genes can affect the desired result of a drug. Your provider can use the information from this test to prescribe medicines that will work best for you and produce fewer side effects.\nHow the Test is Performed\nTesting is done one of three ways:\nBy taking a\nblood sample\nBy taking a sample of your saliva (spit)\nBy\ncollecting cells from the inside of your cheek\n(buccal smear)\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nTo prepare for the three different testing methods:\nNo special preparation is necessary for the blood test.\nDo not eat, drink, smoke, or chew gum for 30 minutes before the spit test.\nYour provider may ask you to rinse your mouth before your cheek is swabbed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nThe saliva test and check swab don't hurt.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order pharmacogenetic testing to see if you can take certain medicines safely and how well they will work for your condition. If the results show possible side effects or that your body is resistant to that medicine, your provider can change it to a medicine your body will process better.\nNormal Results\nPharmacogenetic testing results identify changes in a select group of genes. These genes control how your body responds to medicines."}
