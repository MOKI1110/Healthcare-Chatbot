It uses a smaller surgical cut. Also, fewer muscles around the hip are cut or detached.\nDescription\nTo perform this surgery:\nA cut will be made in one of three places -- on the back of the hip (over the buttock), on the front of the hip (near the groin), or on the side of the hip. Your surgeon will explain which approach will be used.\nIn most cases, the cut will be 3 to 6 inches (7.5 to 15 centimeters) long. In a regular\nhip replacement surgery\n, the cut is 10 to 12 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) long.\nThe surgeon will use special instruments to work through the small cut.\nSurgery involves cutting and removing bone. The surgeon must cut through some muscles and other tissues. Less tissue is cut than in regular surgery."}

This technique works better for people who are younger and thinner. Minimally invasive techniques may allow for a quicker recovery and less pain.\nYou may not qualify for this procedure if\nYour arthritis is quite severe.\nYou have medical problems that do not allow you to have this surgery.\nYou have a lot of soft tissue or fat so that larger cuts would be needed to access the joint.\nTalk with your surgeon about the benefits and risks. Ask if your surgeon has experience with this type of surgery.\nAfter the Procedure\nPeople who have this surgery can have a shorter stay in the hospital and faster recovery."}
