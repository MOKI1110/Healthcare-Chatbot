A small amount is needed for the body to function, but the body cannot make its own copper. You must get it from food.\nFunction\nCopper works with iron to help the body form red blood cells. It also helps keep the blood vessels, nerves, immune system, and bones healthy. Copper also aids in iron absorption.\nFood Sources\nOysters and other shellfish, whole grains, beans, nuts, potatoes, and organ meats (kidneys, liver) are good sources of copper. Dark leafy greens, dried fruits such as prunes, cocoa, black pepper, and yeast are also sources of copper in the diet.\nSide Effects\nPeople normally get enough copper from the foods they eat.\nMenkes disease\n(kinky hair syndrome) is a very rare disorder of copper\nmetabolism\nthat is present before birth. It occurs in male infants and affects their copper levels.\nLack of copper may lead to anemia and osteoporosis.\nIn large amounts, copper is poisonous."}

It occurs in male infants and affects their copper levels.\nLack of copper may lead to anemia and osteoporosis.\nIn large amounts, copper is poisonous. A rare inherited disorder,\nWilson disease\n, causes deposits of copper in the liver, brain, and other organs. The increased copper in these tissues leads to\nhepatitis\n, kidney compromise, brain disorders, and other problems.\nRecommendations\nDosages for copper, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)\n: The average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people. An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence.\nAdequate Intake (AI)\n: This level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA."}

Women who are pregnant or producing breast milk (lactating) need higher amounts. Ask your health care provider which amount is best for you.\nAlternative Names\nDiet - copper\nReferences\nHopkins AC.
