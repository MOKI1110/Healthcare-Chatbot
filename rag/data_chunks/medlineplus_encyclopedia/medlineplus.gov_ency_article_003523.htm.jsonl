Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTularemia blood test\nTularemia blood test\nTularemia blood test checks for infection caused by bacteria called\nFrancisella tularensis (F tularensis).\nThe bacteria  causes the disease\ntularemia\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample is needed\n.\nThe sample is sent to a laboratory where it is examined for francisella antibodies using a method called serology. This method checks if your body has produced substances called\nantibodies\nto a specific foreign substance (\nantigen\n), in this case\nF tularensis\n.\nAntibodies are proteins that defend your body against bacteria, viruses, and fungi. If antibodies are present, they are in the serum of your blood. Serum is the liquid portion of blood.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no special preparation.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, you may feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or bruising."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis blood test is done when tularemia is suspected.\nNormal Results\nA normal result is no antibodies specific for\nF tularensis\nare found in the serum.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf antibodies are detected, there has been exposure to\nF tularensis\n.\nIf antibodies are found, it means you either have a current or past infection with\nF tularensis\n. In some cases, a single high level of antibodies that are specific to\nF tularensis\nmeans you have an infection.\nDuring the early stage of an illness, few antibodies may be detected. Antibody production increases during the course of an infection."}

Antibody production increases during the course of an infection. For this reason, this test may be repeated several weeks after the first test.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nTularemia test; Serology for Francisella tularensis\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nAoyagi K, Ashihara Y, Kasahara Y.
