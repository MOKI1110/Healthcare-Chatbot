You may feel a slight prick when the needle is being inserted.\nNext, your dentist will use a tiny drill to remove a small portion of the top part of your tooth to expose the pulp. This is typically called gaining access to the pulp.\nPulp is made up of nerves, blood vessels, and connective tissue. It is found inside the tooth and runs in tooth canals all the way to the jaw bone. Pulp supplies blood to a tooth and allows you to feel sensations such as temperature.\nThe dead or infected pulp is removed with special tools called files. The canals (tiny pathways inside the tooth) are cleaned and irrigated with disinfecting solution. Medicines may be placed into the area to make sure all the germs are removed and to prevent further infection."}

Once the tooth is cleaned, canals are filled with a permanent material.\nThe top side of the tooth may be sealed with a soft, temporary material. Once the tooth is filled with a permanent material, a final crown may be placed on top.\nYou may be given antibiotics to treat and prevent infection.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nA root canal is done if you have an infection that affects the pulp of a tooth. Generally, there is pain and swelling in the area. The infection can be the result of a tooth crack, cavity, or injury. It may also be the result of a deep pocket in the gum area around a tooth.\nIf this is the case, a dental specialist known as an endodontist should examine the area. Depending on the source of infection and severity of the decay, the tooth may or may not be salvageable.\nA root canal can save your tooth. Without treatment, the tooth may become so damaged that it must be removed. Root canal must be followed by a permanent restoration."}

This is done in order to restore the tooth to its original shape and strength so it can withstand the force of chewing.\nRisks\nPossible risks of this procedure are:\nInfection in your tooth root (\nabscess\n)\nLoss of tooth\nNerve damage\nTooth fracture\nAfter the Procedure\nYou will need to see your dentist after the procedure to make sure the infection is gone. A dental x-ray will be taken. Regular dental checkups are necessary. For adults, this usually means a visit twice a year.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nYou may have some pain or soreness after the procedure. An over-the-counter anti-inflammatory drug, such as ibuprofen, can help relieve discomfort.\nMost people can return to their normal routine the same day. Until the tooth is permanently filled or covered with a crown, you should avoid rough chewing in the area.\nAlternative Names\nEndodontic therapy; Root canal therapy\nImages\nTooth abscess\nReferences\nAmerican Association of Endodontists website."}
