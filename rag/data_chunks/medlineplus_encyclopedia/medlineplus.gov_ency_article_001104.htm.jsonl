Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCyanotic heart disease\nCyanotic heart disease\nCyanotic\nheart disease\nrefers to a group of many different heart defects that are present at birth (congenital). They result in a low blood oxygen level. Cyanosis refers to a bluish color of the skin and mucous membranes.\nCauses\nNormally, blood returns from the body and flows through the heart and lungs.\nBlood that is low in oxygen returns from the body to the right side of the heart.\nThe right side of the heart then pumps the blood to the lungs, where it picks up more oxygen and becomes red.\nThe oxygen-rich blood returns from the lungs to the left side of the heart. From there, it is pumped to the rest of the body.\nHeart defects that children are born with can change the way blood flows through the heart and lungs. These defects can cause less blood to flow to the lungs. They can also result in blue and red blood mixing together. This causes poorly oxygenated blood to be pumped out to the body."}

As a result:\nThe blood that is pumped out to the body is lower in oxygen.\nLess oxygen delivered to the body can make the skin look blue (\ncyanosis\n).\nSome of these heart defects involve the heart valves. These defects force blue blood to mix with red blood through abnormal heart channels. Heart valves are found between the heart and the large blood vessels that bring blood to and from the heart. These valves open up enough for blood to flow through."}

Heart valves are found between the heart and the large blood vessels that bring blood to and from the heart. These valves open up enough for blood to flow through. Then they close, keeping blood from flowing backward.\nHeart valve defects that can cause cyanosis include:\nTricuspid valve (the valve between the 2 chambers on the right side of the heart)\nmay be absent\nor unable to open wide enough.\nPulmonary valve (the valve between the heart and the lungs)\nmay be absent\nor\nunable to open wide enough\n.\nAortic valve (the valve between the heart and the blood vessel to the rest of the body) is unable to open wide enough.\nMitral valve (the valve between the 2 chambers on the left side of the heart) may be absent or unable to open wide enough. This is very rare and a\npoorly formed left ventricle\nmay also be present.\nOther heart defects may include abnormalities in valve development or in the location and connections between blood vessels."}

During these spells, symptoms may include:\nAnxiety\nBreathing too quickly (hyperventilation)\nSudden increase in bluish color to the skin\nInfants may get tired or sweat while feeding and may not gain as much weight as they should.\nFainting (syncope) and chest pain may occur.\nOther symptoms depend on the type of cyanotic heart disease, and may include:\nFeeding problems or reduced appetite, leading to poor growth\nBluish color to the skin (cyanosis) due to low oxygen level in the blood\nPuffy eyes or face\nTiredness all the time\nExams and Tests\nPhysical examination\nconfirms cyanosis.

If you are not immune, avoid any possible exposure to rubella and get vaccinated right after delivery.\nPregnant women who have diabetes should try to get good control over their blood sugar level.\nAlternative Names\nRight-to-left cardiac shunt; Right-to-left circulatory shunt\nImages\nHeart - section through the middle\nCardiac catheterization\nHeart - front view\nTetralogy of Fallot\nClubbing\nCyanotic heart disease\nReferences\nBernstein D."}
