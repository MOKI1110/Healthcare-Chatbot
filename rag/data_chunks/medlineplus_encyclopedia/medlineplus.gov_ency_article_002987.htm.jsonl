It is a type of skin-smoothing surgery.\nDescription\nDermabrasion is usually done by a doctor, either a plastic surgeon or dermatologic surgeon. The procedure takes place in your doctor's office or an outpatient clinic.\nYou'll likely be awake. A numbing medicine (local anesthesia) will be applied to the skin that will be treated.\nIf you are having a complex procedure, you may be given medicines called sedatives to make you sleepy and less anxious. Another option is\ngeneral anesthesia\n, which allows you to sleep through surgery and not feel any pain during the procedure.\nDermabrasion uses a special device to gently and carefully sand the top surface of the skin down to normal, healthy skin."}

Swelling usually goes away within 2 to 3 weeks.\nYou may feel aching, tingling, or burning for a while. Your doctor can prescribe medicine to help control pain.\nIf you've had\ncold sores (herpes)\nbefore, your doctor may give you antiviral medicine to prevent an outbreak.\nFollow your doctor's instructions on skin care after you go home.\nDuring healing:\nThe new layer of skin will be a little swollen, sensitive, itchy, and bright pink for several weeks.\nHealing time depends on the extent of dermabrasion and size of treatment area.\nMost people can go back to normal activities in about 2 weeks. You should avoid any activity that could cause injury to the treated area."}

You should avoid any activity that could cause injury to the treated area. Avoid sports that involve balls, such as baseball, for 4 to 6 weeks.\nFor about 3 weeks after surgery, your skin will turn red when you drink alcohol.\nMen who have this procedure may need to avoid shaving for a while, and use an electric razor when shaving again.\nProtect your skin from the sun for 6 to 12 weeks or until your skin color has returned to normal. You can wear hypoallergenic make-up to hide any changes in skin color. New skin should closely match the surrounding skin when full color returns.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf your skin remains red and swollen after healing has started, it may be a sign that abnormal scars are forming. Tell your doctor if this happens. Treatment may be available.\nPeople with dark skin are at greater risk of having dark patches of skin after the procedure.\nAlternative Names\nSkin planing\nImages\nSkin smoothing surgery  - series\nReferences\nMonheit GD,  Hrynewycz K.
