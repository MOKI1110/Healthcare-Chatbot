Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSecondary systemic amyloidosis\nSecondary systemic amyloidosis\nSecondary systemic amyloidosis is a disorder in which abnormal proteins build up in tissues and organs. Clumps of the abnormal proteins are called amyloid deposits.\nSecondary means it occurs because of another disease or situation. For example, this condition usually occurs due to\nlong-term\n(chronic) infection or inflammation. In contrast, primary amyloidosis is a primary hematological disorder that results in deposition of abnormal amyloid proteins in different organs such as the heart and kidney.\nSystemic means that the disease affects the entire body.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of secondary systemic\namyloidosis\nis unknown."}
