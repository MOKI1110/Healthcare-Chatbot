Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nDacryoadenitis\nDacryoadenitis\nDacryoadenitis is inflammation of the tear-producing gland (lacrimal gland).\nCauses\nAcute dacryoadenitis is most commonly due to viral or bacterial infection. Common causes include\nmumps\n,\nEpstein-Barr virus\n, staphylococcus, and gonococcus.\nChronic dacryoadenitis is most often due to noninfectious inflammatory disorders. Examples include\nsarcoidosis\n, thyroid eye disease, and\norbital pseudotumor\n.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nSwelling of the outer portion of the upper eyelid, with possible redness and tenderness\nPain in the area of swelling\nExcess tearing or discharge\nSwelling of lymph nodes\nin front of the ear\nExams and Tests\nDacryoadenitis can be diagnosed by an exam of the eyes and lids. Special tests, such as a\nCT scan\nmay be needed to look for the cause. Sometimes a biopsy will be needed to  make sure that a\ntumor of the lacrimal gland\nis not present.\nTreatment\nIf the cause of dacryoadenitis is a viral condition such as mumps, rest and warm compresses may be enough."}

In other cases, the treatment depends on the disease that caused the condition.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people will fully recover from dacryoadenitis. For more serious causes, such as sarcoidosis, the outlook depends on the disease that caused this condition.\nPossible Complications\nSwelling may be severe enough to put pressure on the eye and distort vision. Some people who were  first thought to have dacryoadenitis may turn out to have cancer of the lacrimal gland.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if swelling or pain increase despite treatment.\nPrevention\nMumps can be prevented by getting vaccinated. You can avoid getting infected with gonococcus, the bacteria that cause gonorrhea,  by using  safe sex practices. Most other causes cannot be prevented.\nImages\nLacrimal gland anatomy\nReferences\nDurand ML. Periocular infections.
