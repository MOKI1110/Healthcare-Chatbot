There are many types of immunoglobulins that fight different types of infections. Some immunoglobulins can be abnormal and may be due to some types of\ncancer\n.\nImmunoglobulins can also be measured in the\nblood\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nclean-catch urine sample\nis needed. The clean-catch method is used to prevent germs from the penis or vagina from getting into a urine sample. To collect your urine, your health care provider may give you a special clean-catch kit that contains a cleansing solution and sterile wipes. Follow instructions exactly.\nAfter you provide a urine sample, it is sent to the lab. There, a lab specialist will place the urine sample on special paper and apply an electric current."}

The various proteins move and form visible bands, which reveal the amounts of each protein.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider may ask you to collect the first morning urine, which is the most concentrated.\nIf you are taking the collection from an infant, you may need extra collection bags.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe test involves only normal urination, and there is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is used to measure the amounts of various immunoglobulins in urine. Most often, it is done after a large amount of protein is found in the urine.\nNormal Results\nNormally there is no protein, or only a small amount of protein in the urine. When there is protein in the urine, it normally consists of mainly albumin.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nImmunoglobulin in the urine can result from:\nAmyloidosis\n(buildup of abnormal proteins in tissues and organs)\nLeukemia\n(cancer of the bone marrow)\nWaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia\n(a type of lymphoma)\nLymphoma (cancer of the lymph tissue)\nMonoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance (MGUS, a type of blood disorder)\nMultiple myeloma\n(a type of blood cancer)\nOther cancers\nInfection\nKidney disorders such as\nIgA nephropathy\nor IgM nephropathy\nSome people have monoclonal immunoglobulins, but do not have cancer. This is called monoclonal gammopathy of unknown significance, or MGUS.\nRisks\nThere are no risks with this test.\nAlternative Names\nImmunoglobulin electrophoresis - urine; Gamma globulin electrophoresis - urine; Urine immunoglobulin electrophoresis; IEP - urine\nImages\nFemale urinary tract\nMale urinary tract\nReferences\nGertz MA, Dispenzieri A.
