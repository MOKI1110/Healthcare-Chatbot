It can develop as a result of nerve damage in the feet due to\ndiabetes\nor other nerve injuries.\nCauses\nCharcot foot is a rare and disabling disorder. It is a result of nerve damage to the feet. A common cause is\nperipheral neuropathy\n.\nDiabetes is the most common cause of this type of nerve damage. This damage is more common in people with\ntype 1 diabetes\n. When\nblood sugar levels\nare high over a long time, both nerve and blood vessel damage occurs in the arms and legs.\nNerve damage makes it harder to notice the amount of pressure or pain on the foot or if it is being stressed."}

The result is ongoing small injuries to the bones and ligaments that support the foot.\nYou may develop bone stress fractures in your feet, yet never know it.\nContinuing to walk on the fractured bone often leads to further bone and joint damage.\nOther factors leading to foot damage include:\nBlood vessel damage from diabetes can increase or change blood flow to the feet. This can lead to bone loss. Weakened bones in the feet increase the risk of fracture.\nInjury to the foot signals the body to produce more inflammation-causing chemicals. This contributes to swelling and bone loss.\nSymptoms\nEarly foot symptoms may include:\nMild pain and discomfort\nRedness\nSwelling\nWarmth in the affected foot (noticeably warmer than the other foot)\nAt later stages, bones in the foot break and move out of place, causing the foot or ankle to become deformed.\nA classic sign of Charcot is rocker-bottom foot. This occurs when the bones in middle of the foot collapse."}

This occurs when the bones in middle of the foot collapse. This causes the arch of the foot to collapse and bow downward.\nThe toes may curl downward.\nBones that stick out at odd angles can lead to pressure sores and\nfoot ulcers\n.\nBecause the feet are numb, these sores and ulcers may grow wider or deeper before they are noticed.\nHigh blood sugar also makes it hard for the body to fight infection. As a result, these foot ulcers may become infected.\nExams and Tests\nCharcot foot is often difficult to diagnose early on. It can be mistaken for sprains, bone infection, arthritis or joint swelling. Your health care provider will take your medical history and examine your foot and ankle.\nBlood tests and other lab work may be done to help check for other causes.\nYour provider may check for nerve damage with these tests:\nElectromyography\nNerve conduction velocity tests\nNerve biopsy\nThe following tests may be done to check for bone and joint damage:\nFoot\nx-rays\nFoot MRI\nBone scan\nFoot x-rays may look normal at early stages of the condition."}

Diagnosis often comes down to recognizing early symptoms of Charcot foot: swelling, redness, and warmth of the affected foot.\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to stop bone loss, allow bones to heal, and prevent bones from moving out of place (deformity).\nImmobilization --\nYour provider will have you wear a total contact cast. This will help limit movement of your foot and ankle. You will likely be asked to keep your weight off your foot entirely, so you will need to use crutches, a knee-walker device, or wheelchair.\nYou will have new casts placed on your foot as the swelling comes down. Healing can take a couple of months or more.\nProtective footwear --\nOnce your foot has healed, your provider may suggest footwear to help support your foot and prevent re-injury."}

These may include:\nSplints\nBraces\nOrthotic insoles\nCharcot restraint orthotic walker, a special boot that provides even pressure to the whole foot\nActivity changes --\nYou will always be at risk for Charcot foot coming back or developing in your other foot. So your provider may recommend activity changes, such as limiting your standing or walking, to protect your feet.  You may need to use a wheelchair to limit activity on your feet.\nSurgery --\nYou may need surgery if you have foot ulcers that keep coming back or severe foot or ankle deformity. Surgery can help stabilize your foot and ankle joints and remove bony areas to prevent foot ulcers.\nOngoing monitoring --\nYou will need to see your provider for checkups and take steps to protect your feet for the rest of your life.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe prognosis depends on the severity of foot deformity and how well you heal without infection."}
