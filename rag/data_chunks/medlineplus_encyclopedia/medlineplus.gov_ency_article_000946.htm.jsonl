Cocaine comes from the coca plant. When used, cocaine causes the brain to release higher than normal amounts of some chemicals. These produce a sense of euphoria, or a \"high.\"\nCocaine intoxication is a condition in which you're not only high from\nusing the drug\n, but you also have body-wide symptoms that can make you ill and impaired.\nCauses\nCocaine intoxication may be caused by:\nTaking too much cocaine, or taking a too-concentrated form of cocaine\nUsing cocaine when the weather is hot, which leads to more harm and side effects due to dehydration\nUsing cocaine with certain other drugs\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of cocaine intoxication include:\nFeeing high, excited, talking and rambling, sometimes about bad things happening\nAnxiety, agitation, restlessness, confusion\nMuscle tremors, such as in the face and fingers\nEnlarged pupils that don't get smaller when a light shines into the eyes\nIncreased heart rate and blood pressure\nLightheadedness\nPale"}
