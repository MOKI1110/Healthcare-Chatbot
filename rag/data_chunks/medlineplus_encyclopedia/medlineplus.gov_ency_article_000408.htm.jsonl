The disorder causes a large amount of fat to build up in the blood.\nCauses\nFamilial lipoprotein lipase deficiency is caused by a defective gene that is passed down through families.\nPeople with this condition lack an\nenzyme\ncalled lipoprotein lipase. Without this enzyme, the body cannot break down fat from digested food."}

Without this enzyme, the body cannot break down fat from digested food. Fat particles called chylomicrons build up in the blood.\nRisk factors include a family history of lipoprotein lipase deficiency.\nThe condition usually first develops during infancy or childhood.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nAbdominal pain (may appear as colic in infants)\nLoss of appetite\nNausea, vomiting\nPain in the muscles and bones\nEnlarged liver and spleen\nFailure to thrive\nin infants\nFatty deposits in the skin (\nxanthomas\n)\nHigh\ntriglyceride levels\nin the blood\nPale retinas and white-colored blood vessels in the retinas\nChronic inflammation of the pancreas\nYellowing of the eyes and skin (jaundice)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical examination and ask about your symptoms.\nBlood tests will be done to check cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Sometimes, a special blood test is done after you are given blood thinners through a vein."}

This test looks for\nlipoprotein lipase\nactivity in your blood.\nGenetic tests may be done.\nTreatment\nTreatment aims to control the symptoms and blood triglyceride levels with a very low-fat diet. Your provider will likely recommend that you eat no more than 20 grams of fat per day to prevent the symptoms from coming back.\nTwenty grams of fat is equal to one of the following:\nTwo 8-ounce (240 milliliters) glasses of whole milk\n4 teaspoons (9.5 grams) of margarine\n4 ounces (113 grams) serving of meat\nThe average American diet has a fat content of up to 45% of total calories. Fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K and mineral supplements are recommended for people who eat a very low-fat diet."}
