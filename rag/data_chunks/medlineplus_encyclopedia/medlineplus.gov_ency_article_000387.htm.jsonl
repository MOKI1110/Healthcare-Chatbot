Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nInsulinoma\nInsulinoma\nAn insulinoma is a\ntumor\nin the pancreas that produces too much insulin.\nCauses\nThe pancreas is an organ in the abdomen. The pancreas makes several\nenzymes\nand hormones, including the hormone insulin. Insulin's job is to reduce the level of sugar (glucose) in the blood by helping sugar move into cells.\nMost of the time when your blood sugar level decreases, the pancreas stops making insulin to make sure that your blood sugar stays in the normal range. Tumors of the pancreas that produce too much insulin are called insulinomas. Insulinomas keep making insulin, even when it's not needed, and can make your blood sugar level too low (hypoglycemia).\nA high blood insulin level causes a low blood sugar level (\nhypoglycemia\n). Hypoglycemia may be mild, leading to symptoms such as anxiety and hunger. Or it can be severe, leading to seizures, coma, and even death.\nInsulinomas are very rare tumors. They usually occur as single, small tumors. But there can also be several small tumors.\nMost insulinomas are non-cancerous (benign) tumors."}

They usually occur as single, small tumors. But there can also be several small tumors.\nMost insulinomas are non-cancerous (benign) tumors. People with certain genetic disorders, such as\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia type I\n, are at higher risk for insulinomas.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms are most common when you are fasting or skip or delay a meal. Symptoms may include:\nAnxiety\n, behavior changes, or\nconfusion\nClouded vision\nLoss of consciousness\nor coma\nConvulsions\nor tremor\nDizziness or headache\nHunger between meals; weight gain is common\nFast heart rate\nor palpitations\nSweating\nExams and Tests\nAfter fasting, your blood may be tested for:\nBlood\nC-peptide\nlevel\nBlood glucose level\nBlood insulin level\nMedicines that cause the pancreas to release insulin\nThe response of your body to a shot of glucagon\nCT\n,\nMRI\n, or\nPET\nscan of the abdomen may be done to look for a tumor in the pancreas."}

If a tumor is not seen in the scans, one of the following tests may be performed:\nEndoscopic ultrasound\n(test that uses a flexible scope and sound waves to view digestive system organs)\nOctreotide scan (special test that checks for specific hormone-producing cells in the body)\nPancreatic\narteriography\n(test that uses special dye to view the arteries in the pancreas)\nPancreatic venous sampling for insulin (test that helps locate the approximate location of the tumor inside the pancreas)\nTreatment\nSurgery is the usual treatment for insulinoma. If there is a single tumor, it will be removed. If there are many tumors, part of the pancreas will need to be removed. At least 15% of the pancreas must be left to produce normal levels of enzymes for digestion.\nIn rare cases, the entire pancreas is removed if there are many insulinomas or they come back after surgery. Removing the entire pancreas leads to diabetes because there is no longer any insulin being produced."}

Removing the entire pancreas leads to diabetes because there is no longer any insulin being produced. Insulin shots (injections) are then required.\nIf no tumor is found during surgery, or if you can't have surgery, you may get the medicine diazoxide to lower insulin production and prevent hypoglycemia. A water pill (diuretic) is given with this medicine to prevent the body from retaining fluid. Octreotide is another medicine that is used to reduce insulin release in some people.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn most cases, the tumor is non-cancerous (benign), and surgery can cure the disease. But a severe hypoglycemic reaction or the spread of a cancerous tumor to other organs can be life threatening.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nSevere hypoglycemic reaction\nSpread of a cancerous tumor (\nmetastasis\n)\nDiabetes if the entire pancreas is removed (rare), or food not being absorbed if too much of the pancreas is removed\nInflammation and swelling of the pancreas\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you develop any symptoms of insulinoma."}
