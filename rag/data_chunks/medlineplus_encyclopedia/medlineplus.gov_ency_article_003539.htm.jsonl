Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nComplement component 3 (C3)\nComplement component 3 (C3)\nComplement C3 is a blood test that measures the activity of a certain protein.\nThis protein is part of the\ncomplement system\n. The complement system is a group of nearly 60 proteins that are in blood plasma or on the surface of some cells. The proteins work with your immune system and play a role to protect the body from infections, and to remove dead cells and foreign material. Rarely, people may inherit deficiency of one or more complement proteins. These people are prone to certain infections or autoimmune disorders.\nThere are nine major complement proteins. They are labeled C1 through C9. This article describes the test that measures C3.\nHow the Test is Performed\nBlood is drawn from a vein."}

They are labeled C1 through C9. This article describes the test that measures C3.\nHow the Test is Performed\nBlood is drawn from a vein. Most often, a vein from the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand is used.\nThe procedure is as follows:\nThe site is cleaned with an antiseptic.\nThe health care provider wraps an elastic band around the upper arm to apply pressure to the area and make the vein swell with blood.\nThe provider gently inserts a needle into the vein.\nThe blood collects into an airtight vial or tube attached to the needle. The elastic band is removed from your arm.\nOnce the blood has been collected, the needle is removed. The puncture site is covered to stop any bleeding.\nIn infants or young children, a sharp tool called a lancet may be used to puncture the skin and make it bleed. The blood collects into a small glass tube called a pipette, or onto a slide or test strip. A bandage may be placed over the area if there is any bleeding.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no special preparation needed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain."}

Others  may feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nC3 and C4 are the most commonly measured complement components.\nA complement test may be used to monitor people with an\nautoimmune disorder\n. It is done to see if treatment for their condition is working. When the complement system is turned on during inflammation, levels of complement proteins may go down. For example, people with active\nlupus erythematosus\nmay have lower-than-normal levels of the complement proteins\nC3\nand\nC4\n.\nThe test may also be done for the following conditions:\nFungal infections\nGram negative\nsepticemia\nParasitic infections, such as\nmalaria\nParoxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH)\nShock\nNormal Results\nThe normal range is 88 to 201 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) (0.88 to 2.01 g/L).\nNote: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nThe examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIncreased complement activity may be seen in:\nCancer\nUlcerative colitis\nDecreased complement activity may be seen in:\nBacterial infections (especially Neisseria)\nCirrhosis\nGlomerulonephritis\nHepatitis\nHereditary angioedema\nKidney transplant\nrejection\nLupus nephritis\nMalnutrition\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\nRare inherited complement deficiencies\nSystemic vasculitis\nRisks\nRisks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting\nor feeling lightheaded\nHematoma\n(blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nConsiderations\nThe complement cascade is a series of reactions that take place in the blood.
