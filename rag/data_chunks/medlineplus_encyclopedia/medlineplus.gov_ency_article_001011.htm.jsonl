Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPterygium\nPterygium\nA pterygium is a noncancerous growth that starts in the clear, thin tissue (\nconjunctiva\n) of the eye. This growth covers the white part of the eye (\nsclera\n) and extends onto the cornea. It is often slightly raised and contains visible blood vessels. The problem may occur on one or both eyes.\nCauses\nThe exact cause is unknown. It is more common in people who have a lot of exposure to sunlight and wind, such as people who work outdoors.\nRisk factors are exposure to sunny, dusty, sandy, or windblown areas. Farmers, fishermen, and people living near the equator are often affected. Pterygia are rare in children.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom of a pterygium is a painless area of raised white tissue that has blood vessels on the inner or outer edge of the cornea. Sometimes the pterygium has no symptoms. However, it may become inflamed and cause burning, irritation, or a feeling like there's something in the eye."}

Sometimes the pterygium has no symptoms. However, it may become inflamed and cause burning, irritation, or a feeling like there's something in the eye. Vision may be affected if the growth extends far enough onto the cornea.\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam of the eyes and eyelids confirms the diagnosis. Special tests are not needed most of the time.\nTreatment\nIn most cases, treatment involves only wearing sunglasses and using artificial tears. Using artificial tears to keep the eyes moist may help prevent a pterygium from becoming inflamed and getting bigger. Mild steroid eye drops can be used to calm inflammation if it occurs. Surgery can be used to remove the growth for cosmetic reasons or if it blocks vision.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost pterygia cause no problems and do not need surgical treatment. If a pterygium affects the cornea, removing it can have good results.\nPossible Complications\nOngoing inflammation can cause a pterygium to grow farther onto the cornea. A pterygium can return after it is removed.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nPeople with a pterygium should be seen by an ophthalmologist each year."}

This will enable the condition to be treated before it affects vision.\nContact your ophthalmologist if you have had a pterygium in the past and your symptoms return.\nPrevention\nTaking steps to protect the eyes from ultraviolet light may help prevent this condition. This includes wearing sunglasses and a hat with a brim.\nImages\nEye anatomy\nReferences\nAmerican Academy of Ophthalmology website.
