Chemotherapy may be used to:\nCure the cancer\nShrink the cancer\nPrevent the cancer from spreading\nRelieve symptoms the cancer may be causing\nInformation\nHOW CHEMOTHERAPY IS GIVEN\nDepending on the type of cancer and where it is found, chemotherapy medicines may be given different ways, including:\nInjections or shots into the muscles\nInjections or shots under the skin\nInto an artery\nInto a vein (intravenous, or IV)\nPills taken by mouth\nShots into the fluid around the spinal cord or brain\nWhen chemotherapy is given over a longer period, a thin catheter can be placed into a large vein near the heart. This is called a central line. The catheter is placed during a minor surgery.\nThere are many types of catheters, including:\nCentral venous catheter\nCentral venous catheter with a port\nPercutaneously inserted central catheter (PICC)\nA central line can stay in the body over a long period of time."}

It will need to be\nflushed\non a periodic basis to prevent blood clots from forming inside the central line.\nDifferent chemotherapy medicines may be given at the same time or after each other. Radiation therapy may be received before, after, or during chemotherapy.\nChemotherapy is most often given in cycles. These cycles may last 1 day, several days, or a few weeks or more. There will usually be a rest period when no chemotherapy is given between each cycle. A rest period may last for days, weeks, or months."}

There will usually be a rest period when no chemotherapy is given between each cycle. A rest period may last for days, weeks, or months. This allows the body and blood counts to recover before the next dose.\nOften, chemotherapy is given at a special clinic or at the hospital.\nDIFFERENT TYPES OF CHEMOTHERAPY\nThe\ndifferent types of chemotherapy\ninclude:\nStandard chemotherapy, which works by killing cancer cells and some normal cells.\nTargeted therapy\n, which targets a specific part of cancer cells.\nImmunotherapy\n, which uses the immune system to attack cancer cells.\nSIDE EFFECTS OF CHEMOTHERAPY\nBecause these medicines travel through the blood to the entire body, chemotherapy is described as a bodywide treatment.\nAs a result, chemotherapy may damage or kill some normal cells. These include bone marrow cells, hair follicles, and cells in the lining of the mouth and the digestive tract.\nWhen this damage occurs, there can be side effects."}

Each person reacts differently to these drugs. Some newer chemotherapy drugs that better target cancer cells may cause fewer or different side effects.\nYour health care provider will explain what you can do\nat home\nto prevent or treat side effects."}
