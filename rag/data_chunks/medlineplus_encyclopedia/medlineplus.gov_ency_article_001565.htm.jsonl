This condition does not have a known cause.\nThis syndrome has occurred in children who were given aspirin when they had chickenpox or the flu. Reye syndrome has become very rare. This is because aspirin is no longer recommended for routine use in children.\nCauses\nThere is no known cause of Reye syndrome. It is most often seen in children ages 4 to 12. Most cases that occur with chickenpox are in children ages 5 to 9. Cases that occur with the flu are most often in children ages 10 to 14.\nSymptoms\nChildren with Reye syndrome get sick very suddenly. The syndrome often begins with vomiting. It may last for many hours. The vomiting is quickly followed by irritable and aggressive behavior. As the condition gets worse, the child may be unable to stay awake and alert.\nOther symptoms of Reye syndrome:\nConfusion\nLethargy\nLoss of consciousness or coma\nMental changes\nNausea and vomiting\nSeizures\nUnusual placement of arms and legs (\ndecerebrate posture\n)."}
