The appendix is a small pouch attached to the end of the large intestine.\nCauses\nAppendicitis is a very common reason for emergency surgery. The problem most often occurs when the appendix becomes blocked by feces, a foreign object, a\ntumor\nor a parasite in rare cases.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms of appendicitis can vary. It can be hard to detect appendicitis in young children, older people, and women of childbearing age.\nThe first symptom is often pain around the belly button or mid upper abdomen. Pain may be minor at first, but becomes more sharp and severe. You may also have a loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and a low-grade fever.\nThe pain tends to move into the right lower part of your belly. The pain tends to focus at a spot directly above the appendix called\nMcBurney point\n. This most often occurs 12 to 24 hours after the illness starts.\nYour pain may be worse when you walk, cough, or make sudden movements."}

Later symptoms include:\nChills and shaking\nHard stools\nDiarrhea\nFever\nNausea and vomiting\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider may suspect appendicitis based on the symptoms you describe.\nYour provider will do a physical exam.\nIf you have appendicitis, your pain will increase when your lower right belly area is pressed.\nIf your appendix has ruptured, touching the belly area may cause a lot of pain and lead you to tighten your muscles.\nA rectal exam may find tenderness on the right side of your rectum.\nA blood test will often show a high white blood cell count. Imaging tests that may help diagnose appendicitis include:\nCT scan of the abdomen\nUltrasound of the abdomen\nTreatment\nMost of the time, a surgeon will\nremove your appendix\nas soon as you are diagnosed.\nIf a CT scan shows that you have an\nabscess\n, you may be treated with antibiotics first."}

You will have your appendix removed after the infection and swelling have gone away.\nThe tests used to diagnose appendicitis are not perfect. As a result, the operation may show that your appendix is normal. In that case, the surgeon will remove your appendix and explore the rest of your abdomen for other causes of your pain.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people recover quickly after surgery if the appendix is removed before it ruptures.\nIf your appendix ruptures before surgery, recovery may take longer. You are also more likely to develop problems, such as:\nAn abscess\nBlockage of the intestine\nInfection inside the abdomen (peritonitis)\nInfection of the wound after surgery\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have\npain\nin the lower-right portion of your belly, or other symptoms of appendicitis.\nImages\nAnatomical landmarks adult - front view\nDigestive system\nAppendectomy  - series\nAppendicitis\nReferences\nCarlberg DJ, Himelfarb NT.
