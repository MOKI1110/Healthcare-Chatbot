The medical term is tinea cruris or ringworm of the groin.\nCauses\nJock itch occurs when a type of fungus grows and spreads in the groin area.\nJock itch occurs mostly in adult men and teenage boys. Some people who have this infection also have\nathlete's foot\nor another kind of\nringworm\n. The fungus that causes jock itch thrives in warm, moist areas.\nJock itch can be triggered by friction from clothes and prolonged moistness in the groin area, such as from sweating. A fungal infection of the feet can spread to the groin area by pulling up pants if the waistband gets contaminated with fungus from the feet.\nJock itch can be passed from one person to another by direct skin-to-skin contact or contact with unwashed clothing.\nSymptoms\nJock itch usually stays around the creases of the upper thigh and does not involve the scrotum or penis. Jock itch may spread to near the anus, causing anal itching and discomfort. Symptoms include:\nRed, raised, scaly patches that may blister and ooze."}
