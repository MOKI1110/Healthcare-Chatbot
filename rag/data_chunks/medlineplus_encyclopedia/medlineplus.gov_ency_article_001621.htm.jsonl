These glands have tiny openings to release oils onto the surface of the cornea.\nCauses\nAny condition that increases the oily secretions of the meibomian glands will allow excess oils to  build up  on the edges of the eyelids. This allows for  the excess growth of bacteria that are normally present on the skin.\nThese problems can be caused by allergies,  hormone changes  during adolescence, or skin conditions such as\nrosacea\nand acne.\nMeibomianitis is often associated with\nblepharitis\n, which can cause  a buildup of a  dandruff-like substance at the base of the eyelashes.\nIn some people with meibomianitis, the glands will be plugged so that there is less oil being made for the normal tear film."}

Special tests are not required.\nTreatment\nStandard treatment involves:\nCarefully cleansing the edges of the lids\nApplying moist heat to the affected eye\nThese treatments will usually reduce symptoms in most cases.\nYour health care provider may prescribe an antibiotic ointment to apply to the lid's edge.\nOther treatments may include:\nHaving an eye doctor perform meibomian gland expression to help clear the glands of secretions.\nInserting a small tube (cannula) into each gland opening to wash out thickened oil.\nTaking a tetracycline antibiotic for several weeks.\nUsing LipiFlow, a device that automatically warms the eyelid and helps clear the glands.\nTaking fish oil to improve the flow of oil from t"}

This may be particularly useful in people who have rosacea.\nYou may also need treatment for general skin conditions such as acne or rosacea.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMeibomianitis is not a vision-threatening condition. However, it may be a long-term (chronic) and recurring cause of eye irritation. Many people find the treatments frustrating because results are not often immediate. Treatment, however, will often help reduce symptoms.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if treatment does not lead to improvement or if styes develop.\nPrevention\nKeeping your eyelids clean  and treating associated skin conditions will help prevent meibomianitis.\nAlternative Names\nMeibomian gland dysfunction\nImages\nEye anatomy\nReferences\nFoulks GN, Lemp MA.
