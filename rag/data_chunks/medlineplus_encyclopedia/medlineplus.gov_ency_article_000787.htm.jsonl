The condition can also cause tumors to grow in the brain. These tumors have a tuber or root-shaped appearance.\nCauses\nTuberous sclerosis is a genetic condition. Changes (non-working gene variants or mutations) in one of two genes,\nTSC1\nand\nTSC2\n, are responsible for most cases.\nOnly one parent needs to pass on the non-working gene for the child to get the disease. However, two-thirds of cases are due to new gene changes. In most cases, there is no family history of tuberous sclerosis.\nThis condition is one of a group of diseases called neurocutaneous syndromes. Both the skin and\ncentral nervous system\n(brain and spinal cord) are involved.\nThere are no known risk factors, other than having a parent with tuberous sclerosis."}

Both the skin and\ncentral nervous system\n(brain and spinal cord) are involved.\nThere are no known risk factors, other than having a parent with tuberous sclerosis. In that case, each child has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease.\nSymptoms\nSkin symptoms include:\nAreas of the skin that are white (due to decreased pigment) and have either an ash leaf or confetti appearance\nRed patches on the face containing many blood vessels (facial angiofibromas)\nRaised patches of skin with an orange-peel texture (shagreen spots), often on the back\nBrain symptoms include:\nAutism\nspectrum disorders\nDevelopmental delays\nIntellectual disability\nSeizures\nOther symptoms include:\nPitted tooth enamel.\nRough growths under or around the fingernails and toenails.\nRubbery noncancerous tumors on or around the tongue.\nLung disease known as LAM (lymphangioleiomyomatosis). This is more common in women. In many cases, there are no symptoms. In other people, this can lead to shortness of breath, coughing blood, and lung collapse.\nA benign cardiac tumor known as a cardiac rhabdomyoma."}

This is common in children with tuberous sclerosis and can be seen on ultrasound before a baby is born.\nThe symptoms vary from person to person. Some people have normal intelligence and no seizures. Others have intellectual disabilities or difficult-to-control seizures.\nExams and Tests\nSigns may include:\nAbnormal heart rhythm (\narrhythmia\n)\nCalcium deposits in the brain\nNoncancerous tumors in the brain\nRubbery growths on the tongue or gums\nTumor-like growth (hamartoma) on the retina, pale patches in the eye\nTumors\nin the kidneys\nTests may include:\nCT scan of the head\nChest CT\nEchocardiogram\n(ultrasound of the heart)\nMRI of the head\nUltrasound of the kidney\nUltraviolet light examination of the skin\nDNA testing for the two genes that can cause this disease (\nTSC1\nor\nTSC2\n) is available.\nRegular ultrasound checks of the kidneys are important to make sure there is no tumor growth.\nTreatment\nThere is no known cure for tuberous sclerosis."}

Because the disease can differ from person to person, treatment is based on the symptoms.\nDepending on the severity of the intellectual disability, the child may need special education.\nSome seizures are controlled with medicine (vigabatrin is first line for infantile spasms). Other children may need surgery.\nSmall growths on the face (facial angiofibromas) may be removed by laser treatment. These growths tend to come back, and repeat treatments will be needed.\nCardiac rhabdomyomas commonly disappear after puberty. Surgery to remove them is usually not needed.\nBrain tumors can be treated with medicines called mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus, everolimus).\nKidney tumors are treated with surgery, or by reducing the blood supply using special x-ray techniques."}

However, children with severe intellectual disability or uncontrollable seizures often need lifelong assistance.\nSometimes when a child is born with severe tuberous sclerosis, one of the parents is found to have had a mild case of tuberous sclerosis that was not diagnosed.\nThe tumors in this disease tend to be noncancerous (benign)."}

Tuberous sclerosis is the leading cause of this tumor.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling is recommended for couples who have a personal or family history of tuberous sclerosis and who want to have children.\nPrenatal diagnosis is available for families with a known gene variant or history of this condition.
