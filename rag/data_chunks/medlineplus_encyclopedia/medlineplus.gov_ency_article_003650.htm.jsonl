Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFibrinogen blood test\nFibrinogen blood test\nFibrinogen is a protein produced by the liver. This protein helps stop bleeding by helping blood clots to form. A blood test can be done to tell how much fibrinogen you have in the blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nsample of blood\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour health care provider may order this test if you have problems with blood clotting, such as excessive bleeding.\nNormal Results\nThe normal range is 200 to 400 mg/dL (2.0 to 4.0 g/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens."}

Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be due to:\nThe body using up too much fibrinogen, such as in\ndisseminated intravascular coagulation\n(DIC)\nFibrinogen deficiency (from birth, or acquired after birth)\nBreakdown of fibrin (\nfibrinolysis\n)\nToo much bleeding (hemorrhage)\nCertain conditions such as an infection or inflammation\nThe test may also be performed during pregnancy if the placenta separates from its attachment to the uterus wall (\nplacenta abruption\n).\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other."}

The risk for excessive bleeding is slightly greater in such people than it is for those who do not have bleeding problems.\nAlternative Names\nSerum fibrinogen; Plasma fibrinogen; Factor I; Hypofibrinogenemia test\nReferences\nGailani D, Benjamin FT, Wheeler AP.
