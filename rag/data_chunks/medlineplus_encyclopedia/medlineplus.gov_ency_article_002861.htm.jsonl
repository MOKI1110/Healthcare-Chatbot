It is very addictive and known for causing significant withdrawal symptoms. It has been illegal in the United States since 1924. It is in the class of drugs known as\nopioids\n.\nThis article discusses heroin overdose. An overdose occurs when someone takes too much of a substance, usually a drug. This can happen by accident or on purpose. A heroin\noverdose\nmay cause serious, harmful symptoms, or even death.\nAbout heroin overdose:\nHeroin overdoses in the United States rose sharply from 2006 to 2015, but since 2016 the number of deaths has trended down. There were 9,173 heroin-related deaths reported in 2021. In the United States, heroin is sold illegally, so there is no control over the quality or strength of the drug. Also, it is sometimes mixed with other poisonous or dangerous substances, such as fentanyl.\nMost people who died from an overdose in the United States from 1999 to 2019 were aged 35 to 54."}

Many people who use heroin also abuse prescription pain medicines and other drugs. They may also abuse alcohol. These combinations of substances can be very dangerous.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose.

Sometimes, the substances heroin is mixed with are also poisonous.\nWhere Found\nHeroin is made from morphine. Morphine is a strong drug that is found in the seedpods of opium poppy plants. These plants are grown around the world. Pain medicines that contain morphine are called opioids. Opioid is a term derived from\nopium\n, which was the Greek word for the juice of the poppy plant."}
