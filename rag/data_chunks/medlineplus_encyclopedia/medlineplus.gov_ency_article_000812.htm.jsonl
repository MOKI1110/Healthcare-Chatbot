Both genes and environment play a role. If both your parents have allergies, there is a good chance that you could also have allergies.\nThe immune system normally protects the body against harmful substances, such as bacteria and viruses. The immune system can also react to foreign substances called\nallergens\n. These allergens are usually harmless, and in most people do not cause a problem.\nIn a person with allergies, the immune response is oversensitive. When it recognizes an allergen, the immune system launches a response. Chemicals such as histamines are released. These chemicals cause allergy symptoms.\nWatch this video about:\nAllergies\nCommon allergens include:\nDrugs\nDust\nFood\nInsect venom\nMold\nPet and other animal dander\nPollen\nSome people have allergy-like reactions to hot or cold temperatures, sunlight, or other environmental triggers."}

Sometimes, friction (rubbing or roughly stroking the skin) will cause symptoms.\nAllergies may make certain medical conditions, such as sinus problems,\neczema\n, and\nasthma\n, worse.\nSymptoms\nMostly, the part of the body the allergen touches determines what symptoms you develop. For example:\nAllergens that you breathe in\noften cause a stuffy nose, itchy nose and throat, mucus, cough, and\nwheezing\n.\nAllergens that touch the eyes\nmay cause itchy, watery, red, swollen eyes.\nAllergens that touch the skin can cause a\nskin rash\n,\nhives\n, itching, blisters, or skin peeling.\nMedicine allergies\nand food allergies may involve the whole body and can lead to a variety of symptoms.\nAt times, an allergy can trigger a response that involves the entire body.\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions, such as when the allergy symptoms occur.\nAllergy testing may be needed to find out whether the symptoms are an actual allergy or are caused by other problems."}

For example, eating contaminated food (\nfood poisoning\n) may cause symptoms similar to food allergies. Some medicines (such as aspirin and ampicillin) can produce non-allergic reactions, including rashes. A runny nose or cough may actually be due to an infection.\nSkin testing\nis the most common method of allergy testing:\nThe prick test involves placing a small amount of the suspected allergy-causing substances on the skin, and then slightly pricking the area so the substance goes under the skin. The skin is closely watched for signs of a reaction, which include swelling and redness.\nThe intradermal test involves injecting a tiny amount of allergen under your skin, then watching the skin for a reaction.\nBoth the prick and intradermal tests are read 15 minutes after application of the test.\nThe patch test involves placing a patch with the suspected allergen on your skin. The skin is then closely watched for signs of a reaction. This test is used to determine contact allergy."}

This is called \"use or elimination testing.\" This is often used to check for food or medicine allergies.\nTreatment\nSevere allergic reactions (\nanaphylaxis\n) need to be treated with a medicine called epinephrine. It can be life-saving when given right away. If you use epinephrine, call 911 or the local emergency number and go straight to the hospital.\nThe best way to reduce symptoms is to avoid what causes your allergies."}

This is especially important for food and medicine allergies.\nThere are several types of medicines to prevent and treat allergies. Which medicine your provider recommends depends on the type and severity of your symptoms, your age, and overall health.\nIllnesses that are caused by allergies (such as asthma, hay fever, and eczema) may need other treatments.\nMedicines that can be used to treat allergies include:\nANTIHISTAMINES\nAntihistamines are available over-the-counter and by prescription. They are available in many forms, including:\nCapsules and pills\nEye drops\nInjection\nLiquid\nNasal spray\nCORTICOSTEROIDS\nThese are anti-inflammatory medicines.

Do not use decongestant nasal spray for more than several days because they can cause a rebound effect and make the congestion worse. Decongestants in pill form do not cause this problem. People with high blood pressure, heart problems, or prostate enlargement should use decongestants with caution.\nOTHER MEDICINES\nLeukotriene inhibitors are medicines that block the substances that trigger allergies. People with asthma and indoor and outdoor allergies may be prescribed these medicines.\nALLERGY SHOTS\nAllergy shots (\nimmunotherapy\n) are sometimes recommended if you cannot avoid the allergen and your symptoms are hard to control. Allergy shots keep your body from over-reacting to the allergen. You will get regular injections of the allergen. Each dose is slightly larger than the last dose until a maximum dose is reached. Allergy shots are only used for environmental allergies (pollens, pet dander, dust) or venom allergies."}

These shots do not work for everybody and you will have to visit the provider often.\nSUBLINGUAL IMMUNOTHERAPY TREATMENT (SLIT)\nInstead of shots, medicine put under the tongue may help for grass, ragweed, and dust mite allergies.\nORAL IMMUNOTHERAPY (OIT)\nFor people with peanut allergy, oral immunotherapy may be an option. This treatment involves eating tiny amounts of peanut powder and slowly increasing the dose over time until they are eating the equivalent of about 1 peanut every day. OIT is a treatment rather than a cure of food allergy and there is a risk of allergic reaction with the dosing of the peanut powder. This requires a significant commitment of time for visits to the provider and dosing at home.\nXOLAIR:\nXolair (omalizumab) is a medication that was recently approved for the treatment of food allergies. Xolair does not cure food allergies but can decrease a person's likelihood of reacting to a tiny amount of their food allergen."}

People can be allergic to Xolair and there may be an increased risk of certain cancers or heart issues in people taking Xolair. Talk to your provider about Xolair if you have food allergies.\nSupport Groups\nAsk your provider if there are any\nasthma and allergy support groups\nin your area.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost allergies can be easily treated with medicine.\nSome children may outgrow an allergy, especially food allergies. But once a substance has triggered an allergic reaction, it usually continues to affect the person.\nAllergy shots are most effective when used to treat hay fever and insect sting allergies. They are not used to treat food allergies because of the danger of a severe reaction.\nAllergy shots may need years of treatment, but they work in most cases."}

Speak with your provider about different food allergy treatments available.\nPossible Complications\nComplications that may result from allergies or their treatment include:\nAnaphylaxis\n(life-threatening allergic reaction)\nBreathing problems and discomfort during the allergic reaction\nDrowsiness and other side effects of medicines\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider for an appointment if:\nSevere symptoms of allergy occur\nTreatment for allergies no longer works\nPrevention\nBreastfeeding may help prevent certain food allergies when you feed babies this way only for 4 to 6 months."}

If a parent, brother, sister, or other family member has a history of eczema and allergies, discuss feeding with your child's doctor.  Infants with eczema or food allergy often benefit from early introduction (before 12 months of life) of peanuts and/or eggs. Discuss with your child's provider if this is something that you should do.\nThere is also evidence that being exposed to certain allergens (such as dust mites and cat dander) in the first year of life may prevent some allergies. This is called the \"hygiene hypothesis.\" It came from the observation that infants on farms tend to have fewer allergies than those who grow up in more sterile environments."}
