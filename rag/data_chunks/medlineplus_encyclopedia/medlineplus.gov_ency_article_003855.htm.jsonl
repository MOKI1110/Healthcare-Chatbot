They also determine the acidity (pH) of your blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nUsually, blood is taken from an artery. In some cases, blood from a vein may be used (venous blood gas).\nMost commonly, blood may be collected from one of the following arteries:\nRadial artery in the wrist\nFemoral artery in the groin\nBrachial artery in the arm\nYour health care provider may test circulation to the hand before taking a sample of blood from the wrist area.\nYour provider inserts a small needle through the skin into the artery. The sample is quickly sent to a lab for analysis.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no special preparation. If you are on oxygen therapy, the oxygen concentration must remain constant for 20 minutes before the test.\nTell your provider if you are taking any blood-thinning medicines (anticoagulants), including aspirin.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away. Pain and discomfort tend to be worse than drawing blood from a vein.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is used to evaluate respiratory diseases and conditions that affect the lungs. It helps determine the effectiveness of oxygen therapy or\nnon-invasive ventilation\n(BiPAP). The test also provides information about the body's acid/base balance, which can reveal important clues about lung and kidney function and the body's general\nmetabolic state\n.\nNormal Results\nValues at sea level:\nPartial pressure of oxygen (PaO2): 75 to 100 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), or 10.0 to 13.3 kilopascal (kPa)\nPartial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2): 38 to 42 mm Hg (5.1 to 5.6 kPa)\nArterial blood pH: 7.38 to 7.42\nOxygen saturation (SaO2): 94% to 100%\nBicarbonate (HCO3): 22 to 28 millimole per liter (mol/L)\nAt altitudes of 3,000 feet (900 meters) and higher, the oxygen value is lower.\nNor"}

Some labs include different measurements. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be due to lung, kidney, metabolic diseases, or medicines. Head or neck injuries or other injuries that affect breathing can also lead to abnormal results.\nRisks\nThere is little risk when the procedure is done correctly. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
