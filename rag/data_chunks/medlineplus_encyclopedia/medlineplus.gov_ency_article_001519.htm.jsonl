Pain may be severe with bowel movements, coughing and sitting.\nOther symptoms may include:\nConstipation\nDischarge of pus from the rectum or in the area of the anus\nFatigue,\nfever\n, night sweats, and chills\nRedness, painful and hardened tissue in the area of the anus\nTenderness\nIn infants, the abscess often appears as a swollen, red, tender lump at the edge of the anus. The infant may be fussy and irritable from discomfort. There are usually no other symptoms.\nExams and Tests\nrectal examination\nmay confirm an anorectal abscess. A\nproctosigmoidoscopy\nmay be done to check for other diseases.\nIn some cases, a\nCT scan\n,\nMRI\n, or\nultrasound\nis needed to help locate the collection of pus.\nTreatment\nThe problem rarely goes away on its own. Antibiotics alone usually cannot treat an abscess.\nTreatment involves surgery to open and drain the abscess.\nSurgery is usually done with local numbing medicine, along with\nmedicine to make you sleepy\n."}

Sometimes,\nspinal or general anesthesia\nis used.\nSurgery is most often an outpatient procedure, which means that you go home on the same day. The surgeon cuts open the abscess and drains the pus. Sometimes a drain is put in to keep the incision open and draining, and sometimes the abscess cavity is packed with gauze.\nIf the pus collection is deep, you may need to stay in the hospital longer for pain control and nursing care of the abscess drainage site.\nAfter surgery, you may need warm\nsitz baths\n(sitting in a tub of warm water). This helps relieve pain and reduce swelling.\nDrained abscesses are usually left open and no stitches are needed.\nThe surgeon may prescribe painkillers and antibiotics.\nAvoiding constipation will help decrease pain. You may need stool softeners. Drinking fluids and eating foods with lots of fiber can also help.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWith prompt treatment, people with this condition usually do well."}
