It is inserted into the uterus (womb) where it stays to prevent pregnancy.\nDescription\nAn IUD is often inserted by your health care provider during your monthly period. Any type of IUD can be inserted quickly and easily in the provider's office or clinic. Before placing the IUD, the provider washes the cervix with an antiseptic solution. After this, the provider:\nSlides a plastic tube containing the IUD through the vagina and into the uterus.\nPushes the IUD into the uterus with the help of a plunger.\nRemoves the tube, leaving two small strings that dangle outside the cervix within the vagina.\nThe strings have two purposes:\nThey let the provider or woman check that the IUD stays properly in position.\nThey are used to pull the IUD out of the uterus when it is time to remove it. This should only be done by a provider.\nThis procedure can cause discomfort and pain, but not all women have the same side effects."}

This should only be done by a provider.\nThis procedure can cause discomfort and pain, but not all women have the same side effects. During insertion, you may feel:\nLittle pain and some discomfort\nCramping and pain\nDizzy or lightheaded\nSome women have cramps and backaches for 1 to 2 days after insertion. Other may have cramps and backaches for weeks or months. Over-the-counter pain medicines can ease the discomfort.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nIUDs are an excellent choice if you want:\nA long-term and effective birth control method\nTo avoid risks and side effects of contraceptive hormones\nBut you should learn more about IUDs when deciding if you want to get an IUD.\nAn IUD can prevent pregnancy for 3 to 10 years. Exactly how long the IUD will prevent pregnancy depends on the type of IUD you are using.\nIUDs can also be used as an emergency contraception. It must be inserted within 5 days of having unprotected sex.\nA newer type of IUD releases a low dose of a hormone into the uterus each day for a period of 3 to 8 years. This increases the effectiveness of the device as a birth control method."}

This increases the effectiveness of the device as a birth control method. It also has the added benefits of reducing or stopping menstrual flow. It may help protect against cancer (\nendometrial cancer\n) in women who are at risk for developing the disease.\nRisks\nWhile uncommon, IUDs carry some risks, such as:\nThere is a small chance of getting pregnant while using an IUD. If you do get pregnant, your provider can remove the IUD to lower the risk for miscarriage or other problems.\nA higher risk of an\nectopic pregnancy\n, but only if you do get pregnant while using an IUD. An ectopic pregnancy is one that occurs outside the womb. It can be serious, even life threatening.\nAn IUD may penetrate the uterine wall and require surgery to remove.\nBefore the Procedure\nTalk with your provider about whether an IUD is a good choice for you."}

If you are sensitive to pain in your vagina or cervix, ask for a local anesthetic to be applied before the procedure starts.\nAfter the Procedure\nYou may want to have someone drive you home after the procedure. Some women have mild cramping, low backache, and spotting for a couple of days.\nIf you have a progestin-releasing IUD, it takes about 7 days for it to start to work. You do not need to wait to have sex."}

But you should use a backup form of birth control, such as a condom, for the first week.\nYour provider will want to see you 2 to 4 weeks after the procedure to be sure the IUD is still in place. Ask your provider to show you how to check that the IUD is still in place, and how often you should check it.\nIn rare cases, an IUD can slip partly or all of the way out of your uterus. This is generally seen after pregnancy. If this happens, contact your provider right away.
