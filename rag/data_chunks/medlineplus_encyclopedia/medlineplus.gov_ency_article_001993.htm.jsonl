Many women feel that doing this is important to their health.\nHowever, experts do not agree about the benefits of breast self-exams in finding\nbreast cancer\nor saving lives. Talk to your health care provider about whether breast self-exams are right for you.\nInformation\nThe best time to do a monthly breast self-exam is about 3 to 5 days after your period starts. Do it at the same time every month. Your breasts are not as tender or lumpy at this time in your monthly cycle.\nIf you have gone through\nmenopause\n, do your exam on the same day every month.\nBegin by lying on your back. It is easier to examine all breast tissue if you are lying down.\nPlace your right hand behind your head. With the middle fingers of your left hand, gently yet firmly press down using small motions to examine the entire right breast.\nNext, sit or stand."}

Feel your armpit, because breast tissue goes into that area.\nGently squeeze the nipple, checking for discharge. Repeat the process on the left breast.\nUse one of the patterns shown in the diagram to make sure that you are covering all of the breast tissue.\nNext, stand in front of a mirror with your arms by your side.\nLook at your breasts directly and in the mirror. Look for changes in skin texture, such as dimpling, puckering, indentations, or skin that looks like an orange peel.\nAlso note the shape and outline of each breast.\nCheck to see if the nipple turns inward.\nDo the same with your arms raised above your head.\nYour goal is to get used to the feel of your breasts. This will help you to find anything new or different."}
