Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPregnancy test\nPregnancy test\nA pregnancy test measures a hormone in the body called\nhuman chorionic gonadotropin\n(HCG or hCG). HCG is a hormone produced during pregnancy. It appears in the blood and urine of pregnant women as early as 10 days after conception.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA pregnancy test is done using blood or urine. There are 2 types of blood tests:\nQualitative, which measures\nwhether\nthe HCG hormone is present\nQuantitative, which measures\nhow much\nHCG is present\nThe blood test is done by drawing a single tube of blood and sending it to a laboratory. You may wait anywhere from a few hours to more than a day to get the results.\nThe urine HCG test is most often performed by placing a drop of urine on a prepared chemical strip. It takes 1 to 2 minutes for a result.\nHow the Test will Feel\nFor the urine test, you urinate into a cup.\nFor the blood test, the provider uses a needle and syringe to draw blood from your vein into a tube."}

Any discomfort you might feel from the blood draw will only last a few seconds.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to:\nDetermine if you are pregnant\nDiagnose abnormal conditions that can raise HCG levels\nWatch the development of the pregnancy during the first 2 months (quantitative test only)\nNormal Results\nThe HCG level rises rapidly during the first trimester of pregnancy and then slightly declines.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThe HCG level should almost double every 48 hours in the beginning of a pregnancy. An HCG level that does not rise appropriately may indicate a problem with your pregnancy. Problems related to an abnormal rising HCG level include\nmiscarriage\nand\nectopic (tubal) pregnancy\n.\nAn extremely high level of HCG may suggest a molar pregnancy or more than one fetus, for example, twins.\nYour provider will discuss the meaning of your HCG level with you.\nConsiderations\nUrine pregnancy tests will only be positive when you have enough HCG in your blood."}

Most over-the-counter home pregnancy tests will not show that you are pregnant until your expected menstrual cycle is late. Testing before this will often give an inaccurate result. The HCG level is higher if your urine is more concentrated. A good time to test is when you first get up in the morning.\nIf you think you are pregnant, repeat the pregnancy test at home or at your provider's office.\nImages\nPregnancy test\nReferences\nJeelani R, Bluth MH.
