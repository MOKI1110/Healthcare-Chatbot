Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRetroperitoneal fibrosis\nRetroperitoneal fibrosis\nRetroperitoneal fibrosis is a rare disorder that blocks the tubes (ureters) that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder.\nCauses\nRetroperitoneal fibrosis occurs when extra fibrous tissue forms in the area behind the stomach and intestines. The tissue forms a mass (or masses) or tough fibrotic tissue. It can block the tubes that carry urine from the kidney to the bladder.\nThe cause of this problem is mostly unknown. It is most common in people aged 40 to 60."}

Some  health care providers  also prescribe a medicine called tamoxifen.\nIf corticosteroid treatment does not work, a biopsy should be done to confirm the diagnosis. Other medicines to suppress the immune system can be prescribed.\nWhen medicine does not work, surgery and\nstents\n(draining tubes) are needed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook will depend on the extent of the problem and the amount of damage to the kidneys.\nThe\nkidney damage\nmay be temporary or permanent.\nPossible Complications\nThe disorder may lead to:\nOngoing blockage of the tubes leading from the kidney on one or both sides\nChronic kidney disease or failure\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have lower abdomen or flank pain and less output of urine.\nPrevention\nTry to avoid long-term use of medicines that contain methysergide, ergot alkaloids, or dopamine agonists."}
