It is the most common form of inherited\nintellectual disability\nin boys.\nCauses\nFragile X syndrome is caused by a change in a gene called\nFMR1\n. A small part of the gene code is repeated several times in one area of the X chromosome. The more repeats (also called gene expansion), the more likely the condition will occur.\nThe\nFMR1\ngene makes a protein needed for your brain to function properly. A defect in the gene makes your body produce too little of the protein, or none at all.\nBoys and girls can both be affected, but because boys have only one X chromosome, a single fragile X expansion is likely to affect them more severely."}

You can have fragile X syndrome even if your parents do not have it.\nA family history of fragile X syndrome, developmental problems, or intellectual disability may not be present.\nSymptoms\nBehavior problems associated with fragile X syndrome include:\nAutism spectrum disorder\nDelay in crawling, walking, or twisting\nHand flapping or hand biting\nHyperactive or impulsive behavior\nIntellectual disability\nSpeech and language delay\nTendency to avoid eye contact\nPhysical signs may include:\nFlat feet\nFlexible joints and low muscle tone\nLarge body size\nLarge forehead or ears with a prominent jaw\nLong face\nSoft skin\nSome of these problems are present at birth, while others may not develop until after puberty.\nFamily members who have fewer repeats in the\nFMR1\ngene may not have intellectual disability. Women may have premature\nmenopause\nor difficulty becoming pregnant."}

Women may have premature\nmenopause\nor difficulty becoming pregnant. Both men and women may have problems with tremors and poor coordination.\nExams and Tests\nThere are very few outward signs of fragile X syndrome in babies. Some things that your health care provider may look for include:\nLarge head circumference in babies\nIntellectual disability\nLarge testicles after the start of puberty\nSubtle differences in face features\nIn females, excess shyness may be the only sign of the disorder.\nGenetic testing can diagnose this disease.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for fragile X syndrome. Instead, training and education have been developed to help affected children function at the highest possible level."}
