This is  the back part of the inner eye that sends sight information to the brain. The fluid leaks from the blood vessel layer under the retina. This layer is called the choroid.\nCauses\nThe cause of this condition is unknown.\nMen are affected more often than women, and the condition is most common at around age 45. However, anyone can be affected.\nStress appears to be a risk factor."}

However, anyone can be affected.\nStress appears to be a risk factor. Early studies found that people with aggressive, \"type A\" personalities who are under a lot of stress may be more likely to develop central serous choroidopathy.\nThis condition can also occur as a complication of steroid drug use.\nIt has recently been reported after vaccination for COVID-19, although cause and effect could not be proven.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nDim and blurred blind spot in the center of vision\nDistortion of straight lines with the affected eye\nObjects appearing smaller or farther away with the affected eye\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can most often diagnose central serous choroidopathy by dilating the eye and performing an eye exam.\nFluorescein angiography\nconfirms the diagnosis.\nThis condition may also be diagnosed with a noninvasive test called ocular coherence tomography (OCT).\nTreatment\nMost cases clear up without treatment in 1 to 2 months."}

Laser treatment or photodynamic therapy to seal the leak may help restore vision in people with more severe leakage and vision loss, or in those who have had the disease for a long time.\nPeople who are using steroid medicines (for example, to treat autoimmune diseases) should stop using these medicines, if possible. Do not stop taking these medicines without first talking to your provider.\nTreatment with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) eye drops may also help.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people recover good vision without treatment. However, vision is often not as good as it was before the condition occurred.\nThe disease returns in about one half of all people. Even when the disease returns, it has a good outlook. Rarely, people develop permanent scars that damage their central vision.\nPossible Complications\nA small number of people will have complications from laser treatment that impair their central vision."}

That is why most people will be allowed to recover without treatment, if possible.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your vision gets worse.\nPrevention\nThere is no known prevention. Although there is a clear association with stress, there is no evidence that reducing stress can help prevent or treat central serous choroidopathy.\nAlternative Names\nCentral serous retinopathy; Central serous chorioretinopathy\nImages\nRetina\nReferences\nFowler N, Mendez Martinez NR, Pallares BV, Maldonado RS.
