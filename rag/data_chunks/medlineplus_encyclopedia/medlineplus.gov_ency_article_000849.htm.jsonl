It occurs where the skin has healed after an injury.\nCauses\nKeloids can form after skin injuries from:\nAcne\nBurns\nChickenpox\nEar or body piercing\nMinor scratches\nCuts from surgery or trauma\nVaccination sites\nKeloids are most common in people younger than 30. Black people, Asians, and Hispanics are more prone to developing keloids. Keloids often run in families. Sometimes, a person may not recall what injury caused a keloid to form.\nSymptoms\nA keloid may be:\nFlesh-colored, red, or pink\nLocated over the site of a wound or injury\nLumpy or ridged\nTender and itchy\nIrritated from friction such as rubbing on clothing\nA keloid will tan darker than the skin around it if exposed to the sun during the first year after it forms. The darker color may not go away.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will look at your skin to see if you have a keloid. A\nskin biopsy\nmay be done to check for other types of skin growths (\ntumors\n).\nTreatment\nKeloids often do not need treatment."}
