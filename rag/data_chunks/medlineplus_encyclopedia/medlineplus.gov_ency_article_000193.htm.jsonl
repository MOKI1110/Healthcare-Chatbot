These deposits make it hard for the heart to work properly.\nCauses\nAmyloidosis\nis a group of diseases in which clumps of proteins called amyloid build up in body tissues. Over time, these proteins replace normal tissue, leading to failure of the involved organ. There are many forms of amyloidosis.\nCardiac amyloidosis (\"stiff heart syndrome\") occurs when amyloid deposits take the place of normal heart muscle. It is the most typical type of\nrestrictive cardiomyopathy\n. Cardiac amyloidosis may affect the way electrical signals move through the heart (conduction system). This can lead to abnormal heartbeats (\narrhythmias\n) and faulty heart signals (heart block).\nThe condition can be inherited. This is called familial cardiac amyloidosis. It can also develop as the result of another disease such as a type of bone and blood cancer, or as the result of another medical problem causing inflammation."}

It can also develop as the result of another disease such as a type of bone and blood cancer, or as the result of another medical problem causing inflammation. Cardiac amyloidosis is more common in men than in women. The disease is rare in people under age 40.\nSymptoms\nSome people may have no symptoms. When present, symptoms may include:\nExcessive urination at night\nFatigue, reduced exercise ability\nPalpitations (sensation of feeling heartbeat)\nShortness of breath with activity\nSwelling of the abdomen, legs, ankles, or other part of the body\nTrouble breathing while lying down\nExams and Tests\nThe signs of cardiac amyloidosis can be related to a number of different conditions."}

This can make the problem hard to diagnose.\nSigns may include:\nAbnormal sounds in the lung (lung crackles) or a heart murmur\nBlood pressure that is low or drops when you stand up\nEnlarged neck veins\nSwollen liver\nThe following tests may be done:\nBlood and urine protein tests\nChest or abdomen CT scan\n(considered the \"gold standard\" to help diagnose this condition)\nCoronary angiography\nEchocardiogram\nElectrocardiogram (ECG)\nMagnetic resonance imaging\n(MRI)\nNuclear heart scans\n(MUGA, RNV)\nPositron emission tomography (PET)\nAn ECG may show problems with the heartbeat or heart signals. It may also show low signals (called \"low voltage\").\ncardiac biopsy\nmay be used to confirm the diagnosis. A biopsy of another area, such as the abdomen, kidney, or bone marrow, is often done as well.\nTreatment\nYour health care provider may tell you to make changes to your diet, including limiting salt and fluids.\nYou may need to take water pills (diuretics) to help your body get rid of excess fluid."}

A weight gain of 3 or more pounds (1 kilogram or more) over 1 to 2 days can mean there is too much fluid in the body.\nMedicines including digoxin, calcium-channel blockers, and beta-blockers may be used in people with atrial fibrillation. However, the medicines must be used with caution, and the dosage must be carefully monitored. People with cardiac amyloidosis may be extra sensitive to side effects of these medicines.\nOther treatments may include:\nChemotherapy\nDrugs that target the abnormal protein (tafamidis)\nImplantable cardioverter-defibrillator (AICD)\nPacemaker, if there are problems with heart signals\nPrednisone, an anti-inflammatory medicine\nheart transplant\nmay be considered for people with some types of amyloidosis who have very poor heart function."}

However, the field is changing rapidly. Different types of amyloidosis can affect the heart in different ways. Some types are more severe than others. Many people can now expect to survive and experience a good quality of life for several years after diagnosis.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nAtrial fibrillation\nor ventricular arrhythmias\nCongestive heart failure\nFluid buildup in the abdomen (\nascites\n)\nIncreased sensitivity to digoxin\nLow blood pressure and dizziness from excessive urination (due to medicine)\nSick sinus syndrome\nSymptomatic\ncardiac conduction system disease (arrhythmias related to abnormal conduction of impulses through the heart muscle)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have this disorder and develop new symptoms such as:\nDizziness\nwhen you c"}
