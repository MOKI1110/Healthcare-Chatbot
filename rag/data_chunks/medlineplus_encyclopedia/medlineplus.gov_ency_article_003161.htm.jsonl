This is the name for the sac surrounding the testicles.\nConsiderations\nScrotal swelling can occur in males at any age. The swelling can be on one or both sides, and there may be pain. The testicles and penis may or may not be involved.\nIn\ntesticular torsion\n, the testicle becomes twisted in the\nscrotum\nand loses its blood supply. It is a serious emergency. If this twisting is not relieved quickly, the testicle may be permanently and completely damaged. This condition is extremely painful. Call 911 or the local emergency number, or see your health care provider immediately."}
