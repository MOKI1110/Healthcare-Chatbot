Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nDilated cardiomyopathy\nDilated cardiomyopathy\nCardiomyopathy is disease in which the heart muscle becomes weakened, stretched, or has another structural problem.\nDilated cardiomyopathy is a condition in which the heart muscle becomes weakened and enlarged. As a result, the heart cannot pump enough blood to the rest of the body.\nThere are many types of cardiomyopathy. Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common form, but it may be the result of different underlying conditions. Some health care providers use the term to indicate a specific condition, called idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy."}

There is no known cause for this type of dilated cardiomyopathy.\nCauses\nThe most common causes of dilated cardiomyopathy are:\nHeart disease caused by a narrowing or blockage in the coronary arteries\nPoorly controlled high blood pressure\nThere are many other causes of dilated cardiomyopathy, including:\nAlcohol or cocaine (or other illegal drug) use (usually heavy use for a prolonged time)\nDiabetes, thyroid disease, or hepatitis\nMedicines that can be toxic to the heart, such as certain medicines used to treat cancer\nAbnormal heart rhythms in which the heart beats very fast for a long period of time\nAutoimmune illnesses\nConditions that run in families\nInfections that involve the heart muscle\nHeart valves that are either too narrow or too leaky\nDuring the last month of pregnancy, or\nwithin 5 months after the baby is born\nExposure to heavy metals such as lead, arsenic, cobalt, or mercury\nThis condition can affect anyone at any age."}

However, sometimes symptoms start very suddenly and may be severe.\nCommon symptoms are:\nChest pain or pressure (more likely with exercise)\nCough\nFatigue, weakness, faintness\nIrregular or rapid pulse\nLoss of appetite\nShortness of breath\nwith activity or after lying down (or being asleep) for a while\nSwelling of feet\nand ankles\nExams and Tests\nDuring the exam, the provider may find:\nThe heart is enlarged.\nLung crackles (a sign of fluid buildup), heart murmur, or other abnormal sounds.\nThe liver is possibly enlarged.\nNeck veins may be bulging.\nA number of laboratory tests may be done to determine the cause:\nAntinuclear antibody\n(ANA),\nerythrocyte sedimentation rate\n(ESR), and other tests to diagnose autoimmune illnesses\nAntibody test to identify infections such as Lyme disease and HIV\nIron tests of the blood\nSerum\nTSH\nand\nT4\ntest to identify thyroid proble"}
