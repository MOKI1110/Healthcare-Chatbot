Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nUrethral stricture\nUrethral stricture\nUrethral stricture is an abnormal narrowing of the urethra. The urethra is the tube that carries urine out of the body from the bladder.\nCauses\nA urethral stricture may be caused by swelling or scar tissue from surgery. It can also occur after an infection or injury. Rarely, it may be caused by pressure from a growing tumor near the urethra.\nOther factors that increase the risk for this condition include:\nSexually transmitted infection (STI)\nProcedures that place a tube into the urethra (such as a catheter or\ncystoscope\n)\nBenign prostatic hyperplasia\n(BPH)\nInjury to the pelvic area\nRepeated\nurethritis\nStrictures that are present at birth (congenital) are rare."}

Topical numbing medicine will be applied to the area before the procedure. A thin instrument is inserted into the urethra to stretch it. You may be able to treat your stricture by learning to dilate the urethra at home.\nIf urethral dilation cannot correct the condition, you may need surgery. The type of surgery will depend on the location and length of the stricture. If the narrowed area is short and not near the muscles that control the exit from the bladder, the stricture may be cut or dilated. One procedure uses a drug-coated balloon, which is inserted and opened up to dilate the urethra and deliver the medicine to the area. After several minutes, the balloon is deflated and removed. The medicine helps the stricture remain open.\nA surgery called an open urethroplasty may be done for longer strictures. This surgery involves removing the diseased area. The urethra is then rebuilt."}

This surgery involves removing the diseased area. The urethra is then rebuilt. The results vary, depending on the size and location of the stricture, the number of treatments you have had, and the surgeon's experience.\nIn acute cases when you cannot pass urine, a\nsuprapubic catheter\nmay be placed. This is an emergency treatment. This allows the bladder to drain through the abdomen.\nThere are currently no drug treatments for this disease. If no other treatments work, a urinary diversion called an appendicovesicostomy (Mitrofanoff procedure) or another type of surgery may be done. This lets you drain your bladder through the wall of the abdomen using a catheter or a stoma bag.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome is often excellent with treatment. Sometimes, treatment needs to be repeated to remove scar tissue.\nA urethral stricture may totally block urine flow. This can cause sudden urinary retention. This condition must be treated quickly."}
