Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCPR - adult and child after onset of puberty\nCPR - adult and child after onset of puberty\nCPR stands for cardiopulmonary resuscitation. It is a lifesaving procedure that is done when someone's breathing or heartbeat has stopped. This may happen after an\nelectric shock\n, drowning, or heart attack. CPR involves:\nRescue breathing, which provides oxygen to a person's lungs.\nChest compressions, which keep the person's blood circulating.\nPermanent brain damage or death can occur in as little as 4 minutes if a person's blood flow stops. Therefore, you must continue CPR until the person's heartbeat and breathing return, or trained medical help arrives.\nFor the purposes of CPR, puberty is defined as breast development in females and the presence of axillary (armpit) hair in males.\nConsiderations\nCPR is best done by someone trained in an accredited CPR course. The procedures described here are not a substitute for CPR training."}

The procedures described here are not a substitute for CPR training. The newest techniques emphasize compression over rescue breathing and airway management, reversing a long-standing practice. See\ncpr.heart.org/en/course-catalog-search\nfor classes near you.\nTime is very important when an\nunconscious\nperson is not breathing. Permanent brain damage begins after only 4 minutes without oxygen, and death can occur as soon as 4 to 6 minutes later.\nMachines called automated external defibrillators (AEDs) can be found in many public places, and are available for home use. These machines have pads or paddles to place on the chest during a life-threatening emergency. They automatically check the heart rhythm and give a sudden shock if, and only if, that shock is needed to get the heart back into the right rhythm."}

Shake or tap the person gently. See if the person moves or makes a noise. Shout, \"Are you OK?\"\n2.\nCall 911 or the local emergency number if there is no response\n. Shout for help and send someone to call 911 or the local emergency number."}

If you are alone, call 911 or the local emergency number and retrieve an AED (if available), even if you have to leave the person.\n3.\nCarefully place the person on their back\n. If there is a chance the person has a spinal injury, two people should move the person to prevent the head and neck from twisting.\n4.\nPerform chest compressions\n:\nPlace the heel of one hand on the breastbone -- right between the nipples.\nPlace the heel of your other hand on top of the first hand.\nPosition your body directly over your hands.\nGive 30 chest compressions. These compressions should be fast and hard. Press down about 2 inches (5 centimeters) into the chest. Each time, let the chest rise completely. Count the 30 compressions quickly: \"1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,29,30, off\".\n5.\nOpen the airway\n. Lift up the chin with 2 fingers. At the same time, tilt the head by pushing down on the forehead with the other hand.\n6.\nLook, listen, and feel for breathing\n."}

Place your ear close to the person's mouth and nose. Watch for chest movement. Feel for breath on your cheek.\n7.\nIf the person is not breathing or has trouble breathing\n:\nCover their mouth tightly with your mouth.\nPinch the nose closed.\nKeep the chin lifted and head tilted.\nGive 2 rescue breaths. Each breath should take about a second and make the chest rise.\n8. Repeat chest compressions and rescue breathing until the person recovers or help arrives. If an AED for adults is available, use it as soon as possible. If opioid poisoning (overdose of medicines, fentanyl, or heroin) is suspected, and the person is not breathing, give Naloxone if available.\nIf the person starts breathing again, place them in the recovery position. To do this, start with the person lying on their back. Then, pull the arm closest to you so that it makes a right angle to their body with palm up. Fold their other arm and place it under their cheek closest to you. You'll have to hold it there."}

Their bent arm should be supporting the head, and their extended arm will stop you from rolling them too far. Make sure their bent leg is at a right angle. Keep checking for breathing until help arrives.\nDO NOT\nIf the person has normal breathing, coughing, or movement, do not begin chest compressions. Doing so may cause the heart to stop beating.\nUnless you are a health professional, do not check for a pulse. Only a health care professional is properly trained to check for a pulse.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIf you have help\n, tell one person to call 911 or the local emergency number while another person begins CPR.\nIf you are alone\n, as soon as you determine that the person is unresponsive, call 911 or the local emergency number immediately."}
