Coronary heart disease (CHD) is also called coronary artery disease.\nCauses\nCHD is the leading cause of death in the United States for men and women.\nCHD is caused by the buildup of plaque in the arteries to your heart. This may also be called\nhardening of the arteries\nor atherosclerosis.\nFatty material and other substances form a plaque buildup on the walls of your coronary arteries. The coronary arteries bring blood and oxygen to your heart.\nThis buildup causes the arteries to get narrow.\nAs a result, blood flow to the heart can slow down or stop.\nrisk factor for heart disease\nis something that increases your chance of getting it. You cannot change some risk factors for heart disease, but you can change others.\nSymptoms\nIn some cases, symptoms may be very noticeable. But, you can have the disease and not have any symptoms."}

You cannot change some risk factors for heart disease, but you can change others.\nSymptoms\nIn some cases, symptoms may be very noticeable. But, you can have the disease and not have any symptoms. This is more often true in the early stages of CHD.\nChest pain\nor discomfort (\nangina\n) is the most common symptom. You feel this pain when the heart is not getting enough blood or oxygen. The pain may feel different from person to person.\nIt may feel heavy or like someone is squeezing your heart. You may feel it under your breast bone (sternum). You may also feel it in your neck, arms, stomach, or upper back.\nThe pain most often occurs with activity or emotion. It goes away with rest or a medicine called nitroglycerin.\nOther symptoms can include shortness of breath and fatigue with activity (exertion), or even feeling lightheaded or passing out with exertion.\nSome people have symptoms other than chest pain, such as:\nFatigue\nShortness of breath\nGeneral weakness\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you."}

Follow your provider's directions closely to help prevent CHD from getting worse.\nGoals for treating these conditions in people who have CHD:\nThe most commonly used blood pressure target for people with heart disease is less than 130/80, but your provider may recommend a different blood pressure target.\nIf you have diabetes, your\nHbA1c\n(glycohemoglobin A1c) blood levels will be monitored and brought down to the level your provider recommends.\nYour LDL cholesterol level will be lowered with statin or other medicines.\nTreatment depends on your symptoms and how severe the disease is.
