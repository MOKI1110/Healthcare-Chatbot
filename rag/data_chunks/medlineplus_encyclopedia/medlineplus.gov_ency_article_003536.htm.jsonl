These are the bacteria that cause the disease\nbrucellosis\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample is needed\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere is no special preparation.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nBrucellosis is an infection that occurs from coming into contact with animals that carry Brucella bacteria.\nYour health care provider may order this test if you have signs or symptoms of brucellosis. People who often come in contact with animals or meat are most likely to get this disease. This includes:\nSlaughterhouse workers\nFarmers\nVeterinarians\nNormal Results\nA normal (negative) result usually means you have not come in contact with the bacteria that causes brucellosis."}

This includes:\nSlaughterhouse workers\nFarmers\nVeterinarians\nNormal Results\nA normal (negative) result usually means you have not come in contact with the bacteria that causes brucellosis. However, this test may not detect the disease at an early stage. Your provider may have you come back for another test in 10 days to 3 weeks.\nInfection with other bacteria, such as\nYersinia spp.\n,\nFrancisella spp.\n, and\nVibrio spp.\n, and certain immunizations can cause false-positive results.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal (positive) result usually means you have come in contact with the bacteria that causes brucellosis or a closely related bacteria.\nHowever, this positive result does not mean that you have an active infection. Your provider will have you repeat the test after a few weeks to see if the test result increases. This increase is more likely to be a sign of a current infection.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken."}
