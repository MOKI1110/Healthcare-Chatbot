This means they are not a cancer. You may have one or many polyps. They become more common with age. There are many types of polyps.\nAdenomatous polyps are a common type. They are gland-like growths that develop on the mucous membrane that lines the large intestine. They are also called adenomas and are most often one of the following:\nTubular polyp, which protrudes out in the lumen (open space) of the colon\nVillous adenoma, which is sometimes flat and spreading, and is more likely to become a cancer\nWhen adenomas become cancerous, they are known as adenocarcinomas. Adenocarcinomas are cancers that originate in glandular tissue cells."}

Adenocarcinoma is the most common type of colorectal cancer.\nOther types of polyps are:\nHyperplastic polyps, which rarely, if ever, develop into cancer\nSerrated polyps, which are less common, but may develop into cancer over time\nPolyps that are 1 centimeter (cm) or larger have a higher cancer risk than polyps smaller than 1 cm. Risk factors include:\nAge\nFamily history of colon cancer or polyps\nA type of polyp called villous adenoma\nA small number of people with polyps may also be linked to some inherited disorders, including:\nFamilial adenomatous polyposis (FAP)\nGardner syndrome (a type of FAP)\nJuvenile polyposis, a disease that causes many benign growths in the intestine, usually before 20 years old\nHereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), also called Lynch syndrome, a disease that raises the chance of many types of cancer, including in the intestine\nPeutz-Jeghers syndrome\n, a disease that causes intestinal polyps, usually in the small intestine and usually benign\nSymptoms"}

A large polyp in the rectum may be felt during a rectal exam.\nMost polyps are found with the following tests:\nBarium enema\n(rarely done)\nColonoscopy\nSigmoidoscopy\nStool test\nfor hidden (occult) blood\nVirtual colonoscopy\nStool DNA test\nFecal immunochemical test (FIT)\nTreatment\nColorectal polyps should be removed because some can develop into\ncancer\n.

This may reduce the chance of developing colon cancer, or at least help catch it in its most treatable stage.\nAll adults should begin one of these tests at age 45.\nTaking aspirin, naproxen, ibuprofen, or similar medicines may help reduce the risk for new polyps. Be aware that these medicines can have serious side effects if taken for a long time. Side effects include bleeding in the stomach or colon and heart disease."}
