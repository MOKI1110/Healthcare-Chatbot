Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBreast biopsy - stereotactic\nBreast biopsy - stereotactic\nA breast biopsy is the removal of breast tissue to examine it for signs of\nbreast cancer\nor other disorders.\nThere are several types of breast biopsies, including stereotactic,\nultrasound-guided\n, MRI-guided, and\nexcisional breast biopsy\n. This article focuses on stereotactic breast biopsy, which uses mammography to help pinpoint the spot in the breast that needs to be removed. This procedure is usually done by a radiologist or surgeon.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou are asked to undress from the waist up. During the biopsy, you are awake.\nYou will most likely be asked to lie facing down on the biopsy table. The breast that is being biopsied hangs through an opening in the table. The table is raised and your doctor performs the biopsy from underneath. In some cases, stereotactic breast biopsy is done while you sit in an upright position.\nThe biopsy is done in the following way:\nYour doctor first cleans the area on your breast."}

In some cases, stereotactic breast biopsy is done while you sit in an upright position.\nThe biopsy is done in the following way:\nYour doctor first cleans the area on your breast. Numbing medicine is injected.\nYour breast is pressed down to hold it in position during the procedure. You need to hold still while the biopsy is being done.\nYour doctor makes a very small cut on your breast over the area that needs to be biopsied.\nUsing a special machine, a needle or sheath is guided to the exact location of the abnormal area. Several samples of breast tissue are taken.\nA small metal clip may be placed into the breast in the biopsy area. The clip marks it for surgical biopsy later, if needed.\nThe biopsy itself is done using one of the following:\nHollow needle (called a core needle)\nVacuum-powered device\nBoth a needle and vacuum-powered device\nThe procedure usually takes about 1 hour. This includes the time it takes for the x-rays. The actual biopsy takes only several minutes.\nAfter the tissue sample has been taken, the needle is removed. Ice and pressure are applied to the site to stop any bleeding. A bandage will be applied to absorb any fluid."}

Adhesive strips may be placed over any wound, if needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour doctor will ask about your medical history. A breast exam may be done. If you take medicines (including aspirin, supplements, or herbs), ask your doctor whether you need to stop taking these before the biopsy. Ask which medicines you should still take on the day of biopsy.\nLet your doctor know If you may be pregnant or about any illness you may have before your biopsy. This includes\nCOVID-19\n, a\ncold\n,\nflu\n, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness."}

If you do get sick, your biopsy may need to be postponed.\nDo not use lotion, perfume, powder, or deodorant underneath your arms or on your breasts.\nIf you took medicines to relax or relieve anxiety, you should arrange for transportation to and from the location of the biopsy procedure.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the numbing medicine is injected, it may sting a bit.\nDuring the procedure, you may feel slight discomfort or light pressure.\nLying on your stomach for up to 1 hour may be uncomfortable. Using cushions or pillows may help. Some people are given a pill to help relax them before the procedure.\nAfter the test, the breast may be sore and tender for several days."}

Follow instructions on what activities you can do, how to care for your breast, and what medicines you can take for pain.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nStereotactic breast biopsy is used when a small growth or an area of\ncalcifications\nis seen on a mammogram, but cannot be seen using an\nultrasound of the breast\n.\nThe tissue samples are sent to a pathologist to be examined.\nNormal Results\nA normal result means there is no sign of cancer.\nYour health care provider will let you know when you need a follow-up mammogram or other tests.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf the biopsy shows benign breast tissue without cancer, you will likely not need surgery.\nSometimes the biopsy results show abnormal signs that are not cancer."}
