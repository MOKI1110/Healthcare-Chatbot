This fluid fills the baby's lungs and helps them grow. When the baby is born at term, hormones released during labor tell the lungs to stop making this special fluid. The baby's lungs start removing or reabsorbing it.\nThe first few breaths a baby takes after delivery fill the lungs with air and help to clear most of the remaining lung fluid.\nLeftover fluid in the lungs causes the baby to breathe rapidly."}

If the condition goes away in that time, it is considered to be transient.\nTreatment\nYour baby will be given oxygen, and sometimes CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure) as well, to keep the blood oxygen level and breathing rate stable. Your baby will often need the most support within a few hours after birth and will usually begin to improve after that. Most infants with TTN improve in less than 24 to 48 hours, but some will need help for a few days.\nVery rapid breathing usually means a baby is unable to eat. Fluids and nutrients will be given through a vein until your baby improves. Your baby may also receive antibiotics if there is concern for infection. Sometimes, babies with TTN will need help with breathing or feeding for a week or more, usually if they are premature.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe condition most often goes away within 48 to 72 hours after delivery."}

In most cases, babies who have had TTN have no further problems from the condition. They will not need special care or follow-up other than their routine checkups. However, there is some evidence that babies with TTN may be at a higher risk for wheezing problems later in infancy.\nAlternative Names\nTTN; Wet lungs - newborns; Retained fetal lung fluid; Transient RDS; Prolonged transition; Neonatal - transient tachypnea\nReferences\nAhlfeld SK.
