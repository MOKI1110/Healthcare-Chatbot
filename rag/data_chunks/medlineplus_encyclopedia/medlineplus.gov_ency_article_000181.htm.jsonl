Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAortic dissection\nAortic dissection\nAortic dissection is a serious condition in which there is a tear in the wall of the major artery carrying blood out of the heart (aorta). As the tear extends along the wall of the aorta, blood can flow in between the layers of the blood vessel wall (dissection). This can lead to aortic rupture or decreased blood flow (ischemia) to organs.\nCauses\nWhen it leaves the heart, the aorta first moves up through the chest towards the head (the ascending aorta). It then bends or arches, and finally moves down through the chest and abdomen (the descending aorta).\nAortic dissection most often happens because of a tear or damage to the inner wall of the aorta. This very often occurs in the chest (thoracic) part of the artery, but it may also occur in the abdominal aorta.\nWhen a tear occurs, it creates 2 channels:\nOne in which blood continues to travel\nAnother where blood stays still\nIf the channel with non-traveling blood gets bigger, it can push on other branches of the aorta."}

This can narrow the other branches and reduce blood flow through them.\nAn aortic dissection may also cause abnormal widening or ballooning of the aorta (\naneurysm\n).\nThe exact cause is unknown, but more common risks include:\nAging\nAtherosclerosis\nBlunt trauma to the chest, such as hitting the steering wheel of a car during an accident\nHigh blood pressure\nOther risk factors and conditions linked to aortic dissection include:\nBicuspid aortic valve\nCoarctation (narrowing) of the aorta\nConnective tissue disorders (such as\nMarfan syndrome\nand Ehlers-Danlos syndrome) and rare genetic disorders\nHeart surgery or procedures\nPregnancy\nSwelling of the blood vessels due to conditions such as arteritis and syphilis\nAortic dissection occurs in about 2 out of every 10,000 people. It can affect anyone, but is most often seen in men ages 40 to 70.\nSymptoms\nIn most cases, the symptoms begin suddenly, and include severe\nchest pain\n."}

This requires a surgical incision that is made in the chest or abdomen.\nEndovascular aortic repair. This surgery is done without any major surgical incisions.\nMedicines that lower blood pressure may be prescribed. These medicines may be given through a vein (intravenously). Beta-blockers are the medicines of first choice. Strong pain relievers are very often needed.\nIf the aortic valve is damaged, valve replacement is needed. If the heart arteries are involved, a coronary bypass is also performed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAortic dissection is life threatening. The condition can be managed with surgery if it is done before the aorta ruptures. Less than one half of people with a ruptured aorta survive.\nThose who survive will need lifelong, aggressive treatment of high blood pressure. They will need to be followed up with CT scans every few months to monitor the aorta.\nPossible Complications\nAortic dissection may decrease or stop the blood flow to many different parts of the body."}
