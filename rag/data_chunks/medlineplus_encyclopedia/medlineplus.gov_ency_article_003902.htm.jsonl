The tissue is tested under a microscope.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA bladder biopsy can be done as part of a\ncystoscopy\n. Cystoscopy is a procedure that is done to see the inside of the bladder using a thin lighted tube called a cystoscope. A small piece of tissue or the entire abnormal area is removed. The tissue is sent to the lab to be tested if:\nAbnormalities of the bladder are found during this exam\ntumor\nis seen\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou must sign an informed consent form before you have a bladder biopsy. In most cases, you are asked to urinate just before the procedure. You may also be asked to take an antibiotic before the procedure.\nFor infants and children, the preparation you can provide for this test depends on your child's age, previous experiences, and level of trust."}

For general information regarding how you can prepare your child, see the following topics:\nInfant test or procedure preparation\n(birth to 1 year)\nToddler test or procedure preparation\n(1 to 3 years)\nPreschooler test or procedure preparation\n(3 to 6 years)\nSchool age test or procedure preparation\n(6 to 12 years)\nAdolescent test or procedure preparation\n(12 to 18 years)\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may have a slight discomfort as the cystoscope is passed through your urethra into your bladder. You will feel discomfort that is similar to a strong urge to urinate when the fluid has filled your bladder.\nYou may feel a pinch during the biopsy. There may be a burning sensation when the blood vessels are sealed to stop bleeding (cauterized).\nAfter the cystoscope is removed, your urethra may be sore. You may feel a burning sensation during urination for a day or two. There may be blood in the urine."}

In most cases, this will go away on its own.\nIn some cases, the biopsy needs to be taken from a large area. In that case, you may need general anesthesia or sedation before the procedure.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is most often done to check for\ncancer of the bladder\nor urethra.\nNormal Results\nThe bladder wall is smooth. The bladder is of a normal size, shape, and position. There are no\nblockages\n, growths, or\nstones\n.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThe presence of cancer cells indicates bladder cancer. The type of cancer can be determined from the biopsy sample.\nOther abnormalities may include:\nBladder\ndiverticula\nCysts\nInflammation\nInfection\nUlcers\nRisks\nThere is some risk for\nurinary tract infection\n(UTI).\nThere is a slight risk for excessive bleeding."}

If the bleeding continues after you urinate, contact your health care provider.\nAlso contact your provider if:\nYou have pain, chills, or a fever\nYou are producing less urine than usual (\noliguria\n)\nYou cannot urinate despite a strong urge to do so\nAlternative Names\nBiopsy - bladder\nImages\nBladder catheterization - female\nBladder catheterization - male\nFemale urinary tract\nMale urinary tract\nBladder biopsy\nReferences\nCundiff GW, Bent AE.
