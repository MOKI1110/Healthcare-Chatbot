Mottling or mottled skin refers to blood vessel changes in the skin that cause a patchy appearance.\nConsiderations\nIrregular or patchy discoloration of the skin can be caused by:\nChanges in\nmelanin\n, a substance produced in the skin cells that gives skin its color\nGrowth of bacteria or other organisms on the skin\nBlood vessel (vascular) changes\nInflammation due to certain rashes\nThe following can increase or decrease melanin production:\nYour genes\nHeat\nInjury\nExposure to radiation (such as from the sun)\nExposure to heavy metals\nChanges in hormone levels\nCertain conditions such as\nvitiligo\nCertain fungal infections\nCertain rashes\nExposure to sun or ultraviolet (UV) light, especially after taking a medicine called psoralens, may increase skin color (pigmentation)."}

Increased pigment production is called\nhyperpigmentation\n, and can result from certain rashes as well as sun exposure.\nDecreased pigment production is called hypopigmentation.\nSkin color changes can be their own condition, or they may be caused by other medical conditions or disorders.\nHow much skin pigmentation you have can help determine which skin diseases you may be more likely to develop. For example, lighter-skinned people are more sensitive to sun exposure and damage. This raises the risk of skin cancers. But even in darker-skinned people, too much sun exposure can lead to skin cancers.\nExamples of the most common skin cancers are\nbasal cell carcinoma\n,\nsquamous cell carcinoma\n, and\nmelanoma\n.\nGenerally, skin color changes are cosmetic and do not affect physical health. But, mental\nstress\ncan occur because of pigment changes."}
