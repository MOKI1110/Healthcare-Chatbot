Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nChoking - infant under 1 year\nChoking - infant under 1 year\nChoking is when someone is having a very hard time breathing because food, a toy, or other object is blocking the throat or windpipe (airway).\nA choking infant's airway may be blocked so that not enough oxygen reaches the lungs. Without oxygen, brain damage can occur in as little as 4 minutes. Rapid first aid for choking can save an infant's life.\nThis article discusses choking in infants.\nCauses\nChoking in infants is usually caused by breathing in a small object that the baby has placed in their mouth, such as a button, coin, balloon, toy part, or watch battery.\nChoking may result from a complete or partial blockage of the airway.\nA complete blockage is a medical emergency.\nA partial blockage can quickly become life threatening if the baby cannot get enough air.\nWhen a person does not get enough air, permanent brain damage can occur in as little as 4 minutes."}

Rapid first aid for choking can save a life.\nSymptoms\nThe danger signs of choking are:\nBluish skin color\n(cyanosis)\nDifficulty breathing -- ribs and chest pull inward\nLoss of consciousness (unresponsiveness) if blockage is not cleared\nInability to cry or make much sound\nWeak, ineffective coughing\nSoft or high-pitched sounds while inhaling\nFirst Aid\nDo not perform these steps if the infant is coughing hard or has a strong cry. Strong coughs and cries can help push the object out of the airway.\nIf your child is not coughing forcefully or does not have a strong cry, follow these steps:\nLay the infant face down, along your forearm. Use your thigh or lap for support. Hold the infant's chest in your hand and the jaw with your fingers. Point the infant's head downward, lower than the body.\nGive up to 5 quick, forceful blows between the infant's shoulder blades. Use the palm of your free hand.\nIf the object does not come out of the airway after 5 blows:\nTurn the infant face-up."}

Support the head.\nPlace 2 fingers on the middle of the breastbone just below the nipples.\nGive up to 5 quick thrusts down, compressing the chest one third to one half the depth of the chest.\nContinue 5 back blows followed by 5 chest thrusts until the object is dislodged or the infant loses alertness (becomes unconscious).\nIF THE INFANT LOSES ALERTNESS\nIf the child becomes unresponsive, stops breathing, or turns blue:\nShout for help.\nGive infant\nCPR\n. Call 911 or the local emergency number after 1 minute of CPR.\nIf you can see the object blocking the airway, try to remove it with your finger. Try to remove an object only if you can see it.\nDO NOT\nDo not perform choking first aid if the infant is coughing forcefully, has a strong cry, or is breathing enough."}

Try to remove an object only if you can see it.\nDO NOT\nDo not perform choking first aid if the infant is coughing forcefully, has a strong cry, or is breathing enough. However, be ready to act if the symptoms get worse.\nDo not try to grasp and pull out the object if the infant is alert (conscious).\nDo not do back blows and chest thrusts if the infant stops breathing for other reasons, such as asthma, infection, swelling, or a blow to the head. Do give the infant CPR in these cases.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIf an infant is choking:\nTell someone to call 911 or the local emergency number while you begin first aid.\nIf you are alone, shout for help and begin first aid.\nAlways call your health care provider after a child has been choking, even if you successfully remove the object from the airway and the infant seems fine.\nPrevention\nTo prevent choking in an infant:\nCut large pieces of food into easily chewable sizes.\nDo not give children under 3 years old balloons or toys with small parts that can break off.\nKeep infants away from buttons, popcorn, coins, grapes, nuts, and other small items.\nWatch infants and toddlers while they are eating."}
