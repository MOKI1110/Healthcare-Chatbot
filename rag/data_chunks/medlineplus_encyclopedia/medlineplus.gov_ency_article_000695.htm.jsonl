It is also called grand mal seizure. The terms generalized seizure,\nconvulsion\n, or\nepilepsy\nare most often associated with bilateral tonic-clonic seizures.\nCauses\nSeizures result from electrical overactivity in the brain. Bilateral tonic-clonic seizures may occur in people of any age. They can occur once (single episode). Or, they can occur as part of a repeated, chronic illness (epilepsy)."}

Bilateral tonic-clonic seizures may occur in people of any age. They can occur once (single episode). Or, they can occur as part of a repeated, chronic illness (epilepsy). Some seizures are due to psychological problems (psychogenic or non-epileptic).\nSymptoms\nMany people with generalized bilateral tonic-clonic seizures have an aura with one or more symptoms before the seizure such as:\nVision, taste, smell, or sensory changes.\nSeeing, smelling, or sometimes hearing things that are not there (\nhallucinations\n).\nDizziness\nor other symptoms.\nSome people have a focal onset seizure (only affecting one part of the body) that becomes a bilateral tonic-clonic seizure.\nThe seizures often result in rigid muscles (tonic phase). This is followed by violent\nmuscle contractions\n(clonic phase)."}

This will include a detailed check of the brain and nervous system.\nAn\nelectroencephalogram\n(EEG) will be done to check the electrical activity in the brain. People with seizures often have abnormal electrical activity seen on this test. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start."}
