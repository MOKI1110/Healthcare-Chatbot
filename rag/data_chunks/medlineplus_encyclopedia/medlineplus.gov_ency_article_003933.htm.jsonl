Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLymph node biopsy\nLymph node biopsy\nA lymph node biopsy is the removal of lymph node tissue for examination under a microscope.\nThe lymph nodes are small glands that make white blood cells (lymphocytes), which fight infection. Lymph nodes may trap the germs that are causing an infection.\nCancer\ncan spread to lymph nodes.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA lymph node biopsy is often done in an operating room in a hospital or at an outpatient surgical center. The biopsy may be done in different ways.\nAn open biopsy is surgery to remove all or part of the lymph node. This is usually done if there is a lymph node that can be felt on exam. This can be done with local anesthesia (numbing medicine) injected into the area, or under\ngeneral anesthesia\n. The procedure is typically done in the following way:\nYou lie on the exam table. You may be given medicine to calm you and make you sleepy or you may have general anesthesia, which means you are asleep and pain-free.\nThe biopsy site is cleansed.\nA small surgical cut (incision) is made."}

The lymph node or part of the node is removed.\nThe incision is closed with stitches and a bandage or liquid adhesive is applied.\nAn open biopsy may take 30 to 45 minutes.\nFor some cancers, a special way of finding the best lymph node to biopsy is used. This is called sentinel lymph node biopsy, and it involves:\nA tiny amount of a tracer, either a radioactive tracer (radioisotope) or a blue dye or both, is injected at the tumor site or in the area of the tumor.\nThe tracer or dye flows into the nearest (local) node or nodes. These nodes are called the sentinel nodes. The sentinel nodes are the first lymph nodes to which a cancer may spread.\nThe sentinel node or nodes are removed.\nLymph node biopsies in the belly may be performed with a laparoscope. This is a small tube with a light and camera that is inserted through a small incision in the abdomen. One or more incisions will be made and tools will be inserted to help remove the node."}

The biopsy site will be sore for a few days after the test.\nAfter an open or laparoscopic biopsy, the pain is usually mild and you can easily control it with an over-the-counter pain medicine. You may also notice some bruising or fluid leaking for a few days. Follow instructions for taking care of the incision."}

While the incision is healing, avoid any type of intense exercise or heavy lifting that causes pain or discomfort. Ask your surgeon for specific instructions about what activities you can do.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is used to diagnose cancer,\nsarcoidosis\n, or an infection (such as tuberculosis):\nWhen you or your health care provider feel\nswollen lymph glands\nand they do not go away\nWhen abnormal lymph nodes are present on a\nmammogram\n, ultrasound, CT, or\nMRI scan\nFor some people with cancer, such as\nbreast cancer\nor\nmelanoma\n, to see if the cancer has spread (sentinel lymph node biopsy or needle biopsy by a radiologist)\nThe results of the biopsy help your provider decide on further tests and treatments.\nNormal Results\nIf a lymph node biopsy does not show any signs of cancer, it is more likely that other lymph nodes nearby are also cancer-free."}
