These are called topical medicines, and may include:\nA mild cortisone (steroid) cream or ointment at first. You may need a stronger medicine if this does not work.\nOther ointments or creams that help quiet the immune response may be prescribed for anyone over 2 years old, often for use on the face or other sensitive areas.\nCreams or ointments that contain coal tar may be used for thickened areas.\nYou may also be asked to try a wet wrap treatment.
