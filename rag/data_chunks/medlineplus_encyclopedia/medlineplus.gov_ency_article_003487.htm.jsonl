Others feel a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done when your health care provider suspects you have an abnormal level of magnesium in your blood.\nOnly a small amount of the body's total amount of magnesium is found in the blood. About one half of the body's magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found inside cells of body tissues and organs.\nMagnesium is needed for many chemical processes in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function and helps keep bones strong. Magnesium is also needed for the heart to function normally and to help regulate blood pressure."}

It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function and helps keep bones strong. Magnesium is also needed for the heart to function normally and to help regulate blood pressure. Magnesium also helps the body regulate blood sugar levels and helps support the body's defense (immune) system.\nNormal Results\nThe normal range for blood magnesium level is 1.7 to 2.2 mg/dL (0.70 to 0.91 mmol/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA high blood magnesium level may be due to:\nAdrenal insufficiency (the glands are not producing enough hormones)\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\n, a life-threatening problem in people with diabetes\nLithium use\nLoss of kidney function (\nacute\nor\nchronic renal failure\n)\nLoss of body fluids (\ndehydration\n)\nMilk alkali syndrome\n(a condition in which there is a high level of calcium in the body)\nA low blood magnesium level may be due to:\nAlcohol use disorder\nDiabetes that is uncontrolled\nDiarrhea\nthat is chronic\nToo much production of the hormone aldosterone by the adrenal"}
