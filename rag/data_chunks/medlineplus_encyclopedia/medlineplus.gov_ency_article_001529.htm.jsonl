It is followed by a return to the previous level of function. The person may or may not be aware of the strange behavior.\nThis condition most often affects people in their 20s, 30s, and 40s. Those who have personality disorders are at high risk of having a brief reactive psychosis.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of brief psychotic disorder may include the following:\nBehavior that is odd or out of character\nFalse ideas about what is taking place (delusions)\nHearing or seeing things that aren't real (hallucinations)\nStrange speech or language\nThe symptoms are not due to alcohol or other illegal drug use, and they last longer than a day, but less than a month.\nExams and Tests\nA psychiatric evaluation can confirm the diagnosis."}

A physical exam and laboratory testing can rule out medical illness as the cause of the symptoms.\nTreatment\nBy definition, psychotic symptoms go away on their own in less than 1 month. In some cases, brief psychotic disorder can be the beginning of a more chronic psychotic condition, such as\nschizophrenia\nor\nschizoaffective disorder\n. Antipsychotic medicines can help decrease or stop the psychotic symptoms.\nTalk therapy may also help you cope with the emotional stress that triggered the problem.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people with this disorder have a good outcome. Repeat episodes may occur in response to stress.\nPossible Complications\nAs with all psychotic illnesses, this condition can severely disrupt your life and possibly lead to violence and suicide.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall for an appointment with a mental health professional if you have symptoms of this disorder.\nIf you or someone you know is thinking about suicide, call or text 988 or chat\n988lifeline.org\n."}
