Your body stores vitamin K in the liver and other body tissues, including the brain, heart, pancreas, and bone.\nFunction\nVitamin K is known as the clotting vitamin. The body needs vitamin K to make certain proteins in the liver that cause blood to clot. These proteins are called clotting factors.   Without vitamin K, the liver could not produce clotting factors II, VII, IX, and X, and  blood would not clot. Some studies suggest that vitamin K helps maintain strong bones in older adults.\nFood Sources\nThe best way to get the daily requirement of vitamin K is by eating food sources. Vitamin K is found in the following foods:\nGreen leafy vegetables, such as kale, spinach, turnip greens, collards, Swiss chard, mustard greens, parsley, romaine, and green leaf lettuce\nVegetables such as Brussels sprouts, broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage\nFish, liver, meat, eggs, and cereals (contain smaller amounts)\nVitamin K is also made by the bacteria in the lower intestinal tract.\nSide Effects\nVitamin K deficiency is very rare."}

It occurs when the body can't properly absorb the vitamin from the intestinal tract. Vitamin K deficiency can also occur after long-term treatment with antibiotics.\nPeople with vitamin K deficiency are often more likely to have bruising and bleeding.\nKeep in mind that:\nIf you take the blood-thinning medicine warfarin (Coumadin), you may need to eat less of vitamin K containing foods.\nEven more important, you may also need to eat the same amount of vitamin K-containing foods every day. Sudden changes in vitamin K consumption can change the effect of this medicine.\nYou should know that vitamin K or foods containing vitamin K can affect how warfarin works."}

It is important for you to keep vitamin K levels in your blood constant on a day to day basis.\nAsk your health care provider if you need to monitor your intake of vitamin K containing foods and how much you can eat.\nRecommendations\nRecommendations for vitamin K, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)\n: The average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people. An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence.\nAdequate Intake (AI)\n: This level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA."}
