Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSpinal stenosis\nSpinal stenosis\nSpinal stenosis is narrowing of the spinal column that causes pressure on the spinal cord, or narrowing of the openings (called neural foramina) where spinal nerves leave the spinal column.\nCauses\nSpinal stenosis usually occurs as a person ages, however, some people are born with less space for their spinal cord.\nThe spinal disks become drier and start to bulge and can rupture.\nThe bones and ligaments of the spine thicken or grow larger. This is caused by arthritis or long-term swelling.\nSpinal stenosis may also be caused by:\nArthritis\nof the spine, usually in middle-aged or older people\nBone diseases, such as\nPaget disease\nDefect or growth in the spine that was present from birth\nNarrow spinal canal that the person was born with\nHerniated\nor slipped disk, which often may have happened in the past\nInjury that causes pressure on the nerve roots or the spinal cord\nTumors\nin the spine\nFracture or injury of a spinal bone\nSymptoms\nSymptoms often get worse slowly over time."}

Most often, symptoms will be on one side of the body, but may involve both legs.\nSymptoms include:\nNumbness\n, cramping, or pain in the back, buttocks, thighs, or calves, or in the neck, shoulders, or arms\nWeakness\nof part of a leg or arm\nSymptoms are more likely to be present or get worse when you stand or walk. They often lessen or disappear when you sit down or lean forward. Most people with spinal stenosis cannot walk for a long period without having significant pain.\nMore serious symptoms include:\nDifficulty or poor balance when walking\nProblems controlling urine or bowel movements\nExams and Tests\nDuring a physical exam, your health care provider will try to find the location of the pain and learn how it affects your movement. You will be asked to:\nSit, stand, and walk. While you walk, your provider may ask you to try walking on your toes and then your heels.\nBend forward, backward, and sideways."}

Your pain may worsen with these movements.\nLift your legs straight up while lying down. If the pain is worse when you do this, you may have sciatica, especially if you also feel numbness or tingling in one of your legs.\nYour provider will also move your legs in different positions, including bending and straightening your knees. This is to check your strength and ability to move.\nTo test nerve function, your provider will use a rubber hammer to check your reflexes. To test how well your nerves sense feeling, your provider will touch your legs in many places with a pin, cotton swab, or feather. To check your balance, your provider will ask you to close your eyes while standing and keeping your feet together.\nA brain and nervous system (neurologic) exam helps confirm leg weakness and\nloss of sensation\nin the legs."}

If the pain does not respond to these treatments, or you lose movement or feeling, you may need surgery.\nSurgery is done to relieve pressure on the nerves or spinal cord.\nYou and your provider can decide when you need to have surgery for these symptoms.\nSurgery may include\nremoving a bulging disk\n,\nremoving part of the vertebra bone\n, or\nwidening the canal and openings where your spinal nerves are located\n.\nDuring some spinal surgeries, the surgeon will remove some bone to create more room for your spinal nerves or spinal column. The surgeon will then fuse some of the spine bones to make your spine more stable. But this will make your back more stiff and may cause arthritis in areas above or below your fused spine.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMany people with spinal stenosis are able to be active with the condition, although they may need to make some changes in their activities or work.\nSpine surgery will often partly or fully relieve symptoms in your legs or arms."}
