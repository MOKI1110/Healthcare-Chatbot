Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCT angiography - chest\nCT angiography - chest\nCT angiography combines a CT scan with the injection of dye. This technique is able to create pictures of the blood vessels in the chest and upper abdomen. CT stands for computed tomography.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will be asked to lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner.\nWhile inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you.\nA computer creates  multiple separate  images of the body area, called slices. These images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, or printed on film. Three-dimensional models of the chest area can be created by stacking the slices together.\nYou must be still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time.\nComplete scans usually take only a few minutes."}

You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time.\nComplete scans usually take only a few minutes. The newest scanners can image your entire body, head to toe, in less than 30 seconds.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nCertain exams require a special dye, called contrast, to be delivered into the body before the test starts. Contrast helps certain areas show up better on x-rays.\nContrast can be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. If contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.\nLet your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medications before the test in order to safely receive it.\nBefore receiving the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes medication metformin (Glucophage). You may need to take extra precautions.\nThe contrast can worsen kidney function problems in people with poorly functioning kidneys.   Talk to your provider if you have a history of kidney problems.\nToo much weight can damage the scanner."}

Talk to your provider if you have a history of kidney problems.\nToo much weight can damage the scanner. If you weigh more than 300 pounds (135 kilograms), talk to your provider about the weight limit before the test.\nYou will be asked to remove jewelry and wear a hospital gown during the study.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe x-rays produced by the CT scan are painless. Some people may have discomfort from lying on the hard table.\nIf you have contrast through a vein, you may have a:\nSlight burning feeling\nMetallic taste in your mouth\nWarm flushing of your body\nThis is normal and usually goes away within a few seconds.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA chest CT angiogram may be done:\nFor symptoms that suggest blood clots in the lungs, such as chest pain, rapid breathing, or shortness of breath\nAfter a chest injury or trauma\nBefore surgery in the lung or chest\nTo look for a possible site to insert a catheter for hemodialysis\nFor swelling of the face or upper arms that cannot be explained\nTo look for a suspected birth defect of the aorta or other blood vessels in the chest\nTo look for a widening of an"}

Having many x-rays or CT scans over time may increase your risk for cancer. However, the risk from any one scan is small. You and your provider should weigh this risk against the benefits of getting a correct diagnosis for a medical problem. Most modern scanners use techniques to use less radiation.\nSome people have allergies to contrast dye. Let your provider know if you have ever had an allergic reaction to injected contrast dye.\nThe most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. If you have an iodine allergy, you may have\nnausea or vomiting\n,\nsneezing\n,\nitching\n, or\nhives\nif you get this type of contrast.\nIf you absolutely must be given such contrast, your provider may give you antihistamines (such as Benadryl) and/or steroids before the test.\nThe kidneys help remove iodine out of the body."}

If you have any trouble breathing during the test, you should notify the scanner operator immediately. Scanners come with an intercom and speakers, so someone can hear you at all times.\nYour provider may ask you to avoid the use of metformin for two days after the CT-angiogram.\nAlternative Names\nComputed tomography angiography - thorax; CTA - lungs; Pulmonary embolism - CTA chest; Thoracic aortic aneurysm - CTA chest; Venous thromboembolism - CTA lung; Blood clot - CTA lung; Embolus - CTA lung; CT pulmonary angiogram\nImages\nCT scan\nReferences\nCarmichael SP, Mowery NT, Martin RS, Meredith JW.
