This condition is a complication of\ndiabetes\n.\nCauses\nIn people with diabetes, the body's nerves can be damaged by decreased blood flow and a high blood sugar (glucose) level. This condition is more likely when the blood sugar level is not well controlled over time.\nAbout one half of people with diabetes develop nerve damage. Symptoms often do not begin until many years after diabetes has been diagnosed. Some people who have diabetes that develops slowly already have nerve damage when they are first diagnosed with diabetes.\nPeople with diabetes are also at higher risk for other nerve problems not caused by their diabetes. These other nerve problems won't have the same symptoms and will progress in a different manner than nerve damage caused by diabetes.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms often develop slowly over many years."}

These other nerve problems won't have the same symptoms and will progress in a different manner than nerve damage caused by diabetes.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms often develop slowly over many years. The types of symptoms you have depend on the nerves that are affected.\nNerves in the feet and legs are most often affected. Symptoms often start in the toes and feet, and include tingling or burning, or deep pain. Over time, nerve damage can also occur in the fingers and hands. As the damage gets worse, you may lose feeling in your toes, feet, and legs. Your skin may become numb. Because of this, you may:\nNot notice when you step on something sharp\nNot know that you have a blister or small cut\nNot notice when your feet or hands touch something that is too hot or cold\nHave feet that are very dry and cracked\nWhen the nerves that control digestion are affected, you may have trouble digesting food due to reduced movement of the stomach (\ngastroparesis\n). This can make your diabetes harder to control. Damage to nerves that control digestion almost always occurs in people with severe nerve damage in their feet and legs."}
