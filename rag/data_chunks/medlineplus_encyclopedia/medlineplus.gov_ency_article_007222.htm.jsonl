Primary brain tumors can start from brain cells, the membranes around the brain (meninges), nerves, or glands.\nTumors can directly destroy brain cells. They can also damage cells by producing inflammation, placing pressure on other parts of the brain, and increasing\npressure within the skull\n.\nThe cause of primary brain tumors is unknown."}

There are many risk factors that could play a role:\nRadiation therapy used to treat brain cancers increases the risk of brain tumors up to 20 or 30 years later.\nSome inherited conditions increase the risk of brain tumors, including neurofibromatosis, Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, and Turcot syndrome.\nLymphomas that begin in the brain in people with a weakened immune system (such as people with HIV) are sometimes linked to infection by the Epstein-Barr virus.\nThese have not proven to be risk factors:\nExposure to radiation at work, or to power lines, cell phones, cordless phones, or wireless devices\nHead injuries\nSmoking\nHormone therapy\nSPECIFIC TUMOR TYPES\nBrain tumors are classified depending on:\nLocation of the tumor\nType of tissue involved\nWhether they are noncancerous (\nbenign\n) or cancerous (\nmalignant\n)\nOther factors\nSometimes, tumors that start out less aggressive can change their biologic behavior and become more aggressive.\nTumors can occur at any age, but m"}

In adults, gliomas and meningiomas are the most common.\nGliomas come from glial cells around the nerve cells of the brain such as astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and ependymal cells. Gliomas are divided into three types:\nAstrocytic tumors include astrocytomas (can be noncancerous), anaplastic astrocytomas, and glioblastomas.\nOligodendroglial tumors. Some primary brain tumors are made up of both astrocytic and oligodendrocytic tumors. These are called mixed gliomas.\nGlioblastomas are the most aggressive type of primary brain tumor.\nMeningiomas and schwannomas are two other types of brain tumors. These tumors:\nOccur most often between ages 40 and 70.\nAre usually noncancerous, but can still cause serious complications and death from their size or location. Some are cancerous and aggressive.\nOther primary brain tumors in adults are rare."}

Debulking is a procedure to reduce the tumor's size.\nTumors can be hard to remove completely by surgery alone. This is because the tumor invades surrounding brain tissue much like roots from a plant spread through soil.
