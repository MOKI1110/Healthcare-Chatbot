This is the bacterium that causes tuberculosis (TB). The bacteria spread to the brain and spine from another place in the body, usually the lung.\nTuberculous meningitis is very rare in the United States. Most cases are in people who traveled to the United States from other countries where TB is common.\nPeople who have the following have a higher chance of developing tuberculous meningitis:\nHIV/AIDS\nDrink alcohol in excess\nTB of the lung\nWeakened immune system\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms often start slowly, and may include:\nFever and chills\nMental status changes\nNausea and vomiting\nSensitivity to light (\nphotophobia\n)\nSevere headache\nStiff neck (meningismus)\nOther symptoms that can occur with this disease may include:\nAgitation\nBulging fontanelles\n(soft spots) in babies\nDecreased consciousness\nPoor feeding or irritability in children\nUnus"}

This is usually found in infants (less than 3 months old)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you. This will usually show that you have the following:\nFast heart rate\nFever\nMental status changes\nStiff neck\nA lumbar puncture (\nspinal tap\n) is an important test in diagnosing meningitis. It is done to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid for examination. More than one sample may be needed to make the diagnosis.\nOther tests that may be done include:\nBiopsy\nof the brain or meninges (rare)\nBlood culture\nChest x-ray\nCerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination\nfor cell count, glucose, and protein\nCT scan of the head\nGram stain\n, other special stains, and\nculture of CSF\nPolymerase chain reaction (PCR) of CSF\nSkin test for TB (\nPPD\n)\nOther tests to look for TB\nTreatment\nYou will be given several medicines to fight the TB bacteria."}

Sometimes, treatment is started even if your provider thinks you have the disease, but testing has not confirmed it yet.\nTreatment usually lasts for at least 12 months. Medicines called corticosteroids may also be used.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nTuberculous meningitis is life threatening if untreated. Long-term follow-up is needed to detect recurring infections.\nPossible Complications\nUntreated, the disease can cause any of the following:\nBrain damage\nBuild-up of fluid between the skull and brain (\nsubdural effusion\n)\nHearing loss\nHydrocephalus\n(build-up of fluid inside the skull that leads to brain swelling)\nSeizures\nDeath\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall 911 or the local emergency number or go to an emergency room if you suspect meningitis in a young child who has the following symptoms:\nFeeding problems\nHigh-pitched cry\nIrritability\nPersistent unexplained fever\nCall the local emergency number if you develop any of the serious symptoms listed above."}

Meningitis can quickly become a life-threatening illness.\nPrevention\nTreating people who have signs of a non-active (dormant) TB infection can prevent its spread. A PPD test and other TB tests can be done to tell if you have this type of infection.\nSome countries with a high incidence of TB give people a vaccine called BCG to prevent TB. But, the effectiveness of this vaccine is limited, and it is not usually used in the United States. The BCG vaccine may help prevent severe forms of TB, such as meningitis, in very young children who live in areas where the disease is common.\nAlternative Names\nTubercular meningitis; TB meningitis\nImages\nMeninges of the brain\nMeninges of the spine\nReferences\nBailey TC, Philips JA.
