A small number, but not all, of the person's cells contain this faulty gene (mosaicism).\nThis disease is not inherited.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom of McCune-Albright syndrome is early puberty in girls. Menstrual periods may begin in early childhood, long before the breasts or pubic hair develop (which normally occur first). The average age that symptoms appear is 3 years old."}

Medicines that block estrogen production, such as testolactone, have been tried with some success.\nAdrenal abnormalities (such as\nCushing syndrome\n) may be treated with surgery to remove the adrenal glands. Gigantism and pituitary adenoma will need to be treated with medicines that block hormone production, or with surgery.\nBone abnormalities (fibrous dysplasia) are sometimes removed with surgery.\nLimit the number of x-rays taken of affected areas of the body.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nLifespan is relatively normal.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nBlindness\nCosmetic problems from bone abnormalities\nDeafness\nOsteitis fibrosa cystica\nPremature puberty\nRepeated broken bones\nTumors of the bone (rare)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if your child starts puberty early, or has other symptoms of Mc"}
