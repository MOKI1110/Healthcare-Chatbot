The procedure is performed as follows:\nYou receive local anesthesia to numb the scalp. You may also receive medicine to relax you.\nYour scalp is thoroughly cleaned.\nA strip of your hairy scalp is removed using a scalpel (surgical knife) and set aside. This area of your scalp is called the donor area. The scalp is closed using tiny stitches.\nSmall groups of hairs, or individual hairs, are carefully separated out from the removed scalp, often done under magnification or microscope.\nIn some cases, smaller areas of the scalp and groups of hairs are removed with other equipment or robotic assistance.\nThe bald areas that will receive these healthy hairs are cleaned. These areas of your scalp are called the recipient areas.\nTiny cuts are made in the bald area.\nHealthy hairs are carefully placed in the cuts."}

During a single treatment session, hundreds or even thousands of hairs may be transplanted.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nA hair transplant can improve the appearance and self-confidence in people who are balding. This procedure cannot create new hair. It can only move the hair you already have to the areas that are bald.\nMost people who have a hair transplant have\nmale\nor\nfemale pattern baldness\n. Hair loss is on the front or top of the scalp."}

Hair loss is on the front or top of the scalp. You must still have thick hair on the back or sides of the scalp to have enough hair follicles to move.\nIn some cases, people with hair loss from\nlupus\n, injuries, or other medical problems are treated with a hair transplant.\nRisks\nRisks of surgery in general include:\nBleeding\nInfection\nOther risks that can occur with this procedure:\nScarring\nUnnatural-looking tufts of new hair growth\nLack of growth of transplanted hair grafts\nIt is possible that the transplanted hair will not look as good as you had desired.\nIf you plan to have a hair transplant, you should be in good health. This is because surgery is less likely to be safe and successful if your health is poor. Discuss your risks and options with your doctor before undergoing this procedure.\nAfter the Procedure\nFollow your doctor's instructions about caring for your scalp and any other self-care measures."}

Discuss your risks and options with your doctor before undergoing this procedure.\nAfter the Procedure\nFollow your doctor's instructions about caring for your scalp and any other self-care measures. This is especially important to ensure healing.\nFor a day or two after the procedure, you may have a large surgical dressing or a smaller dressing that can be protected by a baseball cap.\nDuring the recovery period after surgery, your scalp may be very tender. You may need to take pain medicines. The hair grafts may appear to fall out, but they will regrow.\nYou may also need to take antibiotics or anti-inflammatory medicines after surgery.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost hair transplants result in excellent hair growth within several months after the procedure. More than one treatment session may be needed to create best results.\nThe replaced hairs are mostly permanent. No long-term care is necessary.\nAlternative Names\nHair restoration; Hair replacement; Hair plugs; Follicular unit extraction (FUE)\nImages\nSkin layers\nReferences\nAvram MR, Rogers NE.
