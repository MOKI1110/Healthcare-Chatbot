A child may have pain while passing stools or may be unable to have a bowel movement after straining or pushing.\nConsiderations\nConstipation is common in children. However, normal bowel movements are different for each child.\nIn the first month, infants tend to have bowel movements about once a day. After that, babies can go a few days or even a week between bowel movements. It's also difficult to pass stools because their abdominal muscles are weak. So babies tend to strain, cry, and get red in the face when they have a bowel movement. This does not mean they are constipated."}
