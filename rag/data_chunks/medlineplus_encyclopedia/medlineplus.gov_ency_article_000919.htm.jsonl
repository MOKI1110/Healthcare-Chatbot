The symptoms of conduct disorder also can be an early sign of\ndepression\nor\nbipolar disorder\n.\nSymptoms\nChildren with conduct disorder tend to be impulsive, hard to control, and apparently not concerned about the feelings of other people.\nSymptoms may include:\nBreaking rules without clear reason\nCruel or aggressive behavior toward people or animals (for example: bullying, fighting, using dangerous weapons, forcing sexual activity, and stealing)\nNot going to school (truancy, beginning before age 13)\nHeavy alcohol or drug use\nIntentionally setting fires\nLying to get a favor or avoid things they have to do\nRunning away\nVandalizing or destroying property\nThese children often:\nMake no effort to hide their aggressive behaviors\nLack guilt and empathy\nDon't care about their poor performance in school and work\nDon't express emotions\nUse false emotions for gains\nHave a hard time making real friends\nExams and Tests\nThere is no real test for diagnosing conduct disorder."}

The diagnosis is made when a child or teen has a history of conduct disorder behaviors.\nA physical exam and blood tests can help check for medical conditions that are similar to conduct disorder. In rare cases, a brain scan helps check for other disorders.\nTreatment\nFor treatment to be successful, it must be started early. The child's family also needs to be involved. Parents can learn techniques to help manage their child's problem behavior.\nSome therapies used are:\nParental management training (PMT)\nFunctional family therapy\nParenting- or school-based training\nCognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)\nIn cases of abuse, the child may need to be removed from the family and placed in a less chaotic or damaging home."}

Treatment with medicines or therapy may be used for symptoms of conduct disorder, depression, attention-deficit disorder, or other diagnosed conditions.\nMany behavioral modification schools, wilderness programs, and boot camps are sold to parents as solutions for conduct disorder. There is no research to support these programs. Research does suggest that treating children at home, along with their families, is more effective.\nChildren who are diagnosed and treated early usually overcome their behavioral problems.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nChildren who have severe or frequent symptoms and who are not able to complete treatment tend to have the poorest outlook.\nPossible Complications\nChildren with conduct disorder may go on to develop personality disorders as adults, particularly\nantisocial personality disorder\n. As their behaviors worsen, these individuals may also develop problems with drug use and the law.\nDepression and bipolar disorder may develop in the teen years and early adulthood."}
