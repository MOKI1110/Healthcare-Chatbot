Two arteries and one vein in the umbilical cord carry blood back and forth. If the newborn baby is ill right after birth, a catheter may be placed.\nA catheter is a long, soft, hollow tube. An umbilical artery catheter (UAC) allows blood to be taken from an infant at different times, without repeated needle sticks. It can also be used to continuously monitor a baby's blood pressure.\nA UAC is most often used if:\nThe baby needs breathing help.\nThe baby needs blood gases and blood pressure monitored.\nThe baby needs strong medicines for blood pressure.\nAn umbilical venous catheter (UVC) allows fluids and medicines to be given without frequently replacing an intravenous (IV) line.\nA UVC may be used if:\nThe baby is very premature.\nThe baby has bowel problems that prevent feeding.\nThe baby needs very strong medicines.\nThe baby needs exchange transfusion.\nHOW ARE UMBILICAL CATHETERS PLACED?\nThere are normally two umbilical arteries and one umbilical vein in"}

After the umbilical cord is cut off, the health care provider can find these blood vessels. The catheters are placed into the blood vessel, and an x-ray is taken to determine the final position. Once the catheters are in the right position, they are held in place with silk thread. Sometimes, the catheters are taped to the baby's belly area.\nWHAT ARE THE RISKS OF UMBILICAL CATHETERS?\nComplications include:\nInterruption of the blood flow to an organ (intestines, kidney, liver) or limb (leg or rear end)\nBlood clot along the catheter\nInfection\nBlood flow and blood clot problems can be life threatening and require removal of the UAC. The neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) nurses carefully monitor your baby for these possible problems.\nAlternative Names\nUAC; UVC\nImages\nUmbilical catheter\nReferences\nDel Valle RolÃ³n ME.
