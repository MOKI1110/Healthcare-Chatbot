This article discusses cryotherapy of the skin.\nDescription\nCryotherapy is done using a cotton swab that has been dipped into liquid nitrogen or a probe that has liquid nitrogen flowing through it.\nThe procedure is done in your health care provider's office. It usually takes less than a minute.\nThe freezing may cause some discomfort. Your provider may apply a numbing medicine to the area first.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nCryotherapy or cryosurgery may be used to:\nRemove\nwarts\nDestroy precancerous skin lesions (actinic keratoses or solar keratoses)\nIn rare cases, cryotherapy is used to treat some skin cancers.
