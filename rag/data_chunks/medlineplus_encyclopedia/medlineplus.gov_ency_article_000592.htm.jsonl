It affects B lymphocyte cells, a type of white blood cell.\nCauses\nHCL is caused by the abnormal growth of certain B cells. The cells look \"hairy\" under the microscope because they have fine projections extending from their surface.\nHCL usually leads to a low number of normal blood cells.\nThe cause of this disease is unknown. Certain genetic changes in the cancer cells may be the cause. It affects men more often than women. The average age of diagnosis is 55.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of HCL may include any of the following:\nEasy\nbruising\nor bleeding\nHeavy sweating (especially at night)\nFatigue\nand weakness\nFeeling full after eating only a small amount\nRecurrent infections and fevers\nPain or fullness in the upper left belly (\nenlarged spleen\n)\nSwollen lymph glands\nWeight loss\nExams and Tests\nDuring a physical exam, your health care provider may be able to feel a\nswollen spleen\nor liver."}

An\nabdominal CT scan\nor\nultrasound\nmay be done to evaluate this swelling.\nBlood tests that may be done include:\nComplete blood count\n(CBC) to check low levels of white and red blood cells, as well as\nplatelets\n.\nBlood tests and a\nbone marrow biopsy\nto check for hairy cells.\nTreatment\nTreatment may not be needed for the early stages of this disease. Some people may need an occasional blood transfusion.\nIf treatment is needed because of very low blood counts,\nchemotherapy\nmedicines can be used.\nIn most cases, chemotherapy can relieve the symptoms for many years. When the signs and symptoms go away, you are said to be in remission.\nRemoving the spleen\nmay improve blood counts, but is unlikely to cure the disease. Antibiotics can be used to treat infections."}

People with low blood counts may receive growth factors and, possibly, transfusions.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people with HCL can expect to live 10 years or longer after diagnosis and treatment.\nPossible Complications\nThe low blood counts caused by hairy cell leukemia can lead to:\nInfections\nFatigue\nExcessive bleeding\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you have major bleeding. Also contact your provider if you have signs of infection, such as a persistent\nfever\n,\ncough\n, or\ngeneral ill feeling\n.\nPrevention\nThere is no known way to prevent this disease.\nAlternative Names\nLeukemic reticuloendotheliosis; HCL; Leukemia - hairy cell\nImages\nBone marrow aspiration\nHairy cell leukemia - microscopic view\nEnlarged spleen\nReferences\nNational Cancer Institute website.
