Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRenin blood test\nRenin blood test\nThe renin test measures the level of renin in blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample is needed\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nCertain medicines may affect the results of this test. Your health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines. Do not stop any medicine before talking to your provider.\nMedicines that can affect renin measurements include:\nBirth control pills.\nBlood pressure drugs.\nMedicines that dilate blood vessels (vasodilators). These are usually used to treat high blood pressure or heart failure.\nWater pills (diuretics).\nYour provider may instruct you to limit your sodium intake before the test.\nBe aware that renin level can be affected by pregnancy, as well as the time of day and the body position when blood is drawn.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nRenin is a protein (\nenzyme\n) released by special kidney cells when you have a decreased salt (sodium) level or low blood volume. Most often, the renin blood test is done at the same time as an aldosterone blood test to calculate the renin to aldosterone ratio.\nIf you have\nhigh blood pressure\n, your doctor may order a renin and\naldosterone\ntest to help determine the cause of your elevated blood pressure. Test results can help guide your doctor in choosing the correct treatment.\nNormal Results\nFor normal sodium diet, normal value range is 0.2 to 1.6 ng/mL/hour (0.2 to 1.6  µg/L/hour) while lying down and 0.5 to 4.0 ng/mL/hour (0.5 to 4.0  µg/L/hour) while standing.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA high level of renin may be due to:\nAdrenal glands that do not make enough hormones (\nAddison disease\nor other adrenal gland insufficiency)\nBleeding (hemorrhage)\nHeart failure\nHigh blood pressure caused by narrowing of the kidney arteries (\nrenovascular hypertension\n)\nLiver scarring and poor liver function (\ncirrhosis\n)\nLoss of body fluid (dehydration)\nLow salt diet\nKidney damage that creates\nnephrotic syndrome\nKidney tumors that produce renin\nSudden and very high blood pressure (\nmalignant hypertension\n)\nA low level of renin may be due to:\nAdrenal glands that release too much aldosterone hormone (\nhyperaldosteronism\n)\nHigh blood pressure that is salt-sensitive\nHigh salt diet\nTreatment with antidiuretic hormone\n(ADH)\nTreatment with steroid medicines that cause the body to retain salt\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken."}

Veins and arteries vary in size from one patient to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nPlasma renin activity; Random plasma renin; PRA\nImages\nKidney - blood and urine flow\nBlood test\nReferences\nGuber HA, Oprea M, Russell YX.
