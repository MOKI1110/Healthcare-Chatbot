It is done in order to treat symptoms of an\nenlarged prostate\n.\nDescription\nThe surgery takes about 1 to 2 hours.\nYou will be given medicine before surgery so you don't feel pain. You may get general anesthesia in which you are asleep and pain-free or spinal anesthesia in which you are awake, but numb from the waist and below.\nYour surgeon will insert a scope through the tube that carries urine from your bladder out of the penis. This instrument is called the resectoscope. A special cutting tool is placed through the scope. It is used to remove the inside part of your prostate gland using electricity.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nYour health care provider may recommend this surgery if you have benign prostatic hyperplasia (\nBPH\n). The prostate gland often grows larger as men get older. The larger prostate may cause problems with urinating."}

In some cases, you may be allowed to go home the same day.\nAfter surgery, you will have a small tube, called a\nFoley catheter\n, in your bladder to remove urine. Your bladder may be flushed with fluids (irrigated) to keep it clear of clots. The urine will look bloody at first. In most cases, the blood goes away within a few days. Blood can also seep around the catheter. A special solution may be used to flush out the catheter and keep it from getting clogged with blood. The catheter will be removed within 1 to 3 days for most people.\nYou will be able to go back to eating a normal diet right away.\nYour health care team will:\nHelp you change positions in bed.\nTeach you exercises to keep blood flowing.\nTeach you how to perform coughing and deep breathing techniques."}
