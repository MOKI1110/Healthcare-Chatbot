Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPBG urine test\nPBG urine test\nPorphobilinogen (PBG) is one of several types of porphyrins found in your body. Porphyrins help form many important substances in the body. One of these is\nhemoglobin\n, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen in the blood. Porphyrins usually leave your body through urine or stools. If this process does not occur, porphyrins such as PBG can build up in your body.\nThis article describes the test to measure the amount of PBG in a urine sample.\nHow the Test is Performed\nAfter you provide a urine sample, it is tested in the lab. This is called a random urine sample.\nIf needed, your health care provider may ask you to\ncollect your urine at home over 24 hours\n. This is called a 24-hour urine sample. Your provider will tell you how to do this. Follow instructions exactly.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider may tell you to temporarily stop taking medicines that may affect the test results. Be sure to tell your provider about all the medicines you take."}

Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens."}
