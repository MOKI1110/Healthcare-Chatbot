Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBone lesion biopsy\nBone lesion biopsy\nA bone lesion biopsy is the removal of a piece of bone or bone marrow for examination.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is done in the following way:\nAn\nx-ray\n,\nCT\nor\nMRI\nscan is likely used to guide the exact placement of the biopsy instrument.\nYour surgeon applies a numbing medicine (local anesthetic) to the area.\nA small cut is then made in the skin.\nA special drill needle is often used. This needle is gently inserted through the cut, then pushed and twisted into the bone.\nOnce the sample is obtained, the needle is twisted out.\nPressure is applied to the site. Once bleeding stops, stitches are applied, and covered with a bandage.\nThe sample is sent to a lab for examination.\nBone biopsy may also be done under general anesthesia to remove a larger sample. Then surgery to remove the bone can be done if the biopsy exam shows that there is an abnormal growth or\ncancer\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nFollow your surgeon's instructions on how to prepare."}

This may include not eating and drinking for several hours before the procedure. If you take any blood thinners, please make sure you stop them ahead of the procedure.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWith a needle biopsy, you may feel some discomfort and pressure, even though a local anesthetic is used. You must remain still during the procedure.\nAfter the biopsy, the area may be sore or tender for several days.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe most common reasons for bone lesion biopsy are to tell the difference between cancerous and noncancerous bone tumors and to identify other bone or bone marrow problems."}
