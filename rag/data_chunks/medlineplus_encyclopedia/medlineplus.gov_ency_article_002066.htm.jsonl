Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCharley horse\nCharley horse\nA charley horse is the common name for a muscle spasm or cramp. Muscle spasms can occur in any muscle in the body, but often happen in the leg. When a muscle is in spasm, it contracts without your control and does not relax.\nCauses\nMuscle spasms often occur when a muscle is overused or injured. Things that might bring on a muscle spasm include:\nExercising when you have not had enough fluids (you're dehydrated).\nHaving low levels of minerals such as potassium or calcium.\nSome spasms occur because the nerve that connects to a muscle is irritated. One example is when a herniated disk irritates the spinal nerves and causes pain and spasm in the back muscles.\nSpasms in the calf often occur while kicking during swimming or running. They can also happen at night when you are in bed. Upper leg spasms are more common with running or jumping activities. Spasm in the neck (cervical spine) can be a sign of stress.\nSymptoms\nWhen a muscle goes into spasm it feels very tight. It is sometimes described as a knot."}

Spasm in the neck (cervical spine) can be a sign of stress.\nSymptoms\nWhen a muscle goes into spasm it feels very tight. It is sometimes described as a knot. The pain can be severe.\nExams and Tests\nTo diagnose a spasm, your health care provider will look for tight or hard muscles that are very tender to the touch. There are no imaging studies or blood tests for this condition. If the spasm is caused by nerve irritation, such as in the back, an MRI may be helpful to find the cause of the problem.\nTreatment\nStop your activity and try stretching and massaging the affected muscle at the first sign of a spasm.\nHeat will relax the muscle at first. Ice may be helpful after the first spasm and when the pain has improved.\nIf the muscle is still sore after heat and ice, you can use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (such as ibuprofen or naproxen) to help with pain. In more severe cases, your provider can prescribe antispasm medicines.\nAfter you get treated, your provider should look for the cause of the spasm so that it doesn't happen again."}

If an irritated nerve is involved, you might need physical therapy or even surgery.\nDrinking water or sports drinks when exercising can help ease cramps due to dehydration. If drinking water alone is not enough, salt tablets or sports drinks may help replace minerals in your body.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMuscle spasms will get better with rest and time. The outlook is excellent for most people. Learning how to exercise properly with the right training and enough fluid intake can prevent spasms from occurring regularly.\nYou might need other treatments if an irritated nerve caused the spasm."}
