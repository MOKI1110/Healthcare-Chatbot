The infection worsens over time, causing breakdown and loss of the ligaments, soft tissues, and bone (supporting structures) of your teeth. This loss of support causes the teeth to become loose and eventually fall out. Periodontitis is the primary cause of tooth loss in adults. This disorder is uncommon in young children, but it increases during the teen years.\nPlaque and tartar build up on the teeth. Inflammation results from this buildup and causes a normal \"sulcus\" to deepen into an abnormal \"pocket,\" or gap between the gums and the teeth below the gum line. This pocket collects more plaque and transforms into a hard material called tartar. The bacteria in the plaque and tartar get trapped in the pockets and receive less oxygen."}

These anaerobes trigger the body's inflammatory response, which leads to the natural destruction of the support for your teeth. Periodontal disease is a painless, chronic inflammatory disease, which if not treated, often leads to tooth mobility and tooth loss\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of periodontitis include:\nBad\nbreath odor\n(halitosis)\nGums that are bright red or reddish-purple\nGums that look shiny\nGums that bleed easily\n(when flossing or brushing)\nGums that are tender when touched but are painless otherwise\nGums that have receded\nLoose teeth\nSwollen gums\nGaps between the teeth and gums\nShifting teeth\nYellow, brown green or white hard deposits on your teeth\nTooth sensitivity\nNote: Early symptoms are similar to gingivitis (inflammation of the gums).\nExams and Tests\nYour dentist will examine your mouth and teeth.

In most cases, the gums are painless or only mildly tender, unless a\ntooth abscess\nis also present. Your gums will be tender when checking your pockets with a probe. Your teeth may be loose and gums may be pulled back, exposing the base of your teeth.\nDental x-rays\nshow the loss of supporting bone.

This may involve the use of various tools to loosen and remove plaque and tartar from your teeth.
