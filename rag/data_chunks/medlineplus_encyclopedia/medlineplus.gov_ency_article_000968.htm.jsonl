It usually does not itch.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask questions about the child's medical history. The child may have swollen lymph nodes in the neck or back of the scalp.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for roseola. The disease most often gets better on its own without complications.\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) and cool sponge baths can help reduce the fever. Some children may have seizures when they get a high fever."}
