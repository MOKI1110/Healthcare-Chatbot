Why get vaccinated?\nPneumococcal conjugate vaccine\ncan prevent\npneumococcal disease.\nPneumococcal disease\nrefers to any illness caused by pneumococcal bacteria. These bacteria can cause many types of illnesses, including:\nPneumonia, (infection of the lungs)\nEar infections\nSinus infections\nMeningitis (infection of the tissue covering the brain and spinal cord)\nBacteremia (bloodstream infection)\nAnyone can get pneumococcal disease, but young children, older adults, and people with certain risk factors are at the highest risk.\nMost pneumococcal infections are mild. However, some can result in long-term problems, such as brain damage or hearing loss. Meningitis, bacteremia, and pneumonia caused by pneumococcal disease can lead to death.\n2."}

Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine\nPneumococcal conjugate vaccine helps protect against bacteria that cause pneumococcal disease. There are several pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs). The specific PCV and number of doses recommended are based on a person's age, vaccination history, and medical status. Your health care provider can help you determine which type of PCV, and how many doses, should be received.\nInfants and young children\nusually need 4 doses of PCV. These doses are recommended, at 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age.\nCertain\nolder children and adolescents\nwho did not receive the recommended doses as infants or young children need PCV. This depends on age and medical conditions, or other risk factors.\nAdults 19 through 49 years old\nwho have not received PCV and have certain medical conditions or other risk factors should receive PCV."}

Some adults in this group who have already received PCV might be recommended to receive another dose.\nAdults 50 years or older\nwho have not previously received PCV should receive a PCV vaccine. Some adults in this group who have already received PCV might be recommended to receive another dose.\n3. Talk with your health care provider\nTell your vaccination provider if the person getting the vaccine:\nHas had an\nallergic reaction after a previous dose of any type of PCV, or to any vaccine containing diphtheria toxoid\n(for example, DTaP), or has any\nsevere, life-threatening allergies.\nIn some cases, your health care provider may decide to postpone PCV until a future visit.\nPeople with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover.\nYour health care provider can give you more information.\n4."}

Risks of a vaccine reaction\nRedness, swelling, pain, or tenderness where the shot is given; fever; loss of appetite; fussiness (irritability); tiredness; headache; muscle aches; joint pain; or chills can happen after pneumococcal conjugate vaccination.\nYoung children may be at increased risk for seizures caused by fever after a pneumococcal conjugate vaccine if it is administered at the same time as inactivated influenza vaccine. Ask your health care provider for more information.\nPeople sometimes faint after medical procedures, including vaccination. Tell your provider if you feel dizzy or have vision changes or ringing in the ears.\nAs with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction, other serious injury, or death.\n5. What if there is a serious problem?\nAn allergic reaction could occur after the vaccinated person leaves the clinic."}

If you see signs of a severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, or weakness), call\n9-1-1\nand get the person to the nearest hospital.\nFor other signs that concern you, call your health care provider.\nAdverse reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your health care provider will usually file this report, or you can do it yourself. Visit the\nVAERS website\nor call\n1-800-822-7967\n.\nVAERS is only for reporting reactions, and VAERS staff members do not give medical advice\n.\n6. The National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program\nThe National Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) is a federal program that was created to compensate people who may have been injured by certain vaccines. Claims regarding alleged injury or death due to vaccination have a time limit for filing, which may be as short as two years."}
