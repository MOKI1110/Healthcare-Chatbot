There is most often only one, and it is usually found on the face, scalp, belly, back, or chest. It occurs most often in people 60 years old or older. Rarely, it may be a sign of a serious internal disease.\nIf you have several small bumps of the sebaceous glands, this is called sebaceous hyperplasia. Such bumps are harmless in most cases, and often found on the face. They are not a sign of serious disease. They are more common with age. They may be treated if you do not like how they look.\nAlternative Names\nSebaceous hyperplasia; Hyperplasia - sebaceous; Adenoma - sebaceous\nImages\nSebaceous adenoma\nHair follicle sebaceous gland\nReferences\nCalonje E, Brenn T, Lazar AJ, Billings SD.
