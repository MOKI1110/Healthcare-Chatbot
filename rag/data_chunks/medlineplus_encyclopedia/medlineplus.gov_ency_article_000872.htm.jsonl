It often follows this pattern:\nIt may start when something rubs, irritates, or scratches the skin, such as clothing.\nThe person begins to rub or scratch the itchy area. Constant scratching (often during sleep) causes the skin to thicken.\nThe thickened skin itches, and this leads to more scratching."}
