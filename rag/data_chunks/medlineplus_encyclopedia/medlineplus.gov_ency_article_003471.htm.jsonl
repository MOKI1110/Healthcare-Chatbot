Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLactate dehydrogenase test\nLactate dehydrogenase test\nLactate dehydrogenase (LDH) is a protein that helps produce energy in the body. An LDH test measures the amount of LDH in the blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo specific preparation is necessary.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nLDH is most often measured to check for tissue damage. LDH is in many body tissues, especially the heart, liver, kidney, muscles, brain, blood cells, and lungs.\nOther conditions for which the test may be done include:\nLow red blood cell count (\nanemia\n)\nCancer, including blood cancer (\nleukemia\n) or lymph cancer (lymphoma)\nNormal Results\nNormal value range is 125 to 220 international units per liter (IU/L).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}

Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA higher-than-normal level may indicate:\nBlood flow deficiency (ischemia)\nHeart attack\nHemolytic anemia\nInfectious mononucleosis\nLeukemia or lymphoma\nLiver disease\n(for example,\nhepatitis\n)\nLow blood pressure\nMuscle injury\nMuscle weakness and loss of muscle tissue (\nmuscular dystrophy\n)\nNew abnormal tissue formation (usually cancer)\nPancreatitis\nStroke\nTissue death\nIf your LDH level is high, your provider may recommend an\nLDH isoenzymes test\nto determine the location of any tissue damage.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
