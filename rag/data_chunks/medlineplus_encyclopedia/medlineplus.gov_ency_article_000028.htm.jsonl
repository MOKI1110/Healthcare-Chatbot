Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHead injury - first aid\nHead injury - first aid\nA head injury is any trauma to the scalp, skull, or brain.\nHead injury can be either closed or open (penetrating).\nA closed head injury means you received a hard blow to the head from striking an object, but the object did not penetrate the skull.\nAn open, or penetrating, head injury means you were hit with an object that broke the skull and entered the brain. This is more likely to happen when you move at a high speed, such as going through the windshield during a car accident. It can also happen from a gunshot to the head.\nHead injuries include:\nConcussion\n, most often in which the brain has been shaken, is the most common type of traumatic brain injury.\nScalp wounds.\nSkull fractures.\nHead injuries may cause bleeding:\nIn the brain tissue\nIn the layers that surround the brain (\nsubarachnoid hemorrhage\n,\nsubdural hematoma\n,\nepidural hematoma\n)\nHead injury is a common reason for an emergency room visit.

A large number of people who suffer head injuries are children. Each year an estimated 1.5 million Americans sustain a traumatic brain injury (TBI). As a consequence of these injuries, 230,000 people are hospitalized and survive.\nCauses\nCommon causes of head injury include:\nAccidents at home, work, outdoors, or while playing sports\nFalls\nPhysical assault\nTraffic accidents\nMost of these injuries are minor because the skull protects the brain. Some injuries are severe enough to require a stay in the hospital.\nSymptoms\nHead injuries may cause bleeding in the brain tissue and the layers that surround the brain (subarachnoid hemorrhage, subdural hematoma, epidural hematoma).\nSymptoms of a head injury can occur right away or may develop slowly over several hours or days. Even if the skull is not fractured, the brain can hit the inside of the skull and be bruised."}

Even if the skull is not fractured, the brain can hit the inside of the skull and be bruised. The head may look fine, but problems could result from bleeding or swelling inside the skull.\nThe spinal cord is also likely to be injured from falls from a significant height or ejection from a vehicle.\nSome head injuries cause changes in brain function. This is called a traumatic brain injury. A concussion is a type of traumatic brain injury.\nSymptoms of a concussion\ncan range from mild to severe.\nFirst Aid\nLearning to recognize a serious head injury and give basic first aid can save someone's life."}

Cover the wound with sterile gauze dressing.\nIf the person is vomiting or about to vomit, to prevent choking, roll the person's head, neck, and body as one unit while stabilizing the head and neck onto their side.
