Salivary duct stones are a type of\nsalivary gland disorder\n.\nCauses\nSpit (saliva) is produced by the salivary glands in the mouth. The chemicals in saliva can form a hard crystal that can block the salivary ducts.\nWhen saliva cannot exit a blocked duct, it backs up into the gland. This may cause pain, swelling, or an infection of the gland.\nThere are three pairs of major salivary glands:\nParotid glands -- These are the two largest glands. One is located in each cheek over the jaw in front of the ears. Inflammation of one or more of these glands is called parotitis, or parotiditis.\nSubmandibular glands -- These two glands are located just under both sides of the jaw and carry saliva up to the floor of mouth under the tongue.\nSublingual glands -- These two glands are located just under the front area of the floor of the mouth.\nSalivary stones most often affect the submandibular glands."}

The provider may be able to find the stone during the exam by feeling under your tongue.\nTests such as x-rays, ultrasound, MRI scan, or CT scan of the face are used to confirm the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nThe goal is to remove the stone.\nSteps you can take at home include:\nDrinking lots of water\nUsing sugar-free lemon drops to increase the amount of saliva\nOther ways to remove the stone are:\nMassaging the gland with heat -- The provider or dentist may be able to push the stone out of the duct.\nIn some cases, you may need surgery to cut out the stone.\nA newer treatment that uses shock waves to break the stone into small pieces is another option.\nA technique called sialendoscopy, can diagnose and treat stones in the salivary gland duct using very small cameras and instruments.\nIf stones become infected or come back often, you may need surgery to remove the salivary gland.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost of the time, salivary duct stones cause only pain or discomfort, but at times become infected.\nW"}
