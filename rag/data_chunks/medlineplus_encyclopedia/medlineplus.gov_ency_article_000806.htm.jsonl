It usually occurs in people with a brain function problem who also don't have a regular routine during the day. The total sleep time is normal, but the body clock loses its normal circadian cycle.\nPeople with changing work shifts and travelers who often change time zones may also have these symptoms. These people have a different condition, such as shift work sleep disorder or\njet lag syndrome\n.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include any of the following:\nSleeping or napping more than usual during the day\nTrouble falling asleep and staying asleep at night\nWaking up often during the night\nExams and Tests\nA person must have at least 3 abnormal sleep-wake episodes during a 24-hour period to be diagnosed with this problem. The time between episodes is usually 1 to 4 hours.\nIf the diagnosis is not clear, your health care provider may prescribe a device called an actigraph."}

The time between episodes is usually 1 to 4 hours.\nIf the diagnosis is not clear, your health care provider may prescribe a device called an actigraph. The device looks like a wristwatch, and it can tell when a person is sleeping or awake.\nYour provider may ask you to keep a sleep diary. This is a record of what times you go to bed and wake up. The diary allows your provider to assess your sleep-wake cycle patterns.\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to help the person return to a normal sleep-wake cycle. This may involve:\nSetting up a regular daytime schedule of activities and mealtimes.\nNot staying in bed during the day.\nUsing bright light therapy in the morning and taking melatonin at bedtime. (In older people, especially those with dementia, sedatives such as melatonin are not advised.)\nMaking sure the room is dark and quiet at night.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome is often good with treatment. But some people continue to have this disorder, even with treatment.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nMost people have sleep disturbances on occasion."}
