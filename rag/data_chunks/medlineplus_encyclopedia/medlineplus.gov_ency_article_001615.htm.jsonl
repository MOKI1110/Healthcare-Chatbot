The lens of the eye is normally clear. It focuses light that comes into the eye onto the\nretina\n.\nCauses\nUnlike most cataracts, which occur with aging, congenital cataracts are present at birth.\nCongenital cataracts are rare. In most people, no cause can be found.\nCongenital cataracts often occur as part of the following birth defects:\nChondrodysplasia syndrome\nCongenital rubella\nConradi-HÃ¼nermann syndrome\nDown syndrome (trisomy 21)\nEctodermal dysplasia\nsyndrome\nFamilial congenital cataracts\nGalactosemia\nHallermann-Streiff syndrome\nLowe syndrome\nMarinesco-SjÃ¶gren syndrome\nPierre-Robin syndrome\nTrisomy 13\nSymptoms\nCongenital cataracts most often look different than other forms of cataract.\nSymptoms may include:\nAn infant does not seem to be visually aware of the world around them (if cataracts are in both eyes)\nGray or white cloudiness of the pupil (which is normally black)\nThe \"red eye\" glow (red reflex) of the pupil is missing in"}

The infant may also need to be examined by a pediatrician who is experienced in treating inherited disorders. Blood tests or\nx-rays\nmay also be needed.\nTreatment\nIf congenital cataracts are mild and do not affect vision, they may not need to be treated, especially if they are in both eyes.\nModerate to severe cataracts that affect vision, or a cataract that is in only 1 eye, will need to be treated with\ncataract removal\nsurgery. In most (noncongenital) cataract surgeries, an artificial intraocular lens (IOL) is inserted into the eye. The use of IOLs in infants is controversial."}

In most (noncongenital) cataract surgeries, an artificial intraocular lens (IOL) is inserted into the eye. The use of IOLs in infants is controversial. Without an IOL, the infant will need to wear a contact lens.\nPatching to force the child to use the weaker eye is often needed to prevent\namblyopia\n.\nThe infant may also need to be treated for the inherited disorder that has caused the cataracts.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nRemoving a congenital cataract is usually a safe, effective procedure. The child will need follow-up for vision rehabilitation. Most infants with congenital cataract in one eye have some level of \"lazy eye\" (amblyopia) and will need to use patching after the surgery in an attempt to reverse it.\nPossible Complications\nWith cataract surgery there is a very slight risk of:\nBleeding\nInfection\nInflammation\nInfants who have surgery for congenital cataracts are likely to develop another type of cataract, which may need further surgery or laser treatment.\nMany of the diseases that are associated with congenital cataract can also affect other organs.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall for an urgent appointment with your bab"}
