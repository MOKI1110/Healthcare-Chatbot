The medicine can help relieve pain and inflammation. It can also help diagnose the source of hip pain.\nDescription\nFor this procedure, a health care provider inserts a needle in the hip area and injects medicine into the hip joint. In most cases, the provider uses a real-time x-ray (fluoroscopy) or ultrasound to see where to place the needle in the joint.\nYou may be given medicine to help you relax.\nFor the procedure:\nYou will lie on the x-ray table, and your hip area will be cleaned.\nA numbing medicine will be applied to the injection site.\nA small needle will be guided into the joint area while the provider watches the placement on the x-ray or ultrasound screen.\nOnce the needle is in the right spot, a small amount of contrast dye is injected so the provider can see where the medicine will be placed.\nThe medicine (usually a combination of a local anesthetic and a steroid) is slowly injected into the joint.\nAfter the injection, you will remain on the t"}

Your provider will then ask you to move the hip to see if it is still painful. You may have pain relief almost immediately. The hip joint will become more painful afterwards when the numbing medicine has worn off. It may be a few days before you notice any pain relief from the steroids that were given.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nHip joint injection is done to reduce hip pain caused by problems in the bones or cartilage of your hip joint. The hip pain is often caused by:\nBursitis\nArthritis\nLabral tear (a tear in the cartilage that is attached to the rim of the hip socket bone)\nInjury to the hip joint or surrounding area\nOveruse or strain from running or other activities\nA hip joint injection can also help diagnose hip pain."}

If the shot does not relieve pain right after the injection of the numbing medicine or within a few days, then the hip joint may not be the source of hip pain.\nRisks\nRisks are rare, but may include:\nBruising\nSwelling\nSkin irritation\nAllergic reaction to medicine\nInfection\nBleeding in the joint\nWeakness in the leg\nBefore the Procedure\nTell your provider about:\nAny health problems\nAny allergies\nMedicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines\nAny blood thinner medicines, such as aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin), dabigatran (Pradaxa), apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), or clopidogrel (Plavix)\nPlan ahead to have someone drive you home after the procedure.\nAfter the Procedure\nAfter the injection, follow any specific instructions your provider gives you."}

How long the shot lasts varies from person to person, and depends on the cause of the pain. For some, it can last weeks or months.\nAlternative Names\nCortisone shot - hip; Hip injection; Intra-articular steroid injections - hip\nImages\nNormal hip joint anatomy\nReferences\nAmerican College of Rheumatology website."}
