Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRetinal artery occlusion\nRetinal artery occlusion\nRetinal artery occlusion is a blockage in one of the small arteries that carry blood to the\nretina\n. The retina is a layer of tissue in the back of the eye that is able to sense light.\nCauses\nRetinal arteries may become blocked when a\nblood clot\nor fat deposits get stuck in the arteries. These blockages are more likely if there is hardening of the arteries (\natherosclerosis\n) in the eye.\nClots may travel from other parts of the body and block an artery in the retina."}

These blockages are more likely if there is hardening of the arteries (\natherosclerosis\n) in the eye.\nClots may travel from other parts of the body and block an artery in the retina. The most common sources of clots are the heart and carotid artery in the neck.\nMost blockages occur in people with conditions such as:\nCarotid artery disease\n, in which the two large blood vessels in the neck become narrowed or blocked\nDiabetes\nHeart rhythm problem (mainly\natrial fibrillation\n)\nHeart valve problem\nHigh levels of fat in the blood (hyperlipidemia)\nHigh blood pressure\nIntravenous drug abuse\nTemporal arteritis\n(inflammation of arteries due to an immune response)\nIf a branch of the retinal artery is blocked, part of the retina will not receive enough blood and oxygen. If this happens, you may lose part of your vision.\nSymptoms\nSudden blurring or loss of vision may occur in:\nAll of one eye (central retinal artery occlusion or CRAO)\nPart of one eye (branch retinal artery occlusion or BRAO)\nThe retinal artery occlusion may last for only a few seconds or minutes, or it may be permanent.\nA blood clot in the eye may be a warning sign of clots elsewhere."}

However, the benefit of these treatments has never been proven, and they are rarely used.\nBreathing in (inhaling) a carbon dioxide-oxygen mixture. This treatment causes the arteries of the retina to widen (dilate).\nMassage of the eye.\nRemoval of fluid from within the eye. An eye doctor uses a needle to drain a small amount of fluid from the front of the eye. This causes a sudden drop in eye pressure, which can sometimes cause the clot to move into a smaller branch artery where it will cause less damage.\nThe clot-busting drug, tissue plasminogen activator (tPA).\nThe health care provider should look for the cause of the blockage."}

These include:\nEating a low-fat diet\nExercising\nStopping smoking\nLosing weight if you are overweight\nSometimes, blood thinners may be used to prevent the artery from becoming blocked again.
