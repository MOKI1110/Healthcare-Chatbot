The sap may be on the plant, in the ashes of burned plants, on an animal, or on other objects that came in contact with the plant, such as clothing, garden tools, and sports equipment.\nSmall amounts of sap can remain under a person's fingernails for several days. It must be purposely removed with thorough cleaning.\nPlants in this family are strong and hard to get rid of. They are found in every state of the continental United States. These plants grow best along cool streams and lakes. They grow especially well in areas that are sunny and hot. They do not survive well above 1,500 m (5,000 feet), in deserts, or in rainforests.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure."}

Quickly washing the area can prevent a reaction. However, it most often does not help if done more than 1 hour after touching the plant's sap. Flush the eyes out with water for at least 15 minutes. Take care to clean under the fingernails well to remove traces of toxin.\nCarefully wash any contaminated objects or clothing alone in hot soapy water. DO NOT let the items touch any other clothing or materials.\nAn over-the-counter steroid cream may help relieve itching. Over the counter antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) may be used, but are of limited benefit."}
