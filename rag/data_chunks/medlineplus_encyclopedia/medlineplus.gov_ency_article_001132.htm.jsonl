Possible causes may include any of the following:\nAn enlarged opening due to relaxed muscles in the pelvic floor, which is formed of muscles around the rectum\nLoose muscles of the anal sphincter\nAn abnormally long colon\nDownward movement of the abdominal cavity between the rectum and uterus\nProlapse of the small intestine\nConstipation\nDiarrhea\nChronic coughing and sneezing\nA prolapse can be partial or complete:\nWith a partial prolapse, the inner lining of the rectum bulges partly from the anus.\nWith a complete prolapse, the entire rectum bulges through the anus.\nRectal prolapse occurs most often in children under age 6 years."}

Health problems that may lead to prolapse include:\nCystic fibrosis\nIntestinal worm infections\nLong-term diarrhea\nOther health problems present at birth\nIn adults, it is usually found with constipation, or with a muscle or nerve problem in the pelvic or genital area.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom is a reddish-colored mass that sticks out from the opening of the anus, especially after a bowel movement. This reddish mass is actually the inner lining of the rectum. It may bleed slightly and can be uncomfortable and painful.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam, which will include a\nrectal exam\n. To check for prolapse, the provider may ask the person to bear down while sitting on a toilet.\nTests that may be done include:\nColonoscopy\nto confirm the diagnosis\nBlood test\nto check for anemia if there is bleeding from the rectum\nTreatment\nContact your provider if a rectal prolapse occurs.\nIn some cases, the prolapse can be treated at home."}

Follow your provider's instructions on how to do this. The rectum must be pushed back inside manually. A soft, warm, wet cloth is used to apply gentle pressure to the mass to push it back through the anal opening. The person should lie on one side in a knee-chest position before applying pressure. This position allows gravity to help put the rectum back into position.\nImmediate surgery is rarely needed. In children, treating the cause often solves the problem. For example, if the cause is straining because of dry stools, laxatives may help. If the prolapse continues, surgery may be needed.\nIn adults, the only cure for rectal prolapse is a\nprocedure\nthat repairs the weakened anal sphincter and pelvic muscles.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn children, treating the cause cures rectal prolapse."}
