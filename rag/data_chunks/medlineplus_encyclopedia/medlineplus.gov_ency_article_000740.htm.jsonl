Many disorders may cause delirium. Often, these disorders do not allow the brain to get oxygen or other substances. They may also cause dangerous chemicals (toxins) to build up in the brain. Delirium is common in the intensive care unit (ICU), especially in older adults.\nCauses include:\nAlcohol or medicine overdose or withdrawal\nDrug use or overdose, including being sedated in the ICU\nElectrolyte\nor other body chemical disturbances\nInfections such as\nurinary tract infections\n,\npneumonia\n, or meningitis\nSevere lack of sleep\nPoisons\nGeneral anesthesia and surgery\nAutoimmune disease\nSymptoms\nDelirium involves a quick change between mental states (for example, from\nlethargy\nto\nagitation\nand back to lethargy).\nSymptoms include:\nChanges in alertness\n(usually more alert in the morning, less alert at night)\nChanges in feeling (se"}

Treatment depends on the condition causing delirium. The person may need to stay in the hospital for a short time.\nStopping or changing medicines that may worsen confusion, or that are no longer needed, may improve mental function.\nDisorders that contribute to confusion should be treated. These may include:\nAnemia\nDecreased oxygen (\nhypoxia\n)\nHeart failure\nHigh carbon dioxide levels (hypercapnia)\nInfections\nKidney failure\nLiver failure\nMetabolic disorders\nNutritional disorders\nPsychiatric conditions (such as\ndepression\nor\npsychosis\n)\nThyroid disorders\nTreating medical and mental disorders often greatly improves mental function.\nMedicines may be needed to control aggressive or agitated behaviors."}

In hospitalized people, avoiding or using a low dosage of sedatives, prompt treatment of metabolic disorders and infections, and using reality orientation programs will reduce the risk of delirium in those at high risk.\nAlternative Names\nAcute confusional state; Acute brain syndrome\nImages\nCentral nervous system and peripheral nervous system\nBrain\nReferences\nInouye SK.
