Poisoning may occur if you breathe in ammonia. Poisoning may also occur if you swallow or touch products that contain very large amounts of ammonia.\nWARNING: Never mix ammonia with bleach. This causes the release of toxic chlorine gas, which can be deadly.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure."}
