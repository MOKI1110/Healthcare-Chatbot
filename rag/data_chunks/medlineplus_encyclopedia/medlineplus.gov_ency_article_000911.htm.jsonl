Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFetal alcohol syndrome\nFetal alcohol syndrome\nFetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) are groupings of growth, mental, and physical problems that may occur in a baby when a mother drinks alcohol during pregnancy. Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is the most severe form of FASD.\nCauses\nUsing alcohol during pregnancy can cause the same risks as using alcohol in general. But it poses extra risks to an unborn baby. When a pregnant woman drinks alcohol, it easily passes across the placenta to the fetus. Because of this, drinking alcohol can harm an unborn baby.\nThere is no safe level of alcohol use during pregnancy. Larger amounts of alcohol appear to increase the problems. Binge drinking is more harmful than drinking small amounts of alcohol.\nTiming of alcohol use during pregnancy is also important. Drinking alcohol is likely most harmful during the first 3 months of pregnancy."}

Pregnant women with alcohol use disorder should join a rehab program and be checked closely by their health care provider throughout their pregnancy.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome for infants with FAS varies. Almost none of these babies have normal brain development.\nInfants and children with FAS have many different problems, which can be difficult to manage."}
