Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAmebic liver abscess\nAmebic liver abscess\nAmebic liver abscess is a collection of pus in the liver in response to an intestinal parasite called\nEntamoeba histolytica\n.\nCauses\nAmebic liver abscess is caused by a parasite called\nEntamoeba histolytica.\nThis parasite causes\namebiasis\n, an intestinal infection that is also called amebic dysentery. After an infection has occurred, the parasite may be carried by the bloodstream from the intestines to the liver.\nAmebiasis spreads from eating food or water that has been contaminated with feces. This is sometimes due to the use of human waste as fertilizer. Amebiasis is also spread through person-to-person contact.\nThe infection occurs worldwide. It is most common in tropical areas where crowded living conditions and poor sanitation exist."}

But people with amebic liver abscess do have symptoms, including:\nAbdominal pain, more so in the right, upper part of the abdomen; pain is intense, continuous or stabbing\nCough\nFever\nand\nchills\nDiarrhea, non-bloody\n(in only one-third of people with amebic liver abscess)\nGeneral discomfort, uneasiness, or ill feeling (\nmalaise\n)\nHiccups\nthat do not stop (rare)\nJaundice\n(yellowing of the skin, mucous membranes, or eyes)\nLoss of appetite\nSweating\nWeight loss\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical examination.

A medicine such as paromomycin or diloxanide must also be taken to get rid of all the ameba in the intestine and to prevent the disease from coming back. This treatment can usually wait until after the abscess has been treated.\nIn rare cases, the abscess may need to be drained using a catheter or surgery to relieve some of the abdominal pain and to increase chances of treatment success.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWithout treatment, the abscess may break open (rupture) and spread into other organs, leading to death."}

People who are treated have a very high chance of a complete cure or only minor complications.\nPossible Complications\nThe abscess may rupture into the abdominal cavity, the lining of the lungs, the lungs, or the sac around the heart. The infection can also spread to the brain.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of this disease, especially if you have recently traveled to an area where the disease is known to occur.\nPrevention\nWhen traveling in tropical countries with poor sanitation, drink purified water and do not eat uncooked vegetables or unpeeled fruit.\nAlternative Names\nHepatic amebiasis; Extraintestinal amebiasis; Abscess - amebic liver\nImages\nLiver cell death\nAmebic liver abscess\nReferences\nHuston CD.
