This technique is able to create pictures of the blood vessels in the arms or legs. CT stands for computed tomography.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner.\nWhen you are inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you. Modern \"spiral\" scanners can perform the exam without stopping.\nA computer makes multiple images of the body area, called slices. These images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, or printed on film. Models of the body area in three-dimension can be created by adding the slices together.\nYou must stay still during the exam, because movement blurs the pictures. You may have to hold your breath for short periods of time.\nThe scan should take only about 5 minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nSome exams require a special dye, called contrast, to be injected into your body before the test."}

Contrast helps certain areas show up better on the x-rays.\nContrast can be given through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm. If contrast is used, you also may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.\nLet your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test to avoid this problem.\nBefore receiving the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes medicine metformin (Glucophage). You may need to take extra steps if you are taking this medicine.\nThe contrast can worsen kidney function problems in people with poorly functioning kidneys. Talk to your provider if you have a history of kidney problems.\nToo much weight can cause damage to the scanner's working parts."}

If you weigh more than 300 pounds (135 kilograms), talk to your provider about the weight limit before the test.\nYou will need to remove jewelry and wear a hospital gown during the CT exam.\nHow the Test will Feel\nSome people may be uncomfortable lying on the hard table.\nContrast given through an IV may cause a:\nSlight burning feeling\nMetallic taste in your mouth\nWarm flushing of your body\nThese feelings are normal and usually go away within a few seconds.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou may need this test if you have symptoms of a\nnarrowed or blocked blood vessel\nin the arms, hands, legs, or feet.\nThe test may also be done to diagnose:\nAbnormal widening or ballooning of part of an artery (aneurysm)\nBleeding\nSwelling or inflammation of the blood vessels (vasculitis)\nLeg pain during walking or exercise (claudication)\nNormal Results\nResults are considered normal if no problems are seen.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal result is commonly due to narrowing and hardening of the arteries"}
