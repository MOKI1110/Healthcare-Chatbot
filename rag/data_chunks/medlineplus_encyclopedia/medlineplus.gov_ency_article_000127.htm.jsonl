It usually grows in preexisting lung cavities. The infection can also appear in the brain, kidney, or other organs.\nCauses\nAspergillosis\nis an infection caused by the fungus aspergillus. Aspergillomas are formed when the fungus grows in a clump in a lung cavity. The cavity is often created by a previous condition. Cavities in the lung may be caused by diseases such as:\nTuberculosis\nCoccidioidomycosis\nCystic fibrosis\nHistoplasmosis\nLung\nabscess\nLung cancer\nSarcoidosis\nThe most common species of fungus that causes disease in humans is\nAspergillus fumigatus\n.\nAspergillus is a common fungus.

Other tests that may be done include:\nBiopsy\nof lung tissue\nBlood test for presence of aspergillus in the body (galactomannan)\nBlood test to detect immune response to aspergillus (\naspergillus precipitin\n)\nBronchoscopy\nor bronchoscopy with lavage\nChest CT\nSputum culture\nTreatment\nMany people never develop symptoms. Often, no treatment is needed, unless you are coughing up blood.\nSometimes, antifungal medicines may be used.\nIf you have bleeding in the lungs, your provider may recommend a test to inject dye into the blood vessels (\nangiography\n) to find the site of bleeding."}
