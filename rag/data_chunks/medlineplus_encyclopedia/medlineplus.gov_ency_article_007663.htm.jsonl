It may be done alone to treat mild obstructive sleep apnea or snoring or with other procedures to treat moderate\nobstructive sleep apnea\n(OSA).\nDescription\nUPPP removes soft tissue at the back of the throat. This includes:\nAll or part of the uvula (the soft flap of tissue that hangs down at the back of the mouth).\nParts of the soft palate and tissue at the sides of the throat.\nTonsils and adenoids, if they are still there.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nYour health care provider may recommend this surgery if you have mild OSA.\nTry lifestyle changes first, such as weight loss or changing your sleep position.\nMost experts recommend trying to use\nCPAP\n, nasal expanding strips, or an oral device to treat OSA first, before considering surgery.\nYour provider may recommend this surgery to treat severe snoring, even if you do not have OSA."}

The surgery does not work for everyone.\nMake sure your insurance will pay for this surgery. If you do not also have OSA, your insurance may not cover the surgery.\nSometimes, UPPP is done along with other more invasive surgeries to treat severe OSA.\nRisks\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:\nReactions to medicines or breathing problems\nBleeding, blood clots, or infection\nRisks of this surgery are:\nDamage to the muscles in the throat and soft palate.

You will get liquid pain medicines to ease the soreness.\nYou may have stitches in the back of your throat.
