The material that they are made from can leach into the food that is being cooked.\nCommon materials used in cookware and utensils are:\nAluminum\nCopper\nIron\nLead\nStainless steel\nTeflon (polytetrafluoroethylene)\nBoth lead and copper have been linked to illness. The FDA imposed limits on the amount of lead in dishware, but ceramic items made in other countries or considered to be a craft, antique, or collectable may exceed the recommended amount. The FDA also warns against using unlined copper cookware because the metal can easily leach into acidic foods, causing copper toxicity.\nFood Sources\nCookware and cooking utensils can affect any cooked foods.\nRecommendations\nChoose metal cookware and bakeware that can be easily cleaned."}

There should be no cracks or rough edges that can trap or hold food or bacteria.\nAvoid using metal or hard plastic utensils on cookware. These utensils can scratch surfaces and cause pots and pans to wear out faster. Use wood, bamboo, or silicone instead. Never use cookware if the coating has started to peel or wear away.\nAluminum\nAluminum cookware is very popular. Nonstick, scratch-resistant anodized aluminum cookware is a good choice. The hard surface is easy to clean. It is sealed so aluminum cannot get into food.\nThere have been concerns in the past that aluminum cookware increases the risk for\nAlzheimer disease\n. The Alzheimer's Association reports that using aluminum cookware is not a major risk for the disease.\nUncoated aluminum cookware is a greater risk. This type of cookware can easily melt. It can cause burns if it gets too hot."}

This type of cookware can easily melt. It can cause burns if it gets too hot. Still, research has shown that the amount of aluminum this cookware leaches into food is very small.\nLead\nChildren should be protected from ceramic cookware containing lead.\nAcidic foods such as oranges, tomatoes, or foods containing vinegar will cause more lead to be leached from ceramic cookware than non-acidic foods like milk.\nMore lead will leach into hot liquids like coffee, tea, and soups than into cold beverages.\nDO NOT use any dishware that has a dusty or chalky gray film on the glaze after it has been washed.\nSome ceramic cookware should not be used to hold food. This includes items bought in another country or considered to be a craft, antique, or collectable. These pieces may not meet FDA specifications. Test kits can detect high levels of lead in ceramic cookware, but lower levels may also be dangerous.\nIron\nIron cookware may be a good choice. Cooking in cast iron pots may increase the amount of iron in the diet."}

Cooking in cast iron pots may increase the amount of iron in the diet. Most of the time, this is a very small source of dietary iron.\nTeflon\nTeflon is a brand name for a nonstick coating found on certain pots and pans. It contains a substance called polytetrafluoroethylene.\nThe nonstick types of these pans should be used only at low or medium heat. They should never be left unattended at high heat. This may cause the release of fumes that can irritate humans and household pets. When left unattended on the stove, empty cookware can get very hot within just a few minutes.\nThere have been concerns about a possible link between Teflon and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a man-made chemical. The Environmental Protection Agency states that Teflon does not contain PFOA so the cookware poses no danger.\nCopper\nCopper pots are popular due to their even heating. But large amounts of copper from unlined cookware can cause\nnausea,\nvomiting\n, and\ndiarrhea\n.\nSome copper and brass pans are coated with another metal to prevent food from coming into contact with copper."}

Over time, these coatings can break down and allow copper to dissolve in food. Older copper cookware may have tin or nickel coatings and should not be used for cooking.\nStainless Steel\nStainless steel cookware is low in cost and can be used at high heat. It has a sturdy cookware surface that does not wear down easily. Most stainless steel cookware has copper or aluminum bottoms for even heating. Health problems from stainless steel are rare.\nCutting Boards\nChoose a surface such as plastic, marble, glass, or pyroceramic. These materials are easier to clean than wood.\nAvoid contaminating vegetables with meat bacteria. Use one cutting board for fresh produce and bread. Use a separate one for raw meat, poultry, and seafood."}

Microwaving the sponge on high for one minute or cleaning it in the dishwasher at a water temperature of 140 °F (60 °C) or higher may remove some of the bacteria. However, the USDA (United States Department of Agriculture) recommends to replace sponges often if you use them.\nReferences\nUnited States Food & Drug Administration.
