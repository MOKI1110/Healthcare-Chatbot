This is the nerve that travels from the armpit down the back of the arm to the hand. It helps you move your arm, wrist, and hand.\nCauses\nDamage to one nerve, such as the radial nerve, is called\nmononeuropathy\n. Mononeuropathy means there is damage to a single nerve. Diseases affecting the entire body (systemic disorders) can also cause isolated nerve damage.\nCauses of mononeuropathy include:\nAn illness in the whole body that damages a single nerve\nDirect injury to the nerve\nLong-term pressure on the nerve\nPressure on the nerve caused by swelling or injury of nearby body structures\nRadial neuropathy occurs when there is damage to the radial nerve, which travels down the arm and controls:\nMovement of the triceps muscle at the back of the upper arm\nAbility to bend the wrist and fingers backward\nMovement of the wrist and hand\nSensation of part of the back of the hand\nWhen damage destroys the nerve covering (\nmyelin sheath\n) or part of the nerve"}

You may be asked what you were doing before the symptoms started.\nTests that may be needed include:\nBlood tests\nImaging tests to view the nerve and nearby structures\nElectromyography\nto check the health of the radial nerve and the muscles it controls\nNerve biopsy\nto examine a piece of nerve tissue (rarely needed)\nNerve conduction tests\nto check how fast nerve signals travel\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to allow you to use the hand and arm as much as possible. Your provider will find and treat the cause, if possible. Sometimes, no treatment is needed and you will get better on your own.\nIf medicines are needed, they may include:\nOver-the-counter or prescription pain medicines\nCorticosteroid injections around the nerve to reduce swelling and pressure\nYour provider will likely suggest self-care measures. These may include:\nA supportive splint at either the wrist or elbow to help prevent further injury and relieve the symptoms."}

Also, avoid bumping or leaning on the elbow.\nPhysical therapy exercises to help maintain muscle strength in the arm.\nOccupational therapy or counseling to suggest changes in the workplace may be needed.\nSurgery to relieve pressure on the nerve may help if the symptoms get worse, or if there is proof that part of the nerve is wasting away.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf the cause of the nerve dysfunction can be found and successfully treated, there is a good chance that you will fully recover."}
