Ascariasis is the most common intestinal worm infection. It is related to poor sanitation. People who live in places where human feces (stool) are used as fertilizer are also at risk for this disease.\nOnce consumed, the eggs hatch and release immature roundworms called larvae inside the small intestine. Within a few days, the larvae move through the bloodstream to the lungs. They travel up through the large airways of the lungs and are swallowed back into the stomach and small intestine.\nAs the larvae move through the lungs they may cause an uncommon form of pneumonia called eosinophilic pneumonia. Eosinophils are a type of white blood cell. Once the larvae are back in the small intestine, they mature into adult roundworms. Adult worms live in the small intestine, where they lay eggs that are present in feces."}

Once the larvae are back in the small intestine, they mature into adult roundworms. Adult worms live in the small intestine, where they lay eggs that are present in feces. They can live 10 to 24 months.\nAn estimated 800 to 900 million people are infected worldwide. Ascariasis occurs in people of all ages, though children are affected more severely than adults.\nSymptoms\nMost of the time, there are no symptoms. If there are symptoms, they may include:\nBloody sputum\n(mucus coughed up by the lower airways)\nCough,\nwheezing\nLow-grade fever\nPassing worms in stool\nShortness of breath\nSkin rash\nStomach pain\nVomiting or coughing up worms\nWorms leaving the body through the nose or mouth\nExams and Tests\nThe infected person may show signs of malnutrition."}

Tests to diagnose this condition include:\nAbdominal x-ray\nor other imaging tests\nBlood tests, including\ncomplete blood count\nand\neosinophil count\nStool exam\nto look for worms and worm eggs\nTreatment\nTreatment includes medicines such as albendazole that paralyze or kill intestinal parasitic worms.\nIf there is a blockage of the intestine caused by a large number of worms, a procedure called an\nendoscopy\nmay be used to remove the worms. In rare cases, surgery is needed.\nPeople who are treated for roundworms should be checked again in 3 months. This involves examining the stools to check for eggs of the worm. If eggs are present, treatment should be given again.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people recover from symptoms of the infection, even without treatment."}

But they may continue to carry the worms in their body.\nComplications can be caused by adult worms that move to certain organs, such as the:\nAppendix\nBile duct\nPancreas\nIf the worms multiply, they can block the intestine.\nPossible Complications\nThese complications may occur:\nAppendicitis\nBlockage in the bile ducts of the liver\nBlockage in the intestine\nHole in the gut\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have symptoms of ascariasis, particularly if you have traveled to an area where the disease is common. Also contact your provider if you have any of the following:\nSymptoms get worse\nSymptoms do not improve with treatment\nNew symptoms occur\nPrevention\nImproved sanitation and hygiene in developing countries will reduce the risk in those areas."}
