When a ligament is stretched too far or tears, the area around the joint will become painful and swell.\nCauses\nSprains are caused when a joint is forced to move into an unnatural position. For example, \"twisting\" one's ankle causes a sprain to the ligaments around the ankle.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of a sprain include:\nJoint pain\nor\nmuscle pain\nSwelling\nJoint stiffness\nDiscoloration of the skin, especially\nbruising\nFirst Aid\nFirst aid steps include:\nApply ice right away to reduce swelling. Wrap the ice in cloth. Do not place ice directly on the skin.\nWrap a bandage around the affected area to limit movement. Wrap firmly, but not tightly. Use a\nsplint\nif needed.\nKeep the swollen joint raised above your heart, even while sleeping.\nRest the affected joint for several days.\nAvoid putting stress on the joint because it can make the injury worse."}
