Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCSF oligoclonal banding\nCSF oligoclonal banding\nCSF oligoclonal banding is a test to look for inflammation-related proteins in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF is the clear fluid that flows in the space around the spinal cord and brain.\nOligoclonal bands are proteins called immunoglobulins. The presence of these proteins indicates inflammation of the\ncentral nervous system\n. The presence of oligoclonal bands may point to a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA sample of CSF is needed. A\nlumbar puncture\n(spinal tap) is the most common way to collect this sample.\nOther methods for collecting CSF are rarely used, but may be recommended in some cases. They include:\nCisternal puncture\nVentricular puncture\nRemoval of CSF from a tube that is already in the CSF, such as a shunt or ventricular drain.\nAfter the sample is taken, it is sent to a lab for testing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test helps support the diagnosis of\nmultiple sclerosis\n(MS). However, it does not confirm the diagnosis."}

Oligoclonal bands in the CSF may also be seen in other illnesses such as:\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\nInfections, such as\nLyme disease\nand\nhuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection\nStroke\nNormal Results\nOne or no bands should be found in the CSF.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nThe examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThere are two or more bands found in the CSF and not in the blood. This may be a sign of multiple sclerosis or other diseases causing inflammation in the central nervous system.\nAlternative Names\nCerebrospinal fluid - immunofixation\nImages\nCSF oligoclonal banding  - series\nLumbar puncture (spinal tap)\nReferences\nDe Luca GC, Griggs RC, Johnston SC.
