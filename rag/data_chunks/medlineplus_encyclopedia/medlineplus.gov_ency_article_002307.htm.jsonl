Spores have thick walls. They can resist high temperatures, humidity, and other environmental conditions.\nThe bacteria\nClostridia\nform spores. These spores create the bacteria that cause a rare condition called gas gangrene and a type of colitis that is linked to use of antibiotics.\nInformation\nChemical disinfectants can kill bacteria, but they do not destroy their spores.\nA process called sterilization destroys spores and bacteria. It is done at high temperature and under high pressure. In health care settings, sterilization of instruments is usually done using a machine called an autoclave.\nReferences\nStatler VA, Bryant KA.
