At the beginning of the 17th century, medical practice in England was divided into three groups: the physicians, the surgeons, and the apothecaries.\nPhysicians were seen as elite. They most often held a university degree. Surgeons were typically hospital-trained and they did apprenticeships. They often served the dual role of barber-surgeon. Apothecaries also learned their roles (prescribing, making, and selling medicines) through apprenticeships, sometimes in hospitals.\nThis distinction between medicine, surgery, and pharmacy did not persist in colonial America."}

When university-prepared MDs from England arrived in America, they were expected to also perform surgery and prepare medicines.\nThe New Jersey Medical Society, chartered in 1766, was the first organization of medical professionals in the English colonies in America. It was developed to \"form a program embracing all the matters of highest concern to the profession: regulation of practice; educational standards for apprentices; fee schedules; and a code of ethics.\" Later this organization became the Medical Society of New Jersey.\nProfessional societies began regulating medical practice by examining and licensing practitioners as early as 1760. By the early 1800s, the medical societies were in charge of establishing regulations, standards of practice, and certification of doctors.\nA natural next step was for such societies to develop their own training programs for doctors."}

These society-affiliated programs were called proprietary medical colleges.\nThe first of these proprietary programs was the medical college of the Medical Society of the County of New York, founded March 12, 1807. Proprietary programs began to spring up everywhere. They attracted a large number of students because they eliminated two features of university-affiliated medical schools: a long general education and a long lecture term.\nTo address the many abuses in medical education, a national convention was held in May 1846. Proposals from that convention included the following:\nA standard code of ethics for the profession\nThe adoption of uniform higher educational standards for MDs, including courses of premedical education\nThe creation of a national medical association\nOn May 5, 1847, nearly 200 delegates representing 40 medical societies and 28 colleges from 22 states and the District of Columbia met."}

The AMA has become an organization that has a great deal of influence over issues related to health care in the United States.\nThe AMA set educational standards for MDs, including the following:\nA liberal education in the arts and sciences\nA certificate of completion in an apprenticeship before entering the medical college\nAn MD degree that covered 3 years of study, including two 6-month lecture sessions, 3 months devoted to dissection, and a minimum of one 6-month session of hospital attendance\nIn 1852, the standards were revised to add more requirements:\nMedical schools had to provide a 16-week course of instruction that included anatomy, medicine, surgery, midwifery, and chemistry\nGraduates had to be at least 21 years of age\nStudents had to complete a minimum of 3 years of study, 2 years of which were under an"}

In 1810, there were 650 students enrolled and 100 graduates from medical schools in the United States. By 1900, these numbers had risen to 25,000 students and 5,200 graduates. Nearly all of these graduates were white males.\nDaniel Hale Williams (1856-1931) was one of the first black MDs. After graduating from Northwestern University in 1883, Dr. Williams practiced surgery in Chicago and was later a main force in establishing Provident Hospital, which still serves Chicago's South Side. Previously black physicians found it impossible to obtain privileges to practice medicine in hospitals.\nElizabeth Blackwell (1821-1920), after graduating from Geneva College of Medicine in upstate New York, became the first woman granted an MD degree in the United States.\nThe Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine opened in 1893."}

Johns Hopkins Medical School served as a model for the reorganization of medical education. After this, many sub-standard medical schools closed.\nMedical schools had become mostly diploma mills, with the exception of a few schools in large cities. Two developments changed that.

His highly negative report and recommendations for improvement led to the closing of many substandard schools and the creation of standards of excellence for a real medical education.\nThe other development came from Sir William Osler, a Canadian who is regarded as one of the greatest professors of medicine in modern history. He worked at McGill University in Canada, and then at the University of Pennsylvania, before being recruited to be the first physician-in-chief and one of the founders of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. There he established the first residency training (after graduation from medical school) and was the first to bring students to the patient's bedside. Before that time, medical students only learned from textbooks until they went out to practice, so they had little practical experience. Osler also wrote the first comprehensive, scientific textbook of medicine and later went to Oxford as Regent professor, where he was knighted."}

Many states also required candidates to complete a 1-year internship in a hospital setting after receiving a degree from a recognized medical school in order to receive a license to practice medicine.\nAmerican doctors did not begin to specialize until the middle of the 20th century."}

Laws and guidelines are being developed. Some states have recently established procedures for recognizing the licenses of physicians practicing in other states in times of emergency, such as after hurricanes or earthquakes.\nCertification:\nMDs who wish to specialize must complete an additional 3 to 9 years of postgraduate work in their specialty area, then pass board certification exams. Family Medicine is the specialty with the broadest scope of training and practice. Doctors who claim to practice in a specialty should be board-certified in that specific area of practice. However, not all certifications come from recognized academic agencies."}
