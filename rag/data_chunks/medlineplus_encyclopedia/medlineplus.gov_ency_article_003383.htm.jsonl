The lump indicates that the\nantigen\nhas been injected at the correct depth.\nThe injection site is labeled and examined 3 days, and again 28 days later to see if there is a reaction.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nPeople with\ndermatitis\nor other skin irritations should have the test performed on an unaffected part of the body.\nIf your child is to have this test performed, it may be helpful to explain how the test will feel, and even demonstrate on a doll. Explain the reason for the test. Knowing the \"how and why\" may reduce the anxiety your child feels.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the antigen is injected, there may be a slight stinging or burning."}

Explain the reason for the test. Knowing the \"how and why\" may reduce the anxiety your child feels.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the antigen is injected, there may be a slight stinging or burning. There may also be mild itching at the site of injection afterward.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nLeprosy\nis a long-term (\nchronic\n) and potentially disfiguring infection if left untreated. It is caused by\nMycobacterium leprae\nbacteria.\nThis test is a research tool that helps classify the different types of leprosy. It is not recommended as the main method to diagnose leprosy.\nNormal Results\nPeople who don't have leprosy will have little or no skin reaction to the antigen.  People with a particular type of leprosy, called lepromatous leprosy, will also have no skin reaction to the antigen.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA positive skin reaction may be seen in people with specific forms of leprosy, such as tuberculoid and borderline tuberculoid leprosy."}
