However, the prostate may be swollen or tender.\nUrine tests may show white or red blood cells in the urine. A semen culture may show a higher number of white blood cells and low sperm count with poor movement.\nUrine culture\nor culture from the prostate does not show bacteria.\nTreatment\nTreatment for nonbacterial prostatitis is difficult. The problem is hard to cure, so the main goal is to control symptoms.\nSeveral types of medicines may be used to treat the condition. These include:\nLong-term antibiotics to make sure that the prostatitis is not caused by bacteria. However, people who are not helped by antibiotics should stop taking these medicines.\nMedicines called alpha-adrenergic blockers help relax the muscles of the prostate gland. It often takes about 6 weeks before these medicines start working."}

Many people do not get relief from these medicines.\nAspirin, ibuprofen, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs), which may relieve symptoms for some men.\nMuscle relaxers like diazepam or cyclobenzaprine can help to reduce spasms in the pelvic floor.\nSome people have found some relief from pollen extract (Cernitin) and allopurinol. But research does not confirm their benefit. Stool softeners may help reduce discomfort with bowel movements.\nSurgery, called\ntransurethral resection of the prostate\n, may be done in rare cases if medicine does not help. In most cases, this surgery is not done on younger men. It may cause\nretrograde ejaculation\n."}
