The drip collector is worn over the penis. It is held in place by close-fitting underwear. This works well for men who constantly leak just a little.\nCondom catheter -- You place this product over your penis like you would put on a condom. It has a tube on the end that connects with a collection bag tied to your leg. This device can handle small or large amounts of urine. It has little odor, doesn't irritate your skin, and is easy to use.\nCunningham clamp -- This device is placed over the penis.

It can be uncomfortable at first, but most men adjust to it. It is reusable, so it can be less expensive than other options.\nPRODUCTS FOR WOMEN\nPessaries -- These are reusable devices you insert in your vagina to support your bladder and put pressure on your urethra so you don't leak. Pessaries come in different shapes and sizes, such as a ring, cube, or dish. It may take a few tries for your provider to help you find the right fit.\nUrethral insert -- This is a soft plastic balloon that is inserted into your urethra. It works by blocking urine from coming out. You must remove the insert to urinate. Some women use inserts for only part of the day, like when exercising. Others use them throughout the day. To prevent infection, you must use a new sterile insert each time.\nDisposable vaginal insert -- This device is inserted into the vagina like a tampon. It puts pressure on the urethra to prevent leakage."}

These underpads, sometimes called Chux, are made of absorbent material with a waterproof backing. They may be disposable or reusable.\nSome new products can pull moisture away from the surface of the pad. This protects your skin from breakdown. Medical supply companies and some larger department stores carry underpads.\nYou can also create your own underpads from vinyl tablecloths with flannel backing. Shower curtain liners covered with a flannel sheet also work well. Or, place a rubber pad between layers of bed linens.\nKEEP YOUR SKIN DRY\nWhen you use these products, it's important to protect your skin."}
