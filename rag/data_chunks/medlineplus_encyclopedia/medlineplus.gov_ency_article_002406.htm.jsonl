Your body stores vitamin E in fatty tissue and the liver.\nFunction\nVitamin E has the following functions:\nIt is an antioxidant. This means it protects body tissue from damage caused by substances called free radicals. Free radicals can harm cells, tissues, and organs. They are believed to play a role in certain conditions related to aging.\nIt helps keep the immune system strong against viruses and bacteria.\nIt helps form red blood cells and widen blood vessels to keep blood from clotting inside them.\nIt helps the body use\nvitamin K\n.\nCells also use vitamin E to interact with each other. It helps them carry out many important functions.\nDetermining whether vitamin E can prevent cancer, heart disease, dementia, liver disease, and stroke requires further research.\nFood Sources\nThe best way to get the daily requirement of vitamin E is by eating food sources."}

Vitamin E is found in the following foods:\nVegetable oils (such as wheat germ, sunflower, safflower, corn, and soybean oils)\nNuts (such as almonds, peanuts, and hazelnuts/filberts)\nSeeds (such as sunflower seeds)\nGreen leafy vegetables (such as spinach and broccoli)\nFortified breakfast cereals, fruit juices, margarine, and spreads.\nFortified means that vitamins have been added to the food. Check the Nutrition Fact Panel on the food label.\nProducts made from these foods, such as margarine, also contain vitamin E.\nSide Effects\nEating vitamin E in foods is not risky or harmful. However, high doses of vitamin E supplements (alpha-tocopherol supplements) might increase the risk of bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke).\nHigh levels of vitamin E may also increase the risk for birth defects."}

However, this needs more research.\nLow intake may lead to\nhemolytic anemia\nin premature babies.\nRecommendations\nRecommendations for vitamin E, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)\n: The average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people. An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence.\nAdequate Intake (AI)\n: This level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA."}
