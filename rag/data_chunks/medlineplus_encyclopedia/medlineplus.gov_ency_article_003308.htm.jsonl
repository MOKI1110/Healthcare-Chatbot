There are 8 bones in the skull itself and 14 bones in the face area. They join together to form a solid, bony cavity that protects and supports the brain. The areas where the bones join together are called the sutures.\nIn an infant only a few minutes old, the pressure from delivery compresses the head. This makes the bony plates overlap at the sutures and creates a small ridge. This is normal in newborns. In the next few days, the head expands and the overlapping disappears. The edges of the bony plates meet edge-to-edge. This is the normal position.\nRidging of the suture line can also occur when the bony plates fuse together too early. When this happens, growth along that suture line stops. Premature closure generally leads to an unusually shaped skull.\nPremature closing of the suture running the length of the skull (sagittal suture) produces a long, narrow head."}

Premature closing of the suture that runs from side-to-side on the skull (coronal suture) leads to a short, wide head.\nCauses\nCauses may include:\nNormal ridging due to overlap of bony plates after birth\nCongenital\ncraniosynostosis\nCrouzon syndrome\nApert syndrome\nCarpenter syndrome\nPfeiffer syndrome\nHome Care\nHome care depends on the condition causing the premature closure of sutures.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if:\nYou notice a ridge along the suture line of your child's head.\nYou think that your child has an abnormal head shape.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nYour provider will take a medical history and will do a\nphysical exam\n.\nMedical history questions might include:\nWhen did you first notice that the skull seemed to have ridges in it?\nWhat do the soft spots (fontanelles) look like?\nHave the fontanelles closed?"}

At what age did they close?\nWhat other symptoms are present?\nHow has your child been developing?\nYour provider will examine the skull to see if there is ridging. If there is ridging, your child might need\nx-rays\nor other types of scans of the skull to show whether the sutures have closed too early.\nAlthough your provider keeps records from routine checkups, you may find it helpful to keep your own records of your child's development. Bring these records to your provider's attention if you notice anything unusual.\nAlternative Names\nRidged sutures\nImages\nSkull of a newborn\nReferences\nBall JW, Dains JE, Flynn JA, Solomon BS, Stewart RW.
