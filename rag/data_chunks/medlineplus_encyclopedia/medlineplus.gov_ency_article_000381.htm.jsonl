Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEnlarged prostate\nEnlarged prostate\nThe prostate is a gland that produces some of the fluid that carries sperm during ejaculation. The prostate gland surrounds the urethra, the tube through which urine passes out of the body.\nAn enlarged prostate means the gland has grown bigger. Prostate enlargement happens to almost all men as they get older.\nAn enlarged prostate is often called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). It is not cancer, and it does not raise your risk for prostate cancer.\nCauses\nThe actual cause of prostate enlargement is unknown. Factors linked to aging and changes in the cells of the testicles may have a role in the growth of the gland, as well as testosterone levels. Men who have had their testicles removed at a young age (for example, as a result of testicular cancer) do not develop BPH.\nAlso, if the testicles are removed after a man develops BPH, the prostate begins to shrink in size."}

However, this is not a standard treatment for an enlarged prostate.\nSome facts about prostate enlargement:\nThe likelihood of developing an enlarged prostate increases with age.\nBPH is so common that it has been said all men will have an enlarged prostate if they live long enough.\nA small amount of prostate enlargement is present in many men over age 40. More than 90% of men over age 80 have the condition.\nNo risk factors have been identified, other than having normally-functioning testicles.\nSymptoms\nLess than half of all men with BPH have symptoms of the disease."}

But many men with an enlarged prostate have only minor symptoms. Self-care steps are often enough to make you feel better.\nIf you have BPH, you should have a yearly assessment to monitor your symptoms and see if you need changes in treatment.\nSELF-CARE\nFor mild symptoms:\nUrinate when you first get the urge. Also, go to the bathroom on a timed schedule, even if you don't feel a need to urinate.\nAvoid alcohol and caffeine, especially after dinner.\nDo not drink a lot of fluid all at once. Spread out fluids during the day. Avoid drinking fluids within 2 hours of bedtime.\nTry not to take over-the-counter cold and sinus medicines that contain decongestants or antihistamines. These medicines can increase BPH symptoms.\nKeep warm and exercise regularly. Cold weather and lack of physical activity may worsen symptoms.\nReduce stress."}

These medicines relax the muscles of the bladder neck and prostate. This allows easier urination. Most people who take alpha-1 blockers notice improvement in their symptoms, usually within 3 to 7 days after starting the medicine.\nFinasteride and dutasteride lower levels of hormones produced by the prostate. These medicines also reduce the size of the gland, increase urine flow rate, and decrease symptoms of BPH. You may need to take these medicines for 3 to 6 months before you notice symptoms getting better.

TURP is performed by inserting a scope through the penis and removing the prostate piece by piece.\nSimple prostatectomy\n: This is a procedure to remove the inside part of the prostate gland. It is done through a surgical cut in your lower belly. This treatment is most often done on men who have very large prostate glands.\nOther\nless-invasive procedures\nuse heat or a laser to destroy prostate tissue.
