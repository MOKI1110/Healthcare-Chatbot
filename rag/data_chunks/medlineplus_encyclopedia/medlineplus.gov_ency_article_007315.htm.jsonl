The coronary arteries are blood vessels that bring oxygen-rich blood to the heart.\nFistula means abnormal connection.\nCauses\nA coronary artery fistula is often congenital, meaning that it is present at birth. It generally occurs when one of the coronary arteries fails to form properly. This most often takes place when the baby is developing in the womb. The coronary artery abnormally attaches to one of the chambers of the heart (the atrium or ventricle) or another blood vessel (for example, the pulmonary artery).\nA coronary artery fistula can also develop after birth. It may be caused by:\nAn infection that weakens the wall of the coronary artery and the heart\nCertain types of heart surgery\nInjury to the heart from an accident or surgery\nCoronary artery fistula is a rare condition. Infants who are born with it sometimes also have other heart defects."}

Infants who are born with it sometimes also have other heart defects. These may include:\nHypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS)\nPulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum\nSymptoms\nInfants with this condition often do not have any symptoms.\nIf symptoms do occur, they can include:\nHeart murmur\nChest discomfort or pain\nEasy fatigue\nFailure to thrive\nFast or irregular heartbeat (palpitations)\nShortness of breath (dyspnea)\nExams and Tests\nIn most cases, this condition is not diagnosed until later in life. It is most often diagnosed during tests for other heart diseases. However, the health care provider may hear a heart murmur that will lead to the diagnosis with further testing.\nThe main test to determine the size of the fistula is a\ncoronary angiography\n. This is a special x-ray test of the heart using dye to see how and where blood is flowing."}

This is a special x-ray test of the heart using dye to see how and where blood is flowing. It is often done along with\ncardiac catheterization\n, which involves passing a thin, flexible tube into the heart to evaluate blood pressure and flow in the heart and surrounding arteries and veins.\nOther diagnostic tests may include:\nUltrasound exam of the heart (echocardiogram)\nUsing magnets to create images of the heart (MRI)\nCT scan of the heart\nTreatment\nA small fistula that is not causing symptoms very often will not need treatment. Some small fistulas will close on their own. Often, even if they do not close, they will never cause symptoms or need treatment.\nInfants with a larger fistula will need to have surgery to close the abnormal connection. The surgeon closes the site with a patch or stitches.\nAnother treatment option plugs up the opening without surgery, using a special wire (coil) that is inserted into the heart with a long, thin tube called a catheter."}

After the procedure in children, the fistula will most often close.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nChildren who have surgery mostly do well, although a small percentage may need to have surgery again. Most people with this condition have a normal lifespan.\nPossible Complications\nComplications include:\nAbnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia)\nHeart attack\nHeart failure\nOpening (rupture) of the fistula\nPoor oxygen to the heart\nComplications are more common in older people.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCoronary artery fistula is most often diagnosed during an exam by your provider. Contact your provider if your infant has symptoms of this condition.\nPrevention\nThere is no known way to prevent this condition.\nAlternative Names\nCongenital heart defect - coronary artery fistula; Birth defect heart - coronary artery fistula\nImages\nCoronary angiography\nCoronary artery fistula\nReferences\nBernstein D.
