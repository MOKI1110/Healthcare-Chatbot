Most cases are not passed down through families.\nCauses\nChanges to one of three genes,\nTCOF1\n,\nPOLR1C\n, or\nPOLR1D\n, can lead to Treacher Collins syndrome. The condition can be passed down through families (inherited). However, most of the time, there is not another affected family member.\nThis condition may vary in severity from generation to generation and from person to person.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nOuter part of the ears are abnormal or almost completely missing\nHearing loss\nVery small jaw (\nmicrognathia\n)\nVery large mouth\nDefect in the lower eyelid\nScalp hair that reaches to the cheeks\nCleft palate\nExams and Tests\nThe child most often will show normal intelligence."}
