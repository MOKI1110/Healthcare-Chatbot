A bruise occurs when small blood vessels break and leak their contents into the soft tissue beneath the skin.\nConsiderations\nThere are three types of bruises:\nSubcutaneous -- beneath the skin\nIntramuscular -- within the belly of the underlying muscle\nPeriosteal -- bone bruise\nBruises can last from days to months. A bone bruise is the most severe and painful.\nCauses\nBruises are often caused by falls, sports injuries, car accidents, or blows received from other people or objects.\nIf you take a blood thinner, such as aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), dabigatran (Pradaxa), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), apixaban (Eliquis), or clopidogrel (Plavix), you are likely to bruise more easily.\nSymptoms\nMain symptoms are pain, swelling, and skin discoloration. The bruise begins as a pinkish red color that can be very tender to touch. It is often difficult to use the muscle that has been bruised."}

The bruise begins as a pinkish red color that can be very tender to touch. It is often difficult to use the muscle that has been bruised. For example, a deep thigh bruise is painful when you walk or run.\nEventually, the bruise changes to a bluish color, then greenish-yellow, and finally returns to the normal skin color as it heals.\nFirst Aid\nPlace ice on the bruise to help it heal faster and to reduce swelling. Wrap the ice in a clean towel. Do not place ice directly on the skin. Apply the ice for up to 15 minutes each hour.\nKeep the bruised area raised above the heart, if possible. This helps keep blood from pooling in the bruised tissue.\nTry to rest the bruised body part by not overworking your muscles in that area.\nIf needed, take acetaminophen (Tylenol) to help reduce pain.\nIn the rare case of\ncompartment syndrome\n, surgery is often done to relieve the extreme buildup of pressure. Compartment syndrome results from increased pressure on the soft tissues and structures beneath the skin."}

It can decrease the supply of blood and oxygen to the tissues.\nDO NOT\nDo not try to drain the bruise with a needle.\nDo not continue running, playing, or otherwise using the painful, bruised part of your body.\nDo not ignore the pain or swelling.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider right away if you feel extreme pressure in a bruised part of your body, especially if the area is large or very painful. This may be due to compartment syndrome, and can be life-threatening. You should receive emergency care.\nAlso contact your provider if:\nYou are bruising without any injury, fall, or other reason.\nThere are signs of infection around the bruised area including streaks of redness, pus or other drainage, or fever.\nPrevention\nBecause bruises are usually the direct result of an injury, the following are important safety recommendations:\nTeach children how to be safe.\nBe mindful to avoid falls around the house."}
