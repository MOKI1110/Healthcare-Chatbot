Over time, it may damage the spinal cord.\nCauses\nThe fluid-filled cyst is called a syrinx. The spinal fluid buildup may be caused by:\nBirth defects (especially Chiari malformation, in which part of the brain pushes down onto the spinal cord at the base of the skull)\nSpinal cord trauma\nTumors of the spinal cord\nThe fluid-filled cyst usually begins in the neck area. It expands slowly, putting pressure on the spinal cord and slowly causing damage.\nOnset of syringomyelia is usually between 25 to 40 years old. Males are more affected than females.\nSymptoms\nIf the condition is due to birth defects, there may be no symptoms until age 30 to 40 years. Symptoms of syringomyelia usually appear slowly and worsen over many years. In the case of trauma, the onset of symptoms may be as early as 2 to 3 months of age."}

Tests that may be done include:\nMRI of the head\nand spine\nSpinal CT\nscan with myelogram (may be done when an MRI is not possible)\nTreatment\nThere is no known effective treatment for syringomyelia. The goals of treatment are to stop the spinal cord damage from getting worse and to improve function.\nMedicines and devices can help with pain.\nSurgery may be needed to relieve pressure in the spinal cord. Physical and occupational therapy may be needed to improve muscle function and help maximize independence.\nVentriculoperitoneal shunting\nor syringosubarachnoid shunting may be needed. This is a procedure in which a catheter (thin, flexible tube) is inserted to drain the fluid buildup.\nOther treatments are available to manage bowel and bladder problems and spasticity.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWithout treatment, the disorder may get worse very slowly. Over time, it may cause severe disability.\nSurgery usually stops the condition from getting worse."}
