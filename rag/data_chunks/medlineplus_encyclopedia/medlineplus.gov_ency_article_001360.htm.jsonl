The infection spreads to the developing baby across the placenta. Most of the time, the infection is mild in the mother. The woman may not be aware she has the parasite. However, infection of the developing baby can cause serious problems. Problems are worse if the infection occurs in early pregnancy.\nSymptoms\nUp to half babies who become infected with toxoplasmosis during the pregnancy are born early (prematurely). The infection can damage the baby's eyes, nervous system, skin, and ears.\nOften, there are signs of infection at birth. However, babies with mild infections may not have symptoms for months or years after birth. If not treated, most children with this infection develop problems in their teens."}

(For example, toxoplasmosis infection can be passed from cats if you clean the cat's litter  box.) Contact your provider if you are pregnant and have not had prenatal care.\nPrevention\nWomen who are pregnant or planning to become pregnant can be tested to find out if they are at risk for the infection.\nPregnant women who have cats as house pets may be at higher risk."}

They should avoid contact with cat feces, or things that could be contaminated by insects exposed to cat feces (such as cockroaches and flies).\nAlso, cook meat until it is well done, and wash your hands after handling raw meat to avoid getting the parasite.\nImages\nCongenital toxoplasmosis\nReferences\nDuff WP.
