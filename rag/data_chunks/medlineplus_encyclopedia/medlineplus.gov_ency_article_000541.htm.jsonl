Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAcute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)\nAcute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL)\nAcute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a fast-growing cancer of a type of white blood cells called lymphocytes.\nALL occurs when the bone marrow produces a large number of immature lymphoblasts, a cancerous form of lymphocytes. Bone marrow is the soft, spongy tissue found inside most bones in children and in the front chest bone (sternum) and the pelvis bones in adults that helps form all blood cells. The abnormal lymphoblasts grow quickly and replace normal cells in the bone marrow. ALL prevents healthy blood cells from being made."}

The abnormal lymphoblasts grow quickly and replace normal cells in the bone marrow. ALL prevents healthy blood cells from being made. Life-threatening symptoms can occur as normal blood counts drop.\nCauses\nMost of the time, no clear cause can be found for ALL.\nThe following factors may play a role in the development of all types of leukemia:\nCertain chromosome problems\nExposure to radiation\nPast treatment with\nchemotherapy\nmedicines\nReceiving a\nbone marrow transplant\nToxins\n, such as benzene\nThe following factors are known to increase the risk for ALL:\nDown syndrome\nor some other genetic conditions\nA brother or sister with leukemia\nThis type of leukemia usually affects children ages 3 to 7. ALL is the most common childhood cancer, but it can also occur in adults.\nSymptoms\nALL makes a person more likely to bleed and develop infections."}

Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of specific symptoms.\nExams and Tests\nYour provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms.\nBlood tests may include:\nComplete blood count\n(CBC), including\nwhite blood cell (WBC) count\nand\ncell differential\nPlatelet count\nBone marrow biopsy\nLumbar puncture (\nspinal tap\n) to check for leukemia cells in the spinal fluid\nTests are also done to look for changes in the DNA inside the abnormal white cells."}

Certain DNA changes may determine how well a person does (prognosis), and what kind of treatment is recommended.\nTreatment\nThe first goal of treatment is to get blood counts back to normal. If this occurs and the bone marrow looks healthy under the microscope, the cancer is said to be in remission.\nChemotherapy is the first treatment tried with the goal of achieving a remission.\nThe person may need to stay in the hospital for chemotherapy. Or it may be given at a clinic and the person goes home afterward.\nChemotherapy is given into the veins (by IV) and sometimes into the fluid around the brain (the spinal fluid). Oral chemotherapy may be given after a remission to maintain it.\nThere are also multiple new agents approved for ALL including CAR-T-cell therapy and certain\ntargeted agents\n, such as Blinatumomab and Inotuzumab ozogamicin, that have improved the outcomes.\nAfter a remission is achieved, more treatment is given to achieve a cure."}

Further treatment depends on:\nAge and health of the person\nGenetic changes in the leukemia cells\nHow many courses of chemotherapy it took to achieve remission\nIf abnormal cell DNA is detected in the bone marrow after remission\nAvailability of donors for stem cell or bone marrow transplant\nYou and your provider may need to manage other concerns during your leukemia treatment, including:\nHaving chemotherapy at home\nManaging your pets\nduring chemotherapy\nBleeding problems\nDry mouth\nEating enough calories\nSafe eating\nduring cancer treatment\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\ncancer support group\n. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThose who respond to treatment right away tend to do better. Most children with ALL can be cured."}
