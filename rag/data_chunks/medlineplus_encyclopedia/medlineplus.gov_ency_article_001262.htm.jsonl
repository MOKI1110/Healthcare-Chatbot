Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFlat feet\nFlat feet\nFlat feet (pes planus) refer to a change in foot shape in which the foot does not have a normal arch when standing.\nCauses\nFlat feet are a common condition. The condition is normal in infants and toddlers.\nFlat feet occur because the tissues holding the joints in the foot together (called tendons) are loose.\nThe tissues tighten and form an arch as children grow older. This will take place by the time the child is 2 or 3 years old. Most people have normal arches by the time they are adults. However, the arch may never form in some people.\nSome hereditary conditions cause loose tendons and ligaments.\nEhlers-Danlos Syndrome\nMarfan Syndrome\nPeople born with these conditions may have flat feet.\nAging, injuries, or illness may harm the tendons and cause flat feet to develop in a person who has already formed arches. This type of flat foot may occur only on one side.\nRarely, painful flat feet in children may be caused by a condition in which two or more of the bones in the foot grow or fuse together."}

This type of flat foot may occur only on one side.\nRarely, painful flat feet in children may be caused by a condition in which two or more of the bones in the foot grow or fuse together. This condition is called tarsal coalition.\nSymptoms\nMost flat feet do not cause pain or other problems.\nChildren don't often have foot pain, ankle pain, or lower leg pain. They should be evaluated by a health care provider if this occurs.\nSymptoms in adults may include tired or achy feet after long periods of standing or playing sports. You also may have pain on the outside of the ankle.\nFor patients that have had flat foot for a long time, you may develop changes in the appearance and flexibility of your toes also. You can have pain in the deformed toes.\nExams and Tests\nIn people with flat feet, the instep of the foot comes in contact with the ground when standing.\nTo diagnose the problem, the provider will ask you to stand on your toes. If an arch forms, the flat foot is called flexible."}

The treatment depends on the cause of the flat feet.\nFor tarsal coalition, treatment starts with rest and possibly a cast. Surgery may be needed if pain does not improve.\nIn more severe cases, surgery may be needed to:\nClean or repair the tendon\nTransfer a tendon to restore the arch\nFuse joints in the foot into a corrected position\nFlat feet in older adults can be treated with pain relievers, orthotics, and sometimes surgery.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost cases of flat feet are painless and do not cause any problems. They will not need treatment.\nSome causes of painful flat feet can be treated without surgery. If other treatments do not work, surgery may be needed to relieve pain in some cases."}
