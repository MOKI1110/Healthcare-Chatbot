Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nNeonatal abstinence syndrome\nNeonatal abstinence syndrome\nNeonatal abstinence syndrome (NAS) is a group of problems that can happen when a baby is exposed to opioid drugs or medicine for a length of time while in their mother's womb (uterus).\nCauses\nNAS may occur when a pregnant woman takes drugs such as heroin, or medicines such as codeine, oxycodone (Oxycontin), methadone, or buprenorphine.\nThese and other substances pass through the placenta that connects the baby to its mother in the womb. The baby becomes dependent on the drug along with the mother.\nIf the mother continues to use the drugs within the week or so before delivery, the baby will be dependent on the drug at birth."}

The baby becomes dependent on the drug along with the mother.\nIf the mother continues to use the drugs within the week or so before delivery, the baby will be dependent on the drug at birth. Because the baby is no longer getting the drug after birth, withdrawal symptoms may occur as the drug is slowly cleared from the baby's system.\nWithdrawal symptoms also may occur in babies exposed to\nalcohol\n, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and certain antidepressants (SSRIs) while in the womb.\nBabies of mothers who use opioids and other addictive drugs (nicotine, amphetamines, cocaine, marijuana, alcohol) may have long-term problems. While there is no clear evidence of a NAS for other drugs, they may contribute to the severity of a baby's NAS symptoms.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms of NAS depend on:\nThe type of drug the mother used\nHow the body breaks down and clears the drug (influenced by genetic factors)\nHow much of the drug she was taking\nHow long she used the drug\nWhether the baby was born full-term or early (premature)\nSymptoms often begin within 1 to 3 days after birth, but may take up to a week to appear."}

To help make a diagnosis, the health care provider will ask questions about the mother's drug use. The mother may be asked about which drugs she took during pregnancy, and when she last took them. The mother's urine may be screened for drugs as well.\nTests that may be done to help diagnose NAS in a newborn include:\nNAS scoring system, which assigns points based on each symptom and its severity."}

Babies who vomit or who are very dehydrated may need to get fluids through a vein (IV).\nInfants with NAS are often fussy and hard to calm. Tips to calm them include measures often referred to as \"TLC\" (tender loving care):\nGently rocking the child\nReducing noise and lights\nSkin to skin care with mom, or swaddling the baby in a blanket\nBreastfeeding (if the mother is in a methadone or buprenorphine treatment program without other illicit drug use)\nSome babies with severe symptoms need medicines such as methadone or morphine to treat withdrawal symptoms and help them be able to eat, sleep and relax. These babies may need to stay in the hospital for weeks or months after birth. The goal of treatment is to prescribe the infant a drug similar to the one the mother used during pregnancy and slowly decrease the dose over time. This helps wean the baby off the drug and relieves some withdrawal symptoms.\nIf the symptoms are severe, such as if other drugs were used, a second medicine such as phenobarbital or clonidine may be added.\nBabies with this condition often have severe diaper rash or other areas of skin breakdown."}
