Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTORCH screen\nTORCH screen\nThe TORCH screen is a group of blood tests. These tests check for several different infections in a newborn. The full form of TORCH is\ntoxoplasmosis\n,\nrubella cytomegalovirus\n, herpes simplex, and HIV. However, it can also contain other newborn infections.\nSometimes the test is spelled TORCHS, where the extra \"S\" stands for syphilis.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe health care provider will clean a small area (usually the finger). They will stick it with a sharp needle or cutting instrument called a lancet. The blood may be collected in a small glass tube, on a slide, onto a test strip, or into a small container."}

If there is any bleeding, cotton or a bandage may be applied to the puncture site.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nFor more information about how you can prepare your child, see\ninfant test or procedure preparation\n.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhile the blood sample is being taken, your child will most likely feel a prick and a brief stinging sensation.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nIf a woman becomes infected with certain germs during her pregnancy, the baby may also become infected while still in the womb. The baby is more sensitive to harm from infection during the first 3 to 4 months of the pregnancy.\nThis test is used to screen infants for TORCH infections. These infections may lead to the following problems in the baby:\nBirth defects\nGrowth delay\nBrain and nervous system problems\nNormal Results\nNormal values mean there is no sign of infection in the newborn.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf high levels of antibodies called immunoglobulins (IgM) against a certain germ are found in the infant, there may be an infection. Your provider may order more tests to confirm a diagnosis.\nRisks\nBlood draws carry a small risk of bleeding, bruising, and infection at the involved site.\nConsiderations\nThe TORCH screen is useful for determining whether there may be an infection. If the result is positive, more testing will be needed to confirm the diagnosis. The mother will also need to be checked.\nReferences\nHarrison GJ. Approach to infections in the fetus and newborn.
