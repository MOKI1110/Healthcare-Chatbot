Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSmell - impaired\nSmell - impaired\nImpaired smell is the partial or total loss or abnormal perception of the sense of smell.\nConsiderations\nThe loss of smell can occur with conditions that prevent air from reaching smell receptors located high in the nose, or loss of or injury to the smell receptors. Loss of smell is not serious, but can sometimes be a sign of a nervous system condition.\nTemporary loss of the sense of smell is common with colds and nasal\nallergies\n, such as hay fever (\nallergic rhinitis\n). It may occur after a viral illness.\nSome loss of smell occurs with aging. In most cases, there is no clear cause, and there is no treatment.\nThe sense of smell also enhances your ability to taste. Many people who lose their sense of smell also complain that they lose their sense of taste. Most can still tell between salty, sweet, sour, and bitter tastes, which are sensed on the tongue. They may not be able to tell between other flavors. Some spices (such as pepper) may affect the nerves of the face."}

Treatment can include:\nAntihistamines (if the condition is due to an allergy)\nChanges in medicine\nSurgery to correct blockages\nTreatment of other disorders\nOlfactory retraining therapy using familiar odors can help improve the sense of smell in a minority of patients\nAvoid using too many nasal decongestants, which can lead to repeated nasal congestion.\nIf you lose your sense of smell, you may have changes in taste. Adding highly seasoned foods to your diet can help stimulate the taste sensations that you still have.\nImprove your\nsafety at home\nby using smoke detectors and electric appliances instead of gas appliances. You may not be able to smell gas if there is a leak. Or, install equipment that detects gas fumes in the home. People with smell loss should label when food items were opened to prevent eating spoiled food.\nThere is no treatment for loss of smell due to aging.\nIf you have a loss of smell due to a recent upper respiratory infection, be patient."}
