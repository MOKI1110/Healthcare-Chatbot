Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCSF leak\nCSF leak\nA CSF leak is an escape of the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. This fluid is called the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).\nCauses\nAny tear or hole in the membrane that surrounds the brain and spinal cord (dura) can allow the fluid that surrounds those organs to leak. When it leaks out, the pressure around the brain and spinal cord drops.\nCauses of leakage through the dura include:\nCertain head, brain, or spinal surgeries\nHead or spine injury\nPlacement of tubes for epidural anesthesia or pain medicines\nSpinal tap (\nlumbar puncture\n)\nSometimes, no cause can be found. This is called a spontaneous CSF leak.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nA headache that is worse when you sit up and improves when you lie down. It may be associated with light sensitivity, nausea, and neck stiffness.\nDrainage of CSF from the ear (rarely).\nDrainage of CSF from the nose (rarely).\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your symptoms."}

Tests may include:\nCT scan of the head\nwith contrast dye\nCT myelogram of the spine\nMRI of the head\nor spine\nRadioisotope test of the CSF to track the leakage\nTreatment\nDepending on the cause of the leak, many symptoms improve on their own after a few days. Complete bed rest for several days is usually recommended. Drinking more fluids, especially drinks with caffeine, can help slow or stop the leak and may help with headache pain.\nYour headache may be treated with pain relievers and fluids. If your headache lasts longer than a week after a lumbar puncture, a procedure may be done to block the hole that may be leaking fluid. This is called a blood patch, because a blood clot can be used to seal the leak. In most cases, this makes symptoms go away."}

In rare cases, surgery is needed to repair the tear in the dura and stop your headache.\nIf symptoms of infection (fever, chills, change in mental status) are present, treatment with antibiotics will likely be needed.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook is usually good depending on the cause. Most cases heal by themselves with no lasting symptoms.\nIf the CSF leak keeps coming back, high pressure of the CSF (\nhydrocephalus\n) might be the cause and should be treated.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may occur if the cause is surgery or trauma."}

Infections after surgery or trauma can lead to\nmeningitis\nand serious complications, such as swelling of the brain, and need to be treated right away.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nYou have a headache that gets worse when you sit up, especially if you have recently had a head injury, surgery, or childbirth involving epidural anesthesia.\nYou have a moderate head injury, and then develop a headache that is worse when you sit up, or you have a thin, clear fluid draining from your nose or ear.\nPrevention\nMost CSF leaks are a complication of a spinal tap or surgery. The provider should use the smallest needle possible when doing a spinal tap.\nAlternative Names\nIntracranial hypotension; Cerebrospinal fluid leak\nImages\nCerebrospinal fluid leak\nReferences\nMaslak JP, Casper DS, Pelle D.
