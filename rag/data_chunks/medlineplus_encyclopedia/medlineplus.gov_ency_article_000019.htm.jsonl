Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBroken or dislocated jaw\nBroken or dislocated jaw\nA broken jaw is a break (fracture) in the jaw bone. A dislocated jaw means the lower part of the jaw has moved out of its normal position at one or both joints where the jaw bone connects to the skull (temporomandibular joints). A jaw bone joint is called the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).\nConsiderations\nA broken or dislocated jaw usually heals well after treatment. But the jaw may become dislocated again in the future.\nComplications may include:\nAirway blockage\nBleeding\nBreathing blood or food into the lungs\nDifficulty eating (temporary)\nDifficulty talking (temporary)\nInfection of the jaw or face\nPain of the jaw joint\n(TMJ) pain and other problems\nNumbness of part of the jaw or face\nProblems aligning the teeth\nSwelling\nCauses\nThe most common cause of a broken or dislocated jaw is injury to the face."}

This is because they may have breathing problems or bleeding. Call 911 or the local emergency number or a local hospital for further advice.\nHold the jaw gently in place with your hands on the way to the emergency room. You can also wrap a bandage under the jaw and over the top of the head. The bandage should be easy to remove in case you need to vomit.\nAt the hospital, if you have breathing problems, heavy bleeding occurs, or severe swelling of your face, a tube may be placed into your airway to help you breathe.\nFRACTURED JAW\nTreatment for a fractured jaw depends on how badly the bone is broken. If you have a minor fracture, it can heal on its own. You may only need pain medicines. You will probably have to eat soft foods or stay on a\nliquid diet\nfor a while.\nSurgery is often needed for moderate to severe fractures."}

You may only need pain medicines. You will probably have to eat soft foods or stay on a\nliquid diet\nfor a while.\nSurgery is often needed for moderate to severe fractures. The jaw may be wired to the teeth of the opposite jaw to keep the jaw stable while it heals. Jaw wires are usually left in place for 6 to 8 weeks. Small rubber bands (elastics) are used to hold the teeth together. After a few weeks, some of the elastics are removed to allow motion and reduce joint stiffness.\nIf the jaw is wired, you can only drink liquids or eat very soft foods. You must have blunt scissors readily available to cut the elastics in the event of vomiting or choking. If the wires must be cut, call your health care provider right away so that the wires can be replaced.\nDISLOCATED JAW\nIf your jaw is dislocated, the provider may be able to place it back into the correct position using the thumbs. Numbing medicines (anesthetics) and muscle relaxants may be needed to relax the jaw muscles.\nAfterward, your jaw may need to be stabilized. This usually involves bandaging the jaw to keep the mouth from opening widely."}

This usually involves bandaging the jaw to keep the mouth from opening widely. In some cases, surgery is needed to do this, particularly if repeated jaw dislocations occur.\nAfter dislocating your jaw, you should not open your mouth widely for at least 6 weeks. Support your jaw with one or both hands when yawning and sneezing.\nDO NOT\nDo  not try to correct the position of the jaw. A provider should do this.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nA broken or dislocated jaw requires  prompt medical attention. Emergency symptoms include difficulty breathing or heavy bleeding.\nPrevention\nDuring work, sports, and recreation activities, using safety equipment, such as a helmet when playing football, or using mouth guards can prevent or minimize some injuries to the face or jaw.\nAlternative Names\nDislocated jaw; Fractured jaw; Fractured mandible; Broken jaw; TMJ dislocation; Mandibular dislocation\nImages\nMandibular fracture\nReferences\nKellman RM.
