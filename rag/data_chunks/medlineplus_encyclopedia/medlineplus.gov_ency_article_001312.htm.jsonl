It involves pale-colored hair, eyes, and skin.\nCauses\nChediak-Higashi syndrome is passed down through families (inherited). It is an\nautosomal recessive\ndisease. This means that both parents are carriers of a non-working copy of the gene. Each parent must pass their non-working gene to the child for them to show symptoms of the disease.\nDefects have been found in the\nLYST\n(also called\nCHS1\n) gene."}

The primary defect in this disease is found in certain substances normally present in skin cells and certain white blood cells.\nSymptoms\nChildren with this condition may have:\nSilver hair, light-colored eyes (albinism)\nIncreased infections in the lungs, skin, and mucous membranes\nJerky eye movements (\nnystagmus\n)\nInfection of affected children with certain viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (\nEBV\n), can cause a life-threatening illness resembling the blood cancer\nlymphoma\ncalled hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis.\nOther symptoms may include:\nDecreased vision\nIntellectual disability\nMuscle weakness\nNerve problems in the limbs (\nperipheral neuropathy\n)\nNosebleeds or easy bruising\nNumbness\nTremor\nSeizures\nSensitivity to bright light (photophobia)\nUnsteady walking (\nataxia\n)\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

High doses of vitamin C may help some children whose condition is in the stable phase. Hematopoietic stem cells appear to have been successful in several patients.\nAntibiotics are used to treat and, sometimes, prevent infections. Antiviral drugs, such as acyclovir, and chemotherapy drugs are often used in the accelerated phase of the disease. Blood and platelet transfusions are given as needed."}
