What is known is that when a person has the disease, tiny clumps of abnormal tissue (granulomas) form in certain organs of the body. Granulomas are clusters of immune cells.\nThe disease can affect almost any organ. It most commonly affects the lungs.\nHealth experts think that having certain genes makes it more likely for a person to develop sarcoidosis. Things that may trigger the disease include infections with bacteria or viruses. Contact with dust or chemicals may also be triggers.\nThe disease is more common in African Americans and White people of Scandinavian heritage. More women than men have the disease.\nThe disease often begins between ages 20 and 40. Sarcoidosis is rare in young children.\nA person with a close blood relative who has sarcoidosis is nearly 5 times as likely to develop the condition.\nSymptoms\nThere may be no symptoms."}
