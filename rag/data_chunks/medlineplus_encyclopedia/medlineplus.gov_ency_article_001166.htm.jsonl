Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPhenylketonuria\nPhenylketonuria\nPhenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare condition in which a baby is born without the ability to properly break down an\namino acid\ncalled phenylalanine.\nCauses\nPKU is inherited, which means it is passed down through families. If both parents carry a nonworking copy of the gene related to this condition, each of their children has a 25% (1 in 4) chance of developing the disease. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance.\nBabies with PKU are missing an enzyme called phenylalanine hydroxylase. It is needed to break down the essential amino acid phenylalanine. Phenylalanine is found in foods that contain protein.\nWithout the enzyme, levels of phenylalanine build up in the body. This buildup can harm the\ncentral nervous system\nand cause brain damage.\nSymptoms\nPhenylalanine plays a role in the body's production of melanin. The pigment is responsible for skin and hair color."}

This buildup can harm the\ncentral nervous system\nand cause brain damage.\nSymptoms\nPhenylalanine plays a role in the body's production of melanin. The pigment is responsible for skin and hair color. Therefore, infants with the condition often have lighter skin, hair, and eyes than brothers or sisters without the disease.\nOther symptoms may include:\nDelayed mental and social skills\nHead size much smaller than normal\nHyperactivity\nJerking movements of the arms or legs\nMental disability\nSeizures\nSkin rashes\nTremors\nIf PKU is untreated, or if foods containing phenylalanine are eaten, the breath, skin, ear wax, and urine may have a \"mousy\" or \"musty\" odor. This odor is due to a buildup of phenylalanine substances in the body.\nExams and Tests\nPKU can be easily detected with a simple blood test. All states in the United States require a PKU screening test for all newborns as part of the newborn screening panel. The test is generally done by taking a few drops of blood from the baby before the baby leaves the hospital.\nIf the screening test is positive, further blood and urine tests are required to confirm the diagnosis. Genetic testing is also done.\nTreatment\nPKU is a treatable disease."}

Genetic testing is also done.\nTreatment\nPKU is a treatable disease. Treatment involves a diet that is very low in phenylalanine, particularly when the child is growing. The diet must be strictly followed. This requires close supervision by a registered dietitian or health care provider, and cooperation of the parent and child. Those who continue the diet into adulthood have better physical and mental health than those who don't stay on it. \"Diet for life\" has become the standard most experts recommend. Women who have PKU need to follow the diet before conception and throughout pregnancy.\nThere are large amounts of phenylalanine in milk, eggs, and other common foods. The artificial sweetener NutraSweet (\naspartame\n) also contains phenylalanine. Any products containing aspartame should be avoided.\nThere are several special formulas made for infants with PKU.  Infants with PKU can safely breastfeed, together with the use of medical foods and proper monitoring of phenylalanine levels."}

Infants with PKU can safely breastfeed, together with the use of medical foods and proper monitoring of phenylalanine levels. These special medical foods can be used as a protein source that is extremely low in phenylalanine and balanced for the remaining essential amino acids. Older children and adults use a different formula that provides protein in the amounts they need. People with PKU need to take formula every day for their entire life.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome is expected to be very good if the diet is closely followed, starting shortly after the child's birth. If treatment is delayed or the condition remains untreated, brain damage will occur."}

If treatment is delayed or the condition remains untreated, brain damage will occur. School functioning may be mildly impaired.\nIf proteins containing phenylalanine are not avoided, PKU can lead to mental disability by the end of the first year of life.\nPossible Complications\nSevere mental disability occurs if the disorder is untreated.\nAttention-deficit hyperactivity disorder\n(ADHD) appears to be a common problem in those who do not stick to a very low-phenylalanine diet.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if your infant has not been tested for PKU. This is particularly important if anyone in your family has the disorder.\nPrevention\nAn enzyme assay or genetic testing can determine if parents carry the gene for PKU.\nChorionic villus sampling\nor\namniocentesis\ncan be done during pregnancy to test the unborn baby for PKU.\nIt is very important that women with PKU closely follow a strict low-phenylalanine diet both before becoming pregnant and throughout the pregnancy."}
