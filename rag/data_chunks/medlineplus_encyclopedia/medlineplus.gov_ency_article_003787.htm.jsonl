You will need to lie on your back for this test.\nOnce inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you.\nSmall detectors inside the scanner measure the amount of x-rays that make it through the part of the body being studied. A computer takes this information and uses it to create a number of images, called slices. These images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, printed on film or saved on a disk. Three-dimensional models of organs can be created by stacking the individual slices together.\nYou must be still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time.\nIn some cases, an iodine-based dye, called contrast, may be injected into your vein before images are taken."}

You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time.\nIn some cases, an iodine-based dye, called contrast, may be injected into your vein before images are taken. Contrast can highlight specific areas inside the body, which creates a clearer image.\nIn other cases, a CT of the lumbosacral spine is done after injecting contrast dye into the spinal canal during a\nlumbar puncture\nto further check for compression on the nerves. This is called a CT myelogram.\nThe scan usually lasts a few minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou should remove all jewelry or other metal objects before the test. This is because they may cause inaccurate and blurry images.\nIf you do need a\nlumbar puncture\n, you may be asked to stop your blood thinners or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) several days before the procedure. Check with your health care provider ahead of time.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe x-rays are painless. Some people may have discomfort from lying on the hard table.\nContrast may cause a slight burning sensation, a metallic taste in the mouth, and a warm flushing of the body."}

Some people may have discomfort from lying on the hard table.\nContrast may cause a slight burning sensation, a metallic taste in the mouth, and a warm flushing of the body. These sensations are normal and usually go away within a few seconds.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nCT rapidly creates detailed pictures of the body. A CT of the lumbosacral spine can evaluate fractures and changes in the spine, such as those due to arthritis or deformities.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nCT of the lumbosacral spine may reveal the following conditions or diseases:\nCyst\nHerniated disk\nSpinal stenosis\nInfection\nCancer\nthat has spread to the spine\nOsteoarthritis\nOsteomalacia\n(softening of the bones)\nPinched nerve\nTumor\nVertebral\nfracture\n(broken spine bone)\nRisks\nThe most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine."}

The risk associated with any individual scan is small. The risk increases  when many more scans are performed.\nIn some cases, a CT scan may still be done if the benefits greatly outweigh the risks. For example, it can be more risky not to have the exam if your provider thinks you might have cancer.\nPregnant or breastfeeding women should consult their provider about the risk of CT scans to the baby."}
