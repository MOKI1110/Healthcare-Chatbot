They were not used or placed in the food on purpose. These additives are present in small amounts in the final product.\nFunction\nFood additives serve 5 main functions. They are:\n1. Give the food a smooth and consistent texture:\nEmulsifiers prevent liquid products from separating.\nStabilizers and thickeners provide an even texture.\nAnticaking agents allow substances to flow freely.\n2."}

Improve or preserve the nutrient value:\nMany foods and drinks are fortified and enriched to provide vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients. Examples of commonly fortified foods are flour, cereal, margarine, and milk. This helps make up for vitamins or minerals that may be low or lacking in a person's diet.\nAll products that contain added nutrients must be labeled.\n3. Maintain the wholesomeness of foods:\nBacteria and other germs can cause foodborne illnesses. Preservatives reduce the spoilage that these germs can cause.\nCertain preservatives help preserve the flavor in baked goods by preventing the fats and oils from going bad.\nPreservatives also keep fresh fruits from turning brown when they are exposed to the air.\n4."}

Control the acid-base balance of foods and provide leavening:\nCertain additives help change the acid-base balance of foods to get a certain flavor or color.\nLeavening agents that release acids when they are heated react with baking soda to help biscuits, cakes, and other baked goods rise.\n5. Provide color and enhance flavor:\nCertain colors improve the appearance of foods.\nMany spices, as well as natural and man-made flavors, bring out the taste of food.\nSide Effects\nMost concerns about food additives have to do with man-made ingredients that are added to foods."}

Many have not been tested, but most scientists consider them safe. These substances are put on the \"generally recognized as safe (GRAS)\" list. This list contains about 700 items.\nCongress defines safe as \"reasonable certainty that no harm will result from use\" of an additive. Examples of items on this list are: guar gum, sugar, salt, and vinegar."}

For their own protection, people with any\nallergies\nor food intolerances should always check the ingredient list on the label. Reactions to any additive can be mild or severe. For example, some people with asthma have worsening of their asthma after eating foods or drinks that contain sulfites.\nIt is important to keep gathering information about the safety of food additives. Report any reactions you have to food or food additives to the FDA Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition (CFSAN)."}
