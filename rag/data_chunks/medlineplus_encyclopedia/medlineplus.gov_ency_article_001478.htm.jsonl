It refers to a netlike pattern of reddish-blue skin discoloration. The legs are often affected. The condition is linked to swollen blood vessels. It may get worse when the temperature is cold.\nCauses\nAs blood flows through the body, arteries are the blood vessels that carry blood away from the heart and veins carry blood back to the heart. The skin discoloration pattern of LR results from veins in the skin that are filled with more blood than normal. This can be caused by any of the following:\nEnlarged veins\nBlocked blood flow leaving the veins\nThere are two forms of LR: primary and secondary. Secondary LR is also known as livedo racemosa.\nWith primary LR, exposure to cold, tobacco use, or emotional upset can lead the skin discoloration."}
