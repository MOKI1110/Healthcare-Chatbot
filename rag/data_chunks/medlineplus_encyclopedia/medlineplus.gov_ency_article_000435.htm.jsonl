In this disease, the immune system of the body mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. It can affect the skin, joints, kidneys, brain, and other organs.\nCauses\nThe cause of SLE is not clearly known. It may be linked to the following factors:\nGenetic\nEnvironmental\nHormonal\nCertain medicines\nSLE is more common in women than men by nearly 10 to 1. It may occur at any age. However, it appears most often in young women between the ages of 15 and 44. In the United States, the disease is more common in African Americans, Asian Americans, African Caribbeans, and Hispanic Americans than non-Hispanic white people.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms vary from person to person, and may come and go. Everyone with SLE has\njoint pain\nand swelling at some time. Some develop\narthritis\n."}

These include specific symptoms, physical finding and laboratory tests. Nearly all people with SLE have a positive test for an antinuclear antibody (ANA). However, having a positive ANA alone does not mean you have SLE.\nThe health care provider will do a complete physical exam. You may have a rash, arthritis, or swelling in the ankles. There may be an abnormal sound called a pericardial friction rub or pleural friction rub. Your provider will also do a nervous system exam.\nTests used to diagnose SLE may include:\nAntinuclear antibody (ANA)\nComplete blood count (CBC)\nwith differential\nChest x-ray\nSerum creatinine\nUrinalysis\nYou may also have other tests to learn more about your condition."}

The goal of treatment is to control symptoms. Severe symptoms that involve the heart, lungs, kidneys, and other organs often need treatment by specialists. Each person with SLE needs evaluation regarding:\nHow active the disease is\nWhat part of the body is affected\nWhat form of treatment is needed\nMild forms of SLE may be treated with:\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) for joint symptoms and pleurisy."}

These medicines are used if you have severe SLE that is affecting your nervous system, kidney, or other organs. They may also be used if you do not get better with corticosteroids, or if your symptoms get worse when you stop taking corticosteroids.\nMedicines most commonly used include mycophenolate, azathioprine, cyclophosphamide, and valcosporin. Because of its toxicity, cyclophosphamide is limited to a short course of 3 to 6 months."}

Many people with SLE have mild symptoms. How well you do depends on how severe the disease is. Most people with SLE will require medicines for a long time. Nearly all will require hydroxychloroquine indefinitely. However, in the United States, SLE is one of the top 20 leading causes of death in females between the ages of 5 and 64."}

A good outcome is more likely for women who receive proper treatment and do not have serious heart or kidney problems. However, the presence of certain SLE antibodies or antiphospholipid antibodies raises the risk of miscarriage.\nPossible Complications\nLUPUS NEPHRITIS\nSome people with SLE have abnormal immune deposits in the kidney cells. This leads to a condition called\nlupus nephritis\n. People with this problem may develop\nkidney failure\n. They may need\ndialysis\nor a\nkidney transplant\n.\nA kidney biopsy is done to detect the extent of damage to the kidney and to help guide treatment."}
