Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nVIPoma\nVIPoma\nVIPoma is a very rare\ncancer\nthat usually grows from cells in the pancreas called islet cells.\nCauses\nVIPoma causes cells in the pancreas to produce a high level of a hormone called vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). This hormone increases secretions from the intestines. It also relaxes some of the smooth muscles in the gastrointestinal system.\nThe exact cause of VIPomas is not known.\nVIPomas are often diagnosed in adults, most commonly around age 50. Women are more likely to be affected than men. This cancer is rare."}

Women are more likely to be affected than men. This cancer is rare. Each year, only about 1 in 1 million people are diagnosed with a VIPoma.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of VIPoma may include any of the following:\nAbdominal pain\nand cramping\nDiarrhea (watery, and often in large amounts)\nDehydration\nFlushing or redness of the face\nMuscle cramps due to low blood potassium (\nhypokalemia\n)\nNausea\nWeight loss\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history and symptoms.\nTests that may be done include:\nBlood chemistry tests (basic or\ncomprehensive metabolic panel\n)\nCT scan of the abdomen\nGenetic tests\nMRI of the abdomen\nStool exam for cause of diarrhea and\nelectrolyte\nlevels\nVIP level in the blood\nTreatment\nThe first goal of treatment is to correct dehydration. Fluids are often given through a vein (\nintravenous\nfluids) to replace fluids lost through diarrhea.\nThe next goal is to slow the diarrhea. Medicines can help regulate diarrhea. One such medicine is octreotide."}

Medicines can help regulate diarrhea. One such medicine is octreotide. It is a manmade form of a natural hormone that blocks the action of VIP.\nThe best chance of a cure is surgery to remove the tumor. If the tumor has not spread to other organs, surgery can often cure the condition.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\ncancer support group\n. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSurgery can usually cure VIPomas. But, in one third to one half of people, the tumor has spread by the time of diagnosis and cannot be cured."}

But, in one third to one half of people, the tumor has spread by the time of diagnosis and cannot be cured. However, it grows fairly slowly, and its effects often can be regulated by octreotide.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nCancer spread (metastases)\nCardiac arrest from low blood potassium level\nDehydration\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIf you have watery diarrhea for more than 2 to 3 days, contact your provider.\nAlternative Names\nVasoactive intestinal peptide-producing tumor; VIPoma syndrome; Pancreatic endocrine tumor; Verner-Morrison syndrome; WDHA\nImages\nPancreas\nReferences\nAsban A, Patel AJ, Reddy S, Wang T, Balentine CJ, Chen H.
