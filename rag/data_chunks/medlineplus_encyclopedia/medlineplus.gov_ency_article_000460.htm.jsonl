DI is a different disease than\ndiabetes\n, though both share common symptoms of\nexcessive urination\nand thirst.\nCentral diabetes insipidus is a form of DI that occurs when the body has a lower than normal amount of antidiuretic hormone (ADH). ADH is also called\nvasopressin\n. ADH is produced in a part of the brain called the\nhypothalamus\n. ADH is then stored and released from the pituitary gland. This is a small gland at the base of the brain.\nADH controls the amount of water excreted in urine. Without ADH, the kidneys do not work properly to keep enough water in the body. The result is a rapid loss of water from the body in the form of dilute urine."}

Without ADH, the kidneys do not work properly to keep enough water in the body. The result is a rapid loss of water from the body in the form of dilute urine. This results in the need to drink large amounts of water due to extreme thirst and to make up for excessive water loss in the urine (10 to 15 liters a day).\nThe reduced level of ADH may be caused by damage to the hypothalamus or pituitary gland. This damage may be due to surgery, infection, inflammation,\ntumor\n, or\ninjury to the brain\n.\nIn rare cases, central diabetes insipidus is caused by a genetic problem.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of central diabetes insipidus include:\nIncreased urine production\nExcessive thirst\nConfusion and changes in alertness due to dehydration and higher than normal sodium level in the body, if the person is unable to drink\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will ask about your medical history and symptoms.\nTests that may be ordered include:\nBlood sodium\nand\nosmolarity\nDesmopressin (DDAVP) challenge\nMRI of the head\nUrinalysis\nUrine concentration\nand osmolarity\nUrine output\nTreatment\nThe cause of the underlying condition will be treated.\nVasopressin (desmopressin"}

If treated, central diabetes insipidus usually does not cause severe problems or result in early death.\nPossible Complications\nNot drinking enough fluids can lead to dehydration and\nelectrolyte\nimbalance.\nWhen taking vasopressin and your body's thirst control is not normal, drinking more fluids than your body needs can cause dangerous electrolyte imbalance.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop symptoms of central diabetes insipidus.\nIf you have central diabetes insipidus, contact your provider if frequent urination or extreme thirst returns.\nPrevention\nMany of the cases may not be preventable.
