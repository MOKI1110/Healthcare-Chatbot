This type of donor is called a cadaver donor.\nSometimes, a healthy person will donate part of their liver to a person with a diseased liver. For example, a parent may donate to a child. This kind of donor is called a living donor. The liver can regrow itself in a living donor. Both people most often end up with fully working livers after a successful transplant.\nThe donor liver is transported in a cooled salt-water (saline) solution that preserves the organ for up to 8 hours. The necessary tests can then be done to match the donor with the recipient.\nThe new liver is removed from the donor through a surgical cut in the upper abdomen. It is placed into the person who needs the liver (called the recipient) and attached to the blood vessels and\nbile\nducts. The operation may take up to 12 hours."}

The recipient will often need a large amount of blood through a transfusion.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nA healthy liver performs more than 400 jobs each day, including:\nMaking bile, which is important in digestion\nMaking proteins that help with blood clotting\nRemoving or changing bacteria, medicines, and toxins in the blood\nStoring sugars, fats, iron, copper, and vitamins\nThe most common reason for a liver transplant in children is\nbiliary atresia\n. In most of these cases, the transplant is from a living donor.\nThe most common reason for a liver transplant in adults is\ncirrhosis\n.

Key factors include the type of liver problems you have, how severe your disease is, and the likelihood that a transplant will be successful.\nThe amount of time you spend on a waiting list is most often not a factor in how soon you get a liver, with the possible exception of children.\nWhile you are waiting for a liver, follow these steps:\nFollow any diet your transplant team recommends.\nDo not drink alcohol or use drugs.\nDo not smoke.\nKeep your weight in the appropriate range.

This means that their immune system sees the new liver as a foreign substance and tries to destroy it.\nTo avoid rejection, almost all transplant recipients must take medicines that suppress their immune response for the rest of their lives. This is called immunosuppressive therapy. Although the treatment helps prevent organ rejection, it also puts people at a higher risk for infection and cancer.\nIf you take immunosuppressive medicine, you need to be regularly screened for cancer. The medicines may also cause high blood pressure and high cholesterol, and increase the risks for diabetes.\nA successful transplant requires close follow-up with your provider and your transplant team."}
