Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLead poisoning\nLead poisoning\nLead is a very strong poison. When a person swallows an object that has lead in it or breathes in lead dust, some of the poison can stay in the body and cause serious health problems.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call the local emergency number (such as 911), or the local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\nWhere Found\nLead used to be very common in gasoline and house paint in the United States. In children, lead exposure often occurs through ingestion. Children living in cities with older houses are more likely to have high levels of lead in their blood or body. In the United States, it is estimated that half a million children ages 1 through 5 years have unhealthy levels of lead in their blood."}

In the United States, it is estimated that half a million children ages 1 through 5 years have unhealthy levels of lead in their blood. In adults, lead exposure is usually through inhalation in the work environment.\nImmigrant and refugee children are at much greater risk for lead poisoning than children born in the United States because of diet and other exposure risks before arriving in the United States.\nAlthough gasoline and paint are no longer made with lead in them, lead is still a health problem. Lead is everywhere, including in dirt, dust, new toys, and old house paint. Unfortunately, you cannot see, taste, or smell lead.\nAn estimated 1 million people worldwide die from lead poisoning every year. Lead is found in:\nHouses in the US painted before 1978. Even if the paint is not peeling, it can be a problem. Lead paint is very dangerous when it is being stripped or sanded. These actions release fine lead dust into the air. Infants and children living in pre-1960's housing (when paint often contained lead) have the highest risk of lead poisoning."}

They can also get lead on their fingers from touching a dusty or peeling lead object, and then putting their fingers in their mouths or eating food afterward. Children also can breathe in tiny amounts of lead.\nSymptoms\nThere are many possible symptoms of lead poisoning. Lead can affect many different parts of the body. A single high dose of lead can cause severe emergency symptoms.\nHowever, it is more common for lead poisoning to occur slowly over time."}
