Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nEye redness\nEye redness\nEye redness is most often due to swollen or dilated blood vessels. This makes the surface of the eye look red or bloodshot.\nConsiderations\nThere are many causes of a red eye or eyes. Some are medical emergencies. Others are a cause for concern, but not an emergency. Many are nothing to worry about.\nEye redness is often less of a concern than eye pain or vision problems.\nCauses\nBloodshot eyes appear red because the vessels at the surface of the white portion of the eye (\nsclera\n) become swollen. Vessels may swell due to:\nEye dryness\nToo much sun exposure\nDust or other particles in the eye\nAllergies\nInfection\nInjury\nEye infections or inflammation can cause redness as well as possible itching, discharge, pain, or vision problems. These may be due to:\nBlepharitis\n: Swelling along the edge of the eyelid.\nConjunctivitis\n: Swelling or infection of the clear tissue that lines the eyelids and covers the surface of the eye (the conjunctiva)."}

This is often referred to as \"pink eye.\"\nCorneal ulcers\n: Sores on the cornea most often caused by a serious bacterial or viral infection.\nUveitis\n: Inflammation of the uvea, which includes the iris, ciliary body, and choroid. The cause is most often not known. It may be related to an autoimmune disorder, infection, or exposure to toxins. The type of uveitis that causes the worst red eye is called iritis, in which only the iris is inflamed.\nOther potential causes of eye redness include:\nColds or allergies.\nAcute\nglaucoma\n: A sudden increase in eye pressure that is extremely painful and causes serious visual problems. This is a medical emergency. The more common form of glaucoma comes on gradually and is long-term (chronic).\nCorneal scratches: Injuries caused by sand, dust, or overuse of contact lenses.\nSometimes, a bright red spot, called a subconjunctival hemorrhage, will appear on the white of the eye."}

This often happens after straining or coughing, which causes a broken blood vessel on the surface of the eye. Most often, there is no pain and your vision is normal. It is almost never a serious problem. It may be more common in people who are taking aspirin or blood thinners. Because the blood leaks into the conjunctiva, which is clear, you cannot wipe or rinse the blood away. Like a bruise, the red spot will change colors (usually yellow) and then go away within a week or two.\nHome Care\nTry to rest your eyes if redness is due to fatigue or eye strain."}
