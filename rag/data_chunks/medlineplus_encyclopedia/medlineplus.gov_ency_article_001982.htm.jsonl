The average normal body temperature is generally accepted as 98.6 °F (37 °C). Some studies have shown that the normal body temperature can have a wide range, from 97 °F (36.1 °C) to 99 °F (37.2 °C).\nA temperature over 100.4 °F (38 °C) most often means you have a fever caused by an infection or illness.\nBody temperature normally changes throughout the day and in adults, it is lowest in the early morning.\nAlternative Names\nNormal body temperature; Temperature - normal\nImages\nThermometer temperature\nReferences\nBlum FC, Biros MH.
