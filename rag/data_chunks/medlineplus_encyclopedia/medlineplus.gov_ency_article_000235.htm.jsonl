This problem may occur in the esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine, rectum, or gallbladder.\nCauses\nPerforation of an organ can be caused by a variety of factors. These include:\nAppendicitis\nCancer (all types)\nCrohn disease\nDiverticulitis\nGallbladder disease\nPeptic ulcer disease\nUlcerative colitis\nBowel blockage\nChemotherapy agents\nIncreased pressure in the esophagus caused by forceful vomiting\nIngestion of caustic substances\nIt may also be caused by surgery in the abdomen or procedures such as colonoscopy or upper endoscopy.\nSymptoms\nPerforation of the intestine or other organs causes the contents to leak into the abdomen. This causes a severe infection called\nperitonitis\n.\nSymptoms may include:\nSevere abdominal pain\nChills\nFever\nNausea\nVomiting\nShock\nExams and Tests\nX-rays of the chest or abdomen may show air in the abdominal cavity. This is called free air. It is a sign of a perforation."}

This is called free air. It is a sign of a perforation. If the esophagus is perforated free air can be seen in the mediastinum (around the heart) and in the chest.\nCT scan of the abdomen\noften shows where the hole is located. The\nwhite blood cell count\nis often higher than normal.\nA procedure may help find the area of the perforation, such as an upper endoscopy (EGD) or a colonoscopy.\nTreatment\nTreatment most often involves emergency surgery to repair the hole.\nSometimes, a small part of the intestine must be removed. One end of the intestine may be brought out through an opening (stoma) made in the abdominal wall. This is called a\ncolostomy\nor\nileostomy\n.\nA drain from the abdomen or other organ may also be needed.\nIn rare cases, people can be treated with antibiotics alone if the perforation has closed. This can be confirmed by a physical exam, blood tests, CT scan, and x-rays.\nA perforation from a colonoscopy may sometimes be closed during the procedure without surgery.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSurgery is successful most of the time."}

However, the outcome will depend on how severe the perforation is, and for how long it was present before treatment. The presence of other illnesses or septic shock can also affect how well a person will do after treatment.\nPossible Complications\nEven with surgery, infection is the most common complication of the condition. Infections can be either inside the abdomen (abdominal abscess or peritonitis), or throughout the whole body. Body-wide infection is called\nsepsis\n.  Sepsis can be very serious and can lead to death.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have:\nBlood in your stool\nChanges in bowel habits\nFever\nNausea\nSevere abdominal pain\nVomiting\nCall 911 or the local emergency number right away if you or someone else have ingested a caustic substance.\nCall the local\npoison control center\nemergency number at 1-800-222-1222 if a person has ingested a caustic substance."}

This hotline number will let you talk to experts in poisoning.\nDO NOT wait until the person has symptoms before you call for help.\nPrevention\nPeople will often have a few days of pain before the intestinal perforation occurs. If you have pain in the abdomen, see your provider right away. Treatment is much simpler and safer when it is started before the perforation occurs.\nAlternative Names\nIntestinal perforation; Perforation of the intestines; Gastric perforation; Esophageal perforation\nImages\nDigestive system\nReferences\nBrackenridge S, Thompson A.
