High blood pressure (hypertension) is an increase in this force. This article focuses on high blood pressure in children, which is often a result of being overweight.\nBlood pressure readings are given as two numbers. Blood pressure measurements are written this way: 120/80. One or both of these numbers can be too high.\nThe first (top) number is the systolic blood pressure.\nThe second (bottom) number is the diastolic pressure.\nHigh blood pressure in children up to age 13 is defined differently than in adults. This is because what is considered normal blood pressure changes as a child grows."}

This is because what is considered normal blood pressure changes as a child grows. A child's blood pressure numbers are compared with the blood pressure measurements of other children the same age, height, and sex.\nNormal blood pressure ranges in children ages 1 to 13 years are published by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, a US government agency. You can also ask your health care provider. Abnormal blood pressure readings are described as follows:\nElevated blood pressure\nStage 1 high blood pressure\nStage 2 high blood pressure\nChildren older than age 13 follow the same guidelines for\nhigh blood pressure\nas adults.\nCauses\nMany things can affect blood pressure, including:\nHormone levels\nThe health of the nervous system, heart, and blood vessels\nThe health of the kidneys\nMost of the time, no cause of high blood pressure is found."}
