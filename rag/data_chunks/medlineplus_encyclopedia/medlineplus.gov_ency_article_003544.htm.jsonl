Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nQuantitative immunoglobulins\nQuantitative immunoglobulins\nThe quantitative immunoglobulins test measures the levels of proteins called gamma globulins in the fluid part of a blood sample. This fluid is called serum.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nIn the lab, the technician places the blood sample on special paper and applies an electric current. The proteins move on the paper and form bands that show the amount of each protein.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nFollow instructions on whether or not you need to fast before this test.\nCertain medicines may affect the results of this test. Your health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines. Do not stop any medicine before talking to your provider.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to look at gamma globulin protein levels in the blood."}

Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to look at gamma globulin protein levels in the blood. Identifying the levels of gamma globulins can help diagnose certain medical issues.\nGamma globulins include various types of antibodies such as immunoglobulins (Ig) M, G, and A.\nCertain diseases are associated with producing too many immunoglobulins. For example,\nWaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia\nis a cancer of certain white blood cells. It is linked with producing too many IgM antibodies.\nNormal Results\nNormal value ranges are:\nSerum globulin: 2.0 to 3.5 grams per deciliter (g/dL) or 20 to 35 grams per liter (g/L)\nIgM component: 120 to 400 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 1.2 to 4 g/L\nIgG component:  800 to 1600 mg/dL or 8 to 16 g/L\nIgA component:  40 to 220 mg/dL or 0.4 to 2.2 g/L\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIncreased gamma globulin proteins may indicate:\nAcute\ninfection\nBlood and bone marrow cancers including\nmultiple myeloma\n, and some lymphomas and leukemias\nImmune deficiency disorders\nLong-term (\nchronic\n) inflammatory disease (for example,\nrheumatoid arthritis\nand\nsystemic lupus erythematosus\n)\nWaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia\nRisks\nThere is very little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting\nor feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma\n(blood buildup under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nDominiczak MH.
