After it is removed, the end of the small intestine is sewn to the rectum.\nDescription\nYou will receive\ngeneral anesthesia\nbefore your surgery.  You will be asleep and unable to feel pain.\nDuring the surgery:\nYour surgeon will make a surgical cut in your belly.\nYour surgeon will remove your large intestine. Your rectum and anus will be left in place.\nYour surgeon will connect the end of your small intestine to your rectum.\nYour abdomen will be closed, and your skin from the incision may be left open or closed.\nToday, some surgeons perform this operation using a camera that is part of an instrument called a laparoscope. The surgery is done with a few small surgical cuts, and sometimes a larger cut so that the surgeon can also work by hand."}
