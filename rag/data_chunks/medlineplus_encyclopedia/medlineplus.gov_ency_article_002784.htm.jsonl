Cloth dye poisoning occurs when someone swallows large amounts of these substances.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual poison exposure. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\nPoisonous Ingredient\nThe poisonous ingredient in cloth dye is corrosive alkali.\nToday it is rare to find this poisonous ingredient in most household cloth dyes.\nMost common household cloth dyes are made from nonpoisonous substances, such as:\nMild soaps\nPigments\nSalts\nAlthough these substances are generally considered not dangerous, they can cause problems if swallowed in large amounts, especially in small children.\nWhere Found\nThis substance is found in certain dyes used to color clothing or fabric.\nSymptoms\nCloth dye poisoning can ca"}

You can call for any reason, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\nWhat to Expect at the Emergency Room\nThe provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing rate, and blood pressure. Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive:\nBlood and urine tests\nBreathing support, including oxygen through a tube into the lungs, and a breathing machine (\nventilator\n)\nBronchoscopy\n-- camera down the throat to look for burns in the airways and lungs (if the poison was inhaled)\nChest x-ray\nElectrocardiogram\n(ECG)\nEndoscopy\n-- camera down the throat to look for burns in the esophagus and the stomach\nFluids through a vein (by IV)\nMedicine to reverse the effect of the poison and treat symptoms\nSurgical removal of burned skin (skin debridement)\nTube through the mouth into the stomach to aspirate (suck out) the stomach."}

The faster the person gets medical help, the better the chance for recovery.\nIf the poisoning involved a corrosive alkali, extensive damage may occur to the:\nEsophagus\nKidneys\nMouth\nStomach\nThroat\nThe outcome depends on the extent of this damage. Poisoning from dye containing an alkali may result in continuing injury to these tissues for weeks or months.\nSwallowing such poisons can have severe effects on many parts of the body. Burns in the airway or gastrointestinal tract can lead to tissue death. This may result in infection, shock, and death, even several months after substance was swallowed."}
