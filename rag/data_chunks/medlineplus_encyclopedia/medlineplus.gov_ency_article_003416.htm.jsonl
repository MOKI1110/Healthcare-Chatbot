There are two types.\nFine needle aspiration uses a small needle attached to a syringe. Very small amounts of tissue cells are removed.\nCore biopsy removes slivers of tissue using a hollow needle attached to a spring-loaded device.\nWith either type of needle biopsy, the needle is passed several times through the tissue being examined. Your health care provider uses the needle to remove the tissue sample. Needle biopsies are often done using\nCT scan\n,\nMRI\n,\nmammogram\n, or\nultrasound\n. These imaging tools help guide your provider to the right area.\nAn open biopsy is surgery that uses local or\ngeneral anesthesia\n. This means you are relaxed (sedated) or asleep and pain free during the procedure. It is done in a hospital operating room."}

This means you are relaxed (sedated) or asleep and pain free during the procedure. It is done in a hospital operating room. The surgeon makes a cut into the affected area, and the tissue is removed.\nA laparoscopic biopsy uses much smaller surgical cuts than an open biopsy. A camera-like instrument (laparoscope) and tools can be inserted. The laparoscope helps guide the surgeon to the right place to take the sample.\nskin lesion biopsy\nis done when a small amount of skin is removed so it can be examined. The skin is tested to look for skin conditions or diseases.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nBefore scheduling the biopsy, tell your provider about any medicines you are taking, including herbs and supplements. You may be asked to stop taking some for a while. These include blood thinners such as:\nNSAIDs (aspirin, ibuprofen, naproxen)\nClopidogrel (Plavix)\nWarfarin (Coumadin)\nDabigatran (Pradaxa)\nRivaroxaban (Xarelto)\nApixaban (Eliquis)\nDo not stop or change your medicines without first talking to your provider.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWith a needle biopsy, you may feel some discomfort at the site of the biopsy."}

Local anesthesia is injected to lessen the pain that you would feel.\nIn an open or laparoscopic biopsy, general anesthesia is often used so that you will be pain free.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA biopsy is most often done to examine tissue for disease.\nNormal Results\nThe tissue removed is normal.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAn abnormal biopsy means that the tissue or cells have an unusual structure, shape, size, or condition.\nThis may mean you have a disease, such as cancer or another condition, but it depends on your biopsy.\nRisks\nRisks of a biopsy include:\nBleeding\nInfection\nConsiderations\nThere are many different types of biopsies and not all are done with a needle or surgery. Ask your provider for more information about the specific type of biopsy you are having.\nAlternative Names\nTissue sampling\nImages\nCore needle biopsy of the breast\nReferences\nAmerican College of Radiology (ACR), the Society of Interventional Radiology (SIR), and the Society for Pediatric Radiology."}
