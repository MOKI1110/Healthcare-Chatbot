It can be used for people who are\ndeaf or very hard of hearing\n.\nInformation\nA cochlear implant is not the same thing as a hearing aid. It is implanted using surgery and works in a different way.\nThere are many different types of cochlear implants. However, they are most often made up of several similar parts.\nOne part of the device is surgically implanted into the bone surrounding the ear (temporal bone). It is made up of a receiver-stimulator, which accepts, decodes, and then sends an electrical signal to the brain.\nThe second part of the cochlear implant is a device out of the body. This is made up of a microphone/receiver, a speech processor, and an antenna. This part of the implant receives the sound, converts the sound into an electrical signal, and sends it to the inside part of the cochlear implant.\nWHO USES A COCHLEAR IMPLANT?\nCochlear implants allow deaf people to receive and process sounds and speech."}

However, these devices do not restore normal hearing. They are tools that allow sound and speech to be processed and sent to the brain.\nA cochlear implant is not right for everyone. The way a person is selected for cochlear implants is changing as the understanding of the brain's hearing (auditory) pathways improves and the technology changes.\nBoth children and adults can be candidates for cochlear implants. People who are candidates for this device may have been born deaf or become deaf after learning to speak. Children as young as 1 year old are now candidates for this surgery. Although criteria are slightly different for adults and children, they are based on similar guidelines:\nThe person should be completely or almost completely deaf in both ears and get almost no improvement with hearing aids. Anyone who can hear well enough with hearing aids is not a good candidate for cochlear implants.\nThe person needs to be highly motivated."}

Anyone who can hear well enough with hearing aids is not a good candidate for cochlear implants.\nThe person needs to be highly motivated. After the cochlear implant is placed, they must learn how to properly use the device.\nThe person needs to have reasonable expectations for what will occur after surgery. The device does not restore or create \"normal\" hearing.\nChildren need to be enrolled in programs that help them learn how to process sound.\nIn order to determine if a person is a candidate for a cochlear implant, the person must be examined by an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) doctor (otolaryngologist). People will also need specific types of hearing tests performed with their hearing aids on.\nPeople may need a\nCT scan\nor\nMRI scan of the brain\nand the middle and inner ear.\nPeople (especially children) may need to be assessed by a psychologist to determine if they are good candidates.\nHOW IT WORKS\nSounds are transmitted through the air. In a normal ear, sound waves cause the eardrum and then the middle ear bones to vibrate. This sends a wave of vibrations into the inner ear (cochlea)."}

In a normal ear, sound waves cause the eardrum and then the middle ear bones to vibrate. This sends a wave of vibrations into the inner ear (cochlea). These waves are then converted by the cochlea into electrical signals, which are sent along the auditory nerve to the brain.\nA deaf person does not have a functioning inner ear. A cochlear implant tries to replace the function of the inner ear by turning sound into electrical energy. This energy can then be used to stimulate the cochlear nerve (the nerve for hearing), sending \"sound\" signals to the brain.\nSound is picked up by a microphone worn near the ear. This sound is sent to a speech processor, which is most often connected to the microphone and worn behind the ear.\nThe sound is analyzed and converted into electrical signals, which are sent to a surgically implanted receiver behind the ear."}

The pocket helps keep it in place and makes sure it is close enough to the skin to allow electrical information to be sent from the device."}

Risks are less common now that the surgery is performed through a small surgical cut, but may include:\nWound healing problems\nSkin breakdown over the implanted device\nInfection near the implant site\nLess common complications include:\nDamage to the nerve that moves the face on the side of the operation\nLeakage of the fluid around the brain (cerebrospinal fluid)\nInfection of the fluid around the brain (\nmeningitis\n)\nTemporary dizziness (\nvertigo\n)\nFailure of the device to work\nAbnormal taste\nRECOVERY AFTER SURGERY\nYou may be admitted to the hospital overnight for observation. However, many hospitals now allow people to go home the day of surgery. Your surgeon will give you pain medicines and sometimes antibiotics to prevent infection. Many surgeons place a large dressing over the operated ear. The dressing is removed the day after surgery.\nA week or more after surgery, the outside part of the cochlear implant is secured to the receiver-stimulator that was implanted behind the ear."}

These specialists may include:\nAudiologists\nSpeech therapists\nENT doctors\nThis is a very important part of the process. You will need to work closely with your team of specialists to get the most benefit from the implant.\nOUTLOOK\nResults with cochlear implants vary widely. How well you do depends on:\nThe condition of your hearing nerve before surgery\nYour mental abilities\nThe device being used\nThe length of time you were deaf\nThe surgery\nSome people can learn to communicate on the telephone. Others can only recognize sound. Getting the maximum results can take up to several years, and you need to be motivated."}

However, your health care provider or surgeon may tell you to avoid contact sports to lessen the chance of injury to the implanted device.\nMost people with cochlear implants cannot get MRI scans, because the implant is made of metal.\nAlternative Names\nHearing loss - cochlear implant; Sensorineural - cochlear; Deaf - cochlear; Deafness - cochlear\nImages\nEar anatomy\nCochlear implant\nReferences\nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) website.
