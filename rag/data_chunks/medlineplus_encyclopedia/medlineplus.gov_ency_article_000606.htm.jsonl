It causes small, painful\nblisters\ncommonly called cold sores or fever blisters. Oral herpes is also called herpes labialis.\nCauses\nOral herpes is a common infection of the mouth area. It is caused by the herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1). Most people in the United States are infected with this virus by age 20.\nAfter the first infection, the virus becomes dormant (an inactive state) in the nerve tissues in the face. Sometimes, the virus later reactivates, causing cold sores.\nHerpes virus type 2 (HSV-2) most often causes\ngenital herpes\n. However, sometimes HSV-2 is spread to the mouth during oral sex, causing oral herpes.\nHerpes viruses spread most easily from individuals with an active outbreak or sore."}
