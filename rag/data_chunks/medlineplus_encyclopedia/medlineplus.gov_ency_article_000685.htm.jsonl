Tardive means delayed and dyskinesia means abnormal movement.\nCauses\nTD is a serious side effect that may occur when you take medicines called neuroleptics. These medicines are also called antipsychotics or major tranquilizers. They are used to treat mental health issues.\nTD often occurs when you take the medicine for many months or years. In some cases, it occurs after you take them for as little as 6 weeks.\nMedicines that most commonly cause this disorder are older antipsychotics, including:\nChlorpromazine\nFluphenazine\nHaloperidol\nPerphenazine\nProchlorperazine\nTrifluoperazine\nNewer antipsychotics seem less likely to cause TD, but they are not entirely without risk.\nOther medicines that can cause TD include:\nMetoclopramide (treats stomach problem called\ngastroparesis\n)\nAntidepressant medicines such as amitriptyline, fluoxetine, phenelzine, sertraline, trazodone, lithium\nAnti-Parkinson medicines such as levodopa\nAnti-seizure medicines such as ph"}

A dopamine-depleting medicine, tetrabenazine is most effective treatment for TD. Valbenazine is an alternative. Your provider can tell you more about these treatments.\nIf TD is very severe, a procedure called\ndeep brain stimulation\n(DBS) may be tried."}

DBS uses a device called a neurostimulator to deliver electrical signals to the areas of the brain that control movement.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf diagnosed early, TD may be reversed by stopping the medicine that caused the symptoms. Even if the medicine is stopped, the involuntary movements may become permanent, and in some cases, may become worse.\nAlternative Names\nTD; Tardive syndrome; Orofacial dyskinesia; Involuntary movement - tardive dyskinesia; Antipsychotic drugs - tardive dyskinesia; Neuroleptic drugs - tardive dyskinesia; Schizophrenia - tardive dyskinesia\nImages\nCentral nervous system and peripheral nervous system\nReferences\nAronson JK.
