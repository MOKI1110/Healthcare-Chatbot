Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nStrabismus\nStrabismus\nStrabismus is a disorder in which both eyes do not line up in the same direction. Therefore, they do not look at the same object at the same time. The most common form of strabismus is known as \"crossed eyes.\"\nCauses\nSix different muscles surround each eye and work \"as a team.\" This allows both eyes to focus on the same object.\nIn someone with strabismus, these muscles do not work together. As a result, one eye looks at one object, while the other eye turns in a different direction and looks at another object.\nWhen this occurs, two different images are sent to the brain -- one from each eye. This confuses the brain. In children, the brain may learn to ignore (suppress) the image from the weaker eye.\nIf the strabismus is not treated, the eye that the brain ignores will never see well. This loss of vision is called\namblyopia\n. Another name for amblyopia is \"lazy eye.\" Sometimes lazy eye is present first, and it causes strabismus.\nIn most children with strabismus, the cause is unknown."}

In more than one half of these cases, the problem is present at or shortly after birth. This is called congenital strabismus.\nMost of the time, the problem has to do with muscle control, and not with muscle strength.\nOther disorders associated with strabismus in children include:\nApert syndrome\nCerebral palsy\nCongenital rubella\nHemangioma\nnear the eye during infancy\nIncontinentia pigmenti\nsyndrome\nNoonan syndrome\nPrader-Willi syndrome\nRetinopathy of prematurity\nRetinoblastoma\nTraumatic brain injury\nTrisomy 18\nStrabismus that develops in adults can be caused by:\nBotulism\nDiabetes (causes a condition known as acquired paralytic strabismus)\nGraves disease\nGuillain-BarrÃ© syndrome\nInjury to the eye\nShellfish poisoning\nStroke\nTraumatic brain injury\nVision loss from any eye disease or injury\nA family history of strabismus is a risk factor.\nFarsightedness\nmay be a contributing factor, often in children."}

Any other disease that causes vision loss may also cause strabismus.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of strabismus may be present all the time or may come and go. Symptoms can include:\nCrossed eyes\nDouble vision\nEyes that do not aim in the same direction\nUncoordinated eye movements (eyes do not move together)\nLoss of vision or depth perception\nIt is important to note that children may never be aware of double vision. This is because amblyopia can develop quickly.\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will do a\nphysical exam\n. This exam includes a detailed examination of the eyes.\nThe following tests will be done to determine how much the eyes are out of alignment.\nCorneal light reflex\nCover/uncover test\nRetinal exam\nStandard ophthalmic exam\nVisual acuity\nA brain and nervous system (neurological) exam will also be done.\nTreatment\nThe first step in treating strabismus in children is to prescribe glasses, if needed.\nNext, amblyopia or lazy eye must be treated. A patch is placed over the better eye."}

A patch is placed over the better eye. This forces the brain to use the weaker eye and it develops better vision.\nYour child may not like wearing a patch or eyeglasses. A patch forces your child to see through the weaker eye at first. However, it is very important to use the patch or eyeglasses as directed.\nEye muscle surgery may be needed if the eyes still do not move correctly. Different muscles in the eye will be made stronger or weaker. To strengthen a muscle, it is removed from the eye, shortened, then reattached. To weaken a muscle, it is removed from the eye and reattached further toward the back of the eye. Often in adults, an adjustable suture method is used so that the final adjustment of the position of the weakened muscle is made with the person awake and looking at a target. This has been shown to be more accurate.\nEye muscle repair surgery does not fix the poor vision of a lazy eye.\nMuscle surgery\nwill fail to improve vision if amblyopia has not been treated."}

A child may still have to wear glasses after surgery. Surgery is more often successful if done when the child is younger.\nAdults with mild strabismus that comes and goes may do well with glasses. Eye muscle exercises may help keep the eyes straight. More severe forms will require surgery to straighten the eyes. If strabismus has occurred because of vision loss, the vision loss will need to be corrected before strabismus surgery can be successful.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAfter surgery, the eyes may look straight, but vision problems can remain.\nThe child may still have reading problems in school. Adults may have a hard time driving. Impaired vision may affect the ability to play sports.\nIn most cases, the problem can be corrected if identified and treated early.

About one third of children with strabismus will develop amblyopia.\nMany children will get strabismus or amblyopia again after successful treatment.
