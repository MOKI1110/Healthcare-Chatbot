There is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test may be done to help determine the cause of a high uric acid level in the blood. It may also be done to monitor people with gout, and to choose the best medicine to lower the uric acid level in the blood.\nUric acid is a chemical created when the body breaks down substances called purines. Most uric acid dissolves in blood and travels to the kidneys, where it passes out in urine. If your body produces too much uric acid or does not remove enough of it, you may get sick. A high level of uric acid in the body is called hyperuricemia and it can lead to gout or kidney damage.\nThis test may also be done to check whether a high uric acid level in the urine is causing kidney stones.\nNormal Results\nNormal values range from 250 to 750 mg/24 hours (1.48 to 4.43 mmol/24 hours).\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}
