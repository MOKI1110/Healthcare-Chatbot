Before 8 months, infants are so new to the world that they lack a sense of what is normal and safe and what may be dangerous. As a result, new settings or people seem to not frighten them.\nFrom 8 to 14 months, children often become frightened when they meet new people or visit new places. They recognize their parents as familiar and safe. When separated from their parents, they feel threatened and unsafe.\nSeparation anxiety is a normal stage as a child grows and develops. It helped keep our ancestors alive and helps children learn how to master the world around them.\nIt usually ends when the child is around 2 years old."}

It helped keep our ancestors alive and helps children learn how to master the world around them.\nIt usually ends when the child is around 2 years old. At this age, toddlers begin to understand that parents may be out of sight now, but will return later. It's also normal for them to test their independence.\nTo get over separation anxiety, children need to:\nFeel safe in their home.\nTrust people other than their parents.\nTrust that their parents will return.\nEven after children have mastered this stage, separation anxiety may return in times of stress. Most children will feel some degree of separation anxiety when in unfamiliar situations, most often when separated from their parents.\nWhen children are in situations (such as hospitals) and are under stress (such as illness or pain), they seek the safety, comfort, and protection of their parents."}

When a parent can't go with the child, exposing the child to the situation beforehand may be helpful, such as visiting the provider's office before a test.\nSome hospitals have child life specialists who can explain procedures and medical conditions to children of all ages. If your child is very anxious and needs extended medical care, ask your provider about such services.\nWhen it's not possible for parents to be with the child, such as for surgery, explain the experience to the child."}
