Head lice may also be found in the eyebrows and eyelashes.\nLice spread by close contact with other people.\nCauses\nHead lice infect hair on the head. Tiny eggs on the hair may look like flakes of\ndandruff\n. However, instead of flaking off the scalp, they stay in place.\nHead lice can live up to 30 days on a human. Their eggs can live for more than 2 weeks.\nHead lice spread easily, particularly among school children ages 3 to 11 years. Head lice are more common in close, overcrowded living conditions.\nYou can get head lice if:\nYou come in close contact with a person who has lice.\nYou touch the clothing or bedding of someone who has lice.\nYou share hats, towels, brushes, or combs of someone who has lice.\nHaving head lice causes intense itching but does not lead to serious medical problems."}

Unlike body lice, head lice never carry or spread diseases.\nHaving head lice does not mean the person has poor hygiene or low social status.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of head lice include:\nVery bad itching of the scalp\nSmall, red bumps on the scalp, neck, and shoulders (bumps may become crusty and ooze)\nTiny white specks (eggs, or nits) on the bottom of each hair that are hard to get off\nExams and Tests\nHead lice can be hard to see. You need to look closely. Use disposable gloves and look at the person's head under a bright light. Full sun or the brightest lights in your home during daylight hours work well."}

A magnifying glass can help.\nTo look for head lice:\nPart the hair all the way down to the scalp in very small sections.\nExamine the scalp and hair for moving lice and eggs (nits).\nLook at the whole head in the same way.\nLook closely around the top of the neck and ears (the most common locations for eggs).\nBoth children and adults should be treated right away if any lice or eggs are found.\nTreatment\nLotions and shampoos containing 1% permethrin (Nix) often work well. You can buy these medicines at the store without a prescription. If these products do not work, a health care provider can give you a prescription for stronger medicine. Always use the medicines exactly as directed."}

Some dishwashing detergents can help dissolve the \"glue\" that makes the nits stick to the hair shaft.\nRemove the eggs with a nit comb. Before doing this, rub olive oil in the hair or run the metal comb through beeswax. This helps make the nits easier to remove.\nMetal combs with very fine teeth are stronger and work better than plastic nit combs."}

This also helps prevent head lice from spreading to others during the short period when head lice can survive off the human body.\nAsk your provider if people who share bedding or clothes with the person who has head lice need to be treated as well.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost of the time, lice are killed with the proper treatment. However, lice can come back if you do not get rid of them at the source.\nPossible Complications\nSome people will develop a skin infection from scratching."}
