The provider can feel growths and organs in the belly area and find where you feel pain.\nAbdominal tenderness can be mild to severe. Rebound tenderness means that there is more pain when pressure on the tender area is released. It occurs when the tissue that lines the abdominal cavity (the peritoneum) is irritated, inflamed, or infected. This is called\nperitonitis\n.\nCauses\nCauses include:\nAbdominal abscess\nAppendicitis\nCertain types of\nhernias\nMeckel diverticulum\nOvarian torsion (twisted fallopian tube)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nGet emergency medical help right away if you have abdominal point tenderness.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nYour provider will examine you and gently push on places on your belly."}

People with peritonitis will often tense the abdominal muscles when the area is touched. This is called guarding.\nThe provider will note any point of tenderness. The location of the tenderness can indicate the problem that is causing it. For example, if you have appendicitis, you will likely have tenderness when a certain place in the lower right abdomen is touched. This spot is called McBurney point.\nThe provider will also ask questions about your symptoms and medical history. These may include:\nWhen did the symptoms start?\nIs this the first time you have had such discomfort?\nIf not, when does the discomfort tend to occur?\nAre you having other symptoms, such as\nconstipation\n,\ndiarrhea\n, fainting,\nvomiting\n, or fever?\nYou may need to have the following tests:\nAbdominal x-ray\nAbdominal CT scan\n(occasionally)\nAbdominal ultrasound\nBlood tests, such as a\ncomplete blood count\nIn some cases, you may need surgery right away."}
