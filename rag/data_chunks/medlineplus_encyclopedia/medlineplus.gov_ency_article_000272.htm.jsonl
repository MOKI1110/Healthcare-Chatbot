It may also contain tissue from the pancreas, enzymes, and blood.\nCauses\nThe pancreas is an organ located behind the stomach. It produces chemicals (called enzymes) needed to digest food. It also produces the hormones insulin and glucagon.\nPancreatic pseudocysts most often develop after an episode of severe pancreatitis.\nPancreatitis\nhappens when your pancreas gets inflamed. There are many causes of this problem.\nThis problem may sometimes occur:\nIn someone with long-term (chronic)\nswelling of the pancreas\n(pancreatitis), most often due to alcohol abuse\nAfter trauma to the belly, more often in children\nThe pseudocyst happens when the ducts (tubes) in the pancreas are damaged and fluid with enzymes cannot drain.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms can occur within days to months after an attack of pancreatitis."}

They include:\nBloating of the abdomen\nConstant pain or deep ache in the abdomen, which may also be felt in the back\nNausea and vomiting\nLoss of appetite\nDifficulty eating and digesting food\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will feel your abdomen for a pseudocyst. It will feel like a lump in the middle or left upper abdomen.\nTests that may help detect pancreatic pseudocyst include:\nAbdominal CT scan\nAbdominal MRI\nAbdominal ultrasound\nEndoscopic ultrasound (EUS)\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the size of the pseudocyst and whether it is causing symptoms. Many pseudocysts go away on their own. Those that remain for more than 6 weeks and are larger than 5 centimeters (about 2 inches) in diameter may need treatment."}

Many pseudocysts go away on their own. Those that remain for more than 6 weeks and are larger than 5 centimeters (about 2 inches) in diameter may need treatment.  However, size and duration do not always mean treatment is needed, especially in a person without any symptoms and whose pseudocyst is not getting bigger.\nPossible treatments include:\nDrainage through the skin using a needle, most often guided by a CT scan.\nEndoscopic\n-assisted drainage using an endoscope. In this, a tube containing a camera and a light is passed down into the stomach).\nSurgical drainage of the pseudocyst. A connection is made between the cyst and the stomach or small intestine. This may be done using a laparoscope.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome is generally good with treatment. It is important to make sure that it is not a pancreatic cancer that starts in a cyst, which has a worse outcome.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\npancreatic abscess\ncan develop if the pseudocyst becomes infected.\nThe pseudocyst can break open (rupture)."}
