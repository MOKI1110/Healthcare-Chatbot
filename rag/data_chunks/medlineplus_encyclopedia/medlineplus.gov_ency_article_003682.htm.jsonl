Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBone marrow culture\nBone marrow culture\nBone marrow culture is an examination of the soft, fatty tissue found inside certain bones. The bone marrow tissue produces blood cells. This test is done to look for an infection inside the bone marrow. It is often done to diagnose prolonged fever that remains unexplained after other tests.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYour health care provider removes a sample of your bone marrow from the back of your pelvic bone or front of your breast bone. This is done with a small needle inserted into your bone. The procedure is called a\nbone marrow aspiration or a biopsy\n.\nThe tissue sample is sent to a lab. It is placed into a special container called a culture dish. The tissue sample is examined under a microscope each day to see if any bacteria, fungi, or viruses have grown.\nIf any bacteria, fungi, or viruses are found, other tests may be done to learn which medicines will kill the organisms."}

Treatment can then be adjusted based on these results.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nFollow any specific instructions from your provider on how to prepare for the test.\nTell the provider:\nIf you are allergic to any medicines\nWhat medicines you are taking\nIf you have bleeding problems\nIf you are pregnant\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will feel a sharp sting when numbing medicine is injected. The biopsy needle may also cause a brief, usually dull, pain. Since the inside of the bone cannot be numbed, this test may cause some discomfort.\nIf a bone marrow aspiration is also done, you may feel a brief, sharp pain as the bone marrow liquid is removed.\nSoreness at the site usually lasts from a few hours up to 2 days.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou may have this test if you have a prolonged unexplained fever or if your provider thinks you have an infection of the bone marrow. This is rare but can be associated with certain fungal infections, tuberculosis, or other bacterial infections."}

This is rare but can be associated with certain fungal infections, tuberculosis, or other bacterial infections. It is more common in people who may have compromised immune systems.\nNormal Results\nNo growth of bacteria, viruses, or fungi in the culture is normal.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results suggest that you have an infection of the bone marrow. The infection may be from bacteria, viruses, or fungi.\nRisks\nThere may be some bleeding at the puncture site. More serious risks, such as serious bleeding or infection, are very rare.\nAlternative Names\nCulture - bone marrow\nImages\nBone marrow aspiration\nReferences\nChoby BA.
