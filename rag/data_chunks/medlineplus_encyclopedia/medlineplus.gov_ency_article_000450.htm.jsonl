It may lead to long-term (chronic) arthritis.\nAdult Still disease is a severe version of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), which occurs in children. Adults can have the same condition, although it is much less common. It is also called adult-onset Still disease (AOSD).\nCauses\nFewer than 1 out of 100,000 people develop ASD each year. It affects women more often than men.\nThe cause of adult Still disease is unknown. No risk factors for the disease have been identified.\nSymptoms\nAlmost all people with the disease will have\nfever\n, joint pain, sore throat, and a rash.\nJoint pain, warmth, and swelling are common. Most often, several joints are involved at the same time."}

Most often, several joints are involved at the same time. Often, people with the condition have morning stiffness of joints that lasts for at least one hour.\nThe fever comes on quickly once per day, most commonly in the afternoon or evening.\nThe skin rash is often salmon-pink colored and comes and goes with the fever.\nAdditional symptoms include:\nAbdominal pain and swelling\nPain when taking a deep breath\n(pleurisy)\nSore throat\nSwollen lymph nodes\n(glands)\nWeight loss\nThe spleen or liver may become swollen. Lung and heart inflammation may also occur.\nExams and Tests\nAOSD can only be diagnosed after many other diseases (such as infections and cancer) are ruled out. You may need many medical tests before a final diagnosis is made.\nA physical exam may show a fever, rash, and arthritis."}

You may need many medical tests before a final diagnosis is made.\nA physical exam may show a fever, rash, and arthritis. The health care provider will use a stethoscope to listen for changes in the sound of your heart or lungs.\nThe following blood tests can be helpful in diagnosing adult Still disease:\nComplete blood count\n(CBC), may show a high number of white blood cells (granulocytes) and reduced number of red blood cells.\nC-reactive protein\n(CRP), a measure of inflammation, will be higher than normal.\nESR\n(sedimentation rate), a measure of inflammation, will be higher than normal.\nFerritin\nlevel will be very high.\nFibrinogen level will be high.\nLiver function tests\nwill show high levels of\nAST\nand\nALT\n.\nRheumatoid factor\nand\nANA\ntest will be negative.\nBlood cultures and viral studies will be negative.\nOther tests may be needed to check for inflammation of the joints, chest, liver, and spleen:\nAbdominal ultrasound\nCT scan of the abdomen\nX-rays of the joints,\nchest\n, or stomach area (abdomen)\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment for adult Still disease is to control the symptoms of\narthritis\n."}

Aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, are most often used first.\nPrednisone may be used for more severe cases.\nIf the disease is severe or persists for a long time (becomes chronic), medicines that suppress the immune system might be needed. Such medicines include:\nMethotrexate\nAnakinra (interleukin-1 receptor agonist)\nTocilizumab (interleukin 6 inhibitor)\nTumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists such as etanercept (Enbrel)\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn many people, symptoms may come back several times over the next few years.\nSymptoms continue for a long time (chronic) in about one third of people with adult Still disease.\nPossible Complications\nA potentially life threatening complication of the disease, called macrophage activation syndrome, can be very severe with high fevers, severe illness and low blood cell counts."}
