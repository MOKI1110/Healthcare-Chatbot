A person with PJS has a high risk for developing certain cancers.\nCauses\nIt is unknown how many people are affected by PJS. However, the National Institutes of Health estimates that it affects about 1 in 50,000 to 200,000 people.\nPJS is caused by a mutation in the gene called STK11 (previously known as LKB1). There are two ways that PJS can occur:\nFamilial PJS is inherited in families as an\nautosomal dominant\ntrait. That means if one of your parents has this type of PJS, you have a 50% chance of inheriting the gene and having the disease.\nSpontaneous PJS is not inherited from a parent. The gene mutation occurs on its own."}

The gene mutation occurs on its own. Once someone carries the genetic change, their children have a 50% chance of inheriting it.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of PJS are:\nBrownish or bluish-gray spots on the lips, gums, inner lining of the mouth, and skin\nClubbed fingers or toes\nCramping pain in the belly area\nDark freckles on and around the lips of a child\nBlood in the stool\nthat can be seen with the naked eye (sometimes)\nVomiting\nExams and Tests\nThe polyps develop mainly in the small intestine, but also in the large intestine (colon). An exam of the colon called a\ncolonoscopy\nwill show colon polyps. The small intestine is evaluated in two ways. One is a barium x-ray (small bowel series)."}
