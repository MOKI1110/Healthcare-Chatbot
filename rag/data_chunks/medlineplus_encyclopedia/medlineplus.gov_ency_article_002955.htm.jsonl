Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTracheostomy\nTracheostomy\nA tracheostomy is a surgical procedure to create an opening through the neck into the trachea (windpipe). A tube is most often placed through this opening to provide an airway and to remove secretions from the lungs. This tube is called a tracheostomy tube or trach tube.\nDescription\nGeneral anesthesia\nis used, unless the situation is critical. If that happens, a numbing medicine is placed into the area to help you feel less pain during the procedure. Other medicines are also given to relax and calm you (if there is time).\nThe neck is cleaned and draped. Surgical cuts are made to reveal the tough cartilage rings that form the outer wall of the trachea."}

This feeling will lessen over time. Medicines may be given to help reduce the person's stress.\nIf the tracheostomy is temporary (for example, if the condition leading to its placement can be improved or cured), the tube will eventually be removed. Healing usually occurs quickly, leaving a small scar. Sometimes, a surgical procedure may be needed to close the site (stoma).\nOccasionally a stricture, or narrowing of the trachea may develop, which may restrict breathing.\nIf the tracheostomy tube is permanent, the hole remains open.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people need 1 to 3 days to adapt to breathing through a tracheostomy tube."}

It will take some time to learn how to communicate with others. At first, it may be impossible for the person to talk or make sounds.\nAfter training and practice, most people can learn to talk with a tracheostomy tube, many times by using special speaking valves. People or family members learn how to take care of the tracheostomy during the hospital stay. Home-care service may also be available.\nYou should be able to go back to your normal lifestyle. When you are outside, you can wear a loose covering (a scarf or other protection) over the tracheostomy stoma (hole). Use safety precautions when you are exposed to water, aerosols, powder, or food particles.\nImages\nTracheostomy  - series\nReferences\nCameron J. Chest wall, mediastinum, and trachea.
