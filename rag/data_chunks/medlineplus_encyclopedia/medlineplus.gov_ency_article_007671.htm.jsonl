Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHepatitis B - children\nHepatitis B - children\nHepatitis B in children is swelling and inflamed tissue of the liver due to infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV).\nOther common hepatitis virus infections include\nhepatitis A\nand\nhepatitis C\n.\nCauses\nHBV is found in the blood or body fluids (semen, tears, or saliva) of an infected person. The virus is not present in the stool (feces).\nA child can get HBV through contact with the blood or body fluids of a person who has the virus. Exposure can occur from:\nA mother with HBV at the time of birth. It does not appear that HBV is passed to the fetus while still in the mother's womb.\nA bite from an infected person that breaks the skin.\nBlood, saliva, or any other body fluid from an infected person that may touch a break or opening in a child's skin, eyes, or mouth.\nSharing personal items, such as a toothbrush, with someone who has the virus.\nBeing stuck with a needle after use by an HBV-infected person.\nA child cannot get hepatitis B from hugging, kissing, coughing, or sneezing."}

Breastfeeding by a mother with hepatitis B is safe if the child is treated properly at the time of birth.\nPeople who are not vaccinated can get HBV during unprotected sex or drug use.\nSymptoms\nMost children with hepatitis B have none or only a few symptoms. Children younger than 5 years rarely have symptoms of hepatitis B. Older children may develop symptoms 3 to 4 months after the virus enters the body. The main symptoms of a new or recent infection are:\nAppetite loss\nFatigue\nLow fever\nMuscle and joint pain\nNausea and vomiting\nYellow skin and eyes (\njaundice\n)\nDark urine\nIf the body is able to fight HBV, the symptoms end in a few weeks to 6 months. This is called acute hepatitis B. Acute hepatitis B does not cause any lasting problems.\nExams and Tests\nYour child's health care provider will perform blood tests called the\nhepatitis viral panel\n."}

This test shows how well your child's treatment for chronic hepatitis B is working.\nTreatment\nAcute hepatitis B does not need any special treatment. Your child's immune system will fight the disease. If there is no sign of the HBV infection after 6 months, then your child has recovered fully. However, while the virus is present, your child can pass the virus to others. You should take steps to help prevent the disease from spreading.\nChronic hepatitis B needs treatment."}

The goal of treatment is to relieve any symptoms, prevent the disease from spreading, and help prevent liver disease. Make sure that your child:\nGets plenty of rest\nDrinks lots of fluids\nEats healthy foods\nYour child's provider also may recommend antiviral medicines. The medicines decrease or remove HBV from the blood:\nInterferon alpha-2b (Intron A) can be given to children age 1 year and older.\nLamivudine (Epivir) and entecavir (Baraclude) are used in children age 2 years and older.\nTenofovir (Viread) is given to children age 12 years and older.\nIt is not always clear what medicines should be given. Children with chronic hepatitis B may get these medicines when:\nLiver function quickly gets worse\nThe liver shows signs of long-term damage\nHBV level is high in the blood\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMany children are able to rid their body of the HBV and do not have a long-term infection.\nHowever, some children never get rid of HBV."}
