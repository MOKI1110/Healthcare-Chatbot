The tissue is called the synovial membrane.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test can be done in the operating room or in your health care provider's office. There are multiple techniques used for synovial biopsy including surgery, arthroscopy or ultrasound guided needle biopsy.\nDuring this procedure:\nDepending on the type of procedure, you may receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n,\nregional anesthesia\nor local anesthesia. With general anesthesia, you'll be pain free and asleep during the procedure. With regional anesthesia, you'll be awake, but the part of the body with the involved joint will be numb."}

With general anesthesia, you'll be pain free and asleep during the procedure. With regional anesthesia, you'll be awake, but the part of the body with the involved joint will be numb. With local anesthesia, only the joint is numbed and you will be awake during the procedure.\nIf you are having an arthroscopic procedure:\nYour surgeon makes a tiny cut in the skin near the joint.\nAn instrument called a trocar is inserted through the cut into the joint.\nA tiny camera with a light is used to look inside the joint.\nA tool called a biopsy grasper is then inserted through the trocar. The grasper is used to cut a small piece of tissue.\nYour surgeon removes the grasper along with the tissue. The trocar and any other instruments are removed. The skin cut is closed and a bandage is applied.\nThe sample will be sent to the lab for evaluation.\nIf you are having a needle biopsy:\nYour surgeon (radiologist, orthopedist or rheumatologist) will identify the site using ultrasound.\nThe site of the biopsy will be cleaned and numbed.\nA needle sized trochar is inserted into the joint.\nA tool called a biopsy needle will be inserted through the trochar."}

Multiple samples may be taken based on the clinical case. The biopsy needle will be removed from the joint and the tissue will be sent to the lab for examination.\nThe trochar will be removed.\nA small bandage will be applied and stitches are not needed.\nYour surgeon will determine which method is best given your clinical case.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nFollow your provider's instructions on how to prepare. This may include not eating and drinking anything for several hours before the procedure.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWith the local anesthetic, you will feel a prick and a burning sensation. As the trocar is inserted, there will be some discomfort."}

It can be used to diagnose autoimmune disorders such as\nrheumatoid arthritis\n, or uncommon infections like tuberculosis or fungal infections.\nNormal Results\nThe synovial membrane structure is normal.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nSynovial biopsy may identify the following conditions:\nLong-term (chronic) synovitis (inflammation of the synovial membrane)\nCoccidioidomycosis\n(a fungal infection)\nFungal arthritis\nGout\nPseudogout\nHemochromatosis\n(abnormal buildup of iron deposits)\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\n(autoimmune disease that affects the skin, joints, and other organs)\nSarcoidosis\nTuberculosis\nSynovial cancer (very rare type of soft tissue cancer)\nRheumatoid arthritis\nRisks\nThere is a very slight chance of infection and bleeding.\nConsiderations\nFollow instructions for keep"}
