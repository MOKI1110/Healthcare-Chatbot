Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV)\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV)\nRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a very common virus that leads to mild, cold-like symptoms in adults and older healthy children. It can be more serious in young babies and older adults, especially those in certain high-risk groups.\nCauses\nRSV is the most common germ that causes lung and airway infections in infants and young children. Most infants have had this infection by age 2. Outbreaks of RSV infections most often begin in the fall and run into the spring.\nThe infection can occur in people of all ages."}

Most infants have had this infection by age 2. Outbreaks of RSV infections most often begin in the fall and run into the spring.\nThe infection can occur in people of all ages. The virus spreads through tiny droplets that go into the air when a sick person blows their nose, coughs, or sneezes.\nYou can catch RSV if:\nA person with RSV sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose near you.\nYou touch, kiss, or shake hands with someone who is infected by the virus.\nYou touch your nose, eyes, or mouth after you have touched something contaminated by the virus, such as a toy or doorknob.\nRSV often spreads quickly in crowded households and day care centers. The virus can also live for many hours on hard surfaces such as countertops and doorknobs. It can live on soft surfaces such as tissues and hands for shorter amounts of time.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms appear in 4 to 6 days after infection with the virus."}

To help relieve symptoms:\nTake acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) help lower fever and relieve muscle aches. (Never give aspirin to children.)\nDrink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated.\nAlways talk with your child's provider before giving over-the-counter medicines to children.\nAntibiotics and bronchodilators are NOT used to treat RSV. Antibiotics kill bacteria. They won't work on the virus that causes RSV.\nInfants, children, and adults with a severe RSV infection may be admitted to the hospital."}
