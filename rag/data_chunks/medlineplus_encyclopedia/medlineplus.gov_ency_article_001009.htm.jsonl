A stye is an inflamed oil gland on the edge of your eyelid, where the eyelash meets the lid. It appears as a red, swollen bump that looks like a pimple. It is often tender to the touch.\nCauses\nA stye is caused by a blockage of one of the oil glands in the eyelids. This allows bacteria to grow inside the blocked gland. Styes are a lot like common acne pimples that occur elsewhere on the skin. You may have more than one stye at the same time.\nStyes most often develop over a few days. They may drain and heal on their own. A stye can become a\nchalazion\n, which occurs when an inflamed oil gland becomes fully blocked. If a chalazion gets large enough, it can cause trouble with your vision.\nStyes can be made worse by the presence of Demodex, a mite commonly found on human skin. Demodex has been identified as a cause of blepharitis. If you have\nblepharitis\n, you are more likely to get styes.\nOther possible common eyelid bumps include:\nXanthelasma\n: Raised yellow patches on your eyelids that can happen with age."}

These are harmless, although they are sometimes a sign of high cholesterol.\nPapillomas: Pink or skin-colored bumps. They are harmless, but can slowly grow, affect your vision, or bother you for cosmetic reasons. If so, they can be surgically removed.\nCysts: Small fluid-filled sacs that can affect your vision.\nSymptoms\nIn addition to the red, swollen bump, other possible symptoms of a stye include:\nA gritty, scratchy sensation, as if there is a foreign body in your eye\nSensitivity\nto light\nTearing of your eye\nTenderness of the eyelid\nExams and Tests\nIn most cases, your health care provider can diagnose a stye just by looking at it. Tests are rarely needed.\nTreatment\nTo treat eyelid bumps at home:\nApply a warm, wet cloth to the area for 10 minutes. Do this  4 times a day.\nDo NOT attempt to squeeze a stye or any other type of eyelid bump."}

However, they may return. If bleparitis is present, treating it may help prevent a recurrence of the stye.\nThe outcome is almost always excellent with simple treatment.\nSometimes, the infection may spread to the rest of the eyelid. This is called eyelid cellulitis and may require oral antibiotics."}

If you are prone to getting styes or have blepharitis, it may help to carefully clean off excess oils from the edges of your lids. To do this, use a solution of warm water and no-tears baby shampoo.\nFish oil taken by mouth may help prevent plugging of the oil glands."}
