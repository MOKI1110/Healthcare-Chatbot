Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nPulmonary alveolar proteinosis\nPulmonary alveolar proteinosis\nPulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) is a rare disease in which a type of protein builds up in the air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs, making breathing difficult. Pulmonary means related to the lungs.\nCauses\nIn some cases, the cause of PAP is unknown. In others, it occurs with lung infection or an immune problem. It also can occur with cancers of the blood system, and after exposure to high levels of environmental substances, such as silica or aluminum dust.\nPeople between 30 and 50 years old are most often affected. PAP is seen in men more often than in women. A form of the disorder is present at birth (congenital).\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of PAP may include any of the following:\nShortness of breath\nCough\nFatigue\nFever, if there is lung infection\nBluish skin (\ncyanosis\n) in severe cases\nWeight loss\nSometimes, there are no symptoms.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will listen to the lungs with a stethoscope and may hear crackles (rales) in the lungs."}

Often, the physical examination is normal.\nThe following tests may be done:\nBronchoscopy\nwith saline wash of the lungs (lavage)\nChest x-ray\nCT scan of the chest\nLung function tests\nOpen lung biopsy\n(surgical biopsy)\nTreatment\nTreatment involves washing out the protein substance from the lung (whole-lung lavage) from time to time. Some people may need a lung transplant. Avoiding dusts that might have caused the condition is also recommended.\nAnother treatment that may be tried is a blood-stimulating drug called granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), which is lacking in some people with alveolar proteinosis.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and their families can be found at:\nNational Organization for Rare Disorders --\nrarediseases.org/rare-diseases/pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis\nPAP Foundation --\nwww.papfoundation.org/\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSome people with PAP go into remission."}

Others have a decline in lung function (\nrespiratory failure\n) that gets worse, and they may need a lung transplant.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall your provider if you develop serious breathing symptoms. Shortness of breath that gets worse over time may signal that your condition is developing into a medical emergency.\nAlternative Names\nPAP; Alveolar proteinosis; Pulmonary alveolar phospholipoproteinosis; Alveolar lipoproteinosis phospholipidosis\nPatient Instructions\nInterstitial lung disease - adults - discharge\nImages\nRespiratory system\nReferences\nLevine SM.
