Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBarium enema\nBarium enema\nA barium enema is a special\nx-ray\nof the large intestine, which includes the colon and rectum.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis test may be done in your health care provider's office or hospital radiology department. It is done after your colon is completely empty and clean. Your provider will give you instructions for cleansing your colon.\nDuring the test:\nYou lie flat on your back on the x-ray table. An x-ray is taken.\nYou then lie on your side. The x-ray technologist or radiologist gently inserts a well-lubricated tube (enema tube) into your rectum. The tube is connected to a bag that holds a liquid containing barium sulfate. This is a contrast material that highlights specific areas in the colon, creating a clear image.\nThe barium flows into your colon. X-rays are taken. A small balloon at the tip of the enema tube may be inflated to help keep the barium inside your colon."}

X-rays are taken. A small balloon at the tip of the enema tube may be inflated to help keep the barium inside your colon. The  x-ray technologist or radiologist monitors the flow of the barium on an x-ray screen.\nSometimes a small amount of air is delivered into the colon to expand it. This allows for even clearer images. This test is called a double contrast barium enema.\nYou are asked to move into different positions. The table will move up and down to get different views. At certain times when the x-ray pictures are taken, you are told to hold your breath and be still for a few seconds so the images will not be blurry.\nThe enema tube is removed after the x-rays are taken.\nYou are then given a bedpan or helped to the toilet, so you can empty your bowels and remove as much of the barium as possible. Afterward, 1 or 2 more x-rays may be taken.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour bowels need to be completely empty for the exam. If they are not empty, the test may miss a problem in your large intestine.\nYou will be given instructions for cleansing your bowel using an enema or laxatives."}

This is also called bowel preparation. Follow the instructions exactly.\nFor 1 to 3 days before the test, you need to be on a clear liquid diet. Examples of clear liquids are:\nClear coffee or tea\nFat-free bouillon or broth\nGelatin\nSports drinks\nStrained fruit juices\nWater\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen barium enters your colon, you may feel like you need to have a bowel movement. You may also have:\nA feeling of fullness\nModerate to severe cramping\nGeneral discomfort\nTaking long, deep breaths may help you relax during the procedure.\nIt is normal for your stools to be white for a few days after this test. Drink extra fluids for 2 to 4 days."}

Occasionally gastrografin enemas in patients that have had prior surgery are done which are similar to barium enemas.\nNormal Results\nBarium should fill the colon evenly, showing normal bowel shape and position and no blockages.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal test results may be a sign of:\nBlockage of the large intestine\nNarrowing of the colon above the rectum (\nHirschsprung disease\nin infants)\nCrohn disease or ulcerative colitis\nCancer in the colon or rectum\nSliding of one part of the intestine into another (\nintussusception\n)\nSmall growths that stick out of the lining of the colon, calle"}
