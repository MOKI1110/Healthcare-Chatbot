Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCysticercosis\nCysticercosis\nCysticercosis is an infection by a parasite called\nTaenia solium\n(\nT solium\n). It is a pork tapeworm that creates\ncysts\nin different areas of the body.\nCauses\nCysticercosis is caused by swallowing eggs from\nT solium\n. The eggs are found in contaminated food. Autoinfection is when a person who is already infected with adult\nT solium\nswallows its eggs. This occurs due to\nimproper hand washing\nafter a bowel movement (fecal-oral transmission).\nRisk factors include eating pork, fruits, and vegetables contaminated with\nT solium\nas a result of undercooking or\nimproper food preparation\n. The disease can also be spread by contact with infected feces.\nThe disease is rare in the United States."}

These are rare complications.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nBlindness, decreased vision\nHeart failure or abnormal heart rhythm\nHydrocephalus\n(fluid buildup in part of the brain, often with increased pressure)\nSeizures\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIf you have any symptoms of cysticercosis, contact your health care provider.\nPrevention\nAvoid unwashed foods, do not eat uncooked foods while traveling, and always wash fruits and vegetables well.\nImages\nDigestive system organs\nReferences\nWhite AC, Brunetti E.
