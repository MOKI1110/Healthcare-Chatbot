Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nClubfoot repair\nClubfoot repair\nClubfoot\nrepair is surgery to correct a birth defect of the foot and ankle.\nDescription\nThe type of surgery that is done depends on:\nHow serious the clubfoot is\nYour child's age\nWhat other treatments your child has had\nYour child will have general anesthesia (asleep and pain-free) during the surgery.\nLigaments are tissues that help hold the bones together in the body. Tendons are tissues that help attach muscles to bones. A clubfoot occurs when tight tendons and ligaments prevent the foot from stretching into the right position.\nTo repair a clubfoot, 1 or 2 cuts are made in the skin, most often on the back of the foot and around the inside part of the foot.\nYour child's surgeon may make the tendons around the foot longer or shorter. The Achilles tendon at the back of the foot is almost always cut or lengthened.\nOlder children or more severe cases may need some bone cuts. Sometimes, pins, screws or plates are placed in the bones of the foot.\nA cast is placed on the foot after surgery to keep it in position while it heals."}

Sometimes, pins, screws or plates are placed in the bones of the foot.\nA cast is placed on the foot after surgery to keep it in position while it heals. Sometimes a splint is put on first, and the cast is placed a few days later.\nOlder children who still have a foot deformity after surgery may need more surgery. Also, children who have not had surgery yet may need surgery as they grow. Types of surgery they may need include:\nOsteotomy\n: Removing part of the bone.\nFusion or arthrodesis\n: Two or more bones are fused together. The surgeon may use bone from somewhere else in the body.\nMetal pins, screws or plates may be used to hold the bones together for a while.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nA baby who is born with a clubfoot is first treated with a cast to stretch the foot into a more normal position.\nA new cast will be placed every week so the foot can be stretched into position.\nCast changes continue for about 2 months."}

These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\nAsk your child's surgeon which medicines they should still take on the day of surgery.\nOn the day of the surgery:\nFollow instructions about when your child should stop eating and drinking.\nGive your child the medicines their surgeon told you to give them with a small sip of water.\nArrive at the hospital on time.\nAfter the Procedure\nDepending on the surgery that is done, your child may go home on the same day or stay in the hospital for 1 to 3 days right after the surgery."}

The hospital stay may be longer if surgery was also done on the bones.\nYour child's foot should be kept in a raised position. Medicines may be prescribed to help control the pain.\nThe skin around your child's cast will be checked often to make sure it stays pink and healthy. Your child's toes also will be checked to make sure they are pink and your child can move and feel them. These are signs of proper blood flow.\nYour child will have a cast on for 6 to 12 weeks. It may be changed several times. Before your child leaves the hospital, you will be taught how to take care of the cast.\nWhen the last cast is taken off, your child will probably be prescribed a brace, and may be referred for physical therapy. The therapist will teach you exercises to do with your child to strengthen the foot and make sure it stays flexible.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAfter recovering from surgery, your child's foot will be in a much better position."}
