Congenital means the condition is present at birth.\nCauses\nCongenital rubella occurs when the rubella virus in the mother affects the developing baby in the first 3 months of pregnancy. After the fourth month, if the mother has a rubella infection, it is less likely to harm the developing baby.\nThe number of babies born with this condition is much smaller since the rubella vaccine was developed.\nPregnant women and their unborn babies are at risk if:\nThey are not vaccinated for rubella\nThey have not had the disease in the past\nSymptoms\nSymptoms in the infant may include:\nCloudy corneas or white appearance of pupil\nDeafness\nDevelopmental delay\nExcessive sleepiness\nIrritability\nLow birth weight\nBelow average mental functioning (intellectual disability)\nSeizures\nSmall head size\nSkin rash at birth\nExams and Tests\nThe baby's health care provider will order blood and urine tests to check for the virus"}
