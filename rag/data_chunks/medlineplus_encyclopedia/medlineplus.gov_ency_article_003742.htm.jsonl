This may be done in a health care provider's office using a needle, or much less often, during an operating room procedure. Removing the sample is called\njoint fluid aspiration\n.\nThe fluid sample is sent to a lab. There, it is placed in a special dish and watched to see if bacteria or fungi grow. This is called a culture.\nIf these germs are detected, other tests may be done to further identify the infection-causing substance and its sensitivities or resistance to different antibiotics and determine the best treatment.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider will tell you how to prepare for the procedure. No special preparation is needed. But, tell your provider if you're taking a blood thinner, such as aspirin, warfarin (Coumadin) or clopidogrel (Plavix)."}

These medicines can affect test results or your ability to take the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nAfter cleansing your skin thoroughly, usually, your provider will first inject numbing medicine into the skin with a small needle, which will sting. A larger needle is then used to draw out the synovial fluid.\nThis test may also cause some discomfort if the tip of the needle touches bone. The procedure usually lasts less than 1 to 2 minutes.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order this test if you have unexplained pain and inflammation of a joint or a suspected joint infection.\nNormal Results\nThe test result is considered normal if no organisms (bacteria or fungi) grow in the lab dish.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results are a sign of infection in the joint."}
