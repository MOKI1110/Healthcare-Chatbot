Hives can develop when these skin areas are rubbed.\nCauses\nUrticaria pigmentosa occurs when there are too many inflammatory cells (mast cells) in the skin. Mast cells are immune system cells that help the body fight infections. Mast cells make and release histamine, which causes nearby tissues to become swollen and inflamed.\nThings that can trigger histamine release and skin symptoms include:\nRubbing the skin\nInfections\nExercise\nDrinking hot liquids, eating spicy food\nTemperature changes, such as heat or cold\nStress\nor anxiety\nMedicines, such as aspirin or other NSAIDs, codeine, morphine, x-ray dye, some anesthesia medicines, and alcohol\nUrticaria pigmentosa is most common in children. It can also occur in adults.\nSymptoms\nThe main symptom is brownish patches on the skin. These patches contain cells called mastocytes. When mastocytes release the chemical histamine, the patches develop into hive-like bumps."}

Younger children may develop a\nblister\nthat is filled with fluid if the bump is scratched.\nThe face may also get red quickly.\nIn severe cases, these symptoms may occur:\nDiarrhea\nFainting\n(uncommon)\nHeadache\nWheezing\nRapid heartbeat\nAbdominal pain\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will examine the skin.

The provider may suspect urticarial pigmentosa when the skin patches are rubbed and raised bumps (hives) develop. This is called the Darier sign.\nTests to check for this condition are:\nSkin biopsy\nto look for a higher number of mast cells\nImaging or lab tests if symptoms other than rash are present\nBlood tests for blood cell counts and blood tryptase levels (tryptase is an enzyme found in mast cells)\nBone marrow biopsy may be recommended in adults\nTreatment\nAvoid histamine release triggers.Triggers include insect bites and stings, exposure to temperature extremes, certain medicines, and rubbing the skin lesions.\nAntihistamine medicines can help relieve symptoms such as itching and flushing. Talk to your provider about which type of antihistamine to use. Corticosteroids applied on the skin and light therapy can also be used in some cases.\nYour provider may prescribe other kinds of medicine to treat symptoms of severe and unusual forms of urticaria pigmentosa.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nUrticaria pigmentosa goes away by puberty in about one half of affected children."}

Symptoms usually get better in others as they grow into adulthood.\nIn adults, urticaria pigmentosa can lead to systemic mastocytosis. This is a serious condition that can affect bones, the brain, nerves, and the digestive system.\nPossible Complications\nThe main problems are discomfort from itching and concern about the appearance of the spots. Other problems such as diarrhea and fainting are rare.\nInsect stings\nmay also cause a bad allergic reaction in people with urticaria pigmentosa. Ask your provider if you should carry an epinephrine kit to use if you get a bee sting.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you notice symptoms of urticaria pigmentosa.\nAlternative Names\nMastocytosis; Maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis; Diffuse cutaneous mastocystosis\nImages\nUrticaria pigmentosa in the armpit\nMastocytosis - diffuse cutaneous\nUrticaria pigmentosa on the chest\nUrticaria pigmentosa - close-up\nReferences\nAkin C.
