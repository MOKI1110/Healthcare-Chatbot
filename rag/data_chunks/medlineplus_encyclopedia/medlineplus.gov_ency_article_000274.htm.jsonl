Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCholedocholithiasis\nCholedocholithiasis\nCholedocholithiasis is the presence of at least one gallstone in the common bile duct. The stone may be made up of\nbile\npigments or calcium and cholesterol salts.\nCauses\nAbout 1 in 7 people with gallstones will develop stones in the common bile duct. This is the small tube that carries bile from the gallbladder to the intestine.\nRisk factors include a history of\ngallstones\n. However, choledocholithiasis can occur in people who have had their gallbladder removed.\nSymptoms\nOften, there are no symptoms unless the stone blocks the common bile duct. Symptoms may include:\nPain in the right upper or middle upper abdomen for at least 30 minutes. The pain may be constant and intense."}
