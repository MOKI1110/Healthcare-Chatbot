It most often affects only one eye. It occurs with\nswollen lymph nodes\nand an illness with a fever.\nNote\n: Parinaud syndrome (also called upgaze paresis) is a different disorder in which you have trouble looking upward. The latter can be caused by a brain tumor, and requires an evaluation by your health care provider very promptly.\nCauses\nParinaud oculoglandular syndrome (POS) is caused by an infection with bacteria, a virus, fungus, or parasite.\nThe most common causes are\ncat scratch disease\nand\ntularemia\n(rabbit fever). The bacteria that cause either condition can infect the eye."}

The bacteria can directly enter the eye (on a finger or other object), or air droplets that carry the bacteria can land on the eye.\nOther infectious diseases may spread the same way, or through the bloodstream to the eye.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nRed, irritated, and painful eye (looks like \"pink eye\")\nFever\nGeneral ill feeling\nIncreased tearing (possible)\nSwelling of nearby lymph glands (often in front of the ear)\nExams and Tests\nAn exam shows:\nFever and other signs of illness\nRed, tender, inflamed eye\nTender lymph nodes may be present in front of the ear\nThere may be growths (conjunctival nodules) on the inside of the eyelid or the white of the eye\nBlood tests will be done to check for infection. The\nwhite blood cell\ncount may be high or low, depending on the cause of the infection.\nA blood test to check antibody levels is the main method used to diagnose many of the infections that cause POS."}

Surgery may be needed in rare cases to clean away the infected tissues.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook depends on the cause of the infection. In general, if the diagnosis is made early and treatment starts right away, the outcome of POS can be very good.\nPossible Complications\nSerious complications are rare.\nThe conjunctival nodules can sometimes form sores (ulcers) during the healing process. The infection can spread to nearby tissues or into the bloodstream.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you develop a red, irritated, painful eye.\nPrevention\nFrequent hand washing can reduce the likelihood of getting POS.
