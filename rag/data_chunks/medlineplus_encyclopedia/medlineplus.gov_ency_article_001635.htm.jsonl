Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nGlomus tympanum tumor\nGlomus tympanum tumor\nA glomus tympanum tumor is a tumor of the middle ear and bone behind the ear (mastoid).\nCauses\nA glomus tympanum tumor grows in the temporal bone of the skull, behind the eardrum (tympanic membrane).\nThis area contains nerve fibers (glomus bodies) that normally respond to changes in body temperature or blood pressure.\nThese tumors most often occur late in life, around age 60 or 70, but they can appear at any age.\nThe cause of a glomus tympanum tumor is unknown. In most cases, there are no known risk factors. Glomus tumors have been associated with changes (mutations) in a gene responsible for the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDHD).\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nHearing problems or loss\nRinging or heart beat sounds in the ear (pulsatile\ntinnitus\n)\nWeakness or loss of movement in the face (facial nerve palsy)\nExams and Tests\nGlomus tympanum tumors are diagnosed by a physical exam."}

They may be seen in the ear or behind the eardrum.\nDiagnosis also involves scans, including:\nCT scan\nMRI scan\nTreatment\nGlomus tympanum tumors are rarely cancerous and do not tend to spread to other parts of the body. However, treatment may be needed to relieve symptoms.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPeople who have surgery usually do well. More than 90% of people with glomus tympanum tumors are cured.\nPossible Complications\nThe most common complication is hearing loss.\nNerve damage, which may be caused by the tumor itself or damage during surgery, rarely occurs. Nerve damage can lead to\nfacial paralysis\n.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you notice:\nDifficulty with hearing or swallowing\nProblems with the muscles in your face\nPulsing sensation in your ear\nAlternative Names\nParaganglioma - glomus tympanum\nReferences\nGubbels SP, Hartl RB, Crowson MG, Jenkns HA, Marsh M.
