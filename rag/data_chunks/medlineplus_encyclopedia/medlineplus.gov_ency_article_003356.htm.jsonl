Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nC-reactive protein\nC-reactive protein\nC-reactive protein (CRP) is produced by the liver. The level of CRP rises when there is inflammation in the body. It is one of a group of proteins, called acute phase reactants that go up in response to inflammation. The levels of acute phase reactants increase in response to certain inflammatory proteins called cytokines. These proteins are produced by white blood cells during inflammation.\nThis article discusses the blood test done to measure the amount of CRP in your blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. This is most often taken from a vein. The procedure is called a\nvenipuncture\n.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special steps are needed to prepare for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others may feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe CRP test is a general test to check for inflammation in the body. It is not a specific test."}

Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe CRP test is a general test to check for inflammation in the body. It is not a specific test. This means it can reveal that you have inflammation somewhere in your body, but it cannot pinpoint the exact location or reason. The CRP test is often done with the\nESR\n(erythrocyte or sedimentation rate) test which also looks for inflammation.\nYou may have this test to:\nCheck for flare-ups of inflammatory diseases such as\nrheumatoid arthritis\n,\nlupus\n, or vasculitis.\nDetermine if an anti-inflammatory medicine is working to treat a disease or condition.\nA more sensitive CRP test, called a high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) assay, is available to determine a person's risk for heart disease.\nNormal Results\nNormal CRP values vary from lab to lab. The levels often increase slightly with age, female sex and in African Americans. The majority of healthy adults have levels less than 0.3 mg/dL.\nHowever, a low CRP level does not always mean that there is no inflammation present. Levels of CRP may not be increased in people with rheumatoid arthritis and lupus."}

Levels of CRP may not be increased in people with rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. The reason for this is unknown.\nNote: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nThe examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests. Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIt is unclear if a minor rise of 0.3 to 1 mg/dL in CRP levels is a cause for concern. The hs-CRP is more precise and may be used to further understand these results.\nCRP levels from 1 mg/dL to 10 mg/dL are thought to be a moderate increase.\nCRP Levels greater than 10 mg/dL are considered a marked increase.\nA positive test means you have inflammation in the body. The cause of a high CRP cannot always be determined."}
