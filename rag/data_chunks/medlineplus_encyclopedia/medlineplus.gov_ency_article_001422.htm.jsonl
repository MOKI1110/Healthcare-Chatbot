If this fluid becomes infected, the condition is called a subdural empyema.\nCauses\nA subdural effusion is a rare complication of\nmeningitis\ncaused by bacteria. Subdural effusion is more common in infants.\nIt may also occur after head trauma.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nOutward curving of a baby's skull's soft spot (\nbulging fontanelle\n)\nAbnormally wide spaces in the bony joints of a baby's skull (\nseparated sutures\n)\nIncreased head circumference\nLow energy (\nlethargy\n)\nPersistent fever\nSeizures\nVomiting\nWeakness or loss of movement on both sides of the body\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms.\nTo detect the subdural effusion, tests that may be done include:\nCT scan of the head\nHead size (circumference) measurements\nMRI scan of the head\nUltrasound\nof the head\nTreatment\nSurgery to drain the effusion is o"}

The fluid is usually tested. In rare cases, a permanent drainage device (shunt) is needed to drain fluid. Antibiotics may need to be given through a vein.\nTreatment may include:\nSurgery to drain the effusion\nDrainage device, called a shunt, left in place for a short time or longer time\nAntibiotics given through a vein to treat an infection\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nFull recovery from a subdural effusion is expected. If nervous system problems continue, they are generally due to the meningitis, not the effusion. Long-term antibiotics are usually not needed.\nPossible Complications\nComplications of surgery may include:\nBleeding\nBrain damage\nInfection\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if:\nYour child has recently been treated for meningitis and symptoms continue\nNew symptoms develop\nReferences\nDe Vries LS, Volpe JJ.
