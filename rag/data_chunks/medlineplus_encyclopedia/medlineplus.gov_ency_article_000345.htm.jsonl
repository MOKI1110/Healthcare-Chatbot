Adults can sometimes be affected. Boys and girls are equally likely to develop this tumor.\nSymptoms\nCraniopharyngioma causes symptoms by:\nIncreasing pressure on the brain, usually from\nhydrocephalus\nDisrupting hormone production by the hypothalamus or pituitary gland\nPressure or\ndamage to the optic nerve\nIncreased pressure on the brain can cause:\nHeadache\nNausea\nVomiting (especially in the morning)\nChange in appetite and weight\nConfusion and drowsiness\nDamage to the pituitary gland causes hormone imbalances that can lead to excessive thirst and urination, and slow growth.\nWhen the optic nerve is damaged by the tumor, vision problems develop. These defects are often permanent."}

These defects are often permanent. They may get worse after surgery to remove the tumor.\nBehavioral and learning problems may be present.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. Tests will be done to check for a tumor. These may include:\nBlood tests to measure hormone levels\nCT scan\nor\nMRI\nscan of the brain\nExamination of the nervous system\nTesting your vision\nTreatment\nThe goal of the treatment is to relieve symptoms. Usually, surgery has been the main treatment for craniopharyngioma. However, radiation treatment instead of surgery or along with a smaller surgery may be the best choice for some people.\nIn tumors that cannot be removed completely with surgery alone,\nradiation therapy\nis used. If the tumor has a classic appearance on CT scan, a biopsy may not be needed if treatment with radiation alone is planned."}

If the tumor has a classic appearance on CT scan, a biopsy may not be needed if treatment with radiation alone is planned. In some people, a shunt may be placed to treat the hydrocephalus.\nStereotactic radiosurgery\nis performed at some medical centers.\nThis tumor is best treated at a center with experience in treating craniopharyngiomas.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIn general, the outlook is good. There is an 80% to 90% chance of a cure if the tumor can be completely removed with surgery or treated with high doses of radiation. If the tumor returns, it will most often come back within the first 2 years after surgery.\nThe outlook depends on several factors, including:\nWhether the tumor can be completely removed\nWhich nervous system problems and hormonal imbalances the tumor and treatment cause\nMost of the problems with hormones and vision do not improve with treatment."}
