It results in reddish brown areas of the skin, most commonly on the lower legs.\nCauses\nThe cause of necrobiosis lipoidica diabeticorum (NLD) is unknown. It is thought to be linked to blood vessel inflammation related to\nautoimmune factors\n. This damages proteins in the skin (collagen).\nPeople with type 1 diabetes are more likely to get NLD than those with type 2 diabetes. Women are more affected than men. Smoking increases the risk for NLD. Less than one half of one percent of those with diabetes suffer from this problem.\nSymptoms\nA skin lesion is an area of skin that is different from the skin around it. With NLD, skin lesions start as firm, smooth, red bumps (papules) on the shins and lower part of the legs. They usually appear in the same areas on opposite sides of the body. They are painless in the early stage.\nAs the papules become bigger, they flatten."}

They usually appear in the same areas on opposite sides of the body. They are painless in the early stage.\nAs the papules become bigger, they flatten. They develop a shiny yellow brown center with raised red to purplish edges. Veins are visible below the yellow part of the lesions. The lesions are irregularly round or oval with well-defined borders. They can spread and join together to give the appearance of a patch.\nLesions can also occur on the forearms. Rarely, they may occur on the stomach, face, scalp, palms, and soles of the feet.\nTrauma may cause the lesions to develop\nulcers\n. Nodules also may develop. The area may become very itchy and painful.\nNLD is different from ulcers that can occur on the feet or ankles in people with diabetes.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider can examine your skin to confirm the diagnosis.\nIf needed, your provider may do a\npunch biopsy\nto diagnose the disease. The biopsy removes a sample of tissue from the edge of the lesion.\nYour provider may do a\nglucose tolerance test\nto see if you have diabetes.\nTreatment\nNLD can be difficult to treat."}

Control of blood glucose does not improve symptoms.\nTreatment may include:\nCorticosteroid creams\nInjected corticosteroids\nMedicines that suppress the immune system\nAnti-inflammatory medicines\nMedicines that improve blood flow\nHyperbaric oxygen therapy\nmay be used to increase the amount of oxygen in the blood to promote healing of ulcers\nPhototherapy, a medical procedure in which the skin is carefully exposed to ultraviolet light\nLaser therapy\nIn severe cases, the lesion may be removed by surgery, followed by moving (grafting) skin from other parts of body to the operated area.\nDuring treatment, monitor your glucose level as instructed. Avoid injury to the area to prevent the lesions from turning into ulcers.\nIf you develop ulcers, follow steps on how to take care of the ulcers.\nIf you smoke, you will be advised to\nquit\n.
