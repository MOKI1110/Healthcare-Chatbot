Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHyperparathyroidism\nHyperparathyroidism\nHyperparathyroidism is a condition in which 1 or more of the parathyroid glands in your neck produce too much parathyroid hormone (PTH).\nCauses\nThere are 4 tiny parathyroid glands in the neck, near or attached to the back side of the thyroid gland.\nThe parathyroid glands help regulate calcium absorption, use and removal by the body. They do this by producing parathyroid hormone (PTH). PTH helps regulate calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D levels in the blood and bone. It is important for healthy bones.\nWhen the blood calcium level is too low, the body responds by making more PTH. This causes the calcium level in the blood to rise.\nIf one or more of the parathyroid glands grow larger, it may lead to too much PTH. Most often, the cause is a benign tumor of the parathyroid glands (\nparathyroid adenoma\n). These benign tumors are common and happen without a known cause.\nThe disease is most common in people over age 60, but it can also occur in younger adults."}

Hyperparathyroidism in childhood is very unusual.\nWomen are more likely to be affected than men.\nRadiation to the head and neck increases the risk.\nSome genetic syndromes (\nmultiple endocrine neoplasia I\n) make it more likely to have hyperparathyroidism.\nIn very rare cases, hyperparathyroidism is caused by\nparathyroid cancer\n.\nMedical conditions that cause low blood calcium or increased phosphate can also lead to hyperparathyroidism."}
