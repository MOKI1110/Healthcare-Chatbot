It may occur either during intercourse or by manual stimulation with or without a partner. Ejaculation is when semen is released from the penis.\nCauses\nMost men can ejaculate within a few minutes of starting to thrust during intercourse. Men with delayed ejaculation may be unable to ejaculate or may only be able to ejaculate with great effort after having intercourse for a long time (for example, 30 to 45 minutes).\nDelayed ejaculation can have psychological or physical causes.\nCommon psychological causes include:\nReligious background that makes the person view sex as sinful\nLack of attraction for a partner\nConditioning caused by a habit of excessive masturbation\nTraumatic events (such as being discovered masturbating or having illicit sex, or learning one's partner is having an affair)\nSome factors, such as anger toward the partner, may be involved.\nPhysical causes may include:\nBlockage of the ducts that semen passes throug"}

This is often a nervous system problem. A nervous system (neurological) exam may reveal other nerve problems that are connected with delayed ejaculation.\nAn ultrasound can show a blockage of the ejaculatory ducts.\nTreatment\nIf you have never ejaculated through any form of stimulation, see your health care provider to determine if the problem has a physical cause. (Examples of stimulation may include wet dreams, masturbation, or intercourse.)  Your provider may refer you to a urologist for additional evaluation and advice.\nSee a therapist who specializes in ejaculation problems if you are unable to ejaculate in an acceptable amount of time. Sex therapy most often includes both partners."}

Sex therapy most often includes both partners. In most cases, the therapist will teach you about the sexual response. You also will learn how to communicate and guide your partner to provide the right stimulation.\nTherapy often involves a series of \"homework\" assignments. In the privacy of your home, you and your partner engage in sexual activities that reduce performance pressure and focus on pleasure.\nTypically, you will not have sexual intercourse for a certain period of time. In this time, you will gradually learn to enjoy ejaculation through other types of stimulation.\nIn cases where there is a problem with the relationship or a lack of sexual desire, you may need therapy to improve your relationship and emotional intimacy.\nSometimes, hypnosis may be a helpful addition to therapy. This may be useful if one partner is not willing to participate in therapy. Trying to self-treat this problem is often not successful.\nIf a medicine may be the cause of the problem, discuss other medicine options with your care provider."}

Realize that you cannot force yourself to have a sexual response, just as you cannot force yourself to go to sleep or to perspire. The harder you try to have a certain sexual response, the harder it may become to respond.\nTo reduce the pressure, focus on the pleasure of the moment. Do not worry about whether or when you will ejaculate. Your partner can help by creating a relaxed atmosphere, and by not pressuring you about whether or not you have ejaculated."}
