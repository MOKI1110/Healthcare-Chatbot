Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRBC count\nRBC count\nAn RBC count is a blood test that measures how many red blood cells (RBCs) you have.\nRBCs contain\nhemoglobin\n, a protein which carries oxygen. How much oxygen your body tissues get depends on how many RBCs you have and how well they work.\nWatch this video about:\nRed blood cell production\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is necessary.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise."}

Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe RBC count is almost always part of a complete blood count (\nCBC\n) test.\nThe test can help diagnose different kinds of\nanemia\n(low number of RBCs) and other conditions affecting red blood cells.\nOther conditions that may require an RBC count are:\nBone marrow disorder in which the marrow is replaced by scar tissue (myelofibrosis)\nDisease that damages kidney blood vessels (\nAlport syndrome\n)\nDisorder in which red blood cells break down earlier than normal (hemolysis or\nparoxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria\n)\nWhite blood cell cancer (leukemia or multiple myeloma)\nNormal Results\nNormal RBC ranges are:\nMale: 4.7 to 6.1 million cells per microliter (cells/mcL)\nFemale: 4.2 to 5.4 million cells/mcL\nThe ranges above are common measurements for results of these tests. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples."}

Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nHigher than normal numbers of RBCs may be due to:\nBone marrow disease that causes abnormal increase in RBCs (\npolycythemia vera\n)\nCigarette smoking\nDehydration\n(for example, from severe diarrhea)\nFailure of the right side of the heart (\ncor pulmonale\n)\nKidney tumor (renal cell carcinoma)\nLow blood oxygen level (hypoxia)\nProblem with heart's structure and function that is present at birth (\ncongenital heart disease\n)\nScarring or thickening of the lungs (\npulmonary fibrosis\n)\nYour RBC count will increase for several weeks when you are in a higher altitude.\nMedicines that can increase the RBC count include:\nAnabolic steroids\nErythropoietin\nGentamicin\nTestosterone\nLower-than-normal numbers of RBCs may be due to:\nAnemia\nBleeding\nBone marrow cancer called\nmultiple myeloma\nBone marrow failure (for example, from radiation, toxins, or tumor)\nDeficiency of a hormone called erythropoietin"}
