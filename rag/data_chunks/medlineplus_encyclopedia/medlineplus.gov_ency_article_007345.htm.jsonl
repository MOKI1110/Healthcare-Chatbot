Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nKnee CT scan\nKnee CT scan\nA computed tomography (CT) scan of the knee is a test that uses x-rays to take detailed images of the knee.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner.\nWhen you are inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you. (Modern \"spiral\" scanners can perform the exam without stopping.)\nA computer makes several images of the body area. These are called slices. These images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, or printed on film. Models of the body area in 3-D can be created by adding the slices together.\nYou must stay still during the exam, because movement blurs the pictures. You may have to hold your breath for short periods of time.\nThe scan should take less than 20 minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nSome exams require a special dye, called contrast, to be injected into your body before the test. Contrast helps certain areas show up better on the x-rays.\nContrast can be given through a vein (IV)."}

If contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.\nLet your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test to avoid this problem.\nBefore receiving the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes medicine metformin (Glucophage). You may need to take extra steps if you are taking this medicine.\nToo much weight can cause damage to the scanner's working parts."}

Ask about the weight limit before the test if you weigh more than 300 pounds (135 kilograms).\nYou will need to remove jewelry and wear a hospital gown during the CT exam as metal can affect the CT images.\nHow the Test will Feel\nSome people may be uncomfortable lying on the hard table.\nContrast given through an IV may cause:\nSlight burning feeling\nMetallic taste in the mouth\nWarm flushing of the body\nThese feelings are normal and usually go away within a few seconds.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA CT scan can quickly create more detailed pictures of the knee than standard x-rays."}

You may have\nnausea or vomiting\n,\nsneezing\n,\nitching\n, or\nhives\nif you have this an iodine allergy.\nIf you need to have this kind of contrast, you may need antihistamines (such as Benadryl) or steroids before the test.\nThe kidneys help remove iodine out of the body. You may need extra fluids after the test to help rid your body of the iodine if you have kidney disease or diabetes.\nRarely, the dye may cause a serious allergic response called\nanaphylaxis\n. This can be life-threatening. Notify the scanner operator right away if you have any trouble breathing during the test."}
