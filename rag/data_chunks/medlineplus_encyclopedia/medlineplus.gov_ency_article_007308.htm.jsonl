It occurs when abnormal amounts of fluid build up in two or more body areas of a fetus or newborn. It is a symptom of underlying problems.\nCauses\nThere are two types of hydrops fetalis, immune and nonimmune. The type depends on the cause of the abnormal fluid.\nImmune hydrops fetalis\nis most often a complication of a severe form of\nRh incompatibility\n, which can be prevented. This is a condition in which mother who has Rh negative blood type makes antibodies to her baby's Rh positive blood cells, and the antibodies cross the placenta. Rh incompatibility causes a large number of red blood cells in the fetus to be destroyed (also known as\nhemolytic disease of the newborn\n). This leads to problems including total body swelling. Severe swelling can interfere with how the body organs work.\nNonimmune hydrops fetalis\nis more common. It accounts for up to 90% of cases of hydrops. The condition occurs when a disease or medical condition affects the body's ability to manage fluid."}

It accounts for up to 90% of cases of hydrops. The condition occurs when a disease or medical condition affects the body's ability to manage fluid. There are three main causes for this type, heart or lung problems, severe anemia (such as from thalassemia or infections), and genetic or developmental problems, including\nTurner syndrome\n.\nThe number of babies who develop immune hydrops fetalis has dropped due to a medicine called RhoGAM. This drug is given as an injection to pregnant mothers who are at risk for Rh incompatibility. The drug prevents them from making antibodies against their babies' red blood cells. There are other, much rarer, blood group incompatibilities that can also cause immune hydrops fetalis, but RhoGAM does not help with these.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms depend on the severity of the condition."}

During pregnancy, treatment may include:\nMedicine to cause early labor and delivery of the baby\nEarly cesarean delivery if condition gets worse\nGiving blood to the baby while still in the womb (intrauterine fetal blood transfusion)\nTreatment for a newborn may include:\nFor immune hydrops, direct transfusion of red blood cells that match the infant's blood type."}

The risk is highest for babies who are born very early or who are ill at birth. Babies who have a structural defect, and those with no identified cause for the hydrops are also at higher risk.\nPossible Complications\nBrain damage called\nkernicterus\nmay occur in the case of Rh incompatibility."}
