Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nLyme disease\nLyme disease\nLyme disease is a bacterial infection that is spread through the bite of one of several types of ticks.\nCauses\nLyme disease is caused by bacteria called\nBorrelia burgdorferi\n(\nB burgdorferi\n). Blacklegged ticks (also called deer ticks) can carry these bacteria. Not all species of ticks can carry these bacteria. Immature ticks are called nymphs, and they are about the size of a pinhead. Nymphs pick up bacteria when they feed on small rodents, such as mice, infected with\nB burgdorferi\n. You can only get the disease if you are bitten by an infected tick.\nLyme disease was first reported in the United States in 1977 in the town of Old Lyme, Connecticut. The same disease occurs in many parts of Europe and Asia. In the United States, most Lyme disease infections occur in the following areas:\nNortheastern states, from Virginia to Maine\nNorth-central states, mostly in Wisconsin and Minnesota\nWest Coast, mainly in the northwest\nThere are three stages of Lyme disease.\nStage 1 is called early localized Lyme disease."}

The bacteria have not yet spread throughout the body.\nStage 2 is called early disseminated Lyme disease. The bacteria have begun to spread throughout the body.\nStage 3 is called late disseminated Lyme disease. The bacteria have spread throughout the body.\nRisk factors for Lyme disease include:\nDoing outside activities that increase tick exposure (for example, gardening, hunting, or hiking) in an area where Lyme disease occurs\nHaving a pet that may carry infected ticks home\nWalking in high grasses in areas where Lyme disease occurs\nImportant facts about tick bites and Lyme disease:\nA tick must be attached to your body for 24 to 36 hours in order to spread the bacteria to your blood.\nBlacklegged ticks can be so small that they are almost impossible to see. Many people with Lyme disease never even see or feel a tick on their body.\nMost people who are bitten by a tick do not get Lyme disease.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of early localized Lyme disease (stage 1) begin days or weeks after infection."}

They are similar to the flu and may include:\nFever\nand chills\nGeneral ill feeling\nHeadache\nJoint pain\nMuscle pain\nStiff neck\nThere may be a \"bull's eye\" rash, a flat or slightly raised red spot at the site of the tick bite. Often there is a clear area in the center. It can be large and expanding in size. This rash is called erythema migrans. Without treatment, it can last 4 weeks or longer.\nSymptoms may come and go. Untreated, the bacteria can spread to the brain, heart, and joints.\nSymptoms of early disseminated Lyme disease (stage 2) may occur weeks to months after the tick bite, and may include:\nNumbness or pain in the nerve area\nParalysis or weakness in the muscles of the face\nHeart problems, such as conduction abnormalities (e.g. skipped heartbeats or\npalpitations\n), chest pain, or shortness of breath\nSymptoms of late disseminated Lyme disease (stage 3) can occur months or years after the infection.

Also, if you are treated with antibiotics in the early stage, your body may not make enough antibodies to be detected by blood tests.\nIn areas where Lyme disease is more common, your health care provider may be able to diagnose early disseminated Lyme disease (Stage 2) without doing any lab tests.\nOther tests that may be done when the infection has spread include:\nElectrocardiogram\nEchocardiogram\nto look at the heart\nMRI of the brain\nSpinal tap\n(lumbar puncture to examine spinal fluid)\nTreatment\nPeople bitten by a tick should be watched closely for at least 30 days to see if a rash or symptoms develop.\nTo prevent Lyme disease, a single dose of the antibiotic doxycycline may be given to someone soon after being bitten by a tick, when all of these conditions are true:\nThe person has a tick that can carry Lyme disease attached to their body."}
