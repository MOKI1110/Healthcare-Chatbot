Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCalcium pyrophosphate arthritis\nCalcium pyrophosphate arthritis\nCalcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) arthritis is a joint disease that can cause attacks of arthritis. Like gout, crystals form in the joints. But in this arthritis, the crystals are not formed from uric acid.\nCauses\nDeposition of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) causes this form of\narthritis\n. The buildup of this chemical forms crystals in the cartilage of joints. This leads to attacks of\njoint swelling\nand pain most often in the knees, wrists, ankles, and shoulders. Other joints can be affected as well. In contrast to gout, the metatarsal-phalangeal joint of the big toe is not affected.\nAmong older adults, CPPD is a common cause of sudden (acute) arthritis in one joint. The attack may be caused by:\nInjury to the joint\nMedical stress\nCPPD arthritis mainly affects the elderly because joint degeneration and\nosteoarthritis\nincreases with age. Such joint damage increases the tendency of CPPD deposition."}

Such joint damage increases the tendency of CPPD deposition. However, CPPD arthritis is also more common in people with:\nHemochromatosis\nParathyroid gland disease\nDialysis-dependent renal failure\nSymptoms\nIn most cases, CPPD deposits do not cause any symptoms. Instead, x-rays of affected joints such as knees show characteristic deposits of calcium.\nSome people with chronic CPPD deposits in large joints may have the following symptoms:\nPain\nSwelling\nWarmth\nRedness\nAttacks of joint pain can last for months. There may be no symptoms between attacks.\nIn some people CPPD arthritis causes severe damage to a joint.\nCPPD arthritis can also occur in the upper and lower spine. Pressure on spinal nerves may cause pain in the arms or legs.\nBecause the symptoms are similar, CPPD arthritis can be confused with:\nGouty arthritis (gout)\nOsteoarthritis\nRheumatoid arthritis\nExams and Tests\nMost arthritic conditions show similar symptoms."}

A medicine such as colchicine may help prevent repeat attacks.
