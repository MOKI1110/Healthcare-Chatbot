The abnormal cells start in the tissue that would normally become the placenta. The placenta is the organ that develops during pregnancy to feed the fetus.\nChoriocarcinoma is a type of\ngestational trophoblastic disease\n.\nCauses\nChoriocarcinoma is a rare cancer that occurs as an abnormal pregnancy. A baby may or may not develop in this type of pregnancy.\nThe cancer may also occur shortly after a normal pregnancy. But it most often occurs with a complete\nhydatidiform mole\n. This is a growth that forms inside the womb at the beginning of a pregnancy. The abnormal tissue from the mole can continue to grow even after attempted removal, and can become cancerous. About one half of all women with a choriocarcinoma had a hydatidiform mole, or molar pregnancy.\nChoriocarcinomas may also occur after an early pregnancy that does not continue (miscarriage)."}

The pregnancy hormone (HCG or human chorionic gonadotropin) level will be high.\nA pelvic exam may find an enlarged uterus and ovaries.\nBlood tests that may be done include:\nQuantitative serum HCG\nComplete blood count\nKidney function tests\nLiver function tests\nImaging tests that may be done include:\nCT scan\nMRI\nPelvic ultrasound\nChest x-ray\nYou should be carefully monitored after a hydatidiform mole or at the end of a pregnancy."}

It is usually effective.\nHysterectomy\nto remove the womb and radiation treatment are rarely needed.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the stress of illness by joining a\ncancer support group\n.
