Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHDL test\nHDL test\nThe high-density lipoprotein (HDL) test is a blood test to measure the amount of HDL cholesterol in your blood. HDL is a type of fat (lipid) in your blood.\nHDL is called \"good\" cholesterol because it helps prevent low-density lipoprotein (LDL) \"bad\" cholesterol and triglycerides from building up in the arteries. HDL picks up LDL in the blood and carries it to the liver. The liver breaks down LDL cholesterol, and it is passed from the body as waste.\nThe HDL test is often done as part of a\nlipid profile\n, which measures other fats in your blood:\nTotal cholesterol\nLDL cholesterol\nTriglycerides\nVery low-density lipoprotein cholesterol,\nVLDL cholesterol\n(which is usually calculated from the triglyceride level rather than measured directly)\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed."}

Most of the time,\nblood is drawn from a vein\nlocated on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou should not eat for 9 to 12 hours before the test.\nAlcohol and some medicines can interfere with blood test results.\nMake sure your health care provider knows what medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines and supplements.\nYour provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test.\nDo not stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted. You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nHDL cholesterol is usually measured together with other blood fats."}

Often it is done to help determine your risk of developing heart disease.\nHigh HDL helps lower your risk for:\nHeart disease\nHeart attack\nStroke\nNormal Results\nYou want your HDL cholesterol to be high (unless it is due to a condition described below). Optimal values are 60 mg/dL or 1.55 millimoles per liter (mmol/L) or above.\nAt risk:\nMen - Less than 40 mg/dL (1.04 mmol/L)\nWomen - Less than 50 mg/dL (1.29 mmol/L)\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nLow HDL cholesterol levels may be due to:\nEating a diet high in saturated fats or a diet high in carbohydrates and low in fat\nLack of physical activity\nBeing overweight\nor\nhaving obesity\nMetabolic syndrome\nDiabetes\nA disorder passed down through families in which there are high amounts of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood (\nfamilial combined hyperlipidemia\n)\nSide effect of certain medicines\nOverall, the treatment of low HDL focuses on increased exercise and changes in the diet.\nAn elevated HDL is anything over 80 mg/dL (2.0 mmol/L). This can be a result of:\nA genetic variation that causes the body to produce too much HDL\nOveractive thyroid (\nhyperthyroidism\n)\nDrinking too much alcohol\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
