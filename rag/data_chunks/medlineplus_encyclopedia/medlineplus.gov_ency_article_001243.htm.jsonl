There are more than 100 different types of arthritis.\nCauses\nArthritis involves the breakdown of structures of the joint, particularly cartilage. Normal cartilage protects a joint and allows it to move smoothly. Cartilage also absorbs shock when pressure is placed on the joint, such as when you walk. Without the normal amount of cartilage, the bones under the cartilage become damaged and rub together."}

Cartilage also absorbs shock when pressure is placed on the joint, such as when you walk. Without the normal amount of cartilage, the bones under the cartilage become damaged and rub together. This causes swelling (inflammation), and stiffness.\nOther joint structures affected by arthritis include:\nThe synovium\nThe bone next to the joint\nLigaments and tendons\nSacs that may be fluid-filled next to bone, ligaments and tendons (bursae)\nJoint inflammation and damage may result from:\nAn autoimmune disease (the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue)\nBroken bone\nGeneral \"wear and tear\" on joints\nInfection, most often by bacteria or viruses\nCrystals such as uric acid or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate\nIn most cases, the joint inflammation goes away after the cause goes away or is treated.

When this happens, you have long-term (chronic) arthritis.\nArthritis may occur in people of any age and sex.\nOsteoarthritis\n, which is due to non-inflammatory processes and increases with age, is the most common type.\nOther, more common types of inflammatory arthritis include:\nAnkylosing spondylitis\nCrystal arthritis, gout, calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease\nJuvenile rheumatoid arthritis\n(in children)\nBacterial infections\nPsoriatic arthritis\nReactive arthritis\nRheumatoid arthritis\n(in adults)\nScleroderma\nSystemic lupus erythematosus\n(SLE)\nSymptoms\nArthritis causes joint pain, swelling, stiffness, and limited movement."}

This may be a sign of severe, untreated rheumatoid arthritis or of osteoarthritis.\nBlood tests and\njoint x-rays\nare often done to check for infection and other causes of arthritis.\nThe provider may also remove a sample of joint fluid with a needle and send it to a lab to be checked for inflammation crystals or infection.\nTreatment\nThe underlying cause often cannot be cured."}

Exercise can help relieve stiffness, reduce pain and fatigue, and improve muscle and bone strength. Your health care team can help you design an\nexercise program\nthat is best for you.\nExercise programs may include:\nLow-impact aerobic activity (also called endurance exercise) such as walking\nRange of motion exercises for flexibility\nStrength training for muscle tone\nYour provider may suggest physical therapy. This might include:\nHeat or ice.\nSplints or orthotics to support joints and help improve their position.

For example, install grab bars in the shower, the tub, and near the toilet.\nTry stress-reducing activities, such as meditation, yoga, or tai chi.\nEat a healthy diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables, which contain important vitamins and minerals.\nEat foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, such as cold-water fish (salmon, mackerel, and herring), flaxseed, rapeseed (canola) oil, soybeans, soybean oil, pumpkin seeds, and walnuts.\nAvoid smoking and excessive alcohol consumption.\nApply capsaicin cream over your painful joints.

All medicines have some risks. You should be closely followed by a provider when taking\narthritis medicines\n, even ones you buy over-the-counter.\nOver-the-counter medicines:\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol) is often the first medicine tried to reduce pain. Take up to 3,000 mg a day (2 extra-strength Tylenol every 8 hours). To prevent damage to your liver, do not take more than the recommended dose. Since multiple medicines are available without a prescription that also contain acetaminophen, you will need to include them in the 3,000 mg per day maximum. Also, avoid alcohol when taking acetaminophen.\nAspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that can relieve arthritis pain. However, they can carry risks when used for a long time."}
