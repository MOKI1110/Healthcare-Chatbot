Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)\nCoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a respiratory illness that causes fever, coughing, and\nshortness of breath\n, but many other symptoms can occur. COVID-19 is caused by a highly infectious virus. Most people get mild to moderate illness. Older adults and people with certain health conditions are at high risk for severe illness and death. More than one million people in the United States have died from COVID-19.\nCauses\nCOVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2).\nCoronaviruses\nare a family of viruses that can affect people and animals. They can cause mild to moderate respiratory illnesses, such as the\ncommon cold\n. Some coronaviruses can cause severe illness that can lead to pneumonia and even death.\nCOVID-19 most readily spreads to people within close contact (about 6 feet or 2 meters). When someone with the illness coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes, droplets and very small particles spray into the air."}

When someone with the illness coughs, sneezes, sings, talks, or breathes, droplets and very small particles spray into the air. You can catch the illness if you breathe in these droplets or particles or they land on your eyes, nose, or mouth.\nIn some instances, COVID-19 may spread through the air and infect people who are more than 6 feet away. Small droplets and particles can remain in the air for minutes to hours. This is called airborne (or aerosol) transmission, and it occurs especially in enclosed spaces with poor ventilation. However, it is more common for COVID-19 to spread through close contact.\nLess often, the illness can spread if you touch a surface with the virus on it, and then touch your eyes, nose, mouth, or face. But this is thought to be a much less common way in which the virus spreads.\nCOVID-19 can spread from person to person quickly. As the virus spreads, it can change, and new variants of the virus will occur. Different variants may spread more quickly or be more resistant to treatments or vaccines."}
