There are about 20,000 genes in each cell of the human body. Together, they make up the blueprint for the human body and how it works.\nA person's genetic makeup is called a genotype.\nInformation\nGenes are made of DNA. Strands of DNA make up part of your\nchromosomes\n. Chromosomes have matching strands of DNA that make specific genes. Except for the sex chromosomes (X and Y), chromosomes are paired so there are 2 genes, 1 on each chromosome. The gene occurs in the same position on each chromosome.\nGenetic traits, such as eye color, are dominant or recessive:\nDominant traits are controlled by 1 gene in the pair of chromosomes.\nRecessive traits need both genes in the gene pair to work together.\nMany personal characteristics, such as height, are determined by more than 1 gene. However, some diseases, such as\nsickle cell anemia\n, can be caused by a\nchange in a single gene\n.\nImages\nChromosomes and DNA\nReferences\nBiesecker LG."}
