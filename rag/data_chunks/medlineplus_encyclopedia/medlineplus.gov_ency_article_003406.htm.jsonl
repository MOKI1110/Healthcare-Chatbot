Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nChorionic villus sampling\nChorionic villus sampling\nChorionic villus sampling (CVS) is a test some pregnant women have to screen their baby for genetic problems.\nHow the Test is Performed\nCVS can be done through the cervix (transcervical) or through the belly (transabdominal).\nMiscarriage\nrates are slightly higher when the test is done through the cervix.\nThe transcervical procedure is performed by inserting a thin plastic tube through the vagina and cervix to reach the placenta. Your health care provider uses ultrasound images to help guide the tube into the best area for sampling. A small sample of chorionic villus (placental) tissue is then removed.\nThe transabdominal procedure is performed by inserting a needle through the abdomen and uterus and into the placenta. Ultrasound is used to help guide the needle, and a small amount of tissue is drawn into the syringe.\nThe sample is placed in a dish and evaluated in a lab.  The time to get a test result may vary, depending on the laboratory or the specific test ordered."}

The time to get a test result may vary, depending on the laboratory or the specific test ordered. Most results are available in 7 to 14 days. Preliminary results of the CVS may be available in as little 48 hours in situations where the information is needed more quickly.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour provider will explain the procedure, its risks, and alternative procedures such as\namniocentesis\n.\nYou will be asked to sign a consent form before this procedure. You may be asked to wear a hospital gown.\nThe morning of the procedure, you may be asked to drink fluids and refrain from urinating. Doing so fills your bladder, which helps your provider see where to best guide the needle.\nTell your provider if you are allergic to iodine or shellfish, or if you have any other allergies.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe ultrasound does not hurt. A clear, water-based gel is applied to your skin to help with the transmission of the sound waves. A hand-held probe called a transducer is then moved over your belly area."}

A clear, water-based gel is applied to your skin to help with the transmission of the sound waves. A hand-held probe called a transducer is then moved over your belly area. In addition, your provider may apply pressure on your abdomen to find the position of your uterus.\nThe gel will feel cold at first and may irritate your skin if not washed off after the procedure.\nSome women say the vaginal approach feels like a\nPap test\nwith some discomfort and a feeling of pressure. There may be a small amount of vaginal bleeding following the procedure.\nAn obstetrician can perform this procedure in about 5 minutes, after preparation.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test is used to identify any genetic problems in your unborn baby. It is very accurate, and it can be done very early in a pregnancy.\nGenetic problems can occur in any pregnancy. However, the following factors increase the risk:\nAn older mother\nPast pregnancies with genetic problems\nFamily history of genetic disorders\nGenetic counseling\nis recommended before the procedure."}

This will allow you to make an unhurried, informed decision about options for prenatal diagnosis.\nCVS can be done sooner in pregnancy than amniocentesis, most often at about 10 to 12 weeks.\nCVS does not detect:\nNeural tube defects\n(these involve the spinal column or brain)\nRh incompatibility\n(this occurs when a pregnant woman has Rh-negative blood and her unborn baby has Rh-positive blood)\nBirth defects not due to a genetic cause\nIssues related to brain function, such as autism and intellectual disability\nNormal Results\nA normal result means there are no signs of genetic defects in the developing baby. Even though the test results are very accurate, no test is 100% accurate at testing for genetic problems in a pregnancy.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThis test can help detect hundreds of genetic disorders."}

Abnormal results may be due to many different genetic conditions, including:\nDown syndrome\nHemoglobinopathies\nTay-Sachs disease\nTalk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results. Ask your provider:\nHow the condition or defect may be treated either during or after the pregnancy\nWhat special needs your child may have after birth\nWhat other options you have about maintaining or ending your pregnancy\nRisks\nThe risks of CVS are only slightly higher than those of amniocentesis.\nPossible complications include:\nBleeding\nInfection\nMiscarriage (in up to 1 in 100 women)\nRh incompatibility in the mother\nRupture of membranes, which may lead to miscarriage\nConsiderations\nIf your blood is Rh negative, you may receive a medicine called Rho(D) immune globulin (RhoGAM and other brands) to prevent Rh incompatibility.\nYou will receive a follow-up ultrasound 2 to 4 days after the procedure to make sure your pregnancy is proceeding normally.\nAlternative Names\nCVS; Pregnancy - CVS; Geneti"}
