Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFactor XII assay\nFactor XII assay\nThe factor XII assay is a blood test to measure the activity of factor XII. This is one of the proteins in the body that helps the blood clot.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour health care provider may want you to have this test if you had abnormal results on the\npartial thromboplastin time (PTT) blood-clotting test\n. You may also need the test if a family member is known to have\nfactor XII deficiency\n.\nNormal Results\nA normal value is 50% to 200% of the lab control or reference value.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nDecreased factor XII activity may indicate:\nFactor XII deficiency (a lack of blood clotting factor XII that does not increase the risk for bleeding).  ). It can be due to an inherited condition associated with a variant gene.\nLiver disease\n.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.\nOther risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nMultiple punctures to locate veins\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nHageman factor assay\nReferences\nGailani D, Benjamin FT, Wheeler AP.
