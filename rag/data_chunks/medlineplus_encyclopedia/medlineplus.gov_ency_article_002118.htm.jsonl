They may also not wet their diaper as often as usual.\nGive your child fluids for the first 4 to 6 hours. At first, try 1 ounce (2 tablespoons or 30 milliliters [mL]) of fluid every 30 to 60 minutes. You can use:\nAn over-the-counter drink, such as Pedialyte or Infalyte -- do not water down these drinks\nPedialyte frozen fruit pops\nIf you are nursing, keep breastfeeding your infant. If you are using formula, use it at one half strength for 2 to 3 feedings after the diarrhea starts. Then begin regular formula feedings again.\nIf your child throws up, give only a little bit of fluid at a time. You can start with as little as 1 teaspoon (5 mL) of fluid every 10 to 15 minutes.\nWhen your child is ready for regular foods, try:\nBananas\nChicken\nCrackers\nPasta\nRice cereal\nAvoid:\nApple juice\nDairy products\nFried foods\nFull-strength fruit juice\nThe BRAT diet was recommended by some health care providers in the past."}
