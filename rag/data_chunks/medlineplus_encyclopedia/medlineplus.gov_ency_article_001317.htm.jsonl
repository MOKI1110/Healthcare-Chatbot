Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nMosaicism\nMosaicism\nMosaicism is a condition in which cells within the same person have a different genetic makeup. This condition can affect any type of cell, including:\nBlood cells\nEgg and sperm cells\nSkin cells\nCauses\nMosaicism is caused by an error in cell division very early in the development of the unborn baby. Examples of mosaicism include:\nMosaic\nDown syndrome\nMosaic\nKlinefelter syndrome\nMosaic\nTurner syndrome\nMosaic\nneurofibromatosis\nSymptoms\nSymptoms vary and are very difficult to predict. Symptoms may not be as severe if you have both normal and variant cells.\nExams and Tests\nGenetic testing can diagnose mosaicism.\nTests will likely need to be repeated to confirm the results, and to help determine the type and severity of the disorder. Sometimes two different body tissues may need to be tested, such as blood and skin, or skin from two different areas of the body.\nTreatment\nTreatment will depend on the type and severity of the disorder."}

You  may need less intense treatment if only some of the cells are variant.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHow well you do depends on which organs and tissues are affected (for example, the brain or heart). It is difficult to predict the effects of having two different cell lines in one person.\nIn general, people with a high number of variant cells have the same outlook as people with the typical form of the disease (those who have all variant cells). The typical form is also called non-mosaic.\nPeople with a low number of variant cells may be only mildly affected. They may not discover that they have mosaicism until they give birth to a child who has the non-mosaic form of the disease. Sometimes a child born with the non-mosaic form will not survive, but a child born with mosaicism will.\nPossible Complications\nComplications depend on how many cells are affected by the genetic change.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nA diagnosis of mosaicism may cause confusion and uncertainty."}
