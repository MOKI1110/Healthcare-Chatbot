Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBilateral hydronephrosis\nBilateral hydronephrosis\nBilateral hydronephrosis is the enlargement of the parts of the kidney that collect urine. Bilateral means both sides.\nCauses\nBilateral hydronephrosis occurs when urine is unable to drain from the kidney into the bladder. Hydronephrosis is not itself a disease. It occurs as a result of a problem that prevents urine from draining out of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder.\nDisorders linked with bilateral hydronephrosis include:\nAcute bilateral obstructive uropathy -- sudden blockage of the kidneys\nBladder outlet obstruction\n-- blockage of the bladder, which does not allow drainage\nChronic bilateral obstructive uropathy -- a gradual blockage of both kidneys is most often from a common singular obstruction\nNeurogenic bladder\n-- poorly functional bladder\nPosterior urethral valves -- flaps on the urethra that causes poor emptying of the bladder (in boys)\nPrune belly syndrome\n-- poorly emptying bladder that causes distention of the belly\nRetroperitoneal fibrosis\n-- abnormal scar tissue that blocks the ureters"}
