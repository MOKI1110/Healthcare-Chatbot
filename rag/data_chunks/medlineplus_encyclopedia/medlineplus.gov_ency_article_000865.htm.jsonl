Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSkin lesion of blastomycosis\nSkin lesion of blastomycosis\nA skin lesion of blastomycosis is a symptom of an infection with the fungus\nBlastomyces dermatitidis.\nThe skin becomes infected as the fungus spreads throughout the body. Another form of blastomycosis is only on the skin and usually gets better on its own with time. This article deals with the more widespread form of the infection.\nCauses\nBlastomycosis\nis a rare fungal infection. It is most often found in:\nAfrica\nCanada, around the Great Lakes\nSouth central and north central United States\nIndia\nIsrael\nSaudi Arabia\nA person gets infected by breathing in particles of the fungus that are found in moist soil, especially where there is rotting vegetation. People with immune system disorders are at higher risk for this infection, though healthy people can also develop this disease.\nThe fungus enters the body through the lungs and infects them. In some people, the fungus then spreads (disseminates) to other areas of the body."}

In some people, the fungus then spreads (disseminates) to other areas of the body. The infection may affect the skin, bones and joints, genitals and urinary tract, and other systems. Skin symptoms are a sign of widespread (disseminated) blastomycosis.\nSymptoms\nIn many people, skin symptoms develop when the infection spreads beyond their lungs.\nPapules\n,\npustules\n, or\nnodules\nare most frequently found on exposed body areas.\nThey may look like warts or\nulcers\n.\nThey are usually painless.\nThey may vary from gray to violet in color.\nThe pustules may:\nForm ulcers\nBleed easily\nOccur in the nose or mouth\nOver time, these skin lesions can lead to scarring and loss of skin color (pigment).\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine your skin and ask about symptoms.\nThe infection is diagnosed by identifying the fungus in a culture taken from a skin lesion. This usually requires a\nskin biopsy\n.\nTreatment\nThis infection is treated with antifungal medicines such as amphotericin B, itraconazole, voriconazole, or fluconazole."}

People with a suppressed immune system may need long-term treatment to prevent symptoms from coming back.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nAbscesses\n(pockets of pus)\nAnother (secondary) skin infection caused by bacteria\nComplications related to medicines (for instance, amphotericin B can have severe side effects)\nSpontaneously draining nodules\nSevere body-wide infection and death\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nSome of the skin problems caused by blastomycosis can be similar to skin problems caused by other illnesses.
