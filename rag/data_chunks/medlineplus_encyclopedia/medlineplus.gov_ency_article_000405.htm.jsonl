This causes fat particles called chylomicrons to build up in the blood. The disorder is passed down through families.\nCauses\nChylomicronemia syndrome can occur due to a rare genetic disorder in which a protein (enzyme) called lipoprotein lipase (LpL) is broken or missing. It can also be caused by the absence of second factor called apolipoprotein C-II (also called apoCII), which activates LpL. LpL is normally found in fat and muscle. It helps break down certain lipids. When LpL is missing or broken, fat particles called chylomicrons build up in the blood. This buildup is called chylomicronemia.\nDefects in apolipoprotein CII and apolipoprotein AV can cause the syndrome as well."}

This buildup is called chylomicronemia.\nDefects in apolipoprotein CII and apolipoprotein AV can cause the syndrome as well. It is more likely to occur when people who are predisposed to have high triglycerides (such as those who have\nfamilial combined hyperlipidemia\nor\nfamilial hypertriglyceridemia\n) develop diabetes, obesity or are exposed to certain medicines.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may start in infancy and include:\nAbdominal pain due to pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas).\nSymptoms of nerve damage, such as loss of feeling in the feet or legs, and memory loss.\nYellow deposits of fatty material in the skin called xanthomas. These growths may appear on the back, buttocks, soles of the feet, or ankles, knees and elbows.\nExams and Tests\nA physical exam and tests may show:\nEnlarged liver\nand spleen\nInflammation of the pancreas\nFatty deposits under the skin\nPossibly fatty deposits in the\nretina\nof the eye\nA creamy layer will appear when blood spins in a laboratory machine."}

You may need to stop taking certain medicines that can make symptoms worse. Do not stop taking any medicine without first talking to your health care provider. Conditions such as dehydration and diabetes can make symptoms worse. If diagnosed, these conditions need to be treated and controlled.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nA low fat diet can reduce symptoms dramatically.\nPossible Complications\nWhen untreated, the excess chylomicrons may lead to bouts of pancreatitis."}
