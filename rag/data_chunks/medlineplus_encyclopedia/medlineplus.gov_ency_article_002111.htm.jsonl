In the United States, the EPA set the maximum allowable concentration of lead in public drinking water at 15 mcg/L (micrograms per liter).\nThe EPA requires all water suppliers to produce a water quality report every year. These reports include information about lead amounts. The reports are available to the public.\nThe EPA requires public water systems to alert you if there is a problem with your drinking water.\nLead can enter drinking water when plumbing materials that contain lead corrode. Corrosion is when metal is dissolved or worn away by a chemical reaction between water and your plumbing. Water that has high acidity or low mineral content can corrode pipes and fixtures.\nThe most common sources of lead in drinking water are lead pipes, faucets, and fixtures. Service lines connect the home to the water main."}
