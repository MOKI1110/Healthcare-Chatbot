Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBecker muscular dystrophy\nBecker muscular dystrophy\nBecker muscular dystrophy is an inherited disorder that involves slowly worsening\nmuscle weakness\nof the legs and pelvis.\nCauses\nBecker muscular dystrophy is very similar to\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy\n. The main difference is that it gets worse at a much slower rate and it is less common. This disease is caused by a mutation in the gene that encodes a protein called dystrophin.\nThe disorder is passed down through families (inherited). Having a family history of the condition raises your risk.\nBecker muscular dystrophy occurs in about 3 to 6 out of every 100,000 births. The disease is found mostly in boys.\nSymptoms\nFemales rarely develop symptoms. Males will develop symptoms if they inherit the defective gene."}

Symptoms most often appear in boys between ages 5 and 15, but may begin later.\nMuscle weakness of the lower body, including the legs and pelvis area, slowly gets worse, causing:\nDifficulty walking that gets worse over time; by age 25 to 30, the person is usually unable to walk\nFrequent falls\nDifficulty getting up from the floor and climbing stairs\nDifficulty with running, hopping, and jumping\nLoss of muscle mass\nToe walking\nMuscle weakness in the arms, neck, and other areas is not as severe as in the lower body\nOther symptoms may include:\nBreathing problems\nCognitive problems (these do not get worse over time)\nFatigue\nLoss of balance and coordination\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will do a nervous system (neurological) and muscle exam. A careful medical history is also important, because symptoms are similar to those of Duchenne muscular dystrophy."}

However there are many new medicines currently undergoing clinical testing that show significant promise in treating the disease. The current goal of treatment is to control symptoms to maximize the person's quality of life. Some providers prescribe steroids to help keep a patient walking for as long as possible.\nActivity is encouraged. Inactivity (such as bed rest) can make the muscle disease worse. Physical therapy may be helpful to maintain muscle strength. Orthopedic appliances such as braces and wheelchairs may improve movement and self-care.\nAbnormal heart function may require the use of a pacemaker or defibrillator.\nGenetic counseling may be recommended. Daughters of a man with Becker muscular dystrophy will very likely carry the defective gene and could pass it on to their sons.\nSupport Groups\nYou can ease the\nstress\nof the illness by joining a\nmuscular dystrophy support group\nwhere members share common experiences and problems.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nBecker muscular dystrophy leads to slowly worsening disability.
