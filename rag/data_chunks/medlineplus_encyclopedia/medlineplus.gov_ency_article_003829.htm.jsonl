Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nThyroid scan\nThyroid scan\nA thyroid scan uses a radioactive iodine tracer to examine the structure and function of the thyroid gland. This test is often done together with a\nradioactive iodine uptake test\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe test is done in this way:\nYou are given a pill that contains a tiny amount of radioactive iodine. After swallowing it, you wait as the iodine collects in your thyroid.\nThe first scan is usually done 4 to 6 hours after you take the iodine pill. Another scan is usually done 24 hours later. During the scan, you lie on your back on a movable table. Your neck and chest are positioned under the scanner. You must lie still so that the scanner gets a clear image.\nThe scanner detects the location and intensity of the rays given off by the radioactive material. A computer displays images of the thyroid gland. Other scans use a substance called technetium instead of radioactive iodine.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nFollow instructions about not eating before the test."}

You may be told not to eat after midnight before your scan the next morning.\nTell your health care provider if you are taking anything that contains iodine because it may affect your test results. This includes some medicines, including thyroid and heart medicines. Supplements such as kelp also contain iodine.\nAlso tell your provider if you have:\nDiarrhea (may decrease absorption of the radioactive iodine)\nHad recent\nCT scans\nusing intravenous iodine-based contrast (within the past 2 weeks)\nToo little or too much iodine in your diet\nRemove jewelry, dentures, or other metals because they may interfere with the image.\nHow the Test will Feel\nSome people find it uncomfortable to stay still during the test.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to:\nEvaluate\nthyroid nodules\nor\ngoiter\nFind the cause of an\noveractive thyroid gland\nCheck for thyroid cancer (rarely, since other tests are more accurate for this)\nNormal Results\nNormal test results will show that the thyroid appears to be th"}

It is an even gray color on the computer image without darker or lighter areas.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA thyroid that is enlarged or pushed off to one side could be a sign of a\ntumor\n.\nNodules absorb more or less iodine and this will make them look darker or lighter on the scan. A nodule is usually lighter if it has not taken up the iodine (often called a cold nodule). If part of the thyroid appears lighter, it could be a thyroid problem. Nodules that are darker have taken up more iodine (often called a hot nodule). They can be overactive and may be the cause of an overactive thyroid.\nThe computer will also show the percentage of iodine that has collected in your thyroid gland (radioiodine uptake). If your gland collects too much iodine, it may be due to an overactive thyroid. If your gland collects too little iodine, it may be due to inflammation or other damage to the thyroid.\nRisks\nAll radiation has possible side effects."}

The amount of radioactivity is very small, and there have been no documented side effects.\nWomen who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not have this test.\nTalk to your provider if you have concerns about this test.\nConsiderations\nThe radioactive iodine leaves your body through your urine. You need not take special precautions, such as flushing twice after urinating, for 24 to 48 hours after the test because the dose of radioactive iodine is very low. Ask your provider or the radiology/nuclear medicine team performing the scan about taking precautions.\nAlternative Names\nScan - thyroid; Radioactive iodine uptake and scan test - thyroid; Nuclear scan - thyroid; Thyroid nodule - scan; Goiter - scan; Hyperthyroidism - scan\nImages\nThyroid enlargement - scintiscan\nThyroid gland\nReferences\nMettler FA, Guiberteau MJ.
