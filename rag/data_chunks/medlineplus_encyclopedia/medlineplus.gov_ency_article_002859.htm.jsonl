However, they have been found in several large cities outside these areas.\nThe brown recluse spider prefers dark, sheltered areas, such as under porches and in woodpiles.\nWear protective clothing when traveling through areas where these spiders live. DO NOT put your hands or feet in their nests or in their preferred hiding places, such as dark, sheltered areas under logs or underbrush, or other damp, moist areas.\nSymptoms\nWhen the spider bites you, you may feel a sharp sting or nothing at all.

Pain usually develops within the first several hours after being bitten, and may become severe. Children may have more serious reactions.\nSymptoms may include:\nChills\nItching\nGeneral ill-feeling or discomfort\nFever\nNausea\nReddish or purplish color in a circle around bite\nSweating\nLarge sore (ulcer) in the area of the bite\nRarely, these symptoms may occur:\nComa (lack of responsiveness)\nBlood in urine\nYellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)\nKidney failure\nSeizures\nIn serious cases, blood supply is cut off from the area of the bite. This results in black tissue scarring (eschar) at the site. The eschar sloughs off after about 2 to 5 weeks, leaving an ulcer through skin and fatty tissue. The ulcer may take many months to heal and leave a deep scar.\nHome Care\nSeek emergency medical treatment right away. Call 911 or the local emergency number, or poison control.\nFollow these steps until medical help is given:\nClean the area with soap and water.\nWrap ice in a clean cloth and place it on the bite area. Leave it on for 10 minutes and then off for 10 minutes."}

If the person has blood flow problems, decrease the time that the ice is on the area to prevent possible skin damage.\nKeep the affected area still, if possible, to prevent the venom from spreading. A homemade splint may be helpful if the bite was on the arms, legs, hands, or feet.\nLoosen clothing and remove rings and other tight jewelry.\nBefore Calling Emergency\nHave this information ready:\nPerson's age, weight, and condition\nThe body part affected\nThe time the bite occurred\nThe type of spider, if known\nTake the person to the emergency room for treatment. The bite may not look serious, but it can take some time to become severe. Treatment is important to reduce complications.

It may then become deeper, and additional symptoms such as fever, chills, and other signs of additional organ system involvement may develop."}
