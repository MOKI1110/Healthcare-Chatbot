They attach to you as you brush past bushes, plants, and grass. Once on you, ticks often move to a warm, moist location. They are often found in the armpits, groin, and hair. Ticks attach firmly to your skin and begin to draw blood for their meal. This process is painless. Most people will not notice the\ntick bite\n.\nSome species of ticks can be as large as a pencil eraser. They can also be so small that they are very hard to see. They grow in size (engorgement) after attachment. Ticks can transmit bacteria that can cause disease. Some of these can be serious. However, it usually requires several hours after the tick attaches to transmit bacteria efficiently. So, it is important to remove ticks as soon as possible after they have become attached to avoid this transmission.\nConsiderations\nWhile most ticks do not carry bacteria that cause human diseases, some ticks do carry these bacteria."}

These bacteria can cause:\nColorado tick fever\nLyme disease\nRocky Mountain spotted fever\nTularemia\nFirst Aid\nIf a tick is attached to you, follow these steps to remove it:\nUse tweezers to grasp the tick close to its head or mouth. Do not use your bare fingers. If you don't have tweezers and need to use your fingers, use a tissue or paper towel.\nPull the tick straight out with a slow and steady motion. Avoid squeezing or crushing the tick. Be careful not to leave the head embedded in the skin.\nClean the area well with soap and water. Also wash your hands thoroughly. Save the tick in a jar. Watch the person who was bitten carefully over the next week or two for symptoms of a rash, fever, headache, joint pain or redness, and swollen lymph nodes.\nIf all parts of the tick can't be removed, get medical help."}
