Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTrichinosis\nTrichinosis\nTrichinosis is an infection with the roundworm\nTrichinella spiralis\n.\nCauses\nTrichinosis is a parasitic disease caused by eating meat that has not been thoroughly cooked and contains cysts (larvae, or immature worms) of\nTrichinella spiralis\n. This parasite can be found in pig, bear, walrus, fox, rat, horse, and lion.\nWild animals, especially carnivores (meat eaters) or omnivores (animals that eat both meat and plants), should be considered possible sources of roundworm disease. Domestic meat animals raised specifically for eating under US Department of Agriculture (government) guidelines and inspection can be considered safe. For this reason, trichinosis is rare in the United States, but it is a common infection worldwide.\nWhen a person eats meat from an infected animal, trichinella cysts break open in the intestine and grow into adult roundworms. The roundworms produce other worms that move through the gut wall and into the bloodstream."}

The roundworms produce other worms that move through the gut wall and into the bloodstream. The worms invade muscle tissues, including the heart and diaphragm (the breathing muscle under the lungs). They can also infect the lungs and brain. The resulting cysts can remain alive for years.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of trichinosis include:\nAbdominal discomfort, cramping\nDiarrhea\nFacial swelling around the eyes\nFever\nMuscle pain\n(especially muscle pain with breathing, chewing, or using large muscles)\nMuscle weakness\nExams and Tests\nTests to diagnose this condition include:\nBlood tests such as\ncomplete blood count\n(CBC),\neosinophil count\n(a type of white blood cell),\nantibody test\n, and\ncreatine kinase level\n(an enzyme found in muscle cells)\nMuscle biopsy\nto check for worms in the muscle\nTreatment\nMedicines, such as albendazole, can be used to treat infections in the intestines. A mild infection does not usually need treatment."}

A mild infection does not usually need treatment. Pain medicine can help relieve muscle soreness after the larvae have invaded the muscles.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people with trichinosis have no symptoms, and the infection goes away by itself. More severe infections may be difficult to treat, especially if the lungs, heart, or brain are involved.\nPossible Complications\nPossible complications include:\nBrain infection and inflammation\n(encephalitis)\nHeart failure\nfrom heart muscle inflammation\nHeart rhythm problems from heart muscle inflammation\nPneumonia\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you have symptoms of trichinosis and you recently ate undercooked or raw meat that might have been contaminated.\nPrevention\nFreezing pork at a low temperature (5 °F or -15 °C or colder) for 3 to 4 weeks will kill the worms. Freezing wild game meat does not always kill the worms. Smoking, salting, and drying meat are also not reliable methods of killing the worms."}
