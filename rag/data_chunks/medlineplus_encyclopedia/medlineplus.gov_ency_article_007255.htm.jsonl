Cartilage helps cushion and cover the area where bones meet in the joints.\nDescription\nYou will not feel any pain during the surgery. Three types of anesthesia may be used for knee arthroscopy surgery:\nLocal anesthesia -- You will be given shots of painkillers to numb the knee. You may also be given medicines that relax you.\nSpinal anesthesia\n-- The pain medicine is injected into a space in your spine. You will be awake, but will not be able to feel anything below your waist.\nRegional anesthesia -- The pain medicine is injected in your thigh and groin area. Your lower leg and knee will be numb after the injection.\nGeneral anesthesia\n-- You will be asleep and pain-free.\nThe surgeon will perform the following steps:\nMake a one quarter-inch (6 mm) surgical cut on your knee.\nPlace a long, thin tube with a camera on the end through this cut. This is called an arthroscope."}

This is called an arthroscope. The camera is attached to a video monitor in the operating room. This tool lets the surgeon look inside your knee area and work on the joint.\nMake another cut and pass tools through this opening. A small pointed tool called an awl is used to make very small holes in the bone near the damaged cartilage. This will cause a small amount of blood to come in contact with the defect. These are called microfractures.\nThese holes connect to the bone marrow to release cells that can build new cartilage to replace the damaged tissue.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nYou may need this procedure if you have damage to the cartilage:\nIn the knee joint\nUnder the kneecap\nThe goal of this surgery is to prevent or slow further damage to the cartilage. This will help prevent knee arthritis."}

It can break down more easily.\nThe area with the unstable cartilage can get bigger with time as the degeneration progresses."}

These include aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Naprosyn, Aleve), and others.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\nIf you have diabetes, heart disease, or other medical conditions, your surgeon will ask you to see the provider who treats you for these conditions before your surgery.\nTell your surgeon if you have been drinking a lot of alcohol, more than 1 or 2 drinks a day.\nIf you smoke, try to stop\n. Ask your provider for help."}

Smoking can slow down wound and bone healing.\nAlways let your surgeon know about any cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness you may have before your surgery.\nOn the day of your surgery:\nYou may be asked not to drink or eat anything for 6 to 12 hours before the procedure.\nTake the medicines your surgeon told you to take with a small sip of water.\nYour surgeon or nurse will tell you when to arrive at the hospital.\nAfter the Procedure\nPhysical therapy may begin in the recovery room right\nafter your surgery\n. You will also need to use a machine, called a CPM machine. This machine will gently exercise your leg for 6 to 8 hours a day for several weeks. This machine is most often used for 6 weeks after surgery. Ask your surgeon how long you will use it.\nYour surgeon will increase the exercises you do over time until you can fully move your knee again."}

Keeping the weight off the knee helps the new cartilage grow. Make sure you check with your surgeon to find out how much weight you can put on your leg and for how long.\nYou will need to go to physical therapy and do exercises at home for 3 to 6 months after surgery.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMany people do well after this surgery. Recovery time can be slow. Many people can go back to sports or other intense activities in about 9 to 12 months. Athletes in very intense sports may not be able to return to their former level.\nPeople under age 40 with a recent injury often have the best results."}
