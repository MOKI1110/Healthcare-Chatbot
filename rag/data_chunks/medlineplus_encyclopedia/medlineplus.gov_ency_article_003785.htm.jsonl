Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nOrbit CT scan\nOrbit CT scan\ncomputed tomography (CT) scan\nof the orbit is an imaging method. It uses x-rays to create detailed pictures of the eye sockets (orbits), eyes and surrounding bones.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou will be asked to lie on a narrow table that slides into the center of the CT scanner. Only your head is placed inside the CT scanner.\nYou may lie on your back, or you may lie face-down with your chin raised. You may be allowed to rest your head on a pillow.\nOnce you are inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you, but you won't see the x-ray.\nA computer creates separate images of the body area, called slices. These images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, or printed on film. The computer can create three-dimensional models of the body area by stacking the slices together.\nYou must lie still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images. You may be asked to hold your breath for short periods. You may be asked to remove jewelry and earrings.\nThe actual scan takes about 30 seconds."}

You may be asked to hold your breath for short periods. You may be asked to remove jewelry and earrings.\nThe actual scan takes about 30 seconds. The entire process takes about 15 minutes.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nBefore the test:\nYou will be asked to remove jewelry and wear a hospital gown during the study.\nIf you weigh more than 300 pounds (135 kilograms), find out if the CT machine has a weight limit. Too much weight can cause damage to the scanner's working parts or injury to the person.\nCertain exams require a special dye, called contrast, to be delivered into the body before the test starts. Contrast helps certain areas show up better on the x-rays. Contrast can be given through a vein (intravenous - IV) in your hand or forearm.\nBefore a scan using contrast, it is important to know the following:\nYou may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.\nLet your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test in order to safely receive this substance.\nTell your provider if you take the diabetes medicine metformin (Glucophage)."}

You may need to take extra precautions.\nLet your provider know if you have poor kidney function. This is because the contrast can worsen kidney function.\nHow the Test will Feel\nSome people may have discomfort from lying on the hard table.\nContrast given through an IV may cause a slight burning sensation. You may also have a metallic taste in the mouth and a warm flushing of the body. These sensations are normal and most often go away within a few seconds.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is helpful for diagnosing diseases that affect the following areas around the eyes:\nBlood vessels\nEye muscles\nNerves supplying the eyes (optic nerves)\nSinuses\nAn orbit CT scan may also be used to detect:\nAbscess (infection) of the eye area\nBroken eye socket bone\nForeign object in the eye socket\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may mean:\nBleeding\nBroken eye socket bone\nGraves disease\nInfection\nTumor\nRisks\nCT scans and other x-rays are strictly monitored and controlled to make sure they use"}

The risk associated with any individual scan is very low. The risk increases as more scans are done.\nCT scans are done when the benefits greatly outweigh the risks. For example, it can be more risky not to have the exam, especially if your provider thinks you might have cancer or a fracture.\nThe most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine.\nIf a person with an iodine allergy is given this type of contrast, nausea, sneezing, vomiting, itching, or hives may occur.\nIf you have a known allergy to contrast but need it for a successful exam, you may receive antihistamines (such as Benadryl) or steroids before the test.\nThe kidneys help filter the iodine out of the body. If you have kidney disease or diabetes, you should be closely monitored for kidney problems after contrast is given."}

If you have kidney disease or diabetes, talk to your provider before the test to know your risks.\nBefore receiving the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes medicine metformin (Glucophage) because you may need to take extra precautions. You may need to stop the medicine for 48 hours after the test.\nIn rare cases, the dye can cause a life-threatening allergic response called anaphylaxis. If you have any trouble breathing during the test, tell the scanner operator right away. Scanners come with an intercom and speakers, so the operator can hear you at all times.\nAlternative Names\nCT scan - orbital; Eye CT scan; Computed tomography scan - orbit\nImages\nCT scan\nReferences\nCampion T, Miszkiel K, Davagnanam I.
