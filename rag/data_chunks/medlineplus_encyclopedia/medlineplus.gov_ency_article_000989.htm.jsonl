It occurs in children.\nCauses\nKawasaki disease occurs most often in Japan, where it was first discovered. The disease is seen more often in boys than in girls. Most of the children who develop this condition are younger than age 5.\nKawasaki disease is not well understood and the cause is yet unknown. It may be an\nautoimmune disorder\n. The problem affects the mucous membranes, lymph nodes, walls of the blood vessels, and the heart.\nSymptoms\nKawasaki disease often begins with a\nfever\nof 102 °F (38.9 °C) or higher that does not go away. The fever is often as high as 104 °F (40 °C). A fever lasting at least 5 days is a common sign of the disorder. The fever may last for up to 2 weeks."}

The fever often does not come down with normal doses of acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen.\nOther symptoms often include:\nBloodshot or red eyes (without pus or drainage)\nBright red, chapped, or cracked lips\nRed mucous membranes in the mouth\n\"Strawberry\" tongue, with white coating on the tongue, or visible red bumps on the back of the tongue\nRed, swollen palms of the hands and the soles of the feet\nSkin rashes\non the middle of the body, not blister-like\nPeeling skin in the genital area, hands, and feet (mostly around the nails, palms, and soles)\nSwollen lymph nodes\nin the neck (often only one lymph node is swollen)\nJoint pain\nand swelling, often on both sides of the body\nAdditional symptoms may include:\nIrritability\nDiarrhea\n,\nvomiting\n, and\nabdominal pain\nCough\nand\nrunny nose\nExams and Tests\nTests alone cannot diagnose Kawasaki disease."}

Most of the time, the health care provider will diagnose the disease when a child has most of the common symptoms.\nIn some cases, a child may have a fever that lasts more than 5 days, but not all the common symptoms of the disease. These children may be diagnosed with atypical Kawasaki disease.\nAll children with fever lasting more than 5 days should be checked for Kawasaki disease by a provider. Children with the disease need early treatment for a good outcome.\nThe following tests may be done:\nChest x-ray\nComplete blood count\nC-reactive protein\n(CRP)\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR\n)\nFerritin\nSerum albumin\nSerum transaminase\nUrinalysis\n- may show pus in the urine or\nprotein in the urine\nThroat culture\nfor streptococcus\nEchocardiogram\nElectrocardiogram\nTests such as ECG and echocardiography are done to look for signs of\nmyocarditis\n,\npericarditis\n, and inflammation of the coronary arteries.\nArthritis\nand aseptic meningitis can also occur.\nTreatment\nChildren with Kawasaki disease nee"}

Treatment must be started right away to prevent damage to the coronary arteries and heart.\nIntravenous gamma globulin is the standard treatment. It is given in high doses as a single infusion. The child's condition often gets much better within 24 hours of treatment with IV gamma globulin.\nHigh-dose aspirin is often given along with IV gamma globulin.\nEven with standard treatment, up to 1 in 4 children may still develop problems in their coronary arteries. In sicker children or those with signs of heart disease, adding corticosteroids is recommended. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors such as infliximab (Remicade) or etanercept (Enbrel) are not recommended for initial treatment. However, there still needs to be better tests to tell which children will benefit from these medicines.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost children can recover fully when the disease is caught and treated early. About 1 in 100 children die from heart problems caused by the disease."}

About 1 in 100 children die from heart problems caused by the disease. People who have had Kawasaki disease should have an echocardiogram every 1 to 2 years to check for heart problems.\nPossible Complications\nKawasaki disease can cause inflammation of blood vessels in the arteries, especially the coronary arteries. This can lead to aneurysm. Rarely, it can lead to a heart attack at a young age or later in life.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nCall your provider if symptoms of Kawasaki disease develop. Cracked, red lips and swelling and redness develop in the affected areas such as the palms and soles of the feet."}
