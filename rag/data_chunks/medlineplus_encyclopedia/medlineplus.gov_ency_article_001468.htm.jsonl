Hypermobile EDS is the most common type (90% of cases). Other forms include the classic and vascular forms.\nA variety of gene variations cause problems with collagen. This is the material that provides strength and structure to:\nSkin\nBone\nBlood vessels\nInternal organs\nThe variant collagen leads to the symptoms associated with EDS."}

Individual problems and symptoms are evaluated and cared for appropriately. Physical therapy or an evaluation by a specialist in rehabilitation medicine is often needed.\nSupport Groups\nMore information and support for people with Ehlers-Danlos and their families can be found at:\nThe Ehlers-Danlos Society --\nwww.ehlers-danlos.com/support/\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nPeople with EDS generally have a normal life span.
