Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCMV retinitis\nCMV retinitis\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis is a viral infection of the retina of the eye resulting in inflammation.\nCauses\nCMV is a member of a group of herpes-type viruses. Infection with CMV is very common. Most people are exposed to CMV in their lifetime, but typically only those with weakened immune systems become ill from CMV infection.\nSerious CMV infections can occur in people who have weakened immune systems as a result of:\nHIV/AIDS\nBone marrow transplantation\nChemotherapy\nMedicines that suppress the immune system\nOrgan transplant\nSymptoms\nSome people with CMV retinitis have no symptoms.\nIf there are symptoms, they may include:\nBlind spots\nBlurred vision and other vision problems\nFloaters\nRetinitis usually begins in one eye, but often progresses to the other eye. Without treatment, damage to the retina can lead to blindness in 4 to 6 months or less.\nExams and Tests\nCMV retinitis is diagnosed through an ophthalmologic exam."}

Without treatment, damage to the retina can lead to blindness in 4 to 6 months or less.\nExams and Tests\nCMV retinitis is diagnosed through an ophthalmologic exam. Dilation of the pupils and\nophthalmoscopy\nwill show signs of CMV retinitis.\nCMV infection may be diagnosed with blood or urine tests that look for substances specific to the infection. However, an infection may be present even with a negative blood or urine test. CMV can affect specific organs, such as the retina or gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and blood and urine tests can be negative. A tissue\nbiopsy\ncan detect the viral infection and presence of CMV virus particles, but this may be done only for some organs (GI tract) and not others (eyes).\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to stop the virus from replicating and to stabilize or restore vision and prevent blindness. Long-term treatment is often needed. Medicines may be given by mouth (orally), through a vein (intravenously), or injected directly into the eye (intravitreously).\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nEven with treatment, the disease can worsen to blindness."}

This progression may happen because the virus becomes resistant to the antiviral medicines so the medicines are no longer effective, or because the person's immune system has deteriorated further.\nCMV retinitis may also lead to\nretinal detachment\n, in which the retina detaches from the back of the eye, causing blindness.\nPossible Complications\nComplications that may result include:\nKidney function impairment (from medicines used to treat the condition)\nLow\nwhite blood cell count\n(from medicines used to treat the condition)\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIf symptoms worsen or do not improve with treatment, or if new symptoms develop, contact your health care provider.\nPeople with HIV/AIDS (especially those with a very low CD4 count) who have vision problems should make an appointment right away for an eye exam.\nPrevention\nA CMV infection usually only causes symptoms in people with a weakened immune system."}

Certain medicines (such as cancer therapy) and diseases (such as HIV/AIDS) can cause a weakened immune system.\nPeople with AIDS who have a CD4 count of less than 250 cells/microliter (cells/ µL) or 250 cells/cubic millimeter (cells/mm\n3\n) should be examined regularly for this condition, even if they do not have symptoms.
