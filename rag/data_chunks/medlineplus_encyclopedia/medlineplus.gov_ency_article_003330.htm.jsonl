Most often, you will lie on your back with your arms raised above your head.\nOnce you are inside the scanner, the machine's x-ray beam rotates around you. Modern spiral scanners can perform the exam without stopping. There is very little noise.\nA computer creates separate images of the body area, called slices. These images can be stored, viewed on a monitor, or copied to a disk. Three-dimensional models of the body area can be created by stacking the slices together.\nYou must stay still during the exam, because movement causes blurred images. You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time.\nComplete scans most often take only a few minutes."}

You may be told to hold your breath for short periods of time.\nComplete scans most often take only a few minutes. The newest scanners can image your entire body in less than 30 seconds.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nCertain exams require a special dye, called contrast, to be delivered into your body before the test starts. Contrast helps certain areas show up better on the x-rays.\nLet your health care provider know if you have ever had a reaction to contrast. You may need to take medicines before the test in order to avoid another reaction.\nContrast can be given several ways, depending on the type of CT being performed.\nIt may be delivered through a vein (IV) in your hand or forearm.\nYou might drink the contrast before your scan. When you drink the contrast depends on the type of exam being done. The contrast liquid may taste chalky, although some are flavored."}

When you drink the contrast depends on the type of exam being done. The contrast liquid may taste chalky, although some are flavored. The contrast passes out of your body through your stools.\nRarely, the contrast may be given into your rectum using an enema.\nIf contrast is used, you may also be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 to 6 hours before the test.\nBefore receiving the contrast, tell your provider if you take the diabetes medicine metformin (Glucophage). People taking this medicine may have to stop taking it for a while before the test.\nLet your provider know if you have any kidney problems. The IV contrast can worsen kidney function.\nFind out if the CT machine has a weight limit if you weigh more than 300 pounds (136 kilograms). Too much weight can damage the scanner.\nYou will need to remove jewelry and wear a gown during the study.\nHow the Test will Feel\nSome people may have discomfort from lying on the hard table.\nContrast given through an IV may cause a slight burning feeling, a metallic taste in the mouth, and a warm flushing of the body."}

These sensations are normal and usually go away within a few seconds.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA CT scan creates detailed pictures of the body, including the brain, chest, spine, and abdomen. The test may be used to:\nDiagnose an infection\nGuide a doctor to the right area during a biopsy\nIdentify masses and tumors, including cancer\nStudy blood vessels\nNormal Results\nResults are considered normal if the organs and structures being examined are normal in appearance.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results depend on the part of the body being studied. Talk to your provider about questions and concerns.\nRisks\nRisks of having CT scans include:\nAllergic reaction to the contrast dye\nDamage to kidney function from the contrast dye\nExposure to radiation\nCT scans expose you to more radiation than regular\nx-rays\n. Having many x-rays or CT scans over time may increase your risk for cancer. However, the risk from any one scan is small."}

Having many x-rays or CT scans over time may increase your risk for cancer. However, the risk from any one scan is small. You and your provider should weigh this risk against the value of the information that will come from a CT scan. Most new CT scan machines have the ability to reduce the radiation dose.\nSome people have allergies to contrast dye. Let your provider know if you have ever had an allergic reaction to injected contrast dye.\nThe most common type of contrast given into a vein contains iodine. If you have an iodine allergy, contrast may cause\nnausea or vomiting\n,\nsneezing\n,\nitching\n, or\nhives\n.\nIf you absolutely must be given such contrast, your provider may give you antihistamines (such as Benadryl) or steroids before the test.\nYour kidneys help remove iodine from the body. You may need to receive extra fluids after the test to help flush iodine out of your body if you have diabetes or kidney disease.\nRarely, the dye may cause a life-threatening allergic response called\nanaphylaxis\n. If you have any trouble breathing during the test, tell the scanner operator immediately."}
