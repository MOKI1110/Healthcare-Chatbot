They may be found on the penis,\nvulva\n, urethra, vagina, cervix, and around and in the anus.\nGenital warts are spread through sexual contact.\nCauses\nThe virus that causes genital warts is called human papillomavirus (HPV). HPV infection is the most common sexually transmitted infection (STI). There are more than 180 types of HPV. Many cause no problems. Some cause warts on other parts of the body and not the genitals. Types 6 and 11 are most commonly linked to genital warts.\nCertain other types of HPV can lead to\nprecancerous changes in the cervix\n, or to\ncervical cancer\n. These are called high-risk types of HPV. They can also lead to\nvaginal\nor\nvulvar\ncancer, anal cancer, and\nthroat\nor\nmouth\ncancer.\nImportant facts about HPV:\nHPV infection spreads from one person to another through sexual contact involving the anus, mouth, or vagina."}

The virus can be spread, even if you do not see the warts.\nYou may not see warts for 6 weeks to 6 months after becoming infected. You may not notice them for years.\nNot everyone who has come into contact with the HPV virus and genital warts will develop them.\nYou are more likely to get genital warts and spread them more quickly if you:\nHave multiple sexual partners\nAre sexually active at an early age\nUse tobacco or alcohol\nHave a viral infection, such as herpes, and are stressed at the same time\nAre pregnant\nHave a weakened immune system due to a condition such as diabetes, HIV/AIDS, or from medicines\nIf a child has genital warts, sexual abuse should be suspected as a possible cause.\nSymptoms\nGenital warts can be so tiny, you cannot see them.\nThe warts can look like:\nFlesh-colored spots that are raised or flat\nGrowths that look like the top of a cauliflower\nIn females, genital warts can be found:\nInside the vagina or anus\nOutside the vagina or anus, or on nearby skin\nOn the cervix insi"}

In women, this includes a pelvic exam.\nAn office procedure called\ncolposcopy\nis used to spot warts that cannot be seen with the naked eye. It uses a light and a low-power microscope to help your provider find and then take samples (\nbiopsy\n) of abnormal areas in your cervix. Colposcopy is usually done in response to an abnormal Pap test.\nHPV can cause abnormal results on a\nPap test\n. If you have these types of changes, you may need more frequent Pap tests or a colposcopy.\nAn\nHPV DNA\ntest can tell if you have a high-risk type of HPV known to cause cervical cancer."}

Do not use over-the-counter medicines meant for other kinds of warts.\nTreatment may include:\nMedicines applied to the genital warts or injected by your provider\nPrescription medicine that you apply at home several times a week\nThe warts may also be removed with minor procedures, including:\nFreezing (\ncryosurgery\n)\nBurning (\nelectrocauterization\n)\nLaser therapy\nSurgery\nIf you have genital warts, all of your sexual partners should be examined by a provider and treated if warts are found.
