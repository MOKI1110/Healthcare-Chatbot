Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRenal perfusion scintiscan\nRenal perfusion scintiscan\nA renal perfusion scintiscan is a\nnuclear medicine test\n. It uses a small amount of a radioactive substance to create an image of the kidneys.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYou may be asked to take a blood pressure medicine called an ACE inhibitor, most often a medicine called captopril. The drug may be taken by mouth, or given through a vein (IV). The medicine makes the test more accurate.\nYou will lie down on the scanner table shortly after taking the medicine. Your health care provider will inject a small amount of radioactive material (radioisotope) into one of your veins. Images of your kidneys are taken as the radioactive material flows through the arteries in the area. You will need to remain still for the entire test. The scan takes about 30 minutes.\nAbout 10 minutes after you receive the radioactive material, you will be given a diuretic (\"water pill\") through a vein. This medicine also helps make the test more accurate.\nYou can return to normal activities right after the test."}

You should drink plenty of fluids to help remove the radioactive material from your body. The test will make you urinate more frequently for several hours after the test.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will be asked to drink plenty of water before the test.\nIf you are currently taking an ACE inhibitor for\nhigh blood pressure\n, you may be asked to stop taking your medicine before the exam. Always talk to your provider before you stop any of your medicines.\nYou may be asked to wear a hospital gown. Remove all jewelry and metallic objects before the scan.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel a small amount of pain when the needle is inserted.\nYou must remain still during the scan. You will be told when you need to change positions.\nThere may be some discomfort as your bladder fills with urine during the exam. Tell the person conducting the exam if you must urinate before the scan is complete.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test evaluates blood flow to the kidneys."}

Tell the person conducting the exam if you must urinate before the scan is complete.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThe test evaluates blood flow to the kidneys. It is used to diagnose narrowing of the arteries that supply the kidneys. This is a condition called\nrenal artery stenosis\n. Significant renal artery stenosis may be a cause of high blood pressure and kidney problems.\nNormal Results\nBlood flow to the kidneys appears normal.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal findings on the scan may be a sign of renal artery stenosis. A similar test that does not use an ACE inhibitor can be done to confirm the diagnosis.\nRisks\nIf you are pregnant or nursing, your provider may want to postpone the test. Pregnant women should not take ACE inhibitors.\nThe amount of radioactivity in the injection is very small. Nearly all radioactivity is gone from the body within 24 hours.\nReactions to the materials used during this test are rare, but may include rash, swelling, or\nanaphylaxis\n.\nRisks of a needle stick are slight, but include infection and bleeding.\nConsiderations\nThis test may be less accurate in people who already have kidney disease."}
