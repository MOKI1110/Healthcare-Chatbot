When the placenta does not work as well as it should, your baby can get less oxygen and nutrients from you. As a result, your baby may:\nNot grow well\nShow signs of fetal stress (this means the baby's heart does not work normally)\nHave a harder time during labor\nCauses\nThe placenta may not work well, either due to pregnancy problems or social habits. These may include:\nDiabetes\nGoing past your due date\nHigh blood pressure during pregnancy (called\npreeclampsia\n)\nMedical conditions that increase the mother's chances of blood clots\nSmoking\nTaking cocaine or other illicit drugs\nAnemia\nCertain medicines can also increase the risk for placental insufficiency.\nIn some cases, the placenta:\nMay have an abnormal shape\nMay not grow big enough (more likely if you are carrying twins or other multiples)\nDoes not attach correctly to the surface of the womb\nBreaks away from the surface of the womb or bleeds prematurely\nSymptoms\nA woman with placental insufficiency usual"}

However, certain diseases, such as preeclampsia, which can be symptomatic, can cause placental insufficiency.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will measure the size of your growing womb (uterus) at each visit, starting about halfway through your pregnancy.\nIf your uterus is not growing as expected, a\npregnancy ultrasound\nwill be done. This test will measure your baby's size and growth, and assess the size and placement of the placenta.\nOther times, problems with the placenta or your baby's growth may be found on a routine ultrasound that is done during your pregnancy.\nEither way, your provider will order tests to check how your baby is doing. The tests may show that your baby is active and healthy, and the amount of amniotic fluid is normal."}

Sometimes you may need to get more rest. You will have tests often to make sure your baby is doing well. Treating high blood pressure or diabetes may also help improve your baby's growth.\nIf your pregnancy is over 37 weeks or tests show your baby is not doing well, your provider may want to deliver your baby.
