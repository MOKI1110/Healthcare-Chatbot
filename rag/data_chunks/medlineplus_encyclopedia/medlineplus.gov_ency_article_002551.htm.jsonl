It is used to relieve pain and swelling associated with certain types of arthritis. Sulindac overdose occurs when someone takes more than the recommended amount of this medicine. People with kidney or liver disease are more likely to develop serious side effects or worsening of their disease from NSAIDs.\nAs a group, and because of their common use, NSAIDs are responsible for more serious drug-related side effects than any other class of pain-relieving drugs.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose."}
