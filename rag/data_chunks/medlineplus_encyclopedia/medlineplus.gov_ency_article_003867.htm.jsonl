It is used to evaluate abnormal heartbeats or\nheart rhythms\n.\nHow the Test is Performed\nWire electrodes are placed in the heart to do this test. These electrodes measure electrical activity in the heart.\nThe procedure is done in a hospital laboratory. The staff will include a cardiologist (heart doctor), technicians, and nurses.\nTo have this study:\nYour groin and/or neck area will be cleaned and numbing medicine (anesthetic) will be applied to the skin.\nThe cardiologist will then place several IVs (called sheaths) into your groin or neck area."}

Once these IVs are in place, wires or electrodes can be passed through the sheaths into your body.\nThe doctor uses moving x-ray images (fluoroscopy) to guide the catheter into the heart and place the electrodes in the right places.\nThe electrodes pick up the heart's electrical signals.\nElectrical signals from the electrodes may be used to make the heart skip beats or produce an abnormal heart rhythm. This can help the doctor understand more about what is causing the abnormal heart rhythm or where in the heart it is starting.\nYou may also be given medicines that may also be used for the same purpose.\nOther procedures that may also be done during the test:\nPlacement of a heart\npacemaker\nProcedure to modify small areas in your heart that may be causing your heart rhythm problems (called\ncatheter ablation\n)\nWatch this video about:\nCardiac conduction system\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou will be told not to eat or drink for 6 to 8 hours before the test.\nYou will wear a hospital gown."}

You must sign a consent form for the procedure.\nYour health care provider will tell you ahead of time if you need to make changes to the medicines you regularly take. Do not stop taking or change any medicines without first talking to your provider.\nIn most cases, you will be given medicine to help you feel calm before the procedure. The test can last from 1 hour up to several hours. You may not be able to drive home afterward, so you should plan for someone to drive you.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou will be awake during the test. You may feel some discomfort when the IV is placed into your arm. You may also feel some pressure at the site when the catheter is inserted."}

You may feel your heart skipping beats or racing at times.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may order this test if you have signs of an abnormal heart rhythm (\narrhythmia\n).\nYou may need to have other tests before this study is done.\nAn EPS may be done to:\nTest the function of your heart's electrical system\nPinpoint a known abnormal heart rhythm (arrhythmia) that is starting in the heart\nDecide the best therapy for an abnormal heart rhythm\nDetermine whether you are at risk for future heart events, especially sudden cardiac death\nSee if medicine is controlling an abnormal heart rhythm\nSee whether you need a pacemaker or\nimplantable cardioverter-defibrillator\n(ICD)\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results may be due to abnormal heart rhythms that are too slow or too fast."}
