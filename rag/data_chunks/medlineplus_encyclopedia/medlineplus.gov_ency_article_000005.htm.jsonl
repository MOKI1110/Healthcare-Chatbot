They can be breathed into the lungs, swallowed, or injected.\nConsiderations\nAllergic reactions are common. The immune response that causes an allergic reaction is similar to the response that causes hay fever. Most reactions happen soon after contact with an allergen.\nMany allergic reactions are mild, while others can be severe and life threatening. They can be confined to a small area of the body, or they may affect the entire body. The most severe form is called\nanaphylaxis\nor anaphylactic shock. Allergic reactions occur more often in people who have a family history of\nallergies\n.\nSubstances that don't bother most people (such as venom from\nbee stings\nand certain foods, medicines, and pollens) can trigger allergic reactions in certain people.\nFirst-time exposure may produce only a mild reaction. Repeated exposures may lead to more serious reactions."}

Repeated exposures may lead to more serious reactions. Once a person has had an exposure or an allergic reaction (and thus is sensitized to an allergen), even a very limited exposure to a very small amount of allergen can trigger a severe reaction.\nMost severe allergic reactions occur within seconds or minutes after exposure to the allergen. Some reactions can occur after several hours. In very rare cases, reactions develop after 24 hours.\nAnaphylaxis is a sudden and severe allergic reaction that occurs within minutes or hours of exposure. Immediate medical attention is needed for this condition."}

For a mild reaction, a health care provider may recommend over-the-counter medicines, such as antihistamines.\nFor a severe allergic reaction (anaphylaxis):\nCheck the person's airway, breathing, and circulation (the ABC's of Basic Life Support). A warning sign of dangerous throat swelling is a very hoarse or whispered voice, or coarse sounds when the person is breathing in air.
