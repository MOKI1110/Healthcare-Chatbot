Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nRuptured eardrum\nRuptured eardrum\nA ruptured eardrum is an opening or hole in the eardrum. The eardrum is a thin piece of tissue that separates the outer and middle ear. Damage to the eardrum may harm hearing.\nCauses\nEar infections may cause a ruptured eardrum. This occurs more often in children. The infection causes pus or fluid to build up behind the eardrum. As the pressure increases, the eardrum may break open (rupture).\nDamage to the eardrum can also occur from:\nA very loud noise close to the ear\n, such as a gunshot\nA rapid change in ear pressure\n, which may occur when flying, scuba diving, or driving in the mountains\nForeign objects in the ear\nInjury to the ear (such as from a powerful slap or explosion)\nInserting cotton-tipped swabs or small objects into the ears to clean them\nSymptoms\nEar pain may suddenly decrease right after your eardrum ruptures.\nAfter the rupture, you may have:\nDrainage from the ear\n(drainage may be clear, pus, or bloody)\nEar noise/buzzing  (\ntinnitus\n)\nEarache or ear discomfort\nHearing loss\nin the involved ear (hearing loss may"}

Sometimes they will need to use a microscope for a better view. If your eardrum is ruptured, the provider will see an opening in it. The bones of the middle ear may also be visible.\nPus draining from the ear may make it harder for the provider to see the eardrum."}

If pus is present and blocking the view of the eardrum, the provider may need to suction the ear to clear the pus.\nAudiology\ntesting can measure how much hearing has been lost.\nTreatment\nYou can take steps at home to treat ear pain.\nPut warm compresses on the ear to help relieve discomfort.\nUse medicines such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen to ease pain.\nKeep the ear clean and dry while it is healing.\nPlace cotton balls in the ear while showering or shampooing to prevent water from entering the ear.\nAvoid swimming or putting your head underneath the water.\nYour provider may prescribe antibiotics (oral or ear drops) to prevent or treat an infection.\nRepair of the eardrum\nmight be needed for larger holes or ruptures or if the eardrum does not heal on its own. This can be done either in the office or under anesthesia.\nOptions may include:\nPatch the eardrum with a piece of the person's own tissue taken (called\ntympanoplasty\n)."}

This procedure will usually take 10 to 30 minutes.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe opening in the eardrum most often heals by itself within 2 months if it is a small hole.\nHearing loss will be short-term if the rupture heals completely.\nRarely, other problems may occur, such as:\nLong-term hearing loss\nSpread of infection to the bone behind the ear (mastoiditis)\nLong-term\nvertigo\nand dizziness\nChronic ear infection or ear drainage\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nIf your pain and symptoms improve after your eardrum ruptures, you may wait until the next day to see your provider.\nContact your provider right away after your eardrum ruptures if you:\nAre very dizzy\nHave a fever, general ill feeling, or hearing loss\nHave very bad pain or a loud ringing in your ear\nHave an object in your ear that does not come out\nHave any s"}
