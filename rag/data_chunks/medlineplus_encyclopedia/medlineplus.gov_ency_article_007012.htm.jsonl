Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHeart bypass surgery - minimally invasive\nHeart bypass surgery - minimally invasive\nHeart bypass surgery creates a new route, called a bypass, for blood and oxygen to reach your heart.\nMinimally invasive coronary (heart) artery bypass can be done without stopping the heart. Therefore, you do not need to be put on a heart-lung machine for this procedure.\nDescription\nTo perform this surgery:\nThe heart surgeon will make a 3- to 5-inch (8 to 13 centimeters) surgical cut in the left part of your chest between your ribs to reach your heart.\nMuscles in the area will be pushed apart. A small part of the front of the rib, called the costal cartilage, will be removed.\nThe surgeon will then find and prepare an artery on your chest wall (internal mammary artery) to attach to your coronary artery that is blocked.\nNext, the surgeon will use sutures to connect the prepared chest artery to the coronary artery that is blocked.\nYou will not be on a heart-lung machine for this surgery."}

However, you will have general anesthesia so you will be asleep and not feel pain. A device will be attached to your heart to stabilize it. You will also receive medicine to slow the heart down.\nYou may have a tube in your chest for drainage of fluid. This will be removed in a day or two.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nYour health care provider may recommend a minimally invasive coronary artery bypass if you have a blockage in one or two coronary arteries, most often in the front of the heart.\nWhen one or more of the coronary arteries become partly or totally blocked, your heart does not get enough blood. This is called ischemic heart disease or coronary artery disease. It can cause chest pain (\nangina\n).\nYour provider may have first tried to treat you with medicines. You may have also tried cardiac rehabilitation or other treatments, such as angioplasty with stenting.\nCoronary artery disease varies from person to person. Heart bypass surgery is just one type of treatment."}

In general, the complications of minimally invasive coronary artery bypass are lower than with open coronary artery bypass surgery.\nRisks related to any surgery include:\nBlood clots in the legs that may travel to the lungs\nBlood loss\nBreathing problems\nHeart attack or stroke\nInfection of the lungs, urinary tract, and chest\nTemporary or permanent brain injury\nPossible risks of coronary artery bypass include:\nMemory loss, loss of mental clarity, or \"fuzzy thinking.\" This is less common in people who have minimally invasive coronary artery bypass than in people who have open coronary bypass.\nHeart rhythm problems (arrhythmia).\nA chest wound infection."}

This is more likely to happen if you are obese, have diabetes, or have had coronary bypass surgery in the past.\nLow-grade fever and chest pain (together called postpericardiotomy syndrome), which can last up to 6 months.\nPain at the site of the cut.\nPossible need to convert to conventional procedure with bypass machine during surgery.\nBefore the Procedure\nAlways tell your surgeon what medicines you are taking, even drugs or herbs you bought without a prescription.\nDuring the days before the surgery:\nFor the 2-week period before surgery, you may be asked to stop taking medicines that make it harder for your blood to clot. These might cause increased bleeding during the surgery. They include aspirin, ibuprofen (such as Advil and Motrin), naproxen (such as Aleve and Naprosyn), and other similar drugs."}

Ask your provider for help.\nContact your provider if you have a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or any other illness.\nPrepare your home\nso you can move around easily when you return from the hospital.\nThe day before your surgery:\nShower and shampoo well.\nYou may be asked to wash your whole body below your neck with a special soap. Scrub your chest 2 or 3 times with this soap.\nOn the day of the surgery:\nYou will most often be asked not to drink or eat anything after midnight the night before your surgery. This includes chewing gum and using breath mints."}

The surgeon or nurse will tell you\nhow to care for yourself at home\n. You may be able to return to normal activities after 2 or 3 weeks.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nRecovery from surgery takes time, and you may not see the full benefits of your surgery for 3 to 6 months.
