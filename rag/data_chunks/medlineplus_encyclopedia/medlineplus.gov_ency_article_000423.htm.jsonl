It is due to aging and wear and tear on a joint.\nCauses\nCartilage is the firm, rubbery tissue that cushions your bones at the joints. It allows bones to glide over one another when the joint moves. When the cartilage breaks down and wears away, the fragments of the cartilage or the bones rub together. This often causes the pain, swelling, and stiffness of OA.\nAs OA worsens, bony spurs or extra bone may form around the joint. The ligaments and muscles around the joint may become weaker and stiffer.\nBefore age 55, OA occurs equally in men and women. After age 55, it is more common in women.\nOther factors can also lead to OA.\nOA tends to run in families.\nBeing overweight increases the risk for OA in the hip, knee, ankle, and foot joints. This is because extra weight causes more wear and tear.\nFractures or other joint injuries can lead to OA later in life."}

This includes injuries to the cartilage and ligaments in your joints.\nJobs that involve kneeling or squatting for more than an hour a day, or involve lifting, climbing stairs, or walking increase the risk for OA.\nPlaying sports that involve direct impact on the joint (football), twisting (basketball or soccer), or throwing also increase the risk for OA.\nMedical conditions that can lead to OA or symptoms similar to OA include:\nBleeding disorders that cause bleeding in the joint, such as\nhemophilia\nDisorders that block the blood supply near a joint and lead to bone death (\navascular necrosis\n)\nOther types of arthritis, such as long-term (chronic)\ngout\n,\npseudogout\n, or\nrheumatoid arthritis\nWatch this video about:\nOsteoarthritis\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of OA often appear in middle age.

The pain is often worse:\nAfter exercise\nWhen you put weight or pressure on the joint\nWhen you use the joint\nWith OA, your joints may become stiffer and harder to move over time. You may notice a rubbing, grating, or crackling sound when you move the joint.\nMorning stiffness refers to the pain and stiffness you feel when you first wake up in the morning. Stiffness due to OA often lasts for 30 minutes or less. It can last more than 30 minutes if there is inflammation in the joint. It often improves after activity, allowing the joint to warm up.\nDuring the day, the pain may get worse when you are active and feel better when you are resting. As OA gets worse, you may have pain even when you are resting. And it may wake you up at night.\nSome people might not have symptoms, even though x-rays show the physical changes of OA.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you and ask about your symptoms."}

They can be used to look for alternative conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout.\nAn x-ray will likely show:\nLoss of the joint space\nWearing down of the ends of the bone\nBone spurs\nBony changes near the joint, called subchondral cysts\nTreatment\nOA cannot be cured, but OA symptoms can be controlled.

Although these treatments cannot make the OA go away, they can often delay surgery or make your symptoms mild enough to not cause significant problems.\nMEDICINES\nOver-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers\n, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) can help with OA symptoms. You can buy these medicines without a prescription.\nIt is recommended that you should not take more than 3 grams (3,000 milligrams) of acetaminophen a day. If you have liver disease, talk with your provider before taking acetaminophen. Over the counter NSAIDs include aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. Several other NSAIDs are available by prescription."}

Ask your provider to recommend an exercise routine or refer you to a physical therapist. Water exercises, such as swimming, are often helpful.\nOther lifestyle tips include:\nApplying heat or cold to the joint\nEating healthy foods\nGetting enough rest\nLosing weight if you are overweight\nProtecting your joints from injury\nIf the pain from OA gets worse, keeping up with activities may become more difficult or painful."}

Making changes around the home can help take stress off your joints to relieve some of the pain. If your work is causing stress in certain joints, you may need to adjust your work area or change work tasks.\nPHYSICAL THERAPY\nPhysical therapy can help improve muscle strength and the motion of stiff joints as well as your balance. If therapy does not make you feel better after 6 to 12 weeks, then it likely will not be helpful.\nMassage therapy may provide short-term pain relief but does not change the underlying OA process. Make sure you work with a licensed massage therapist who is experienced in working on sensitive joints.\nBRACES\nSplints and braces may help support weakened joints. Some types limit or prevent the joint from moving. Others may shift pressure off one portion of a joint. Use a brace only when your provider or therapist recommends one."}

It is thought that when acupuncture needles stimulate certain points on the body, chemicals that block pain are released. Acupuncture may provide significant pain relief for OA.\nYoga and Tai chi have also shown significant benefit in treating the pain from OA.\nS-adenosylmethionine (SAMe, pronounced Sammy) is a manmade form of a natural chemical in the body.
