Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nThrombocytopenia\nThrombocytopenia\nThrombocytopenia means there is an abnormally low amount of platelets. Platelets are parts of the blood that help blood to clot. This condition is sometimes associated with abnormal bleeding.\nCauses\nThrombocytopenia is often divided into 3 major causes of low platelets:\nNot enough platelets are made in the bone marrow\nIncreased removal of platelets in the bloodstream\nIncreased trapping of platelets in the spleen or liver\nYour bone marrow may not make enough platelets if you have any of the following conditions:\nAplastic anemia\n(disorder in which the bone marrow does not make enough blood cells)\nCancer in the bone marrow, such as\nleukemia\nCirrhosis (liver scarring)\nFolate deficiency\nInfections in the bone marrow (very rare)\nMyelodysplastic syndrome\n(bone marrow does not make enough blood cells or makes defective cells)\nVitamin B12 deficiency\nUse of certain medicines may also lead to a low production of platelets in the bone marrow."}

The most common example is chemotherapy treatment for cancer.\nThe following health situations cause a low number of platelets:\nDisorder in which the proteins that control blood clotting become over active, most often during a serious illness (\ndisseminated intravascular coagulation - DIC\n)\nDrug-induced low platelet count\nEnlarged spleen\nDisorder in which the immune system destroys platelets (\nimmune thrombocytopenic purpura - ITP\n)\nDisorder that causes blood clots to form in small blood vessels, causing a low platelet count (\nthrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura - TTP\n)\nSymptoms\nYou may not have any symptoms. Or you may have general symptoms, such as:\nBleeding in the mouth and gums\nBruising\nNosebleeds\nRash\nOther symptoms depend on the cause.\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about your medical history and symptoms."}

The following tests may be done:\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nBlood clotting tests:\npartial thromboplastin time\n(PTT) and\nprothrombin time\n(PT)\nOther tests that may help diagnose this condition include\nbone marrow aspiration\nor\nbiopsy\n.\nTreatment\nTreatment depends on the cause of the condition. In some cases, a transfusion of platelets may be required to stop or prevent bleeding.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome depends on the disorder causing the low platelet counts.\nPossible Complications\nSevere bleeding (hemorrhage) is the main complication. Bleeding may occur in the brain or gastrointestinal tract.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you experience unexplained bleeding or bruising.\nPrevention\nPrevention depends on the specific cause.\nAlternative Names\nLow platelet count - thrombocytopenia\nReferences\nAbrams CS.
