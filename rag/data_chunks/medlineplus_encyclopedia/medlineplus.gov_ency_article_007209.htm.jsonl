The new meniscus is taken from a person who has died (cadaver) and donated their tissue.\nDescription\nIf your surgeon finds that you are a good candidate for a meniscus transplant, x-rays or an\nMRI\nof your knee are usually taken to size your knee in order to find a meniscus that will fit your knee. The donated meniscus is tested in the lab for any diseases and infection.\nOther surgeries, such as ligament or cartilage repairs, may be done at the time of the meniscus transplant or with a separate surgery.\nYou will likely receive general anesthesia before this surgery. This means you will be asleep and unable to feel pain. Or, you may have regional anesthesia. Your leg and knee area will be numbed so that you do not feel any pain."}

This means you will be asleep and unable to feel pain. Or, you may have regional anesthesia. Your leg and knee area will be numbed so that you do not feel any pain. If you receive regional anesthesia, you will also be given medicine to make you very sleepy during the operation.\nDuring the surgery:\nThe meniscus transplant is usually performed using\nknee arthroscopy\n. The surgeon makes two or three small cuts around your knee. Salt water (saline) will be pumped into your knee to inflate the knee.\nThe arthroscope is inserted into your knee through a small incision. The scope is connected to a video monitor in the operating room.\nThe surgeon inspects the cartilage and ligaments of your knee, confirming that a meniscus transplant is appropriate and that you don't have severe arthritis of the knee.\nThe new meniscus is prepared to fit your knee correctly.\nIf any tissue is left from your old meniscus, it is removed.\nThe new meniscus is inserted into your knee and sutured (sewn) in place. Screws or other devices may be used to hold the meniscus in place.\nAfter the surgery is finished, the incisions are closed. A dressing is placed over the wound."}

During arthroscopy, most surgeons take pictures of the procedure from the video monitor to show you what was found and what was done.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nMenisci are two cartilage rings that are in each knee. One is on the inner side of the knee (medial meniscus) and one is on the outer side (lateral meniscus). When a meniscus is torn, it is commonly removed by knee arthroscopy. Some people can continue to have pain after the meniscus is removed.\nA meniscus transplant places a new meniscus in the knee where the meniscus is missing. This procedure is only done when meniscus tears are so severe that all or nearly all of the meniscus cartilage is torn or has to be removed."}

This includes medicines, supplements, or herbs you bought without a prescription.\nDuring the 2 weeks before your surgery:\nYou may be asked to temporarily stop taking blood thinners."}

Ask your provider for help. Smoking can slow wound and bone healing.\nTell your surgeon if you develop a cold, flu, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness before your surgery.

Be sure to arrive on time.\nAfter the Procedure\nFollow any\ndischarge\nand self-care instructions you are given.\nAfter the surgery, you will probably wear a knee brace for the first 6 weeks. You will need crutches for 6 weeks to prevent putting full weight on your knee. You will likely be able to move the knee right after surgery. Doing so helps prevent stiffness. Pain is usually managed with medicines.\nPhysical therapy can help you regain the motion and strength of your knee. Therapy lasts for between 4 and 6 months.\nHow soon you can return to work depends on your job. It can take from a few weeks to a few months. It can take 6 months to a year to fully return to activities and sports.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMeniscus allograft transplantation is a difficult surgery, and the recovery is hard. But for people who are missing the meniscus and have pain, it can be very successful."}
