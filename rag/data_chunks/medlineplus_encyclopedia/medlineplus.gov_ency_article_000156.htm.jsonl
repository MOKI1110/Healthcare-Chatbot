DVT mainly affects the large veins in the lower leg and thigh, but can occur in other deep veins, such as in the arms and pelvis. DVT most often affects only one side of the body.\nCauses\nDVT is most common in adults over age 60. But it can occur at any age. When a clot breaks off and moves through the bloodstream, it is called an embolism."}

But it can occur at any age. When a clot breaks off and moves through the bloodstream, it is called an embolism. An embolism can get stuck in the blood vessels in the brain, lungs, heart, or another area, leading to severe damage.\nBlood clots\nmay form when something slows or changes the flow of blood in the veins.\nRisk factors include:\nA pacemaker catheter that has been passed through a vein in the groin\nBed rest or sitting in one position for too long, such as plane or car travel\nFamily history of blood clots\nFractures in the pelvis or legs\nGiving birth within the last 6 months\nPregnancy\nObesity\nRecent surgery (most commonly hip, knee, or female pelvic surgery)\nToo many blood cells being made by the bone marrow, causing the blood to be thicker than normal (\npolycythemia vera\n)\nHaving an indwelling (long-term) catheter in a blood vessel\nAge greater than 60\nBlood is more likely to clot in someone who has certain problems or disorders, such as:\nCancer\nCertain\nautoimmune disorders\n, such as\nlupus\nCigarette smoking\nConditions that make it more likely to develop blood clots\nTaking estrogens or birth c"}

This is most likely when you also have one or more of the risk factors listed above.\nSymptoms\nDVT mainly affects the large veins in the lower leg and thigh, most often on one side of the body. The clot can block blood flow and cause:\nRedness of the skin\nSkin that feels warm to the touch\nSwelling (edema) of a leg or arm\nPain or tenderness in a leg or arm\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam."}

However, most people can be treated without staying in the hospital.\nLow molecular weight heparin can be given by injection under your skin once or twice a day. You may not need to stay in the hospital as long, or at all, if you are prescribed this type of heparin.\nOne type of blood-thinning medicine called warfarin (Coumadin or Jantoven) may be started along with heparin. Warfarin is taken by mouth. It takes several days to fully work.\nAnother class of blood thinners are called direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC), including:\nRivaroxaban (Xarelto)\nApixaban (Eliquis)\nDabigatran (Pradaxa)\nEdoxaban (Savaysa)\nThese medicines work in a similar way to heparin and can be used right away in place of heparin. Your provider will decide which medicine is right for you.\nYou will most likely take a blood thinner for at least 3 months."}
