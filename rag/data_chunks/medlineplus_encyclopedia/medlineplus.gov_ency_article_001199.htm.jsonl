Amino acids are the building blocks of all proteins in the body.\nCauses\nHomocystinuria is inherited in families as an\nautosomal recessive\ntrait. This means that the child must inherit a non-working copy of the gene from each parent to be seriously affected.\nPeople with homocystinuria have several physical features in common with\nMarfan syndrome\n, including skeletal and eye changes.\nSymptoms\nNewborn infants appear healthy. Early symptoms, if present, are not obvious.\nSymptoms may occur as mildly delayed development or\nfailure to thrive\n."}

Early symptoms, if present, are not obvious.\nSymptoms may occur as mildly delayed development or\nfailure to thrive\n. Increasing\nvisual problems\nmay lead to diagnosis of this condition.\nOther symptoms include:\nChest deformities (\npectus carinatum\n,\npectus excavatum\n)\nFlush across the cheeks\nHigh arches of the feet\nIntellectual disability\nKnock knees\nLong limbs\nMental disorders\nNearsightedness\nSpidery fingers (\narachnodactyly\n)\nTall, thin build\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider may notice that the child is tall and thin.\nOther signs include:\nCurved spine (\nscoliosis\n)\nDeformity of the chest\nDislocated lens of the eye\nIf there is poor or double vision, an eye doctor (ophthalmologist) will perform a dilated eye exam to look for dislocation of the lens or nearsightedness.\nThere may be a history of blood clots."}

About half of people with the disease respond to\nvitamin B6\n(also known as pyridoxine).\nThose who do respond will need to take vitamin B6, B9 (folate), and B12 supplements for the rest of their lives. Those who do not respond to supplements will need to eat a low-methionine diet. Most will need to be treated with trimethylglycine (a medicine also known as betaine).\nNeither a low-methionine diet nor medicine will improve existing intellectual disability."}

For this reason, some states screen for homocystinuria in all newborns.\nPeople whose blood homocysteine levels continue to rise are at increased risk for blood clots. Clots can cause serious medical problems and shorten lifespan.\nPossible Complications\nMost serious complications occur due to blood clots."}

Lens replacement surgery may be needed.\nIntellectual disability is a serious outcome of the disease. But, it can be reduced if diagnosed early.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your provider if you or a family member shows symptoms of this disorder, especially if you have a family history of homocystinuria.\nPrevention\nGenetic counseling is recommended for people with a family history of homocystinuria who want to have children.
