Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFetal echocardiography\nFetal echocardiography\nFetal echocardiography is a test that uses sound waves (\nultrasound\n) to evaluate the baby's heart for problems before birth.\nHow the Test is Performed\nFetal echocardiography is a test that is done while the baby is still in the womb. It is most often done during the second trimester of pregnancy. This is when a woman is about 18 to 24 weeks pregnant.\nThe procedure is similar to that of a\npregnancy ultrasound\n. You will lie down for the procedure.\nThe test can be performed on your belly (abdominal ultrasound) or through your vagina (\ntransvaginal ultrasound\n).\nIn an abdominal ultrasound, the person performing the test places a clear, water-based gel on your belly. A hand-held probe is moved over the area. The probe sends out sound waves, which bounce off the baby's heart and create a picture of the heart on a computer screen.\nIn a transvaginal ultrasound, a much smaller probe is placed into the vagina."}

A transvaginal ultrasound can be done earlier in the pregnancy and produces a clearer image than an abdominal ultrasound.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThe conducting gel may feel slightly cold and wet. You will not feel the ultrasound waves.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is done to detect a heart problem before the baby is born."}

These include small holes in the heart or mild valve problems. Also, because it may not be possible to see every part of the large blood vessels leading out of the baby's heart, problems in this area may go undetected. It may still be necessary to repeat an ultrasound of the baby's heart following delivery to confirm findings seen on fetal echocardiography and evaluate areas not previously seen clearly.\nIf the health care provider finds a problem in the structure of the heart, a detailed ultrasound may be done to look for other problems with the developing baby.\nReferences\nBernstein D.
