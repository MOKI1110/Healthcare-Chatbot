Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nERCP\nERCP\nERCP is short for endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography. It is a procedure that looks at the bile and pancreatic ducts. It is done through an endoscope.\nBile ducts are the tubes that carry\nbile\nfrom the liver to the gallbladder and small intestine.\nPancreatic ducts are the tubes that carry fluid from the pancreas into the small intestine.\nERCP is used to treat and evaluate stones, tumors, or narrowed areas of the bile and pancreatic ducts.\nDescription\nAn intravenous (IV) line is placed in your arm. You will lie on your stomach or on your left side for the test.\nMedicines to relax or sedate you will be given through the IV.\nSometimes, a spray to numb the throat is also used. A mouth guard will be placed in your mouth to protect your teeth. Dentures must be removed.\nAfter the sedative takes effect, the endoscope is inserted through the mouth."}

It goes through the esophagus (food pipe) and stomach until it reaches the\nduodenum\n(the part of the small intestine that is closest to the stomach).\nYou should not feel discomfort, and may have little memory of the test.\nYou may gag as the tube is passed down your esophagus.\nYou may feel stretching of the ducts as the scope is put in place.\nA thin tube (catheter) is passed through the endoscope and inserted into the tubes (ducts) that lead to the pancreas and gallbladder. A special dye is injected into these ducts, and x-rays are taken."}

This helps the doctor see stones, tumors, and any areas that have become narrowed.\nSpecial instruments can be placed through the endoscope and into the ducts.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nThe procedure is used mostly to treat or diagnose problems of the pancreas or bile ducts that can cause\nabdominal pain\n(most often in the right upper or middle stomach area) and yellowing of the skin and eyes (\njaundice\n).\nERCP may be used to:\nOpen the entry of the ducts into the bowel (sphincterotomy)\nStretch out narrow segments (bile or pancreatic duct strictures)\nRemove or crush gallstones\nDiagnose conditions such as primary biliary cholangitis or sclerosing cholangitis\nTake tissue samples to diagnose a tumor of the pancreas, bile ducts, or gallbladder\nDrain blocked areas\nNote: Imaging tests generally will be done to diagnose the cause of symptoms before an ERCP is done."}

You will sign a consent form.\nRemove all jewelry so that it will not interfere with the\nx-ray\n.\nTell your health care provider if you have allergies to iodine or you have had reactions to other dyes used to take x-rays.\nYou will need to arrange a ride home after the procedure.\nAfter the Procedure\nSomeone will need to drive you home from the hospital.\nThe air that is used to inflate the stomach and bowel during an ERCP procedure can cause some bloating or gas for about 24 hours. After the procedure, you may have a sore throat for the first day."}

Avoid heavy lifting for the first 48 hours.\nYou can treat pain with acetaminophen (Tylenol). DO NOT take aspirin, ibuprofen, or naproxen.
