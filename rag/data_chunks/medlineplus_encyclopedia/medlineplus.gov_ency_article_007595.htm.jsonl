Why get vaccinated?\nHepatitis A vaccine\ncan prevent\nhepatitis A\n.\nHepatitis A\nis a serious liver disease. It is usually spread through close, personal contact with an infected person or when a person unknowingly ingests the virus from objects, food, or drinks that are contaminated by small amounts of stool (poop) from an infected person.\nMost adults with hepatitis A have symptoms, including fatigue, low appetite, stomach pain, nausea, and jaundice (yellow skin or eyes, dark urine, light-colored bowel movements)."}

Most children less than 6 years of age do not have symptoms.\nA person infected with hepatitis A can transmit the disease to other people even if he or she does not have any symptoms of the disease.\nMost people who get hepatitis A feel sick for several weeks, but they usually recover completely and do not have lasting liver damage. In rare cases, hepatitis A can cause liver failure and death; this is more common in people older than 50 years and in people with other liver diseases.\nHepatitis A vaccine has made this disease much less common in the United States.   However, outbreaks of hepatitis A among unvaccinated people still happen.\n2. Hepatitis A vaccine\nChildren\nneed 2 doses of hepatitis A vaccine:\nFirst dose: 12 through 23 months of age\nSecond dose: at least 6 months after the first dose\nInfants 6 through 11 months old\ntraveling outside the United States when protection against hepatitis A is recommended should receive 1 dose of hepatitis A vaccine."}

Talk with your health care provider\nTell your vaccination provider if the person getting the vaccine:\nHas had an allergic reaction after a previous dose of hepatitis A vaccine, or has any severe, life-threatening allergies\nIn some cases, your health care provider may decide to postpone hepatitis A vaccination until a future visit.\nPregnant or breastfeeding women should be vaccinated if they are at risk for getting hepatitis A. Pregnancy or breastfeeding are not reasons to avoid hepatitis A vaccination.\nPeople with minor illnesses, such as a cold, may be vaccinated. People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting hepatitis A vaccine.\nYour health care provider can give you more information.\n4.

Tell your provider if you feel dizzy or have vision changes or ringing in the ears.\nAs with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction, other serious injury, or death.\n5. What if there is a serious problem?\nAn allergic reaction could occur after the vaccinated person leaves the clinic. If you see signs of a severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, or weakness), call 9-1-1 and get the person to the nearest hospital.\nFor other signs that concern you, call your health care provider.\nAdverse reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). Your health care provider will usually file this report, or you can do it yourself. Visit the VAERS website at\nwww.vaers.hhs.gov\nor call\n1-800-822-7967\n.\nVAERS is only for reporting reactions, and VAERS staff members do not give medical advice.\n6."}
