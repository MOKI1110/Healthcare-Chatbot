Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nABO incompatibility\nABO incompatibility\nA, B, AB, and O are the 4 major blood types. The types are based on small substances (molecules) on the surface of the blood cells.\nWhen people who have  one blood type receive blood from someone with a different blood type, it may cause their immune system to react. This is called ABO incompatibility.\nDue to modern testing techniques, this problem is very rare.\nCauses\nThe different blood types are:\nType A\nType B\nType AB\nType O\nPeople who have one blood type may form proteins (\nantibodies\n) that cause their immune system to react against one or more of the other blood types.\nBeing exposed to another type of blood can cause a reaction. This is important when someone needs to receive a blood transfusion or have an organ transplant."}

This is important when someone needs to receive a blood transfusion or have an organ transplant. The blood types must be compatible to avoid an ABO incompatibility reaction.\nFor example:\nPeople with type A blood will react against type B or type AB blood.\nPeople with type B blood will react against type A or type AB blood.\nPeople with type O blood will react against type A, type B, or type AB blood.\nPeople with type AB blood will not react against type A, type B, type AB, or type O blood.\nType O blood does not cause an immune response when it is given to people with type A, type B, or type AB blood. This is why type O blood cells can be given to people of any blood type. People with type O blood are called universal donors. But people with type O can only receive type O blood.\nBoth blood and plasma transfusions must be matched to avoid an immune reaction. Before anyone receives blood, both the blood and the person receiving it are tested carefully to avoid a reaction."}
