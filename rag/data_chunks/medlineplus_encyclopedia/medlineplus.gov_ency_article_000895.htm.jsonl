If the movement of the egg is blocked or slowed through the tubes, it can lead to an ectopic pregnancy. Things that may cause this problem include:\nBirth defect in the fallopian tubes\nScarring after a\nruptured appendix\nEndometriosis\nHaving had an ectopic pregnancy in the past\nScarring from past infections or surgery of the female organs\nHistory of prior abdominal surgery\nThe following also increase risk for an ectopic pregnancy:\nAge over 35\nGetting pregnant while having an intrauterine device (IUD)\nHaving your fallopian tubes tied\nHaving had surgery to untie fallopian tubes to become pregnant\nHaving had many sexual partners\nSexually transmitted infections (STI)\nSome infertility treatments\nSometimes, the cause is not known. Hormones may play a role.\nThe most common site for an ectopic pregnancy is the fallopian tube."}

Hormones may play a role.\nThe most common site for an ectopic pregnancy is the fallopian tube. In rare cases, this can occur in the ovary, abdomen, or\ncervix\n.\nAn ectopic pregnancy can occur even if you use birth control.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of ectopic pregnancy may include:\nAbnormal vaginal bleeding\nMild cramping on one side of the pelvis\nNo periods\nPain in the lower belly or pelvic area\nIf the area around the abnormal pregnancy ruptures and bleeds, symptoms may get worse. They may include:\nFainting or feeling faint\nIntense pressure in the rectum\nLow blood pressure\nPain in the shoulder area\nSevere, sharp, and sudden pain in the lower abdomen\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will do a pelvic exam. The exam may show tenderness in the pelvic area.\nA pregnancy test and vaginal ultrasound will be done.\nHuman chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is a hormone that is produced during pregnancy."}

Checking the blood level of this hormone can detect pregnancy.\nWhen hCG levels are above a certain value, a pregnancy sac in the uterus should be seen with ultrasound.\nIf the sac is not seen, this may indicate that an ectopic pregnancy is present.\nYou may need more than one exam, ultrasound, and blood test. Your provider will instruct you about signs to watch for until your next visit.\nTreatment\nEctopic pregnancy may be life threatening. The pregnancy cannot continue to birth (term).   Effective treatment requires either medical treatment to end the pregnancy or surgical removal of the pregnancy.\nIf the ectopic pregnancy has not ruptured, treatment may include:\nSurgery\nMedicine that ends the pregnancy\n, along with close monitoring by your provider\nYou will need emergency medical help if the area of the ectopic pregnancy breaks open (ruptures). Rupture can lead to bleeding and shock."}

Treatment for shock may include:\nBlood transfusion\nFluids given through a vein\nKeeping warm\nOxygen\nRaising the legs\nIf there is a rupture, surgery is done to stop blood loss and remove the pregnancy. In some cases, the surgeon may have to remove the fallopian tube.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf diagnosed early, treatment is very effective. It's important to seek early care whenever you believe you may be pregnant so your provider may determine the location of the pregnancy.\nOne out of three women who have had one ectopic pregnancy can have a baby in the future.
