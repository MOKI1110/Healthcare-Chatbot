Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nFactitious hyperthyroidism\nFactitious hyperthyroidism\nFactitious hyperthyroidism is higher-than-normal thyroid hormone levels in the blood and symptoms that suggest hyperthyroidism. It occurs from taking too much thyroid hormone medicine.\nHyperthyroidism is also known as overactive thyroid.\nCauses\nThe thyroid gland produces the hormones thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3). In most cases of\nhyperthyroidism\n, the thyroid gland itself produces too much of these hormones.\nHyperthyroidism can also be caused by taking too much thyroid hormone medicine for\nhypothyroidism\n. This is called factitious hyperthyroidism. When this occurs because the prescribed dosage of hormone medicine is too high, it is called iatrogenic, or doctor-induced, hyperthyroidism. This is common."}

When this occurs because the prescribed dosage of hormone medicine is too high, it is called iatrogenic, or doctor-induced, hyperthyroidism. This is common. Sometimes this is intentional (for some people with depression or thyroid cancer), but often this happens because the dose is not adjusted based on follow-up blood tests.\nFactitious hyperthyroidism can also occur when someone takes too much thyroid hormone on purpose and may conceal this. This is very uncommon. These may be people:\nWho have mental disorders such as\nMunchausen syndrome\nWho are trying to lose weight\nWho are being treated for depression or infertility\nChildren may take thyroid hormone pills accidentally.\nSymptoms\nThe symptoms of factitious hyperthyroidism are the same as those of hyperthyroidism caused by a thyroid gland disorder, except that:\nThere is no\ngoiter\n."}

The thyroid gland is often small.\nThe eyes do not bulge, as they do in\nGraves disease\n(the most common type of hyperthyroidism).\nThe skin over the shins does not thicken, as it sometimes does in people who have Graves disease.\nExams and Tests\nBlood tests used to diagnose factitious hyperthyroidism include:\nFree T4\nThyroglobulin\nTotal\nT3\nTotal\nT4\nTSH\nOther tests that may be done include\nradioactive iodine uptake\nor thyroid ultrasound.\nTreatment\nYour health care provider will tell you to stop taking thyroid hormone. If you need to take it, your provider will reduce the dosage.\nYou should be re-checked in 2 to 4 weeks to be sure that the signs and symptoms are gone."}
