The group A strep bacteria produce a toxin that causes a distinctive red\nrash\n, which led to the name.\nThe main risk factor for getting scarlet fever is infection with the bacteria that cause strep throat. An outbreak of strep throat or scarlet fever in the community, neighborhood, or school may increase the risk of infection.\nSymptoms\nThe time between infection and symptoms is short, most often 1 to 2 days. The illness will likely begin with a\nfever\nand sore throat.\nThe rash first appears on the neck and chest, then spreads over the body. People say it feels like sandpaper. The texture of the rash is more important than the appearance to confirm the diagnosis. The rash can last for more than a week."}
