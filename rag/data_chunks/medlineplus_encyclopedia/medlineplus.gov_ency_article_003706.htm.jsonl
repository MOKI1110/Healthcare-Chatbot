This gland is located at the base of the brain.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour health care provider may give you special instructions about what you can or cannot eat before the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis hormone may be checked if a person's growth pattern is abnormal or if another condition is suspected.\nToo much growth hormone (GH) can cause abnormally increased growth patterns. In adults, this is called\nacromegaly\n. In children, it is called\ngigantism\n.\nToo little growth hormone\ncan cause a slow or flat rate of growth in children."}

In adults, it can sometimes cause changes in energy, muscle mass, cholesterol levels, and bone strength.\nThe GH test may also be used to monitor response to acromegaly treatment.\nNormal Results\nThe normal range for GH level is typically:\nFor adult males -- 0.05 to 3 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL)\nFor adult females -- 0.05 to 8 ng/mL\nFor children -- varies with age and sex, ask your provider what is normal for your child\nGH is released in pulses. The size and duration of the pulses varies with time of day, age, and sex. This is why random GH measurements are rarely useful. A higher level may be normal if the blood was drawn during a pulse. A lower level may be normal if the blood was drawn around the end of a pulse. GH is most useful when measured as part of a stimulation or suppression test.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different specimens."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA high level of GH may indicate:\nAcromegaly in adults. (A\nspecial test\nis done to confirm this diagnosis.)\nGigantism in children. This is abnormal growth due to excess GH. (A\nspecial test\nis done to confirm this diagnosis.)\nGH resistance.\nPituitary tumor\n.\nA low level of GH may indicate:\nSlow growth noticed in infancy or childhood. (A\nspecial test\nis done to confirm this diagnosis.)\nHypopituitarism\n(low function of the pituitary gland). The pituitary gland makes several hormones besides GH and these may be low as well.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken.  Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other."}
