It forms when the body breaks down carbohydrates to use for energy when oxygen levels are low. Times when your body's oxygen level might drop include:\nDuring intense exercise\nWhen you have an infection or disease that reduces oxygen delivery to your body tissues\nA test can be done to measure the amount of lactic acid in the blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. Most of the time blood is\ndrawn from a vein\nlocated on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nDO NOT exercise for several hours before the test. Exercise can cause a temporary increase in lactic acid levels.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted."}

Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nThe examples above show the common measurements for results for these tests."}

Some laboratories use different measurements or may test different specimens.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results mean that body tissues are not getting enough oxygen.\nConditions that can increase lactic acid levels include:\nDiabetic ketoacidosis\nHeart failure\nLiver disease\nLung disease\nMedicines such as beta adrenergic agonists (albuterol, salmeterol), certain HIV medicines, metformin\nNot enough blood containing oxygen getting to a certain area of the body\nSevere infection that affects the entire body (\nsepsis\n)\nVery low levels of oxygen in the blood (hypoxia)\nConsiderations\nClenching the fist or having the elastic band in place for a long time while having blood drawn can increase the lactic acid level even if there is no underlying medical condition. This may be misleading to your provider.\nAlternative Names\nLactate test\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nNeligan PJ. How should acid-base disorders be diagnosed?"}
