RAINN (Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network) has these 4 steps for how to help someone who appears to be at risk, while protecting your own safety.\nCreate a distraction.\nThis may be as simple as interrupting a conversation or offering food or drinks at a party.\nAsk directly.\nAsk the person who appears to be at risk if they are in trouble and need help.\nRefer to an authority.\nIt may be safest to talk with an authority figure who can help. Enlist help from a security guard, bar bouncer, employee, or RA. If needed, call 911 or the local emergency number.\nEnlist other people.\nYou don't have to and probably should not take action alone. Have a friend come along with you to ask the person if they are OK. Or ask someone else to intervene if you feel they might be able to do so safely."}
