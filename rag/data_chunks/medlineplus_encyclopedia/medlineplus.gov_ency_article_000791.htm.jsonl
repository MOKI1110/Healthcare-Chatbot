This condition is also called common fibular nerve dysfunction.\nCauses\nThe common peroneal nerve is a branch of the sciatic nerve. It supplies movement and sensation to the lower leg, foot and toes. Common peroneal nerve dysfunction is a type of\nperipheral neuropathy\n(nerve damage outside the brain or spinal cord). This condition can affect people of any age.\nCommon peroneal nerve is a type of\nmononeuropathy\n. Mononeuropathy is nerve damage to a single nerve. Certain body-wide conditions can also cause single nerve injuries.\nDamage to the nerve disrupts the\nmyelin\nsheath that covers the axon (branch of the nerve cell)."}

Padding the knee may prevent further injury by crossing the legs, while also serving as a reminder to not cross your legs.\nIn some cases, corticosteroids injected into the area may reduce\nswelling\nand pressure on the nerve.\nSurgery may help reduce symptoms in some cases. It may be needed:\nTo relieve pressure on the nerve if the disorder is caused by pressure on the nerve\nTo remove tumors pressing on the nerve\nYou may need surgery if:\nThe disorder does not go away\nYou have problems with movement\nThere is evidence that the nerve axon is damaged\nCONTROLLING SYMPTOMS\nYou may need over-the-counter or prescription pain relievers to control pain."}
