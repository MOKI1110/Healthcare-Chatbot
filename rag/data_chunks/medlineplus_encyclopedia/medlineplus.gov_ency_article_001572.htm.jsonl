It is most often seen in boys and young adult men.\nCauses\nJuvenile angiofibroma is not very common. It is most often found in adolescent boys. The\ntumor\ncontains many blood vessels and  spreads within the area in which it started (locally\ninvasive\n). This can cause bone damage.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms include:\nDifficulty breathing\nthrough the nose\nEasy bruising\nFrequent or repeated nosebleeds\nHeadache\nSwelling of the cheek\nHearing loss\nNasal discharge\n, usually bloody\nProlonged\nbleeding\nStuffy nose\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider may see the angiofibroma when examining the upper throat.\nTests that may be done include:\nArteriogram\nto see the blood supply to the growth\nCT scan of the sinuses\nMRI scan of the head\nX-ray\nBiopsy is generally not recommended due to the high risk of bleeding.\nTreatment\nYou will need treatment if the angiofibroma is growing larger, blocking the airways, or causing repeated nosebleeds."}

In some cases, no treatment is needed.\nSurgery may be needed to remove the tumor. The tumor may be hard to remove if it is not enclosed and has spread to other areas. Newer surgery techniques that place a camera up through the nose have made tumor removal surgery less invasive.\nA procedure called embolization may be done to prevent the tumor from bleeding. The procedure may correct the nosebleeds by itself, but it is most often followed by surgery to remove the tumor.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAlthough not cancerous, angiofibromas may continue to grow and damage nearby tissue or bleed."}
