The faster medical help is given, the better the chance for recovery.\nExtensive damage to the mouth, throat, and stomach is possible. The outcome depends on how much of this damage has happened. Damage to the esophagus and stomach can continue to occur for several weeks after the product is swallowed. A hole can develop in these organs, and that can lead to severe bleeding and infection. Surgery may be needed to treat these and other complications.\nReferences\nHoyte C. Caustics. In: Walls RM, ed.\nRosen's Emergency Medicine: Concepts and Clinical Practice\n. 10h ed.
