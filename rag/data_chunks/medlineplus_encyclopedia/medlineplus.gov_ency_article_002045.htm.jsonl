All 20 baby teeth should be in place by the time a child is 30 months old. Some children do not show any teeth until much later than 8 months, but this is usually normal for the child and not due to a disease.\nThe two bottom front teeth (lower incisors) often come in first.\nNext to grow in are usually the two top front teeth (upper incisors).\nThen the other incisors, lower and upper molars, canines, and finally the upper and lower lateral molars come in.\nThe signs of teething are:\nActing cranky or\nirritable\nBiting or chewing on hard objects\nDrooling\n, which may often begin before teething starts\nGum swelling and tenderness\nRefusing food\nSleeping problems\nTeething does not cause fever or diarrhea."}

If your child develops a fever or diarrhea and you are worried about it, contact your child's health care provider.\nTips to ease your child's teething discomfort:\nWipe your child's face with a cloth to remove the drool and prevent a rash.\nGive your child a cool object to chew on, such as a firm rubber teething ring or a cold apple. Avoid liquid-filled teething rings, or any plastic objects that might break.\nGently rub the gums with a cool, wet washcloth, or (until the teeth are right near the surface) a clean finger. You may place the wet washcloth in the freezer first, but wash it before using it again.\nFeed your child cool, soft foods such as applesauce or yogurt (if your child is eating solids).\nUse a bottle, if it seems to help, but only fill it with water."}

Formula, milk, or juice can all cause tooth decay.\nYou can buy the following medicines and remedies at the drug store:\nAcetaminophen (Tylenol and others) or ibuprofen can help when your child is very cranky or uncomfortable.\nIf your child is 2 years or older, teething gels and preparations rubbed on the gums may help the pain for a short while. Be careful not to use too much. Do not use these remedies if your child is younger than 2 years old.\nBe sure to read and follow package instructions before using any medicine or remedy. If you are not sure how to use it, contact your child's provider.\nWhat not to do:\nDo not tie a teething ring or any other object around your child's neck.\nDo not place anything frozen against your child's gums.\nNever cut the gums to help a tooth grow in, because this can lead to infection.\nAvoid teething powders.\nNever give your child aspirin or place it against the gums or teeth.\nDo not rub alcohol on your child's gums.\nDo not use homeopathic remedies."}
