Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nInfant botulism\nInfant botulism\nInfant botulism is a potentially life-threatening disease caused by a bacterium called\nClostridium botulinum\n. It grows inside a baby's gastrointestinal tract.\nCauses\nClostridium botulinum\nis a spore-forming organism that is common in nature. The spores may be found in soil and certain foods (such as honey and some corn syrups).\nInfant botulism occurs mostly in young infants between 6 weeks and 6 months of age. It may occur as early as 6 days and as late as 1 year.\nRisk factors include swallowing honey as a baby, being around contaminated soil, and having less than one stool per day for a period greater than 2 months.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nBreathing that stops or slows\nConstipation\nEyelids that sag or partially close\n\"Floppy\" body\nAbsence of gagging\nLoss of head control\nParalysis that spreads downward\nPoor feeding and weak suckling\nRespiratory failure\nExtreme tiredness (lethargy)\nWeak cry\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will do a physical exam."}

This may show a decreased muscle tone, a missing or decreased gag reflex, missing or decreased deep tendon reflexes, and eyelid drooping.\nA stool sample from the baby may be checked for the botulinum toxin or bacteria.\nElectromyography (EMG\n) can be done to help tell the difference between muscle and neurological problems.\nTreatment\nBotulism immune globulin is the main treatment for this condition. Infants that get this treatment have shorter hospital stays and milder illness.\nAny infant with botulism must receive supportive care during their recovery. This includes:\nEnsuring proper nutrition\nKeeping the airway clear\nWatching for breathing problems\nIf breathing problems develop, breathing support, including the use of a breathing machine, may be needed.\nAntibiotics do not appear to help the baby improve any faster."}

Therefore, they are not needed unless another bacterial infection such as pneumonia develops.\nThe use of human-derived botulinum antitoxin may also be helpful.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nWhen the condition is detected and treated early, the child most often makes a full recovery. Death or permanent disability may result in complicated cases.\nPossible Complications\nRespiratory insufficiency can develop. This would require assistance with breathing (mechanical ventilation).\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nInfant botulism can be life threatening. Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number right away if your infant has symptoms of botulism.\nPrevention\nIn theory, the disease might be avoided by preventing exposure to spores. Clostridium spores are found in honey and corn syrup. These foods should not be fed to infants less than 1 year old.\nReferences\nBirch TB, Bleck TP. Botulism (\nClostridium botulinum\n)."}
