This article focuses on high blood pressure in infants.\nCauses\nBlood pressure measures how hard the heart is working, and how healthy the arteries are. There are two numbers in each blood pressure measurement:\nThe first (top) number is the systolic blood pressure, which measures the force of blood released when the heart beats.\nThe second (bottom) number is the diastolic pressure, which measures the pressure in the arteries when the heart is at rest.\nBlood pressure measurements are written this way: 120/80. One or both of these numbers can be too high.\nSeveral factors affect blood pressure, including:\nHormones\nThe health of the heart and blood vessels\nThe health of the kidneys\nHigh blood pressure in infants may be due to kidney or heart disease that is present at birth (congenital)."}

It is normal for these numbers to vary.\nSymptoms\nMost babies with high blood pressure will not have symptoms. Instead, symptoms may be related to the condition causing the high blood pressure. These symptoms may include:\nBluish skin\n(cyanosis)\nFailure to grow and gain weight\nFrequent urinary tract infections\nPale skin\n(pallor)\nRapid breathing\nSymptoms that may appear if the baby has very high blood pressure include:\nIrritability\nSeizures\nTrouble breathing\nVomiting\nExams and Tests\nIn most cases, the only sign of high blood pressure is the blood pressure measurement itself.\nSigns of very high blood pressure include:\nHeart failure\nKidney failure\nRapid pulse\nBlood pressure in infants is measured with an automatic device.\nIf\ncoarctation of the aorta\nis the cause, there may be decreased pulses or blood pressure in the legs."}
