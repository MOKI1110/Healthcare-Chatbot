A line drawn from the inner corner to the outer corner determines the slant of the eye, or palpebral slant. Slanting and a fold of skin (\nepicanthal fold\n) are normal in people of Asian descent.\nAbnormal slanting of the eye may occur with some genetic disorders and syndromes. The most common of these is Down syndrome. People with Down syndrome often also have an epicanthal fold in the inner corner of the eye.\nCauses\nPalpebral slant may not be due to any defect."}
