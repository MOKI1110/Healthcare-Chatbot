It is attached by a stalk to the\nhypothalamus\n. The hypothalamus is the area of the brain that controls the pituitary gland's function.\nThe hormones released by the pituitary gland (and their functions) are:\nAdrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) -- stimulates the adrenal gland to release cortisol; cortisol helps to maintain blood pressure and blood sugar\nAntidiuretic hormone (ADH) -- controls water loss by the kidneys\nFollicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) -- controls sexual function and fertility in males and females\nGrowth hormone (GH) -- stimulates growth of tissues and bone\nLuteinizing hormone (LH) -- controls sexual function and fertility in males and females\nOxytocin -- stimulates the uterus to contract during labor and the breasts to release milk\nProlactin -- stimulates female breast development and milk production\nThyroi"}

Lack of a hormone leads to loss of function in the gland or organ the hormone controls. For example, lack of TSH leads to loss of normal function of the thyroid gland.\nHypopituitarism may be caused by:\nBrain surgery\nBrain tumor\nHead trauma (traumatic brain injury)\nInfections or inflammation of the brain and the tissues that support the brain\nDeath of an area of tissue in the pituitary gland (\npituitary apoplexy\n)\nRadiation therapy to the brain\nStroke (rare)\nSubarachnoid hemorrhage\n(from a burst aneurysm)\nTumors of the pituitary gland or hypothalamus\nSometimes, hypopituitarism is due to uncommon immune system or metabolic diseases, such as:\nToo much iron in the body (\nhemochromatosis\n)\nAbnormal increase in immune cells called histiocytes (\nhistiocytoses\n)\nAutoimmune"}

The loss of blood leads to tissue death in the pituitary gland. This condition is called\nSheehan syndrome\n.\nCertain medicines can also suppress pituitary function. The most common medicines are glucocorticoids (such as prednisone and dexamethasone), which are taken for inflammatory and immune conditions."}

These may include:\nCorticosteroids (cortisol)\nGrowth hormone\nSex hormones (testosterone for men and estrogen for women)\nThyroid hormone\nDesmopressin\nMedicines are also available to treat related\ninfertility\nin men and women.\nIf you take glucocorticoid medicines for pituitary ACTH deficiency, be sure you know when to take a stress dose of your medicine. Discuss this with your health care provider.\nAlways carry a medical ID (card, bracelet, or necklace) that says you have adrenal insufficiency. The ID should also say the type of medicine and dosage you need in case of an emergency caused by adrenal insufficiency.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nHypopituitarism is usually permanent.
