Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAflatoxin\nAflatoxin\nAflatoxins are\ntoxins\nproduced by a mold (fungus) that grows on nuts, seeds, and legumes.\nFunction\nAlthough aflatoxins are known to cause cancer in animals, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) allows them at low levels in nuts, seeds, and legumes because they are considered unavoidable contaminants.\nThe FDA believes occasionally eating small amounts of aflatoxin poses little risk over a lifetime. It is not practical to attempt to remove all traces of aflatoxin from food products in order to make them safer.\nFood Sources\nThe mold that produces aflatoxin may be found in the following foods:\nPeanuts and peanut butter\nTree nuts, such as pecans\nCorn\nWheat\nOil seeds, such as cottonseed\nSide Effects\nAflatoxins ingested in large mounts may cause acute liver damage. Chronic intoxication may lead to weight gain or weight loss, loss of appetite, or infertility in men.\nRecommendations\nTo help minimize risk, the FDA tests foods that may contain aflatoxin."}
