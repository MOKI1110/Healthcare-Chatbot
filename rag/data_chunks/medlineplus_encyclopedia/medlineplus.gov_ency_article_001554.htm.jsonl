If you do keep guns in the home, lock them and keep the bullets separate.\nIn older adults, further investigate feelings of hopelessness, being a burden, and not belonging.\nMany people who try to take their own life talk about it before making the attempt. Sometimes, just talking to someone who cares and who does not judge them is enough to reduce the risk of suicide.\nHowever, if you are a friend, family member, or you know someone who you think may attempt suicide, never try to manage the problem on your own.
