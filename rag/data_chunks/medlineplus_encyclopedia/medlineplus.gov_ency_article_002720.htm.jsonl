Benzene is very poisonous. Poisoning can cause rapid death. However, deaths have occurred as long as 3 days after the poisoning. This happens because:\nPermanent brain damage occurs\nThe heart stops\nThe lungs stop working\nPeople who have regular exposure to low levels of benzene can also become sick. The most common problems are blood diseases, including:\nLeukemia\nLymphoma\nSevere anemia\nPeople who work with benzene products should only do so in areas with good air flow. They should also wear protective gloves and eye glasses.\nReferences\nAgency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR) website. ATSDR Toxic Substances Portal.
