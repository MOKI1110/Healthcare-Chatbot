You will be asked to rest your chin and forehead on a support to keep your head steady.\nThe health care provider will examine your eyes, especially the eyelids, cornea, conjunctiva, sclera, and iris. Often a orange dye (fluorescein) is used to help examine the cornea and tear layer. The dye is added either by touching a small strip of paper to your eye or by adding it as an eyedrop. The dye rinses out of the eye with tears as you blink.\nNext, drops may be placed in your eyes to widen (dilate) your pupils. The drops take about 15 to 20 minutes to work."}

The slit-lamp examination is then repeated using another small lens held close to the eye, so the back of the eye can be examined.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special preparation is needed for this test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYour eyes will be sensitive to light for a few hours after the exam if dilating drops are used.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test is used to examine the:\nConjunctiva\n(the thin membrane that covers the inner surface of the eyelid and the white part of the eyeball)\nCornea (the clear outer lens on the front of the eye)\nEyelids\nIris\n(colored part of the eye between the cornea and lens)\nLens\nSclera\n(the white outer coating of the eye)\nNormal Results\nStructures in the eye are found to be normal.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nThe slit lamp exam may detect many diseases of the eye, including:\nClouding of the lens of the eye (\ncataract\n)\nInjury to the cornea\nDry eye syndrome\nMacular degeneration\nSeparation of the retina from its supporting layers (\nretinal detachment\n)"}
