A common cause in adults is\ntendinitis\n. This is inflammation and injury to the tendons, which are tissues that attach muscle to bone.\nPeople who play racquet sports are most likely to injure the tendons on the outside of the elbow. This condition is commonly called\ntennis elbow\n. Golfers are more likely to injure the\ntendons on the inside of the elbow\n.\nOther common causes of elbow tendinitis are gardening, playing baseball, using a screwdriver, or overusing your wrist and arm.\nYoung children commonly develop\nnursemaid elbow\n, which often occurs when someone is pulling on their straightened arm. The bones are stretched apart momentarily and a ligament slips in between. It becomes trapped when the bones try to snap back into place. As a result, the child will usually quietly refuse to use the arm, but often cries out when they try to bend or straighten the elbow."}

It becomes trapped when the bones try to snap back into place. As a result, the child will usually quietly refuse to use the arm, but often cries out when they try to bend or straighten the elbow. This condition is also called an elbow subluxation (a partial\ndislocation\n). This often gets better on its own when the ligament slips back into place. Surgery or diagnostic tests are usually not needed.\nOther common causes of elbow pain are:\nBursitis\n-- inflammation of a fluid-filled cushion beneath the skin\nArthritis\n-- narrowing of the joint space and loss of cartilage in the elbow\nElbow\nstrains\nInfection of the elbow\nTendon tears -- biceps rupture\nHome Care\nGently try to move the elbow and increase your range of motion."}
