It affects the muscles and heart.\nCauses\nFriedreich ataxia is caused by a defect in a gene called frataxin (FXN). Changes in this gene cause the body to make too much of a part of DNA called trinucleotide repeat (GAA). Normally, the body contains about 8 to 30 copies of GAA. People with Friedreich ataxia have as many as 1,000 copies. The more copies of GAA a person has, the earlier in life the disease starts and the faster it gets worse.\nFriedreich ataxia is an\nautosomal recessive\ngenetic disorder. This means you must get a copy of the defective gene from both your mother and father.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms are caused by the wearing away of structures in areas of the brain and spinal cord that control coordination, muscle movement, and other functions. Symptoms most often begin before puberty."}

Symptoms may include:\nAbnormal speech\nChanges in vision, particularly color vision\nDecrease in ability to feel vibrations in lower limbs\nFoot problems, such as\nhammer toe\nand\nhigh arches\nHearing loss, this occurs in about 10% of people\nJerky eye movements\nLoss of coordination\nand balance, which leads to frequent falls\nMuscle weakness\nNo reflexes in the legs\nUnsteady gait\nand uncoordinated movements (\nataxia\n), which gets worse with time\nMuscle problems lead to changes in the spine. This may result in\nscoliosis\nor\nkyphoscoliosis\n.\nHeart disease\ncommonly develops and may lead to\nheart failure\n."}

An eye exam may show damage to the optic nerve, which most often occurs without symptoms.\nTreatment\nTreatment for Friedreich ataxia includes:\nCounseling\nSpeech therapy\nPhysical therapy\nWalking aids or wheelchairs\nA new medicine, omaveloxolone (Skyclarys), was approved by FDA in 2023 to slow disease progression. Orthopedic devices (braces) may be needed for scoliosis and foot problems."}

Treating heart disease and diabetes help people live longer and improve their quality of life.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nFriedreich ataxia slowly gets worse and causes problems doing everyday activities. Most people need to use a wheelchair within 15 years of the disease's start. The disease may lead to early death.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nDiabetes\nHeart failure or heart disease\nLoss of ability to move around\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if symptoms of Friedreich ataxia occur, especially if there is a family history of the disorder.\nPrevention\nPeople with a family history of Friedreich ataxia who intend to have children may want to consider genetic screening to determine their risk.\nAlternative Names\nFriedreich's ataxia; Spinocerebellar degeneration\nImages\nCentral nervous system and peripheral nervous system\nReferences\nMink JW.
