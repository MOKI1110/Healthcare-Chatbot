Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nStool C difficile toxin\nStool C difficile toxin\nThe stool\nC difficile\ntoxin test detects harmful substances produced by the bacterium\nClostridioides difficile\n(\nC difficile\n). This infection is a common cause of diarrhea after antibiotic use.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA stool sample is needed. It is sent to a lab to be analyzed. There are several ways to detect\nC difficile\ntoxin in the stool sample.\nEnzyme immunoassay (\nEIA\n) was used most often in the past to detect substances produced by the bacteria. This test is faster than older tests, and simpler to perform. The results are ready in a few hours. However, it is slightly less sensitive than earlier methods. Several stool samples may be needed to get an accurate result.\nA newer and more common method is to use polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to detect the toxin genes. This is the most sensitive and specific test. Results are ready within 1 hour."}

This is the most sensitive and specific test. Results are ready within 1 hour. Only one stool sample is needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nThere are many ways to collect the samples.\nYou can catch the stool on plastic wrap that is loosely placed over the toilet bowl and held in place by the toilet seat. Then you put the sample in a clean container.\nA test kit is available that supplies a special toilet tissue or plastic cover for the back of the toilet that you use to collect the sample. After collecting the sample, you put it in a container.\nDo not mix urine, water, or toilet tissue with the sample.\nFor children wearing diapers:\nLine the diaper with plastic wrap.\nPosition the plastic wrap so that it will prevent urine and stool from mixing. This will provide a better sample.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYou may have this test if your health care provider thinks that your\ndiarrhea\nis caused by the antibiotic medicines you have taken recently. Antibiotics change the balance of bacteria in the colon."}

This sometimes leads to too much growth of\nC difficile\n.\nDiarrhea caused by\nC difficile\nafter antibiotic use often occurs in people who are in the hospital. It also can occur in people who have not recently taken antibiotics. People with inflammatory bowel disease are particularly at risk as are people who are immunosuppressed. This can lead to a condition called\npseudomembranous colitis\n.\nNormal Results\nNo\nC difficile\ntoxin is detected.\nNote: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal results mean that toxins produced by\nC difficile\nare seen in the stool and are causing diarrhea.\nRisks\nThere are no risks associated with testing for\nC difficile\ntoxin.\nConsiderations\nSeveral stool samples may be needed to detect the condition."}
