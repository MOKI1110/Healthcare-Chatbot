Your health care provider may recommend that you use a catheter if you have:\nUrinary incontinence\n(leaking urine or being unable to control when you urinate)\nUrinary retention (being unable to empty your bladder when you need to)\nSurgery on the prostate or genitals\nOther medical conditions such as\nmultiple sclerosis\n, spinal cord injury,\ndementia\n, or other operations\nCatheters come in many sizes, materials (latex, silicone, Teflon), and types (straight or coude tip). A Foley catheter is a common type of indwelling catheter."}

A Foley catheter is a common type of indwelling catheter. It is a soft, plastic or rubber tube that is inserted into the bladder to drain the urine.\nIn most cases, your provider will use the smallest catheter that is appropriate.\nThere are 3 main types of catheters:\nIndwelling catheter\nCondom catheter\nIntermittent self-catheter\nINDWELLING URETHRAL CATHETERS\nAn indwelling urinary catheter is one that is left in the bladder. You may use an indwelling catheter for a short time or a long time.\nAn indwelling catheter collects urine by attaching to a drainage bag. The bag has a valve that can be opened to allow urine to flow out. Some of these bags can be secured to your leg. This allows you to wear the bag under your clothes. An indwelling catheter may be inserted into the bladder in 2 ways:\nMost often, the catheter is inserted through the urethra. This is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.\nSometimes, the provider will insert a catheter into your bladder through a small hole in your lower belly."}

This is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to the outside of the body.\nSometimes, the provider will insert a catheter into your bladder through a small hole in your lower belly. This is called a suprapubic catheter. It  is done at a hospital or provider's office.\nAn indwelling catheter has a small balloon inflated on the end of it. This prevents the catheter from sliding out of your body. When the catheter needs to be removed, the balloon is deflated.\nCONDOM CATHETERS\nCondom catheters can be used by men to collect urine. They are most often used to help manage incontinence. There is no tube placed inside the penis. Instead, a condom-like device is placed over the penis. A tube leads from this device to a drainage bag. The condom catheter must be changed every day.\nINTERMITTENT CATHETERS\nYou would use an intermittent catheter when you only need to use a catheter sometimes or you do not want to wear a bag. You or your caregiver will insert the catheter to drain your bladder and then remove it. This can be done only once or several times a day."}

You or your caregiver will insert the catheter to drain your bladder and then remove it. This can be done only once or several times a day. The frequency will depend on the reason you need to use this method or how much urine needs to be drained from your bladder.\nDRAINAGE BAGS\nA catheter is most often attached to a drainage bag.\nKeep the drainage bag lower than your bladder so that urine does not flow back up into your bladder. Empty the drainage device when it is about one half full and at bedtime. Always wash your hands with soap and water before emptying the bag.\nHOW TO CARE FOR A CATHETER\nTo care for an indwelling catheter, clean the area where the catheter exits your body and the catheter itself with soap and water every day. Also clean the area after every bowel movement to prevent infection.\nIf you have a suprapubic catheter, clean the opening in your belly and the tube with soap and water every day. Then cover it with dry gauze.\nDrink plenty of fluids to help prevent infections. Ask your provider how much you should drink.\nWash your hands before and after handling the drainage device."}
