The aortic valve separates the heart and aorta. The aortic valve opens so blood can flow out. It then closes to keep blood from returning to the heart.\nYou may need aortic valve surgery to replace the aortic valve in your heart if:\nYour aortic valve does not close all the way, so blood leaks back into the heart. This is called\naortic regurgitation\n.\nYour aortic valve does not open fully, so blood flow out of the heart is reduced. This is called\naortic stenosis\n.\nThe aortic valve can be replaced using:\nMinimally invasive aortic valve surgery, done using one or more small cuts\nOpen aortic valve surgery\n, done by making a large cut in your chest\nDescription\nBefore your surgery, you will receive\ngeneral anesthesia\n.\nYou will be asleep and pain-free.\nThere are several ways to do minimally invasive aortic valve surgery."}

Techniques include min-thoracotomy, min-sternotomy, robot-assisted surgery, and percutaneous surgery. To perform the different procedures:\nYour surgeon may make a 2- to 3-inch (5 to 7.6 centimeters) cut in the right part of your chest near the sternum (breastbone). The muscles in the area will be divided. This lets the surgeon reach the heart and aortic valve.\nYour surgeon may split only the upper portion of your breast bone, allowing exposure to the aortic valve.\nFor robotically-assisted valve surgery, the surgeon makes 2 to 4 small cuts in your chest. The surgeon uses a special computer to control robotic arms during the surgery. A 3D view of the heart and aortic valve are displayed on a computer in the operating room.\nYou may need to be on a heart-lung machine for all of these surgeries.\nWhen the aortic valve is too damaged for repair, a new valve is put in place. Your surgeon will remove your aortic valve and sew a new one into place."}

Your surgeon will remove your aortic valve and sew a new one into place. There are two main types of new valves:\nMechanical, made of man-made materials, such as titanium or carbon. These valves last the longest. You will need to take blood-thinning medicine, such as warfarin (Coumadin), for the rest of your life if you have this type of valve.\nBiological, made of human or animal tissue. These valves last 10 to 20 years, but you may not need to take blood thinners for life.\nAnother technique is\ntranscatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR)\n. TAVR can be done through a small incision made in the groin or the left chest. The replacement valve is passed into the blood vessel or the heart and moved up to the aortic valve. The catheter has a balloon on the end. The balloon is inflated to stretch the opening of the valve. This procedure is called percutaneous valvuloplasty and allows for a new valve to be placed in this spot. The surgeon then sends a catheter with an attached valve and detaches the valve to take the place of the damaged aortic valve."}

You do not need to be on a heart-lung machine for this procedure.\nIn some cases, you will have coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG), or surgery to replace part of the aorta at the same time.\nOnce the new valve is working, your surgeon will:\nClose the small cut to your heart or aorta\nPlace catheters (flexible tubes) around your heart to drain fluids that build up\nClose the surgical cut in your muscles and skin\nThe surgery can take 3 to 6 hours, however, a TAVR procedure is often shorter.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nAortic valve surgery is done when the valve does not work properly."}

Minimally invasive surgery may be done for these reasons:\nChanges in your aortic valve are causing major heart symptoms, such as chest pain, shortness of breath, fainting spells, or heart failure.\nTests show that changes in your aortic valve are harming the work of your heart.\nDamage to your heart valve from infection (\nendocarditis\n).\nA minimally invasive procedure can have many benefits. There is less pain, blood loss, and risk for infection. You will also recover faster than you would from open heart surgery.\nPercutaneous valvuloplasty and catheter-based valve replacement such as TAVR are done only in people who are too sick or at very high risk for major heart surgery. The results of percutaneous valvuloplasty are not long-lasting.\nRisks\nRisks of any surgery are:\nBleeding\nBlood clots\nin the legs that may travel to the lungs\nBreathing problems\nInfection, including in the lungs, kidneys, bladder, chest, or heart valves\nReactions to medicines\nOther risks vary by the person's age."}
