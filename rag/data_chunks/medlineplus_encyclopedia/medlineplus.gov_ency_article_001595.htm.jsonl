The twin that loses the blood is called the donor twin. The twin that receives the blood is called the recipient twin.\nBoth infants may have problems, depending on how much blood is passed from one to the other. The donor twin may have too little blood, and the other may have too much blood.\nSymptoms\nMost of the time, the donor twin is smaller than the other twin at birth. The infant often has\nanemia\n, is dehydrated, and looks pale.\nThe recipient twin is born larger, with redness to the skin, too much blood, and a higher blood pressure. The twin that gets too much blood may develop\ncardiac failure\nbecause of the high blood volume."}

The twin that gets too much blood may develop\ncardiac failure\nbecause of the high blood volume. The infant may also need medicine to strengthen heart function.\nThe unequal size of identical twins is referred to as discordant twins.\nExams and Tests\nThis condition is most often diagnosed by\nultrasound during pregnancy\n.\nAfter birth, the infants will receive the following tests:\nBlood clotting studies, including prothrombin time (PT) and partial thromboplastin time (PTT)\nComprehensive metabolic panel to determine electrolyte balance\nComplete blood count\nChest x-ray\nTreatment\nTreatment may require repeated amniocentesis during pregnancy. Fetal laser surgery may be done to stop the flow of blood from one twin to the other during pregnancy.\nAfter birth, treatment depends on the infant's symptoms. The donor twin may need a blood transfusion to treat anemia.\nThe recipient twin may need to have the volume of body fluid reduced."}

This may involve an exchange transfusion.\nThe recipient twin may also need to take medicine to prevent heart failure.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nIf the twin-to-twin transfusion is mild, both babies often recover fully. Severe cases may result in the death of a twin.\nAlternative Names\nTTTS; Fetal transfusion syndrome\nReferences\nMalone FD, D'Alton ME. Multiple gestation: clinical characteristics and management.
