Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nUterine artery embolization\nUterine artery embolization\nUterine artery embolization (UAE) is a procedure to treat\nfibroids\nwithout surgery. Uterine fibroids are noncancerous (benign) tumors that develop in the uterus (womb).\nDuring the procedure, the blood supply to the fibroids is cut off. This typically causes the fibroids to shrink.\nDescription\nUAE is done by a specially trained doctor called an interventional radiologist.\nYou will be awake, but you will not feel pain. This is called conscious sedation. The procedure takes about 30 to 90 minutes.\nThe procedure is usually done this way:\nYou receive a sedative. This is medicine that makes you relaxed and sleepy.\nA local painkiller (anesthetic) is applied to the skin around your groin or wrist. This numbs the area so you do not feel pain.\nThe radiologist makes a tiny cut (incision) in your skin. A thin tube (catheter) is inserted into your femoral artery. This artery is at the top of your leg.\nThe doctor threads the catheter into your uterine artery."}

This artery supplies blood to the uterus.\nSmall plastic or gelatin particles are injected through the catheter into the blood vessels that supply blood to the fibroids. These particles block the blood supply to the tiny arteries that carry blood to the fibroids. Without this blood supply, the fibroids shrink and die.\nUAE is done in both your left and right uterine arteries through the same incision. Multiple fibroids can be treated.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nUAE is an effective way to treat symptoms caused by fibroids. Discuss with your health care provider whether this procedure is likely to be successful for you.\nWomen who benefit from UAE may:\nHave symptoms of fibroids including bleeding and low red blood count (anemia)."}

These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\nAsk your radiologist which medicines you should still take on the day of your procedure.\nLet your radiologist know about any illness you may have before your surgery. This includes\nCOVID-19\n, a\ncold\n,\nflu\n, fever, herpes breakout, or other illness."}

Sometimes portions of the treated fibroid tissue may pass through your vagina.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nUAE works well to decrease pain, pressure, and bleeding from fibroids in most women who have the procedure.\nUAE is less invasive than surgical treatments for uterine fibroids. Many women may return more quickly to activities than after surgery.\nSimilar to a myomectomy or any procedure where the uterus is not removed, there is a small risk of recurrence of bleeding from fibroids. If this occurs, the symptoms can be treated with\nhysterectomy\n(surgery to remove the uterus), myomectomy (surgery to remove the fibroid), or repeating the UAE.\nAlternative Names\nUterine fibroid embolization; UFE; UAE\nPatient Instructions\nUterine artery embolization - discharge\nImages\nFibroid tumors\nReferences\nDolan MS, Hill CC, Valea FA.
