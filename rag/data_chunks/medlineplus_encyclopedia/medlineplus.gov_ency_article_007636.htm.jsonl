Overgrowth of this lining can create polyps. Polyps are fingerlike growths that are attached to the inner wall of the uterus. They can be as small as a sesame seed or larger than a golf ball. There may be just one or many polyps.\nCauses\nThe exact cause of endometrial polyps is not known. They tend to grow when there is more of the hormone estrogen in the body.\nMost endometrial polyps are not cancerous but they can be cancerous or precancerous."}
