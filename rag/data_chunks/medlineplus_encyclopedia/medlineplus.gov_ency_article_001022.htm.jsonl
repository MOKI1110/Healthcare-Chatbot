It usually is a type of skin cancer.\nMelanoma of the eye can affect several parts of the eye, including the:\nChoroid\nCiliary body\nConjunctiva\nEyelid\nIris\nOrbit\nThe choroid layer is the most likely site of melanoma in the eye. This is the layer of blood vessels and connective tissue between the white of the eye and retina (back of the eye).\nThe cancer may only be in the eye. Or, it may spread (metastasize) to another location in the body, most commonly the liver. Melanoma can also begin on the skin or other organs in the body and spread to the eye.\nMelanoma is the most common type of eye tumor in adults. Even so, melanoma that starts in the eye is rare.\nToo much exposure to sunlight is an important risk factor for melanoma."}

Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome for melanoma of the eye depends on the size of the cancer when it is diagnosed. Most people survive at least 5 years from the time of diagnosis if the cancer has not spread outside the eye.\nIf the cancer has spread outside the eye, the chance of long-term survival is much lower.\nPossible Complications\nProblems that may develop due to melanoma of the eye include:\nDistortion or loss of vision\nRetinal detachment\nSpread of the tumor to other areas of the body\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider for an appointment if you have symptoms of melanoma of the eye.\nPrevention\nThe most important way to prevent melanoma of the eye is to protect the eyes from sunlight, especially between 10 a.m. and 4 p.m., when the sun's rays are most intense."}
