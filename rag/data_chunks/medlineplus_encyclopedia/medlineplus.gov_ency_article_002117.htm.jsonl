It is similar to acupuncture. Acupressure and acupuncture work by changing the pain messages that nerves send to your brain.\nSometimes, mild nausea and even morning sickness may improve when you press firmly down on pressure point P-6 (also called point PC6 or Neiguan). This is the groove between the two large tendons on the inside of your wrist that start at the base of your palm.\nTo find the pressure point on your left wrist:\nPlace the first three fingers on your right hand flat across your left wrist, positioned just below the crease in your wrist.\nThen place the thumb from your right hand below your fingers. Find the space between the two large tendons that run down the wrist.\nApply firm pressure using your thumb. It should not hurt.\nSpecial wristbands to help relieve nausea are sold over the counter at many stores."}
