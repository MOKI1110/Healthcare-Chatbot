The abscess causes swelling in the area.\nCauses\nEpidural abscess is a rare disorder caused by an infection in the area between the bones of the skull, or spine, and the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord (meninges). This infection is called an intracranial epidural abscess if it is inside the skull area. It is called a spinal epidural abscess if it is found in the spine area. Most are located in the spine.\nThe spinal infection is usually caused by bacteria but may be caused by a fungus. It can be due to other infections in the body (especially a urinary tract infection), or germs that spread through the blood. In some people, though, no other source of infection is found.\nAn abscess inside the skull is called an intracranial epidural abscess."}

Surgery is also often needed to reduce pressure on the spinal cord or brain, if there is weakness or damage to the nerves.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nEarly diagnosis and treatment greatly improve the chance of a good outcome. Once weakness,\nparalysis\n, or sensation changes occur, the chance of recovering lost function is greatly reduced. Permanent nervous system damage or death may occur.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nBrain abscess\nBrain damage\nBone infection (osteomyelitis)\nChronic back pain\nMeningitis\n(infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord)\nNerve damage\nReturn of infection\nSpinal cord abscess\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nAn epidural abscess is a medical emergency.
