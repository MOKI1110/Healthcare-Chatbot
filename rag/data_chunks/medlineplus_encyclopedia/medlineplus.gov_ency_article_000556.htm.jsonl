Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nDrug-induced thrombocytopenia\nDrug-induced thrombocytopenia\nThrombocytopenia\nmeans that there are not enough platelets. Platelets are elements in the blood that help the blood clot. A low platelet count makes bleeding more likely.\nMany conditions can cause a low platelet count. When medicines or drugs do this, it is called drug-induced thrombocytopenia.\nCauses\nDrug-induced thrombocytopenia occurs when certain medicines destroy platelets or interfere with the body's ability to make enough of them.\nThere are two types of drug-induced thrombocytopenia: immune and nonimmune.\nIf a medicine causes your immune system to produce\nantibodies\nwhich seek and destroy your platelets, the condition is called drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia. Heparin, a blood thinner, is the most common cause of drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia."}
