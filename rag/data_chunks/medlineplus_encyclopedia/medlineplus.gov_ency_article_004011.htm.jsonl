The other is to remove carbon dioxide from the body. Your body needs oxygen to work properly. Carbon dioxide is a gas your body produces when it uses oxygen.\nWatch this video about:\nBreathing\nDuring breathing, air enters and exits the lungs. When you breathe in (inhale), air flows through the airways into the lungs. The airways are made of stretchy tissue. Bands of muscle and other support tissue wrap around each airway to help keep them open.\nAir keeps flowing into the lungs until it fills tiny air sacs called alveoli. Blood circulates around these air sacs through tiny blood vessels called capillaries. Oxygen crosses into the bloodstream at the place where the blood vessels and air sacs meet."}

This is also where carbon dioxide crosses from the bloodstream into the lungs to be breathed out (exhaled).\nWatch this video about:\nGas exchange\nAGING CHANGES IN YOUR BODY AND THEIR EFFECTS ON THE LUNGS\nChanges to the bones and muscles of the chest and spine:\nBones become thinner and change shape. This can change the shape of your ribcage. As a result, your ribcage may not expand and contract as well during breathing.\nThe muscle that supports your breathing, the diaphragm, becomes weakened. This weakness may prevent you from breathing enough air in or out.\nThese changes in your bones and muscles may lower the oxygen level in your body. Also, less carbon dioxide may be removed from your body. Symptoms such as tiredness and shortness of breath can result.\nChanges to lung tissue:\nMuscles and other tissues that are near your airways may lose their ability to keep the airways completely open."}

This causes the airways to close easily.\nAging also causes the air sacs to lose their shape and become baggy.\nThese changes in lung tissue can allow air to get trapped in your lungs. Too little oxygen may enter your blood vessels and less carbon dioxide may be removed. This makes it hard to breathe.\nChanges to the nervous system:\nThe part of the brain that controls breathing may lose some of its function, weakening the automatic breathing functions. When this happens, your lungs are not able to get enough oxygen. Not enough carbon dioxide may leave the lungs. Breathing may get more difficult.\nNerves in your airways that trigger coughing become less sensitive. Large amounts of particles like smoke or germs may collect in the lungs and may be hard to cough up.\nChanges to the immune system:\nYour immune system can get weaker."}

Large amounts of particles like smoke or germs may collect in the lungs and may be hard to cough up.\nChanges to the immune system:\nYour immune system can get weaker. This means your body is less able to fight lung infections and other diseases.\nYour lungs are also less able to recover after exposure to smoke or other harmful particles.\nCOMMON PROBLEMS\nAs a result of these changes, older people are at increased risk for:\nLung infections, such as\npneumonia\nand\nbronchitis\nShortness of breath\nLow oxygen level\nAbnormal breathing patterns, resulting in problems such as\nsleep apnea\n(episodes of stopped breathing during sleep)\nPREVENTION\nTo decrease the effects of aging on the lungs:\nDo not smoke. Avoid exposure to cigarette smoke. Smoking and smoke exposure harm the lungs and speeds up lung aging.\nDo physical exercise to improve lung function.\nGet up and move. Lying in bed or sitting for long periods allows mucus to collect in the lungs. This puts you at risk of lung infections."}
