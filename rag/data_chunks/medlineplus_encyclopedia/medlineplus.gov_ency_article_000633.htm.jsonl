Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nVisceral larva migrans\nVisceral larva migrans\nVisceral larva migrans (VLM) is a human infection with certain parasites found in the intestines of dogs and cats.\nCauses\nVLM is caused by roundworms (Toxocara) that are found in the intestines of dogs and cats.\nEggs produced by these worms are in the feces of the infected animals. The feces mix with soil. Humans can get sick if they accidentally eat soil that has roundworm eggs in it. This can happen by eating fruit or vegetables that were in contact with infected soil and were not washed thoroughly before eating. People can also become infected by eating raw liver from a chicken, lamb, or cow.\nYoung children or people with\npica\nare at high risk for getting VLM. Pica is a disorder involving eating inedible things such as dirt and paint. Most infections in the United States occur in children who play in areas such as sandboxes, which contain soil contaminated by dog or cat feces.\nAfter the worm eggs are swallowed, they break open in the intestine."}

The worms travel throughout the body to various organs, such as the lungs, liver, and eyes. They may also travel to the brain and heart.\nSymptoms\nMild infections may not cause symptoms.\nSerious infections may cause these symptoms:\nAbdominal pain\nCough\n,\nwheezing\nFever\nIrritability\nItchy skin (hives)\nShortness of breath\nIf the eyes are infected, loss of vision and\ncrossed eyes\ncan occur.\nExams and Tests\nPeople with VLM usually seek medical care if they have a cough, fever, wheezing, and other symptoms. They may also have a swollen liver because it is the organ most affected.\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms. If VLM is suspected, tests that may be done include:\nComplete blood count\n(CBC)\nBlood tests to detect antibodies to Toxocara\nTreatment\nThis infection usually goes away on its own and may not require treatment."}

Many conditions cause similar symptoms.\nPrevention\nPrevention includes deworming dogs and cats and preventing them from defecating in public areas. Children should be kept away from areas where dogs and cats may defecate.\nIt is very important to wash your hands thoroughly after touching soil or after touching cats or dogs."}
