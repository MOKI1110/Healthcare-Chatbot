Emotional stress makes it worse.\nAbnormal and sometimes strange postures may occur because of these movements.\nCauses\nThe slow twisting movements of muscles (athetosis) or jerky muscle contractions (dystonia) may be caused by one of many conditions, including:\nCerebral palsy\n(a group of disorders that can involve brain and nervous system functions, such as movement, learning, hearing, seeing, and thinking)\nSide effects of medicines, especially for mental disorders\nEncephalitis\n(irritation and swelling of the brain, most often due to infections)\nGenetic diseases\nHepatic encephalopathy\n(loss of brain function when the liver is unable to remove toxins from the blood)\nHuntington disease\n(disorder that involves breakdown"}
