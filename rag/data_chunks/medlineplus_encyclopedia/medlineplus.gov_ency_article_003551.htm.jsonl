Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHLA-B27 antigen\nHLA-B27 antigen\nHLA-B27 is a blood test to look for a protein that is found on the surface of white blood cells. The protein is called human leukocyte antigen B27 (HLA-B27).\nHuman leukocyte antigens (HLAs) are proteins that help the body's immune system tell the difference between its own cells and foreign, harmful substances. They are made from instructions by inherited genes.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. Most of the time, blood is\ndrawn from a vein\nlocated on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo special steps are needed to prepare for the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, you may feel moderate pain, or only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour health care provider may order this test to help determine the cause of joint pain, stiffness, or swelling."}

Afterward, there may be some throbbing.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour health care provider may order this test to help determine the cause of joint pain, stiffness, or swelling. The test may be done along with other tests, including:\nAnti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP) antibody\nC-reactive protein\nErythrocyte sedimentation rate (\nESR\n)\nRheumatoid factor\nX-rays\nHLA testing\nis also used to match donated tissue with a person's tissue who is getting an organ transplant. For example, it may be done when a person needs a\nkidney transplant\nor\nbone marrow transplant\n.\nNormal Results\nA normal (negative) result means HLA-B27 is absent.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA positive test means HLA-B27 is present. It suggests a greater-than-average risk for developing or having certain autoimmune disorders. An autoimmune disorder is a condition that occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks and destroys healthy body tissue.\nA positive result can help your provider make a diagnosis of a form of arthritis called spondyloarthritis."}

However, HLA-B27 is found in some normal people and does not always mean you have a disease.\nRisks\nRisks from having blood drawn are slight, but may include:\nExcessive bleeding\nFainting or feeling lightheaded\nHematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)\nInfection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)\nAlternative Names\nHuman leukocyte antigen B27; Ankylosing spondylitis-HLA; Psoriatic arthritis-HLA; Reactive arthritis-HLA\nImages\nBlood test\nReferences\nBray R, Sullivan HC, Krummey S, Gebel HM.
