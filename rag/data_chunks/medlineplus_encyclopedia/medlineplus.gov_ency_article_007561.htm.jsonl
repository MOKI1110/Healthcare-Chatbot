This is an area of tissue at the back of an unborn baby's neck. Measuring this thickness helps assess the risk for\nDown syndrome\nand other genetic problems in the baby.\nHow the Test is Performed\nYour health care provider uses\nabdominal ultrasound\nor a\nvaginal ultrasound\nto measure the nuchal fold. All unborn babies have some fluid at the back of their neck. In a baby with Down syndrome or other genetic disorders, there is more fluid than normal. This makes the space look thicker.\nA blood test of the mother is also done. Together, these two tests will tell if the baby could have Down syndrome or another genetic disorder.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nHaving a full bladder will give the best abdominal ultrasound picture. You may be asked to drink 2 to 3 glasses of liquid an hour before the test."}

You may be asked to drink 2 to 3 glasses of liquid an hour before the test. DO NOT urinate before your ultrasound.\nIf a vaginal ultrasound is performed, your bladder should be empty.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may have some discomfort from pressure on your bladder during the ultrasound. The gel used during the test may feel slightly cold and wet. You will not feel the ultrasound waves.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nYour provider may advise this test to screen your baby for Down syndrome. Many pregnant women decide to have this test.\nNuchal translucency is usually done between the 11th and 14th week of pregnancy. It can be done earlier in pregnancy than\namniocentesis\n. Amniocentesis is another test that checks for birth defects.\nNormal Results\nA normal amount of fluid in the back of the neck during ultrasound means it is very unlikely your baby has Down syndrome or another genetic disorder.\nNuchal translucency measurement increases with gestational age. This is the period between conception and birth."}

This is the period between conception and birth. The higher the measurement compared to babies the same gestational age, the higher the risk is for certain genetic disorders.\nA measurement of up to 3 mm is considered a low risk for genetic disorders. However, different clinics may use slightly different numbers based on their experience.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nMore fluid than normal in the back of the neck means there is a higher risk for Down syndrome, trisomy 18, trisomy 13, Turner syndrome, or congenital heart disease. But it does not tell for certain that the baby has Down syndrome or another genetic disorder. A diagnostic test is required to find out if a serious genetic disorder is present.\nThe nuchal translucency test is a screening test. It does not screen for genetic problems in babies. It is helpful in deciding who may need further testing."}
