It does this by measuring the amount of alcohol in the air you breathe out (exhale).\nHow the Test is Performed\nThere are many brands of breath alcohol tests. Each one uses a different method to test the level of alcohol in the breath. The machine may be electronic or manual.\nOne common tester is the balloon type. You blow up the balloon with  one breath until it is full. You then release the air into a glass tube. The tube is filled with bands of yellow crystals. The bands in the tube change colors (from yellow to green), depending on the alcohol content."}

Carefully read the instructions before using the test to make sure you get an accurate result.\nIf an electronic alcohol meter is used, follow the instructions that come with the meter.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nWait 15 minutes after drinking an alcoholic beverage and 1 minute after smoking before starting the test.\nHow the Test will Feel\nThere is no discomfort.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nWhen you drink alcohol, the amount of alcohol in your blood goes up. This is called your blood-alcohol level.\nWhen the amount of alcohol in the blood reaches 0.02% to 0.03%, you may feel a relaxing \"high.\"\nWhen that percentage reaches 0.05% to 0.10%, you have:\nReduced muscle coordination\nA longer reaction time\nImpaired judgment and responses\nDriving and operating machinery when you're \"high\" or drunk (intoxicated) is dangerous. A person with an alcohol level of 0.08% and above is considered legally drunk in most states."}

(Some states have lower levels than others.)\nThe alcohol content of exhaled air accurately reflects the alcohol content of your blood.\nNormal Results\nNormal is when the blood alcohol level is zero.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nWith the balloon method:\n1 green band means that the blood-alcohol level is 0.05% or lower\n2 green bands mean a level between 0.05% and 0.10%\n3 green bands mean a level between 0.10% and 0.15%\nRisks\nThere are no risks with a breath alcohol test.\nConsiderations\nThe test does not measure the driving abilities of a person. Driving abilities vary among people with the same blood-alcohol level. Some people with a level below 0.05% may not be able to safely drive. For people who only drink sometimes, judgment problems occur at a  level of just 0.02%.\nThe breath alcohol test helps you to know how much alcohol it takes to raise the blood-alcohol level to a dangerous level. Each person's response to alcohol varies."}
