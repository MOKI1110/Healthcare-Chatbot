Teens and adults can sometimes get the infection. HFMD usually occurs in the summer and early fall.\nThe virus can spread from person-to-person through tiny, air droplets that are released when the sick person sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose. You can catch hand-foot-mouth disease if:\nA person with the infection sneezes, coughs, or blows their nose near you.\nYou touch your nose, eyes, or mouth after you have touched something contaminated by the virus, such as a toy or doorknob.\nYou touch stools or fluid from the blisters of an infected person.\nThe virus is most easily spread the first week a person has the disease.\nSymptoms\nThe time between contact with the virus and the start of symptoms is about 3 to 7 days."}

Symptoms include:\nFever\nHeadache\nLoss of appetite\nRash with very small blisters on the hands, feet, and diaper area that may be tender or painful when pressed\nSore throat\nUlcers\nin the throat (including tonsils), mouth, and tongue\nExams and Tests\nThe health care provider will perform a physical exam. Usually, a diagnosis can be made from asking about the symptoms and the rash on the hands and feet.\nTreatment\nThere is no specific treatment for the infection other than symptom relief.\nAntibiotics do not work because the infection is caused by a virus. (Antibiotics treat infections caused by bacteria, not viruses.) To relieve symptoms, the following home care can be used:\nOver-the-counter medicines, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can be used to treat fever. Aspirin should not be given for viral illnesses in children under age 18.\nSalt water mouth rinses (1/2 teaspoon, or 6 grams, of salt to 1 glass of warm water) may be soothing.\nDrink plenty of fluids."}
