Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCushing disease\nCushing disease\nCushing disease is a condition in which the pituitary gland releases too much adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). The pituitary gland is an organ of the\nendocrine system\n.\nCushing disease is a cause of\nCushing syndrome\n.  Other causes of Cushing syndrome include\nexogenous Cushing syndrome\n,\nCushing syndrome caused by an adrenal tumor\n, and\nectopic Cushing syndrome\n.\nCauses\nCushing disease is caused by a\ntumor\nor excess growth (\nhyperplasia\n) of the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is located just below the base of the brain. A type of pituitary tumor called an adenoma is the most common cause. An adenoma is a benign tumor (not a cancer).\nWith Cushing disease, the pituitary gland releases too much ACTH. ACTH stimulates production and release of cortisol, a stress hormone. Too much ACTH causes the adrenal glands to make too much cortisol.\nCortisol is normally released during stressful situations."}

After surgery, the pituitary gland may slowly start to work again and return to normal.\nDuring the recovery process from surgery, you may need cortisol replacement treatments because  the pituitary needs time to start making ACTH again.\nRadiation treatment of the pituitary gland may also be used if the tumor is not completely removed.\nIf the tumor does not respond to surgery or radiation, you may need medicines to stop your body from making cortisol.\nIf these treatments are not successful, the adrenal glands may need to be removed to stop the high levels of cortisol from being produced. Removal of the adrenal glands can cause the pituitary tumor to get much bigger (Nelson syndrome).\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nUntreated, Cushing disease can cause severe illness, even death."}
