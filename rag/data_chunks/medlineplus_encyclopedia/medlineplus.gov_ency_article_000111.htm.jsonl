Breathing into a paper bag -- or using a mask that causes you to re-breathe carbon dioxide -- sometimes helps reduce symptoms when anxiety is the main cause of the condition. However, this method has recently been questioned by experts, especially when there is actual lung disease not just anxiety or a panic attack causing the respiratory alkalosis. Ask your provider what approach is best for you.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outlook depends on the condition that is causing the respiratory alkalosis.\nPossible Complications\nSeizures\nmay occur if the alkalosis is extremely severe."}
