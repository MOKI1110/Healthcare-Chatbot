It is done when part of your small bowel is blocked or diseased.\nThe small bowel is also called the small intestine. Most digestion (breaking down and absorbing nutrients) of the food you eat takes place in the small intestine.\nDescription\nYou will receive\ngeneral anesthesia\nat the time of your surgery. This will keep you asleep and pain-free.\nThe surgery can be performed laparoscopically, with a robot, or open surgery.\nIf you have laparoscopic or robotic surgery:\nYour surgeon makes 3 to 5 small cuts (incisions) in your lower belly. A medical device called a laparoscope is inserted through one of the cuts. The scope is a thin, lighted tube with a camera on the end. It lets the surgeon see inside your belly."}

A medical device called a laparoscope is inserted through one of the cuts. The scope is a thin, lighted tube with a camera on the end. It lets the surgeon see inside your belly. Other medical instruments are inserted through the other cuts.\nA cut of about 2 to 3 inches (in) or 5 to 7.6 centimeters (cm) may also be made if your surgeon needs to put their hand inside your belly to feel the intestine or remove the diseased segment.\nYour belly is filled with a harmless gas to expand it. This makes it easier for your surgeon to see and work.\nThe diseased part of your small intestine is located and removed.\nIf you have open surgery:\nThe surgeon makes a cut of 6 to 8 in (15.2 to 20.3 cm) in your mid-belly.\nThe diseased part of your small intestine is located and removed.\nIn both kinds of surgery, the next steps are:\nIf there is enough healthy small intestine left, the ends are stitched or stapled together. This is called an anastomosis. Most patients have this done.\nIf there is not enough healthy small intestine to reconnect, your surgeon makes an opening called a stoma through the skin of your belly. The small intestine is attached to the outer wall of your belly."}

The ileostomy may be either short-term or permanent.\nSmall bowel resection usually takes 1 to 4 hours.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nSmall bowel resection is used to treat:\nblockage in the intestine\ncaused by scar tissue or congenital (from birth) deformities\nBleeding, infection, or\nulcers\ncaused by inflammation of the small intestine from conditions such as\nCrohn disease\nCancer\nCarcinoid tumor\nInjuries to the small intestine\nMeckel diverticulum\n(a pouch on the wall of the lower part of the intestine that is present at birth)\nNoncancerous (benign) tumors\nPrecancerous polyps\nForeign object in the small bowel\nRisks\nRisks of anesthesia and surgery in general are:\nReactions to medicines\nBreathing problems\nBlood clots, bleeding, infection\nNausea and vomiting\nRisks of having this surgery include:\nBulging tissue through the incision, called an incisional\nhernia\nDamage to nearby organs in the"}

These medicines are called blood thinners. This includes over-the-counter medicines and supplements such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn), and vitamin E. Many prescription medicines are also blood thinners.\nAsk your surgeon which medicines you should still take on the day of your surgery.\nLet your surgeon know about any illness you may have before your surgery.
