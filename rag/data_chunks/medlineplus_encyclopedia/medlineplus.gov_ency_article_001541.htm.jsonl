Speech sound disorders are the inability to correctly form the sounds of words. Speech sound disorders also include articulation disorder, disfluency, and voice disorders.\nChildren with phonological disorder do not use some or all of the speech sounds to form words as expected for a child their age.\nCauses\nThis disorder is more common in boys.\nThe cause of phonological disorders in children is often unknown."}

Close relatives may have had speech and language problems.\nSymptoms\nIn a child developing normal speech patterns:\nBy age 3, at least one half of what a child says should be understood by a stranger.\nThe child should make most sounds correctly by age 4 or 5, except for a few sounds such as\nl\n,\ns\n,\nr\n,\nv\n,\nz\n,\nch\n,\nsh,\nand\nth\n.\nHarder sounds may not be completely correct until age 7 or 8.\nIt is normal for young children to make speech errors as their language develops.\nChildren with a phonological disorder keep using incorrect speech patterns past the age they should have stopped using them.\nIncorrect speech rules or patterns include dropping the first or last sound of each word or replacing certain sounds for others.\nChildren may leave out a sound even though they are able to pronounce the same sound when it occurs in other words or in nonsensical syllables."}

For example, a child who drops last consonants may say \"boo\" for \"book\" and \"pi\" for \"pig\", but may have no problem saying words like \"key\" or \"go\".\nThese errors may make it hard for other people to understand the child. Only family members may be able to understand a child who has a more severe phonological speech disorder.\nExams and Tests\nA speech language pathologist can diagnose a phonological disorder. They may ask the child to say certain words and then use a test such as the Arizona-4 (Arizona Articulation and Phonology Scale, 4th revision).\nChildren should be examined to help rule out disorders not linked with phonological disorders."}

These include:\nCognitive problems (such as\nintellectual disability\n)\nHearing impairment\nNeurological conditions (such as\ncerebral palsy\n)\nPhysical problems (such as\ncleft palate\n)\nYour health care provider should ask questions, such as  if more than one language or a certain dialect is spoken at home.\nTreatment\nMilder forms of this disorder may go away on their own by around age 6.\nSpeech therapy may help more severe symptoms or speech problems that don't get better. Therapy may help the child create the sound. For example, a speech therapist can show where to place the tongue or how to form the lips when making a sound.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nThe outcome depends on the age the disorder started and how severe it is. Many children  will go on to  develop almost normal speech.\nPossible Complications\nIn severe cases, the child may have problems being understood even by family members. In milder forms, the child may have trouble being understood by people outside the family."}
