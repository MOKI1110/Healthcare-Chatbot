This can cause pain, heavy vaginal bleeding, vaginal bleeding between periods, and problems getting pregnant (\ninfertility\n).\nCauses\nEvery month, a woman's ovaries produce hormones that tell the cells lining the uterus to swell and get thicker. Your uterus sheds these cells along with blood and tissue through your vagina when you have your period.\nEndometriosis occurs when these cells grow outside the uterus in other parts of your body. This tissue may attach on your:\nOvaries\nFallopian tubes\nBowel\nRectum\nBladder\nLining of your pelvic area\nIt can grow in other areas of the body, too.\nThese growths stay in your body, and like the cells in the lining of your uterus, these growths react to the hormones from your ovaries. This may cause you to have pain during the month prior to the onset of your period. Over time, the growths may add more tissue and blood."}

This may cause you to have pain during the month prior to the onset of your period. Over time, the growths may add more tissue and blood. Growths can also build up in the abdomen and pelvis, leading to chronic pelvic pain, heavy cycles, and infertility.\nThe cause of endometriosis is unknown. One idea is that when you get your period, the cells may travel backwards through the fallopian tubes into the pelvis. Once there, the cells attach and grow. However, this backward period flow occurs in many women. The immune system may play a role in causing endometriosis in women with the condition.\nEndometriosis is common. It occurs in about 10% of women of reproductive age. Sometimes, it may run in families. Endometriosis probably starts when a woman begins having periods. However, it usually is not diagnosed until ages 25 to 35.\nYou are more likely to develop endometriosis if you:\nHave a mother or sister with endometriosis\nStarted your period at a young age\nNever had children\nHave frequent periods, or they last 7 or more days\nSymptoms\nPain is the main symptom of endometriosis."}

Some types of hormone therapy will also prevent you from getting pregnant while you are taking the medicine.\nBirth control pills -- With this therapy, you take the hormone pills (not the inactive or placebo pills) for 6 to 9 months continuously. Taking these pills relieves most symptoms. However, it does not treat any damage that has already occurred. But it may prevent ongoing damage for as long as the hormone-containing pills are taken. Many young patients will choose to continue this treatment indefinitely or until they wish to attempt pregnancy.\nProgesterone pills, injections, IUD -- This treatment helps shrink growths. Side effects may include weight gain and depression.\nGonadotropin-agonist medicines -- These medicines stop your ovaries from producing the hormone estrogen. This causes a menopause-like state. Side effects include hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and mood changes."}

It may also help protect against bone loss, while not triggering growth of the endometriosis.\nGonadotropin-antagonist medicine -- This oral medication helps lower production of estrogen resulting in a menopausal-like state and controls the growth of endometrial tissue, resulting in less severe painful and heavy menses.\nSURGERY\nYour provider may recommend surgery if you have severe pain that does not get better with other treatments.\nLaparoscopy\nhelps diagnose the disease and can also remove growths and scar tissue.
