It is spread by the bite of the Rocky Mountain wood tick (\nDermacentor andersoni\n).\nCauses\nThis disease is usually seen between March and September. Most cases occur in April, May, and June.\nCTF is seen most often in the western United States and Canada at elevations higher than 4,000 feet (1,219 meters). The CTF virus is transmitted by a\ntick bite\nor, in very rare cases, by a blood transfusion.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of CTF most often start 1 to 14 days after the tick bite. A sudden fever continues for 3 days, goes away, then comes back 1 to 3 days later for another few days. Other symptoms include:\nFeeling weak all over and muscle aches\nHeadache behind the eyes (typically during fever)\nLethargy (sleepiness) or confusion\nNausea and vomiting\nRash (may be light colored)\nSensitivity to light (\nphotophobia\n)\nSweating\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will examine you and ask about your signs and symptoms."}
