These pumps are implanted in your body. In most cases, they are connected to machinery outside your body.\nDescription\nA ventricular assist device has 3 parts:\nA pump. The pump weighs 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram). It is placed inside or outside of your belly.\nAn electronic controller. The controller is a small computer that controls how the pump works.\nBatteries or another power source. The batteries are carried outside your body. They are connected to the pump with a cable that goes into your belly.\nIf you are having an implanted VAD placed, you will need general anesthesia. This will make you sleep and be pain-free during the procedure.\nDuring surgery:\nThe heart surgeon opens the middle of your chest with a surgical cut and then separates your breastbone."}

This will make you sleep and be pain-free during the procedure.\nDuring surgery:\nThe heart surgeon opens the middle of your chest with a surgical cut and then separates your breastbone. This allows access to your heart.\nDepending on the pump used, the surgeon will make space for the pump under your skin and tissue in the upper part of your belly wall.\nThe surgeon will then place the pump in this space.\nA tube will connect the pump to your heart. Another tube will connect the pump to your aorta or one of your other major arteries. Another tube will be passed through your skin to connect the pump to the controller and batteries.\nThe VAD will take blood from your ventricle (one of the main pumping chambers of the heart) through the tube that leads to the pump. Then the device will pump the blood back out to one of your arteries and through your body.\nSurgery most often lasts 4 to 6 hours.\nThere are other types of VADs (called percutaneous ventricular assist devices) which can be placed with less invasive techniques to help the left or right ventricle."}

However, these typically cannot provide as much flow (support) as the surgically implanted ones.\nWhy the Procedure is Performed\nYou may need a VAD if you have severe\nheart failure\nthat cannot be controlled with medicine, pacing devices, or other treatments. You may get this device while you are on a waiting list for a heart transplant. Some people who get a VAD are very ill and may already be on a heart-lung support machine.\nNot everyone with severe heart failure is a good candidate for this procedure.\nRisks\nRisks for this surgery are:\nBlood clots in the legs that may travel to the lungs\nBlood clots that form in the device and can travel to other parts of the body\nBreathing problems\nHeart attack or\nstroke\nAllergic reactions to the anesthesia medicines used during surgery\nInfections\nBleeding\nDeath\nBefore the Procedure\nMany people will already be in the hospital for treatment of their heart failure.\nAfter the Procedure\nMost people who are put on a VAD spend from a few to several days in"}

You may stay in the hospital for a week or longer after you have had the pump placed. During this time you will learn how to care for the pump.\nLess invasive VADs are not designed for ambulatory patients and those patients need to stay in the ICU for the duration of their use. They are sometimes used as a bridge to a surgical VAD or heart recovery.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nA VAD may help people who have heart failure live longer. It may also help improve patients' quality of life.\nAlternative Names\nVAD; RVAD; LVAD; BVAD; Right ventricular assist device; Left ventricular assist device; Biventricular assist device; Heart pump; Left ventricular assist system; LVAS; Implantable ventricular assist device; Heart failure - VAD; Cardiomyopathy - VAD\nPatient Instructions\nAngina - discharge\nHeart attack - discharge\nHeart failure - discharge\nSurgical wound care - open\nImages\nHeart - section through the middle\nReferences\nAaronson KD, Pagan FD."}
