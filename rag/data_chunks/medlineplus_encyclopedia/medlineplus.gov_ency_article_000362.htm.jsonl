They may diet or exercise too much or use other ways to lose weight.\nCauses\nThe exact causes of anorexia are not known. Many factors may be involved. Genes and hormones may play a role. Social attitudes that promote very thin body types may also be involved.\nRisk factors for anorexia include:\nBeing more worried about, or paying more attention to, weight and body shape\nHaving an anxiety disorder as a child\nHaving a negative self-image\nHaving eating problems during infancy or early childhood\nHaving certain social or cultural ideas about health and beauty\nTrying to be perfect or overly focused on rules\nAnorexia often begins during the pre-teen or teen years or young adulthood."}

Most people with anorexia deny that they have an eating disorder. They often seek treatment only when their condition is serious.\nGoals of treatment are to restore normal body weight and eating habits. A weight gain of 1 to 3 pounds (lb) or 0.5 to 1.5 kilograms (kg) per week is considered a safe goal.\nDifferent programs have been designed to treat anorexia."}

This is followed by a day treatment program.\nA longer hospital stay may be needed if:\nThe person has lost a lot of weight (being below 70% of their ideal body weight for their age and height). For severe and life-threatening\nmalnutrition\n, the person may need to be fed through a vein or stomach tube.\nWeight loss continues, even with treatment.\nMedical complications, such as heart problems, confusion, or low potassium levels develop.\nThe person has severe depression or thinks about committing suicide.\nCare providers who are usually involved in these programs include:\nNurse practitioners\nPhysicians\nPhysician assistants\nDietitians\nMental health care providers\nTreatment is often very difficult.

Many therapies may be tried until the disorder is under control.\nPeople may drop out of programs if they have unrealistic hopes of being cured with therapy alone.\nDifferent kinds of talk therapy are used to treat people with anorexia:\nCognitive behavioral therapy (a type of talk therapy), group therapy, and family therapy have all been successful.\nGoal of therapy is to change a person's thoughts or behavior to encourage them to eat in a healthier way. This kind of therapy is more useful for treating younger people who have not had anorexia for a long time.\nIf the person is young, therapy may involve the whole family. The family is seen as a part of the solution, instead of the cause of the eating disorder.\nSupport groups may also be a part of treatment."}

In support groups, people with anorexia and their families meet and share what they have been through.\nMedicines such as antidepressants, antipsychotics, and mood stabilizers may help some people when given as part of a complete treatment program. These medicines can help treat depression or anxiety. Although medicines may help, none has been proven to decrease the desire to lose weight.\nSupport Groups\nThe stress of illness can be eased by joining a\nsupport group\n. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nAnorexia is a serious condition that can be life threatening. Treatment programs can help people with the condition return to a normal weight. But it is common for the disease to relapse.\nWomen who develop this eating disorder at an early age have a better chance of recovering completely."}
