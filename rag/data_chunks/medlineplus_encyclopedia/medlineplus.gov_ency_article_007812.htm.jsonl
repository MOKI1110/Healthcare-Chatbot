Your body needs lipids for proper body functions, growth, and energy. Two important types of lipids found in the blood are cholesterol and\ntriglycerides\n. High levels of lipids in your blood may clog your arteries and increase your risk of\nheart disease\nand\nstroke\n.\nA lipid profile is a blood test to measure different types of lipids:\nTotal cholesterol\n: This is the measure of all the cholesterol in your blood.\nHigh-density lipoprotein cholesterol (\nHDL [good] cholesterol\n): HDL helps remove LDL from your blood.\nLow-density lipoprotein cholesterol (\nLDL [bad] cholesterol\n): LDL can build up in your blood vessels and increase your heart disease risk.\nVery low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (\nVLDL cholesterol\n): VLDL moves triglycerides from your liver to other cells. VLDL can also build up in your blood vessels.\nTriglycerides: Your body makes some triglycerides. Triglycerides also come from the food you eat."}

VLDL can also build up in your blood vessels.\nTriglycerides: Your body makes some triglycerides. Triglycerides also come from the food you eat. Extra calories are turned into triglycerides and stored in fat cells for later use.\nHow the Test is Performed\nA blood sample is needed. Most of the time,\nblood is drawn from a vein\nlocated on the inside of the elbow or the back of the hand.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou should not eat for 9 to 12 hours before the test. If you don't fast, only values for total cholesterol and HDL may be useful.\nAlcohol and some medicines can interfere with blood test results.\nMake sure your health care provider knows what medicines you take, including over-the-counter medicines and supplements.\nYour provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines before you have this test.\nDo not stop or change your medicines without talking to your provider first.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain or a sting when the needle is inserted."}

You may also feel some throbbing at the site after the blood is drawn.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nA lipid profile test helps you and your provider understand your risk for heart disease.\nYou also may have this test to see how well you are responding to medicines to help lower your cholesterol.\nNormal Results\nThe most common ideal results for these levels are:\nTotal cholesterol below 200 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 5.18 millimoles per liter (mmol/L).\nHDL from 40 to 60 mg/dL (1.04 to 1.55 mmol/L), though even higher is better.\nLDL generally below 100 mg/dL (2.59 mmol/L). For people with heart or other vascular disease, it should be below 70 mg/dL (1.81mmol/L).\nVLDL 2 to 30 mg/dL (0.05 to 0.78 mmol/L).\nTriglycerides below 150 mg/dL (3.88 mmol/L) for adults and lower than 90 mg/dL (2.33 mmol/L) for 10 to 19 year olds.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories."}

Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nIf your lipid profile testing is abnormal, your provider may recommend lifestyle changes, cholesterol-lowering medicine, or continued monitoring of your blood lipid levels.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
