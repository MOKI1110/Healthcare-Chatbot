The disease used to be called\nPneumocystis carinii\nor PCP pneumonia.\nCauses\nThis type of pneumonia is caused by the fungus\nPneumocystis jirovecii\n. This fungus is common in the environment and rarely causes illness in healthy people.\nHowever, it can cause a lung infection in people with a weakened immune system due to:\nCancer\nLong-term use of corticosteroids or other medicines that weaken the immune system\nHIV/AIDS\nOrgan or\nbone marrow transplantation\nPneumocystis jirovecii\nwas a rare infection before the AIDS epidemic. Before the use of preventive antibiotics for the condition, most people in the United States with advanced AIDS developed this infection.\nSymptoms\nPneumocystis pneumonia in  people with AIDS usually develops slowly over days to weeks or even months, and is less severe."}
