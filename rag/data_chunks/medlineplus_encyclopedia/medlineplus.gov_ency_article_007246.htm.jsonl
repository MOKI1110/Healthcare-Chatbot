It is only put in when babies need IV nutrients or medicines for a long time.\nHOW IS A CENTRAL VENOUS LINE PLACED?\nThe central venous line is put in at the hospital. The health care provider will:\nGive the baby pain medicine.\nClean the skin on the chest with a germ-killing solution (antiseptic).\nMake a small surgical cut in the chest or groin.\nPlace a hollow needle into a small vein in the arm or leg.\nPut the catheter through the hollow needle into a vein.\nPush the catheter in until the tip is close to the heart often using ultrasound guidance.\nTake an x-ray to make sure the central venous line is in the right place.\nWHAT ARE THE RISKS OF A CENTRAL VENOUS LINE?\nRisks include:\nThere is a small risk for infection. The longer the central venous line is in, the greater the risk.\nBlood clots can form in the veins leading to the heart.\nThe catheters can wear away the blood vessel wall.\nIV fluids or medicine can leak into other parts of the body. This is rare, but this can cause serious bleeding, breathing problems, and problems with the heart.\nIf the baby has any of these problems, the central venous line may be taken out."}
