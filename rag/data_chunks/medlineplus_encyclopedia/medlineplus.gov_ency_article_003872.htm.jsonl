This is the tissue that surrounds the heart.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThe procedure is most often done in a special procedure room, such as a cardiac catheterization laboratory. It may also be done at a patient's hospital bedside. A health care provider will put an\nIV\ninto your arm in case fluids or medicines need to be given through a vein. For example, you may be given medicines if your heartbeat slows or your blood pressure drops during the procedure.\nThe doctor doing the procedure will clean an area just below or next to the breastbone or below the left nipple. Numbing medicine (anesthetic) will be applied to the area.\nThe doctor will then insert a needle and guide it into tissue that surrounds the heart. Often,\nechocardiography\n(ultrasound) is used to help the doctor see the needle and any fluid drainage."}

Often,\nechocardiography\n(ultrasound) is used to help the doctor see the needle and any fluid drainage. An electrocardiogram (\nECG\n) and moving x-ray images (fluoroscopy) may also be used to help with positioning.\nOnce the needle has reached the correct area, it is removed and replaced with a tube called a catheter. Fluid drains through this tube into containers. Most of the time, the pericardial catheter is left in place so draining may continue for several hours.\nSurgical drainage may be needed if the problem is hard to correct or comes back. This is a more invasive procedure in which the pericardium is drained into the chest (pleural) cavity. Alternatively, the fluid may be drained into the peritoneal cavity, but this is less common. This procedure may need to be done under general anesthesia.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYou may not be able to eat or drink for 6 hours before the test. You must sign a consent form.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel pressure as the needle enters."}

Some people have\nchest pain\n, which may require pain medicine.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nThis test may be done to remove and examine fluid that is pressing on the heart. It is most often done to find the cause of a chronic or recurrent\npericardial effusion\n.\nIt may also be done to treat\ncardiac tamponade\n, which is a life-threatening condition.\nNormal Results\nThere is normally a small amount of clear, straw-colored fluid in the pericardial space.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nAbnormal findings may indicate the cause of pericardial fluid accumulation, such as:\nCancer\nCardiac perforation\nCardiac trauma\nCongestive heart failure\nPericarditis\nRenal failure\nInfection\nRupture of a ventricular\naneurysm\nRisks\nRisks may include:\nBleeding\nCollapsed lung\nHeart attack\nInfection (pericarditis)\nIrregular heartbeats (\narrhythmias\n)\nPuncture of the heart muscle, coronary artery, lung, liver, or stomach\nPneumopericardium (air in the pericardial sac)\nAlternative Names\nPericardial tap; Percutaneous pericardi"}
