A single seizure that does not happen again is not epilepsy.\nCauses\nEpilepsy may be due to a medical condition or injury that affects the brain. Or the cause may be unknown.\nCommon causes of epilepsy include:\nTraumatic brain injury\nDamage or scarring after infections of the brain\nBirth defects that involve the brain\nBrain injury that occurs during or near birth\nMetabolic disorders present at birth (such as\nphenylketonuria\n)\nBenign or malignant brain tumor, often very small\nAbnormal blood vessels in the brain\nStroke\nHereditary conditions (run in families)\nOther illnesses that damage or destroy brain tissue\nEpileptic seizures usually start between ages 5 and 20. But they can happen at any age. There may be a family history of seizures or epilepsy.\nfebrile seizure\nis a\nconvulsion\nin a child triggered by a fever."}

But they can happen at any age. There may be a family history of seizures or epilepsy.\nfebrile seizure\nis a\nconvulsion\nin a child triggered by a fever. Most of the time, a febrile seizure is not a sign that the child has epilepsy.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms vary from child to child. Some children may simply stare. Others may shake violently and lose alertness. The movements or symptoms of a seizure may depend on the part of the brain that is affected.\nYour child's health care provider can tell you more about the specific type of seizure your child may  have:\nAbsence (petit mal) seizure\n: Staring spells\nGeneralized tonic-clonic (grand mal) seizure\n: Involves the entire body, including aura (specific warning symptoms), rigid muscles, and loss of alertness\nPartial (focal) seizure\n: Can involve any of the symptoms described above, depending on where in the brain the seizure starts\nSome children can have more than one type of seizure. Most of the time, the seizure is similar to the one before it, although that may change over time. Some children have a strange sensation before a seizure."}

Sensations may be tingling, smelling an odor that is not actually there, feeling fear or anxiety for no reason or having a sense of dÃ©jÃ  vu (feeling that something has happened before). This is called an aura.\nExams and Tests\nThe provider will:\nAsk about your child's medical and family history in detail\nAsk about the seizure episode\nDo a physical exam of your child, including a detailed look at the brain and nervous system\nYour child's provider may order an\nelectroencephalogram\n(EEG) to check the electrical activity in the brain. This test often shows any abnormal electrical activity in the brain. In some cases, the test shows the area in the brain where the seizures start."}

The brain may appear normal after a seizure or between seizures.\nTo diagnose epilepsy or plan for epilepsy surgery, your child may need to:\nWear an EEG recorder for few days during day-to-day activities\nStay in the hospital where brain activity can be watched on video cameras (video EEG)\nYour child's provider also may order other tests, including:\nBlood chemistry\nBlood sugar\nComplete blood count (CBC)\nKidney function tests\nLiver function tests\nLumbar puncture (spinal tap)\nTests for infectious or metabolic diseases\nHead CT\nor\nMRI\nscan are often done to find the cause and location of the problem in the brain. Much less often,\nPET scan of the brain\nis needed to help plan surgery.\nTreatment\nTreatment for epilepsy includes:\nMedicines\nLifestyle changes\nSurgery\nIf your child's epilepsy is due to a tumor, abnormal blood vessels, or bleeding in the brain, surgery may be needed.\nMedicines to prevent seizures are called antiseizure medicines."}

They are also known as anticonvulsants or antiepileptic medicines. These may reduce the number of future seizures.\nThese medicines are taken by mouth, but some can be given by feeding tube, or intravenously (IV). The type of medicine prescribed depends on the type of seizure your child has.\nThe dosage may need to be changed from time to time. Your provider may order regular blood tests to check for side effects.\nAlways make sure your child takes the medicine on time and as directed. Missing a dose can cause your child to have a seizure. Do not stop or change medicines on your own. Talk to your child's provider first.\nOther medicines are used to stop a seizure that doesn't stop on its own. These can be given under the tongue or by an injection into the muscle. They are called rescue medicines.\nMany antiseizure medicines may affect your child's bone health."}

Talk to your child's provider about whether your child needs vitamins and other supplements.\nEpilepsy that is not well controlled after trying a number of antiseizure medicines is called medically refractory epilepsy. In this case, your child's provider may recommend surgery to:\nRemove the abnormal brain cells causing the seizures.\nPlace a vagal nerve stimulator (VNS). This device is similar to a heart pacemaker. It can help reduce the number of seizures.\nSome children are placed on a special diet to help prevent seizures. The most popular one is the ketogenic diet. A diet low in carbohydrates, such as the Atkins diet, also may be helpful. Be sure to discuss these options with your child's provider before trying them.\nEpilepsy is often a lifelong or chronic illness."}

Be sure to talk with your child's provider if you have concerns.\nSupport Groups\nThe stress of being a caretaker of a child with epilepsy can often be helped by joining a\nsupport group\n. In these groups, members share common experiences and problems.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost children with epilepsy live a normal life. Certain types of childhood epilepsy go away or improve with age, usually in the late teens or 20s.
