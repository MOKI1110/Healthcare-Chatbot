It can be caused by many different germs, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi.\nThis article discusses pneumonia that occurs in a person who has a hard time fighting off infection because of problems with the immune system. This type of disease is called \"pneumonia in an immunocompromised host.\"\nRelated conditions include:\nHospital-acquired pneumonia\nPneumocystis jiroveci\n(previously called\nPneumocystis carinii\n) pneumonia\nPneumonia cytomegalovirus\nFungal pneumonia\nPneumonia\nViral pneumonia\nWalking pneumonia\nCauses\nPeople whose immune system is not working well are less able to fight off germs. This makes them prone to infections from germs that do not often cause disease in healthy people."}
