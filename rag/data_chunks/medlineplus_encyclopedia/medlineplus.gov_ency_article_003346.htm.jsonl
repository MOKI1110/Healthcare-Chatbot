Some medicines cause your PSA level to be falsely low.\nIn most cases, no other special steps are needed to prepare for this test. You should not have a PSA test soon after having a urinary tract infection or undergoing a procedure or surgery involving the urinary system. Ask your provider how long you should wait.\nHow the Test will Feel\nYou may feel slight pain or a prick when the needle is inserted. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise."}

But there is debate over the value of the PSA test for detecting prostate cancer. No single answer fits all men.\nFor some men 55 through 69 years old, screening may help reduce the chance of death from prostate cancer. However, for many men, screening and treatment could potentially be more harmful than beneficial."}

However, for many men, screening and treatment could potentially be more harmful than beneficial. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against PSA-based screening for prostate cancer in men 70 years and older.\nBefore having the test, talk to your provider about the pros and cons of having a PSA test. Ask about:\nWhether screening decreases your chance of dying from prostate cancer\nWhether there is any harm from prostate cancer screening, such as side-effects from testing or overtreatment of cancer when discovered\nSome men younger than age 55 have a higher than usual chance of developing prostate cancer and should talk with their provider about PSA screening if they:\nHave a family history of prostate cancer (especially a brother or father)\nAre African American\nNormal Results\nThe PSA test result cannot diagnose prostate cancer."}

The lower the level of this test, the more likely it is that prostate cancer is present.\nOther tests may also be done. The exact role of these tests in deciding on treatment is unclear.\nA urine test called PCA-3.\nAn MRI of the prostate may help identify cancer in an area of the prostate that is hard to reach during a biopsy.\nIf you have been treated for prostate cancer, the PSA level can show if treatment is working or if the cancer has come back. Often, PSA level rises before there are any symptoms. This may happen months or years beforehand.\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others."}
