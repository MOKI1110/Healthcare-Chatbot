Many factors may be involved:\nGenetic -- SPD seems to be more common among relatives of people with SPD. Studies have shown that some gene variants are found more often in people with SPD.\nPsychological -- A person's personality, ability to deal with stress, and handle relationships with others may contribute to SPD.\nEnvironmental -- Emotional trauma as a child and chronic stress may also play roles in developing SPD.\nSymptoms\nSPD should not be confused with\nschizophrenia\n. People with SPD can have odd beliefs and behaviors, but unlike people with schizophrenia, they are not disconnected from reality and usually do not\nhallucinate\n. They also do not have delusions.\nPeople with SPD may be very disturbed."}

They also do not have delusions.\nPeople with SPD may be very disturbed. They may also have unusual preoccupations and fears, such as fear of being monitored by government agencies.\nMore commonly, people with this disorder behave oddly and have unusual beliefs (such as believing in aliens). They cling to these beliefs so strongly that they have difficulty forming and keeping close relationships.\nPeople with SPD may also have depression. A second personality disorder, such as\nborderline personality disorder\n, is also common. Mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders are also common among people with SPD.\nCommon signs of SPD include:\nDiscomfort in social situations\nInappropriate displays of feelings\nNo close friends\nOdd behavior or appearance\nOdd beliefs, fantasies, or preoccupations\nOdd speech\nExams and Tests\nSPD is diagnosed based on a psychological evaluation. The health care provider will consider how long and how severe the person's symptoms have been.\nTreatment\nTalk therapy is an important part of treatment."}

Medicines may also be a helpful addition if mood or anxiety disorders are also present.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSPD is usually a long-term (\nchronic\n) illness. The outcome of treatment varies based on the severity of the disorder.\nPossible Complications\nComplications may include:\nPoor social skills\nLack of interpersonal relationships\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nSee your provider or a mental health professional if you or someone you know has symptoms of SPD.\nPrevention\nThere is no known prevention.
