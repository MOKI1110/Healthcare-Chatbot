The machine sends out high-frequency sound waves, which reflect off body structures. A computer receives the waves and uses them to create a picture. Unlike with an\nx-ray\nor\nCT scan\n, this test does not use ionizing radiation.\nThe test is done in the ultrasound or radiology department.\nYou will lie down for the test.\nA clear, water-based gel is applied to the skin on the area to be examined. The gel helps with the transmission of the sound waves.\nA handheld probe called a transducer is moved over the area being examined. You may need to change position so that other areas can be examined.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nYour preparation will depend on the part of the body being examined.\nHow the Test will Feel\nMost of the time, ultrasound procedures do not cause discomfort. The conducting gel may feel a little cold and wet."}

Talk to your health care provider about your questions and concerns.\nRisks\nThere are no known risks. The test does not use ionizing radiation.\nConsiderations\nSome types of ultrasound tests need to be done with a probe that is inserted into your body."}
