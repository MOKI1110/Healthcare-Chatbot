The average is around 12 years old. If no periods have occurred when a girl is older than 15, further testing may be needed. The need is more urgent if she has gone through other normal changes that occur during puberty.\nBeing born with incompletely formed genital or pelvic organs can lead to a lack of menstrual periods. Some of these defects include:\nBlockages or narrowing of the cervix\nHymen\nthat has no opening\nMissing uterus or vagina\nVaginal septum (a wall that divides the vagina into 2 sections)\nHormones play a big role in a woman's menstrual cycle."}
