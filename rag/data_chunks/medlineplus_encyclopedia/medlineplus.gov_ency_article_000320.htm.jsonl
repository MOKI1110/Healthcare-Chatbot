It occurs when the body starts breaking down fat at a rate that is much too fast. The liver processes the fat into a fuel called ketones, which causes the blood to become acidic.\nCauses\nDKA happens when the signal from insulin in the body is so low that:\nBlood sugar (glucose) can't go into cells to be used as a fuel source.\nThe liver makes a large amount of glucose.\nFat is broken down too rapidly for the body to process.\nThe fat is broken down by the liver into a fuel called ketones. Ketones are normally produced by the liver when the body breaks down fat after it has been a long time since your last meal. These ketones are normally used by the muscles and the heart. When ketones are produced too quickly and build up in the blood, they can be toxic by making the blood acidic."}

This condition is known as ketoacidosis.\nDKA is sometimes the first sign of\ntype 1 diabetes\nin people who have not yet been diagnosed with diabetes. It can also occur in someone who has already been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Infection, injury, a serious illness, missing doses of insulin shots, or the stress of surgery can lead to DKA in people with type 1 diabetes.\nPeople with\ntype 2 diabetes\ncan develop euglycemic DKA or hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state."}

It is usually triggered by prolonged uncontrolled blood sugar, missing doses of medicines, as a side effect of some medicines, or a severe illness or infection.\nSymptoms\nCommon symptoms of DKA can include:\nDecreased alertness\nDeep,\nrapid breathing\nDehydration\nDry skin and mouth\nFlushed face\nFrequent urination\nor\nthirst that lasts for a day or more\nFruity-smelling breath\nHeadache\nMuscle stiffness or aches\nNausea and vomiting\nStomach pain\nExams and Tests\nKetone testing may be used in type 1 diabetes to check for early ketoacidosis. The ketone test is usually done using a\nurine sample\nor a\nblood sample\n.\nKetone testing is usually done when DKA is suspected:\nMost often, urine testing is done first.\nIf the urine is positive for ketones, most often a ketone called beta-hydroxybutyrate is measured in the blood. This is the most common ketone measured."}

Another goal is to replace fluids and bodily chemicals lost through urination, loss of appetite, and vomiting if you have these symptoms.\nIf you have diabetes, it is likely your health care provider told you how to spot the warning signs of DKA. If you think you have DKA, test for ketones using urine strips. Some glucose meters can also measure blood ketones. If ketones are present, contact your provider right away. Do not delay. Follow any instructions you are given.\nIt is likely that you will need to go to the hospital."}

There, you will receive insulin, fluids, and other treatment for DKA. Then providers will also search for and treat the cause of DKA, such as an infection.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nMost people respond to treatment within 24 hours. Sometimes, it takes longer to recover.\nIf DKA is not treated, it can lead to severe illness or death.\nPossible Complications\nHealth problems that may result from DKA include any of the following:\nFluid buildup in the brain (cerebral edema)\nHeart stops working (\ncardiac arrest\n)\nKidney failure\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nDKA is a medical emergency. Contact your provider if you notice symptoms of DKA.\nGo to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you or a family member with diabetes has any of the following:\nDecreased consciousness\nFruity breath\nNausea and vomiting\nTrouble breathing\nPrevention\nIf you have diabetes, learn to recognize the signs and symptoms of DKA."}
