It can pick up most injuries that you have had in your spine or changes that happen with aging. Even small problems or changes that are not the cause of your current back pain can be picked up. These findings rarely change how your provider first treats you. But they can lead to:\nYour provider ordering more tests that you may not really need.\nYou worrying about your health and back even more."}
