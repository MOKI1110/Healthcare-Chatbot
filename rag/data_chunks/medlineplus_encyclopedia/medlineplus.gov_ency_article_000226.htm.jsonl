These include some medicines that you buy over-the-counter or your health care provider prescribes for you. When increased numbers of toxic breakdown products occur, this can make you more likely to get liver damage. Some medicines are directly toxic to the liver, or may cause an allergic response.\nSome medicines can cause hepatitis with small doses, even if the liver breakdown system is normal."}

Some medicines are directly toxic to the liver, or may cause an allergic response.\nSome medicines can cause hepatitis with small doses, even if the liver breakdown system is normal. Large doses of many medicines can damage a normal liver.\nMany different medicines can cause drug-induced hepatitis.\nPainkillers and fever reducers that contain acetaminophen are a common cause of liver injury, particularly when taken in doses greater than those recommended. People who drink alcohol to excess are more likely to have this problem.\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, diclofenac, and naproxen, may also cause drug-induced hepatitis.\nOther medicines that can lead to liver injury include:\nAmiodarone\nAnabolic steroids\nBirth control pills\nChlorpromazine\nErythromycin\nHalothane (a type of anesthesia)\nMethyldopa\nIsoniazid\nMethotrexate\nStatins\nSulfa drugs\nTetracyclines\nAmoxicillin-clavulanate\nSome anti-seizure medicines\nDisulfiram\nNiacin\nAzathoaprine\nKetoconazole\nSymptoms\nSymptoms may include:\nAbdominal pain\nDark urine\nDiarrhea\nFatigue\nFever\nHeadache\nJaundice\nLoss of appetite\nNausea and vomiting\nRash\nWhite or clay-colored stools\nItching\nExams and Tests"}
