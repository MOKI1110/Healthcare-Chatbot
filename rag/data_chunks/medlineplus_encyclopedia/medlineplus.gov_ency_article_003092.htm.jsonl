The episode most often lasts less than a couple of minutes and you usually recover from it quickly. The medical name for fainting is syncope.\nConsiderations\nWhen you faint, you not only\nlose consciousness\n, you also lose muscle tone and the color in your face. Before fainting, you may feel weak, sweaty, or nauseated. You may have the sense that your vision is constricting (tunnel vision) or noises are fading into the background.\nCauses\nFainting may occur while or after you:\nCough very hard\nHave a bowel movement, especially if you are straining\nHave been standing in one place for too long\nUrinate, especially at night or after lying down for a prolonged period\nFainting can also be related to:\nEmotional distress\nFear\nSevere pain\nOther causes of fainting, some of which may be more serious, include:\nCertain medicines, including those used for anxiety, depression, and high blood pressure."}

Call for an appointment to be seen as soon as possible.\nWhat to Expect at Your Office Visit\nYour provider will ask questions to determine whether you simply fainted, or if something else happened (such as  a seizure or heart rhythm disturbance), and to figure out the cause of the fainting episode.
