It involves blistering and sores (erosions) of the skin and\nmucous membranes\n.\nCauses\nThe immune system produces\nantibodies\nagainst specific proteins in the skin and mucous membranes. These antibodies break the bonds between skin cells. This leads to the formation of a blister. The exact cause is unknown.\nIn rare cases, PV is caused by some medicines, including:\nA medicine called penicillamine, which removes certain materials from the blood (chelating agent)\nBlood pressure medicines called\nACE inhibitors\nNonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)\nPV is uncommon. It most often occurs in middle-aged or older people.\nSymptoms\nAbout 50% of people with this condition first develop painful blisters and sores in the mouth. This is followed by skin blisters."}

This is called a positive\nNikolsky sign\n.\nskin biopsy\nand blood tests are often done to confirm the diagnosis.\nTreatment\nSevere cases of PV may need wound management, similar to the treatment for severe\nburns\n. People with PV may need to stay in a hospital and receive care in a burn unit or intensive care unit.\nTreatment is aimed at reducing symptoms, including pain."}

Systemic treatment includes:\nAn anti-inflammatory medicine called dapsone\nCorticosteroids\nMedicines containing gold\nMedicines that suppress the immune system (such as azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, or rituximab)\nAntibiotics may be used to treat or prevent infection.
