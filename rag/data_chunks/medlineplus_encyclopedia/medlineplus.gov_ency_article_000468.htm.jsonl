Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nHigh blood pressure in adults - hypertension\nHigh blood pressure in adults - hypertension\nBlood pressure is a measurement of the force exerted against the walls of your arteries as your heart pumps blood to your body. Hypertension is the medical term used to describe high blood pressure.\nUntreated high blood pressure can lead to many medical problems. These include heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, eye problems, and other health issues.\nBlood pressure readings are given as two numbers. The top number is called systolic blood pressure. The bottom number is called diastolic blood pressure. For example, 120 over 80 (written as 120/80 mm Hg).\nOne or both of these numbers can be too high."}

(Note: The numbers below apply to people who are not taking medicines for blood pressure and who are not ill.)\nNormal blood pressure is when your blood pressure is lower than 120/80 mm Hg most of the time.\nHigh blood pressure (hypertension) is when one or both of your blood pressure readings are 130/80 mm Hg or higher most of the time.\nIf the top blood pressure number is from 120 to 129 mm Hg, and the bottom blood pressure number is less than 80 mm Hg, it is called elevated blood pressure.\nIf you have heart or kidney problems, or you had a stroke, your health care provider may want your blood pressure to be even lower than that of people who do not have these conditions.\nCauses\nMany factors can affect blood pressure, including:\nThe amount of water and salt you have in your body\nThe condition of your kidneys, nervous system, or blood vessels\nYour hormone levels\nYou are more likely to be told your blood pressure is too high as you get older."}
