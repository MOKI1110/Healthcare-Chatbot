An infant boy with an uncircumcised penis does not need special care. Normal bathing is enough to keep it clean.\nDo not pull back (retract) the foreskin for cleaning in infants and children. This may injure the foreskin and cause scarring. This may make it difficult or painful to pull back the foreskin later in life.\nTeenage boys should be taught to gently retract the foreskin during bathing and clean the penis well. It is very important to reposition the foreskin back over the head of the penis after cleaning. Otherwise, the foreskin can slightly squeeze the head of the penis, causing swelling and pain (\nparaphimosis\n). This needs medical care.\nAlternative Names\nUncircumcised penis - bathing; Cleaning an uncircumcised penis\nImages\nMale reproductive hygiene\nReferences\nBoswell B, Thomas AA.
