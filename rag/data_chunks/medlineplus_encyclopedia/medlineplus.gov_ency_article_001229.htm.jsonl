Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nTendinitis\nTendinitis\nTendons are the fibrous structures that join muscles to bones. When these tendons become swollen or inflamed, it is called tendinitis. In many cases, tendinosis (tendon degeneration) is also present.\nCauses\nTendinitis can occur as a result of injury or  overuse. Playing sports is a common cause. Tendinitis also can occur with aging as the tendon loses elasticity. Body-wide (systemic) diseases, such as\nrheumatoid arthritis\nor\ndiabetes\n, can also lead to tendinitis.\nTendinitis can occur in any tendon. Commonly affected sites include the:\nElbow\nHeel (\nAchilles tendinitis\n)\nKnee\nShoulder\nThumb\nWrist\nSymptoms\nSymptoms of tendinitis may vary with activity or cause. Main symptoms may include:\nPain and tenderness along a tendon, usually near a joint\nPain at night\nPain that is worse with movement or activity\nStiffness in the morning\nExams and Tests\nYour health care provider will perform a physical exam. During the exam, your provider will look for signs of pain and tenderness when the muscle attached to the tendon is moved in certain ways."}

During the exam, your provider will look for signs of pain and tenderness when the muscle attached to the tendon is moved in certain ways. There are specific tests for specific tendons.\nThe tendon can be inflamed, and the skin over it may be warm and red.\nOther tests that may be done include:\nUltrasound\nX-ray\nMRI\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to relieve pain and reduce inflammation.\nYour provider will recommend resting the affected tendon to help it recover. This may be done using a splint or a removable brace. Applying heat or cold to the affected area can help.\nOver-the-counter pain relievers\nsuch as NSAIDs like aspirin or ibuprofen, can also reduce both pain and inflammation. Steroid injections into the tendon sheath can also be very useful for controlling pain.\nYour provider may also suggest physical therapy to stretch and strengthen the muscle and tendon. This can restore the tendon's ability to function properly, improve healing, and prevent future injury.\nIn rare cases, surgery is needed to remove the inflamed tissue from around the tendon.\nOutlook (Prognosis)\nSymptoms improve with treatment and rest."}
