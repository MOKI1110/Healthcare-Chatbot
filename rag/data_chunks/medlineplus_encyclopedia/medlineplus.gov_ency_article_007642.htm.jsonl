Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCapsule endoscopy\nCapsule endoscopy\nEndoscopy is a way of looking inside the body.\nEndoscopy\nis often done with a tube put into the body that the doctor can use to look inside.\nAnother way to look inside is to put a camera in a capsule (capsule endoscopy). This capsule includes one or two tiny cameras, a light bulb, a battery, and a radio transmitter.\nIt is about the size of a large vitamin pill. The person swallows the capsule, and it takes pictures all the way through the digestive (gastrointestinal) tract.\nThe radio transmitter sends the photos to a recorder the person wears on their waist or shoulder.\nA technician downloads the photos from the recorder to a computer, and the health care provider looks at them.\nThe camera comes out with a bowel movement and is flushed down the toilet safely.\nHow the Test is Performed\nThis test can be started in the provider's office.\nThe capsule is the size of a large vitamin pill, about an inch (2.5 centimeters) long and less than  ½ inch (1.3 centimeters) wide."}

Each capsule is used only once.\nThe provider may ask you to lie down or sit up while swallowing the capsule. A capsule endoscope has a slippery coating, so it is easier to swallow.\nThe capsule is not digested or absorbed. It travels through the digestive system following the same path food travels. It leaves the body in a bowel movement and can be flushed down the toilet without harming the plumbing.\nThe recorder will be placed on your waist or shoulder. Sometimes a few antenna patches may also be put on your body. During the test, the small light on a recorder will blink. If it stops blinking, call your provider.\nThe capsule may be in your body for several hours or several days. Everyone is different.\nMost of the time, the capsule leaves the body within 24 hours. Flush the capsule down the toilet.\nIf you do not see the capsule in the toilet within two weeks of swallowing it, tell your provider."}

If you do not follow instructions carefully, the test may have to be done a different day.\nYour provider may ask you to:\nTake medicine to clear your bowels before this test\nHave only clear liquids for 24 hours before this test\nHave nothing to eat or drink, including water, for about 12 hours before you swallow the capsule\nDO NOT smoke for 24 hours before this test.\nBe sure to tell your provider:\nAbout all the medicines you take, including prescription medicine, over-the-counter (OTC) medicine, vitamins, minerals, supplements, and herbs."}

These pictures are downloaded to a computer and software turns them into a video. Your provider watches the video to look for problems. It may take up to a week for you to learn the results. If no problems are found, your results are normal.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nYour provider will tell you if they find a problem with your digestive tract, what it means, and how it can be treated.\nRisks\nThere are very few problems that can occur with capsule endoscopy."}
