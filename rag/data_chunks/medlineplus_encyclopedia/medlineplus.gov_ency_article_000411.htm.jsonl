Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia\nCongenital adrenal hyperplasia is the name given to  a group of inherited disorders of the\nadrenal gland\n. Inherited means the traits are passed down from parent to child.\nCauses\nYour adrenal glands are 2 walnut-sized organs that sit one on top of each kidney. The adrenal glands make the following hormones that are essential for life.\nCortisol\nregulates blood pressure, blood sugar, and energy levels. It also helps your body respond to illness and stress.\nAldosterone\nhelps manage sodium and potassium levels in your blood to help regulate blood pressure.\nAndrogens\nare male sex hormones, such as testosterone. These hormones play a role in growth and development in both males and females.\nMost people with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) lack an\nenzyme\ncalled 21-hydroxylase. The adrenal glands need this enzyme to make enough cortisol and aldosterone. Because of low cortisol levels, the body stimulates the adrenal gland, which then produces more androgen."}

The adrenal glands need this enzyme to make enough cortisol and aldosterone. Because of low cortisol levels, the body stimulates the adrenal gland, which then produces more androgen. This results in an imbalance of these hormones.\nThere are two main types of CAH that make up most of all cases: classic CAH and nonclassic CAH.\nClassic CAH\nis rarer and more serious. It is often found at birth or early infancy. The body makes too little aldosterone and cortisol and too much androgen. There are two subtypes of classic CAH:\nSalt-wasting CAH. This is the most serious form, and it can cause life-threatening symptoms. The body makes too little aldosterone to regulate the sodium levels in the blood. This results in loss of sodium through the urine. It can be life-threatening without treatment.\nSimple-virilizing CAH. This more moderate form of CAH does not cause life-threatening symptoms. The body makes enough aldosterone to regulate sodium levels, but it still produces too little cortisol and too much androgen.\nNonclassic CAH\nis the mildest and most common form. The body produces enough aldosterone and cortisol, but too much androgen."}

The person may not have any or only mild symptoms.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms will vary, depending on the type of CAH someone has and their age when the disorder is diagnosed.\nFemales with classic CAH often have\nambiguous genitalia\nat birth and may be diagnosed before symptoms appear.\nMales have typical male genitalia at birth, even if they have a more severe form.\nIn children classic, salt-wasting CAH, several adrenal symptoms often develop within 2 or 3 weeks after birth. They may include:\nPoor feeding or vomiting\nDiarrhea\nDehydration\nElectrolyte changes (abnormal levels of sodium and potassium in the blood)\nAbnormal heart rhythm\nLow blood glucose\nToo much acid in the blood (metabolic acidosis)\nWeight loss\nShock\nFemales with nonclassic CAH will usually have normal female reproductive organs (ovaries, uterus, and fallopian tubes)."}

However, they may appear to enter puberty early. Symptoms may include:\nDeepening voice\nSevere acne\nEarly appearance of pubic or armpit hair\nEnlarged penis but normal testes\nWell-developed muscles\nBoth males and females will grow rapidly during childhood, but be much shorter than normal as adults.\nExams and Tests\nIf you have a family history of CAH, you may want to talk with your health care provider about having prenatal tests to check for the disorder in your unborn baby:\nAmniocentesis\nChorionic villus sampling\nAt birth, your child will be screened for CAH as part of newborn screening tests.

Common blood tests include:\nSerum electrolytes\nAldosterone\nRenin\nCortisol\nGenetic tests can help diagnose or confirm the disorder, but they are rarely needed.\nTreatment\nThe goal of treatment is to return hormone levels to normal, or near normal. Treatment may include taking:\nHydrocortisone to replace cortisol\nFludrocortisone to replace aldosterone\nSalt supplements\nMedicine should be taken daily. People may need additional doses of medicine during times of stress, such as severe illness or surgery. Lifelong monitoring is needed to ensure that proper hormone levels are maintained.\nSteroids (such as hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone) used to treat CAH do not usually cause side effects such as obesity or weak bones, because the doses replace the hormones that the body cannot make."}

This team may include neonatologists, geneticists, endocrinologists, and psychiatrists or social workers.\nFemale children with ambiguous genitalia may need surgery to improve function and to create a more typical female appearance. Many health experts suggest waiting until the child is old enough to be involved in the decision, unless surgery is needed for the health of the infant."}
