This is an area in the middle of the chest that separates the lungs.\nCauses\nThe mediastinum is the part of the chest that lies between the sternum and the spinal column, and between the lungs. This area contains the heart, large blood vessels, windpipe (trachea), thymus gland, esophagus, and connective tissues. The mediastinum is divided into three sections:\nAnterior (front)\nMiddle\nPosterior (back)\nMediastinal tumors are rare.\nThe most common location for tumors in the mediastinum depends on the age of the person. In children, tumors are more common in the posterior mediastinum. These tumors often begin in the nerves and are noncancerous (benign).\nMost mediastinal tumors in adults occur in the anterior mediastinum. They are usually cancerous (malignant) lymphomas, germ cell tumors, or thymomas (cancers of the thymus)."}

Symptoms that do occur are due to pressure on (compression of) local structures and may include:\nChest pain\nFever and chills\nCough\nCoughing up blood\n(hemoptysis)\nHoarseness\nNight sweats\nShortness of breath\nExams and Tests\nA medical history and physical exam may show:\nFever\nHigh-pitched breathing sound (\nstridor\n)\nSwollen or tender lymph nodes (\nlymphadenopathy\n)\nUnintentional weight loss\nWheezing\nFurther tests that may be done include:\nChest x-ray\nCT-guided needle biopsy\nCT scan of the chest\nMediastinoscopy with biopsy\nMRI of the chest\nTreatment\nTreatment for mediastinal tumors depends on the type of tumor and symptoms:\nThymomas are treated with surgery."}

Different tumors respond differently to chemotherapy and radiation.\nPossible Complications\nComplications of mediastinal tumors include:\nSpinal cord compression\nSpread to nearby structures such as the heart, lining around the heart (pericardium), and great vessels (aorta and vena cava)\nRadiation, surgery, and chemotherapy can all have serious complications.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nContact your health care provider if you notice symptoms of a mediastinal tumor.\nAlternative Names\nThymoma - mediastinal; Lymphoma - mediastinal\nImages\nLungs\nReferences\nMcCool FD."}
