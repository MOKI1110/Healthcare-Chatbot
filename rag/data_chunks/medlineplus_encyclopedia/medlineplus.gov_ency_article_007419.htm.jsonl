Problems with moving, thinking, and talking often improve in the first weeks or months after a stroke. Some people will keep improving months or years after a stroke.\nInformation\nWHERE TO LIVE AFTER A STROKE\nMost people will need stroke rehabilitation (rehab) to help them recover after they leave the hospital."}

Stroke rehab will help you regain the ability to care for yourself.\nMost types of therapy can be done where you live, including in your home.\nPeople who are not able to care for themselves at home after a stroke may have therapy in a special part of a hospital or in a\nnursing or rehabilitation center\n.\nThose who are able to go back home might go to a special clinic or have someone come to their home.\nWhether you can go back home after a stroke depends on:\nWhether you can take care of yourself\nHow much help there will be at home\nWhether the home is a safe place (for example, stairs in the home might not be safe for a stroke patient who has trouble walking)\nYou may need to go to a boarding home, adult family home, or convalescent home to have a safe environment.\nFor people who are cared for at home:\nChanges may be needed to stay\nsafe from falls in the home\nand\nbathroom\n, prevent\nwandering\n, and make the home easier to use. The bed and bathroom should be easy to reach."}

Items (such as throw rugs) that may cause a fall should be removed.\nA number of devices can help with activities such as cooking or eating, bathing or showering, moving around the home or elsewhere, dressing and grooming, writing and using a computer, and many more activities.\nFamily counseling may help you cope with the changes needed for home care. Visiting nurses or aides, volunteer services, homemakers, adult protective services, adult day care, and other community resources (such as a local Department of Aging) may be helpful.\nLegal advice may be needed. Advance directives, power of attorney, and other legal actions may make it easier to make decisions about care.\nSPEAKING AND COMMUNICATING\nAfter a stroke, some people may have problems finding a word or being able to speak more than one word or phrase at a time. Or they may have trouble speaking at all. This is called aphasia.\nPeople who have had a stroke may be able to put many words together, but they may not make sense."}

Family and caregivers should learn\nhow best to help communicate\n.\nIt can take up to 2 years to recover speech. Not everyone will fully recover.\nA stroke can also damage the muscles that help you speak. As a result, these muscles do not move the right way when you try to speak. This is called dysarthria.\nA speech and language therapist can work with you and your family or caregivers, and you may be able to\nlearn new ways to communicate\n.\nTHINKING AND MEMORY\nAfter a stroke, people may have:\nChanges in their ability to think or reason\nChanges in behavior and sleep patterns\nMemory problems\nPoor judgment\nThese changes may lead to:\nAn increase in the\nneed for safety measures\nChanges in ability to drive\nOther changes or precautions\nDepression after a stroke is common."}

Treatments for depression include:\nIncreased social activity, including potentially more visits in the home or going to an adult day care center for activities.\nMedicines for depression.\nVisits to a therapist or counselor.\nMUSCLE, JOINT, AND NERVE PROBLEMS\nMoving around and doing normal daily tasks such as dressing and feeding may be harder after a stroke.\nMuscles on one side of the body may be weaker or may not move at all. This may involve only part of the arm or leg, or the whole side of the body.\nMuscles on the weak side of the body may be very tight.\nDifferent\njoints and muscles in the body may become hard to move\n. The shoulder and other joints may dislocate.\nMany of these problems can cause pain after a stroke. Pain may also occur from changes in the brain itself.
