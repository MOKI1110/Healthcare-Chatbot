Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nBacitracin overdose\nBacitracin overdose\nBacitracin is an antibiotic medicine. It is used to kill germs that cause infections. Small amounts of bacitracin are dissolved in petroleum jelly to create antibiotic ointments.\nBacitracin overdose occurs when someone swallows a product containing this ingredient or uses more than the normal or recommended amount of the product. This can be by accident or on purpose.\nThis article is for information only. DO NOT use it to treat or manage an actual overdose. If you or someone you are with has an exposure, call your local emergency number (such as 911), or your local poison control center can be reached directly by calling the national toll-free Poison Help hotline (1-800-222-1222) from anywhere in the United States.\nPoisonous Ingredient\nBacitracin can be poisonous in large amounts.\nWhere Found\nBacitracin is found in certain over-the-counter antibiotic ointments such as Neosporin."}

It may also be found in some prescription eye ointments.\nThe medicine also comes in a form that can be given as a shot into a muscle or through a vein. Using it this way is the most common way for an overdose to occur.\nSymptoms\nBacitracin is very safe. However, getting it in the eyes may cause redness and some pain and itching.\nEating bacitracin in large amounts may cause stomach pain and vomiting.\nIn rare cases, bacitracin can cause an\nallergic reaction\n, often redness and itching of the skin. If the reaction is severe, there may be difficulty swallowing or breathing.\nBacitracin is still used as a body-wide (systemic) antibiotic in parts of the world. If it is given by injection, it may cause pain in the area of the shot or a skin rash."}
