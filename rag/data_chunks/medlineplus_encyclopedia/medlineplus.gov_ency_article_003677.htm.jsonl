Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nSerum free hemoglobin test\nSerum free hemoglobin test\nSerum free hemoglobin is a blood test that measures the level of free\nhemoglobin\nin the liquid part of the blood (the serum). Free hemoglobin is the hemoglobin outside of the red blood cells. Most of the hemoglobin is found inside the red blood cells, not in the serum. Hemoglobin carries oxygen in the blood.\nHow the Test is Performed\nblood sample\nis needed.\nHow to Prepare for the Test\nNo preparation is necessary.\nHow the Test will Feel\nWhen the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.\nWhy the Test is Performed\nHemoglobin (Hb) is the main component of red blood cells. It is a protein that carries oxygen. This test is done to diagnose or monitor how severe\nhemolytic anemia\nis."}

It is a protein that carries oxygen. This test is done to diagnose or monitor how severe\nhemolytic anemia\nis. This is a disorder in which a low red blood cell count is caused by the abnormal breakdown of red blood cells.\nNormal Results\nPlasma or serum in someone who does not have hemolytic anemia may contain up to 5 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 0.05 grams per liter (g/L) hemoglobin.\nNormal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or may test different samples."}

Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.\nWhat Abnormal Results Mean\nA higher-than-normal level may indicate:\nHemolytic anemia\n(due to any cause, including autoimmune and non-immune causes, such as\nthalassemia\n)\nCondition in which red blood cells break down when the body is exposed to certain medicines or the stress of infection (\nG6PD deficiency\n)\nLow red blood cell count due to red blood cells breaking down sooner than normal\nBlood disorder in which red blood cells are destroyed when they go from cold to warm temperatures (\nparoxysmal cold hemoglobinuria\n)\nSickle cell disease\nTransfusion reaction\nRisks\nThere is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other."}
