This article discusses first aid for drug\noverdose\nand withdrawal.\nConsiderations\nMany drugs and medicines can cause harm if taken incorrectly or misused. Many street drugs, such as methamphetamine or crack cocaine, have no known beneficial use in any amount.\nMedicines that are used to treat a health problem can be misused, either accidentally or intentionally. This can occur when people take more than the normal dose or if the medicine is taken with alcohol or other medicines.\nDrug interactions may also lead to side effects. So, it is important to let your health care provider know about all the medicines you are taking. This includes vitamins, supplements, medicines from other countries, and other medicines or drugs you bought without a prescription.\nMany drugs and medicines are addictive. Sometimes, the addiction is gradual. And some drugs (such as\ncocaine\nand opioids) can cause addiction after only a few doses."}

Sometimes, the addiction is gradual. And some drugs (such as\ncocaine\nand opioids) can cause addiction after only a few doses. Addiction means that a person has a strong urge to use the substance and can't stop, even if they want to.\nSomeone who has become addicted to a drug usually will have withdrawal symptoms when the drug is suddenly stopped. Treatment can help prevent or lessen withdrawal symptoms.\nA drug dose that is large enough to cause harm to the body (toxic) is called an overdose. This may occur suddenly, when a large amount of the drug is taken at one time. It may also occur gradually as a drug builds up in the body over a longer period. Prompt medical attention may save the life of someone who has an overdose.\nCauses\nAn overdose of narcotics can cause sleepiness, slowed breathing, and even\nunconsciousness\n.\nWhen prescription medicines are taken in higher than prescribed amounts, serious side effects may occur. Uppers (\nstimulants\n) produce excitement, increased heart rate, and\nrapid breathing\n. Downers (depressants) do the opposite.\nMind-altering drugs are called hallucinogens."}

They vary widely in effect and include drugs like peyote and\nLSD\n, which primarily affect serotonin receptors in the brain, as well as ketamine and\nPCP\n(angel dust), which affect multiple receptors in the brain. These mind-altering substances are not well understood and in some cases may cause\nparanoia\n, dangerous behaviors, or extreme social withdrawal.\nCannabis drugs such as\nmarijuana\nmay cause relaxation, impaired motor skills, and increased appetite.\nSymptoms\nDrug overdose symptoms vary widely, depending on the specific drug used, but may include:\nAbnormal pupil size or pupils that don't change size when light is shined into them\nAgitation\nSeizures\n, tremors\nDelusional or paranoid behavior, hallucinations\nDifficulty breathing\nDrowsiness, coma\nNausea and vomiting\nStaggering\nor unsteady gait (\nataxia\n)\nSweating or extremely dry, hot skin, blisters, rash\nViolent or aggressive behavior\nDeath\nDrug withdrawal symptoms also vary widely, depending on the specific drug used, but may include"}

Check the person's airway, breathing, and pulse. If needed, begin\nCPR\n. If\nunconscious\nbut breathing, carefully place the person in the recovery position by log rolling the person toward you onto their left side. Bend the top leg so both hip and knee are at right angles. Gently tilt their head back to keep the airway open. If the person is conscious, loosen the clothing and keep the person warm, and provide reassurance. Try to keep the person calm. If you suspect an overdose, try to prevent the person from taking more drugs. Call for medical help right away.\n2. Treat the person for signs of\nshock\n. Signs include\nweakness\n,\nbluish lips and fingernails\n,\nclammy skin\n,\npaleness\n, and decreasing alertness.\n3. If the person is having seizures, give\nfirst aid for seizures\n.\n4."}

Keep monitoring the person's\nvital signs\n(\npulse\n, rate of breathing, blood pressure, if possible) until emergency medical help arrives.\n5. If possible, try to determine which drug(s) were taken, how much and when. Save any pill bottles or other drug containers. Give this information to emergency personnel.\nDO NOT\nThings you shouldn't do when tending to someone who has overdosed:\nDo not put your own safety in danger. Some drugs can cause violent and unpredictable behavior. Call for medical help.\nDo not try to reason with someone who is on drugs. Do not expect them to behave reasonably.\nDo not offer your opinions when giving help. You don't need to know why drugs were taken in order to give effective first aid.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nDrug emergencies are not always easy to identify. If you think someone has overdosed, or if you think someone is having withdrawal, give first aid and seek medical help.\nTry to find out what drug the person has taken."}
