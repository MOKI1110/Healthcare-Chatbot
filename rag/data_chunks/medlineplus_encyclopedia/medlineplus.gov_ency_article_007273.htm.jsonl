Share sensitive information only on official,\n→\n→\nAtrial myxoma\nAtrial myxoma\nAn atrial myxoma is a noncancerous tumor in the upper left or right side of the heart. It most often grows on the wall that separates the two sides of the heart. This wall is called the atrial septum.\nCauses\nA myxoma is a primary heart (cardiac) tumor. This means that the tumor started within the heart. Most heart tumors start somewhere else.\nPrimary cardiac tumors such as myxomas are rare. About 75% of myxomas occur in the left atrium of the heart. They most often begin in the wall that divides the two upper chambers of the heart. They can occur in other intra-cardiac sites as well. Atrial myxomas are sometimes linked with valve obstruction stenosis and\natrial fibrillation\n.\nMyxomas are more common in women. About 1 in 10 myxomas are passed down through families (inherited). These tumors are called familial myxomas. They tend to occur in more than one part of the heart at a time, and often cause symptoms at a younger age.\nSymptoms\nMany myxomas will not cause symptoms."}

These tumors are called familial myxomas. They tend to occur in more than one part of the heart at a time, and often cause symptoms at a younger age.\nSymptoms\nMany myxomas will not cause symptoms. These are often discovered when an imaging study (echocardiogram, MRI, CT) is done for another reason.\nSymptoms may occur at any time, but often they go along with a change in body position.\nSymptoms of a myxoma may include:\nBreathing difficulty when lying flat\nor on one side or the other\nBreathing difficulty when asleep\nChest pain\nor tightness\nDizziness\nFainting\nSensation of feeling your heart beat (\npalpitations\n)\nShortness of breath\nwith activity\nSymptoms due to embolism of tumor material\nThe symptoms and signs of left atrial myxomas often mimic\nmitral stenosis\n(narrowing of the valve between the left atrium and the left ventricle)."}

Rarely, the tumor may come back after several years. Your provider will likely recommend regular monitoring to check for new myxomas.\nHaving a myxoma can also increase the risk for heart rhythm problems (\narrhythmias\n) This can be treated with medicines or other treatments.\nUntreated, a myxoma can lead to an\nembolism\n(tumor cells or a clot that breaks off and travels in the bloodstream)."}
