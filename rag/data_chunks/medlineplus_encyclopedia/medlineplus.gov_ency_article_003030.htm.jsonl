The fold runs from the nose to the inner side of the eyebrow.\nCauses\nEpicanthal folds may be normal for people of Asian descent and some non-Asian infants. Epicanthal folds also may be seen in young children of any race before the bridge of the nose begins to rise.\nHowever, they may also be due to certain medical conditions, including:\nDown syndrome\nFetal alcohol syndrome\nTurner syndrome\nPhenylketonuria\n(PKU)\nWilliams syndrome\nNoonan syndrome\nRubinstein-Taybi syndrome\nBlepharophimosis syndrome\nHome Care\nIn most cases, no home care is needed.\nWhen to Contact a Medical Professional\nThis trait is most often found before or during the first well-baby exam.
