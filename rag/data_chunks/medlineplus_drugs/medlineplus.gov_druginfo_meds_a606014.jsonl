Methylphenidate is in a class of medications called central nervous system stimulants. It works by changing the amounts of certain natural substances in the brain.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nTransdermal methylphenidate comes as a patch to apply to the skin.

However, the patches may loosen or fall off during the day, especially if they get wet. If a patch does fall off, ask your child how and when this happened and where to find the patch.
