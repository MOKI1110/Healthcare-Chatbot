Betibeglogene autotemcel injection is in a class of medications called autologous gene therapy, a type of medication prepared using cells from the patient's own blood stem cells. It works by helping your body to produce enough red blood cells so that regular blood transfusions are not necessary.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nBetibeglogene autotemcel injection comes as a suspension (liquid) to be injected intravenously (into a vein) by a doctor or nurse in a hospital. Betibeglogene autotemcel injection is given as a one-time dose administered over up to 2 hours. Before you receive your betibeglogene autotemcel dose, your doctor or nurse will administer other chemotherapy medications to prepare your body for betibeglogene autotemcel.\nBefore your dose of betibeglogene autotemcel injection is to be given, a sample of your blood stem cells will be taken at a hospital or treatment center using a process called mobilization and apheresis (a process that removes blood stem cells from the body). This process usually takes about 1 week and may need to be repeated. The sample will be sent to the manufacturer to prepare a dose of betibeglogene autotemcel injection."}
