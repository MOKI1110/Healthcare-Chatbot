Treprostinil oral inhalation is also used to treat pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease (PH-ILD; high blood pressure in the lungs resulting from a lung disease that involves inflammation and scarring of the lungs). Treprostinil may improve the ability to exercise and slow the worsening of symptoms in patients with PAH and PH-ILD.

It works by relaxing the blood vessels, including those in the lungs, and improving blood flow.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nTreprostinil oral inhalation comes in ampules that contain a solution (liquid) to inhale by mouth using a special nebulizer (a device that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled) and in cartridges that contain a dry powder to inhale by mouth using a special inhaler. It is usually inhaled four times a day, approximately every 4 hours, during waking hours."}
