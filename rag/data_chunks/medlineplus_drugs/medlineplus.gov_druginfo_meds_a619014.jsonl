Ravulizumab-cwvz injection is also used in adults and children 1 month of age and older to treat atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS; an inherited condition in which small blood clots form in the body and may cause damage to the blood vessels, blood cells, kidneys, and other parts of the body)."}

Ravulizumab-cwvz injection is also used in adults to treat a certain form of myasthenia gravis (MG; a disorder of the nervous system that causes muscle weakness). It is also used to treat neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD, an autoimmune disorder of the nervous system that affects eye nerves and the spinal cord) in certain adults. Ravulizumab-cwvz is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It works by blocking the activity of the part of the immune system that may damage blood cells in people with PNH and that causes clots to form in people with aHUS. It works by disrupting communication between nerves and muscles in people with MG.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nRavulizumab-cwvz injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected intravenously (into a vein) over about 2-4 hours by a doctor or nurse in a medical office."}

If ravulizumab-cwvz injection is given intravenously to treat children with PNH or aHUS, it is usually given every 4 or 8 weeks, depending on their body weight, starting 2 weeks after the first dose.\nIf ravulizumab-cwvz injection (in an on-body delivery system) is used to treat adults with PNI or aHUS, it is usually given subcutaneously once a week. For a full dose, you will need to use 2 separate on-body delivery systems and inject the contents of each delivery system subcutaneously over about 10 minutes.
