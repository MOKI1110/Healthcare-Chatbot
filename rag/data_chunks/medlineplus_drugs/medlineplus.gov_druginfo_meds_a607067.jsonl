Armodafinil is also used along with breathing devices or other treatments to prevent excessive sleepiness caused by obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS; a sleep disorder in which the patient briefly stops breathing or breathes shallowly many times during sleep and therefore does not get enough restful sleep). Armodafinil is in a class of medications called wakefulness-promoting agents. It works by changing the amounts of certain natural substances in the area of the brain that controls sleep and wakefulness.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nArmodafinil comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day. If you are taking armodafinil to treat narcolepsy or OSAHS, you will probably take it in the morning. If you are taking armodafinil to treat shift work sleep disorder, you will probably take it 1 hour before the start of your shift. Take armodafinil at around the same time every day."}
