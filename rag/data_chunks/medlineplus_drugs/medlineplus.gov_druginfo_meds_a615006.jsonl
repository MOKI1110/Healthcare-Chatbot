The spray may also be used just before activities that may cause episodes of angina in order to prevent the angina from occurring. Nitroglycerin is in a class of medications called vasodilators."}

The spray may also be used just before activities that may cause episodes of angina in order to prevent the angina from occurring. Nitroglycerin is in a class of medications called vasodilators. It works by relaxing the blood vessels so the heart does not need to work as hard and therefore does not need as much oxygen.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nNitroglycerin comes as a spray to use on or under the tongue. The spray is usually used as needed, either 5 to 10 minutes before activities that may cause attacks of angina or at the first sign of an attack. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use nitroglycerin exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nNitroglycerin may not work as well after you have used it for some time or if you have used many doses. Use the fewest number of sprays needed to relieve the pain of your attacks."}
