It is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. Fluticasone works by decreasing swelling and irritation in the airways to allow for easier breathing.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nFluticasone comes as an aerosol to inhale by mouth using an inhaler and as a powder to inhale by mouth using an inhaler. Fluticasone aerosol oral inhalation (Flovent HFA) is usually inhaled twice daily. Fluticasone powder for oral inhalation is usually inhaled once daily (Armonair, Arnuity Ellipta) or twice daily (Armonair Respiclick, Flovent Diskus). Try to use fluticasone at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use fluticasone exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nTalk to your doctor about how you should use your other oral and inhaled medications for asthma during your treatment with fluticasone inhalation."}

If you were taking an oral steroid such as dexamethasone, methylprednisolone (Medrol), or prednisone (Rayos), your doctor may want to gradually decrease your steroid dose starting at least 1 week after you begin to use fluticasone.\nFluticasone helps to prevent asthma attacks (sudden episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing) but will not stop an asthma attack that has already started. Do not use fluticasone during an asthma attack. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting inhaler to use during asthma attacks.\nYour doctor will probably start you on an average dose of fluticasone. Your doctor may decrease your dose when your symptoms are controlled or increase it if your symptoms have not improved after at least 2 weeks.\nFluticasone controls asthma but does not cure it."}
