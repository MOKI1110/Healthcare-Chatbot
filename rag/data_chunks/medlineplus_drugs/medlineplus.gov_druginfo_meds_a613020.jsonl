Sodium picosulfate is in a class of medications called stimulant laxatives. Magnesium oxide and anhydrous citric acid combine to form a medication called magnesium citrate. Magnesium citrate is in a class of medications called osmotic laxatives. These medications work by causing watery diarrhea so that the stool can be emptied from the colon.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nSodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid combination comes as a powder (Prepopik\n®\n) to mix with water and as a solution (liquid) (Clenpiq\n®\n) to take by mouth. It is generally taken as two doses in preparation for a colonoscopy. The first dose is usually taken the night before the colonoscopy and the second dose taken the morning of the procedure."}

Your doctor will tell you exactly when you should take your medication. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid combination exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nTo prepare for your colonoscopy, you may not eat any solid food or drink milk beginning the day before the procedure. You should only have clear liquids during this time. Examples of clear liquids are water, light colored fruit juice without pulp, clear broth, coffee or tea without milk, flavored gelatin, popsicles and soft drinks."}

Ask your doctor if you have any questions about which liquids you may drink before your colonoscopy.\nIf you are taking the powder (Prepopik\n®\n), you will need to mix the medication powder with cold water right before you take it. If you swallow the powder without mixing it with water, there is a greater chance that you will experience unpleasant or dangerous side effects. To prepare each dose of your medication, fill the dosing cup that was provided with the medication with cold water up to the lower line (5 ounces, 150 mL) that is marked on the cup. Pour in the contents of one packet of sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid powder and stir for 2 to 3 minutes to dissolve the powder. The mixture may become slightly warm as the powder dissolves. Drink the entire mixture right away."}

Sodium picosulfate, magnesium oxide, and anhydrous citric acid solution comes ready to drink and should not be mixed with a liquid before use.\nIf you are taking the medication the night before and the morning of your colonoscopy, you will take your first dose between 5:00 to 9:00 p.m. on the night before your colonoscopy. After you take this dose, you will need to drink five 8-ounce (240 mL) drinks of clear liquid within the next 5 hours before you go to bed.
