It does not spread from person to person.\nRisk is very low for most travelers. It is higher for people living in areas where the disease is common, or for people traveling there for long periods of time.\nMost people infected with JE virus don't have any symptoms."}

It is higher for people living in areas where the disease is common, or for people traveling there for long periods of time.\nMost people infected with JE virus don't have any symptoms. Others might have symptoms as mild as a fever and headache, or as serious as encephalitis (brain infection).\nA person with encephalitis can experience fever, neck stiffness, seizures, and coma. About 1 person in 4 with encephalitis dies. Up to half of those who don't die have permanent disability.\nIt is believed that infection in a pregnant woman could harm her unborn baby.\nJE vaccine can help protect travelers from JE disease.\nWho should get JE vaccine and when?\nJapanese encephalitis vaccine is approved for people 2 months of age and older. It is recommended for travelers to Asia who:\nplan to spend at least a month in areas where JE occurs,\nplan to travel for less than a month, but will visit rural areas and spend a lot of time outdoors,\ntravel to areas where there is a JE outbreak, or\nare not sure of their travel plans.\nLaboratory workers at risk for exposure to JE virus should also be vaccinated. The vaccine is given as a 2-dose series, with the doses spaced 28 days apart."}

The vaccine is given as a 2-dose series, with the doses spaced 28 days apart. The second dose should be given at least a week before travel. Children younger than 3 years of age get a smaller dose than patients who are 3 or older.\nA booster dose might be recommended for anyone 17 or older who was vaccinated more than a year ago and is still at risk of exposure. There is no information yet on the need for a booster dose for children.\nNOTE:\nThe best way to prevent JE is to avoid mosquito bites. Your doctor can advise you.\nWho should not get JE vaccine or should wait?\nAnyone who has had a severe (life-threatening) allergic reaction to a dose of JE vaccine should not get another dose.\nAnyone who has a severe (life threatening) allergy to any component of JE vaccine should not get the vaccine.\nTell your doctor if you have any severe allergies.\nPregnant women should usually not get JE vaccine. If you are pregnant, check with your doctor. If you will be traveling for fewer than 30 days, especially if you will be staying in urban areas, tell your doctor."}

When side effects happen, they are usually mild and go away on their own.\nMild problems\nPain, tenderness, redness, or swelling where the shot was given (about 1 person in 4).\nFever (mainly in children).\nHeadache, muscle aches (mainly in adults).\nModerate or Severe problems\nStudies have shown that severe reactions to JE vaccine are very rare.\nProblems that can happen after any vaccine\nBrief fainting spells can happen after any medical procedure, including vaccination.
