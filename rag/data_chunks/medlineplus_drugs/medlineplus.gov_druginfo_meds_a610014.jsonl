HPV is usually spread through sexual contact.\nMost HPV infections don't cause any symptoms, and go away on their own. But HPV can cause cervical cancer in women. Cervical cancer is the 2nd leading cause of cancer deaths among women around the world. In the United States, about 10,000 women get cervical cancer every year and about 4,000 are expected to die from it.\nHPV is also associated with several less common cancers, such as vaginal and vulvar cancers in women and other types of cancer in both men and women. It can also cause genital warts and warts in the throat.\nThere is no cure for HPV infection, but some of the problems it causes can be treated.\nHPV vaccine-Why get vaccinated?\nHPV vaccine is important because it can prevent most cases of cervical cancer in females, if it is given before a person is exposed to the virus.\nProtection from HPV vaccine is expected to be long-lasting. But vaccination is not a substitute for cervical cancer screening."}
