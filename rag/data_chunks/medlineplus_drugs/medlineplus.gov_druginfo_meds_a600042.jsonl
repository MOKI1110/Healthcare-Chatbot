These appointments are necessary to be sure that your pregnancy has ended and that you have not developed serious complications of medical abortion.\nTalk to your doctor about the risks of taking mifepristone.\nWhy is this medication prescribed?\nMifepristone is used in combination with misoprostol (Cytotec ®) to end an early pregnancy. Early pregnancy means it has been 70 days or less since your last menstrual period began. Mifepristone is in a class of medications called antiprogestational steroids. It works by blocking the activity of progesterone, a substance your body makes to help continue pregnancy.\nMifepristone is also available as another product (Korlym ®), which is used to control hyperglycemia (high blood sugar) in people with a certain type of Cushing's Syndrome in which the body makes too much of the hormone cortisol."}

If you are using mifepristone to control hyperglycemia caused by Cushing's syndrome, read the monograph entitled mifepristone (Korlym ®) that has been written about this product.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nMifepristone comes as a tablet to take by mouth. You will take one tablet of mifepristone once on the first day. Within 24 to 48 hours after taking mifepristone, you will apply four tablets in total of another medication called misoprostol buccally (between the gum and cheek) by placing two tablets in each cheek pouch for 30 minutes, then swallowing the remaining content with water or another liquid. Make sure that you are in an appropriate location when you take misoprostol because vaginal bleeding, cramps, nausea, and diarrhea usually begins within 2 to 24 hours after taking it but could begin within 2 hours."}

You must go back to your doctor for an exam or ultrasound 7 to 14 days after taking mifepristone to confirm that the pregnancy has ended and to check the amount of bleeding. Take mifepristone exactly as directed.\nOther uses for this medicine\nMifepristone is also sometimes used to end pregnancies when more than 70 days have passed since the woman's last menstrual period; as an emergency contraceptive after unprotected sexual intercourse ('morning-after pill'); to treat a certain type of brain tumor, endometriosis (growth of uterus tissue outside the uterus), or fibroids (noncancerous tumors in the uterus); or to induce labor (to help start the birth process in a pregnant woman)."}
