It is usually taken two or three times a day with or without food to treat gallstones and two times a day to prevent gallstones in people who are losing weight quickly.

Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nIf you need to break the tablet for your specific dose, place the tablet on a flat surface with the scored section on the top."}
