Dasiglucagon injection is in a class of medications called glucagon receptor agonists. It works by causing the liver to release stored sugar to the blood.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nDasiglucagon injection comes as a solution (liquid) in a prefilled syringe and an auto-injector device to inject subcutaneously (just under the skin). It is usually injected as needed at the first sign of severe hypoglycemia. After the injection, the patient should be turned onto their side to prevent choking if they vomit. Use dasiglucagon injection exactly as directed; do not inject it more often or inject more or less of it than prescribed by your doctor.\nAsk your doctor or pharmacist to show you, family, or caregivers who could be injecting the medication how to use and prepare dasiglucagon injection.

This information includes directions for how to use the injection device. Be sure to ask your pharmacist or doctor if you or your caregivers have any questions about how to inject this medication.\nFollowing a dasiglucagon injection, an unconscious person with hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) will usually wake within 15 minutes. Once the dasiglucagon has been given, immediately contact a doctor and get emergency medical treatment. If the person does not awaken within 15 minutes after an injection, give one more dose of dasiglucagon. Feed the individual a fast-acting source of sugar (e.g., regular soft drink or fruit juice) and then a long-acting source of sugar (e.g., crackers, cheese or a meat sandwich) as soon as they awaken and are able to swallow.\nAlways look at the dasiglucagon solution before it is injected. It should be clear, colorless, and free of particles. Do not use dasiglucagon injection if it is cloudy, contains particles, or if the expiration date has passed."}
