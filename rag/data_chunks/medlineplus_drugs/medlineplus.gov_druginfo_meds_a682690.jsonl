Fluoxymesterone is also used to stimulate puberty in men with delayed puberty. Fluoxymesterone may also be used alone or along with other medications in certain women with breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and can not be removed with surgery. Fluoxymesterone is in a class of medications called androgenic hormones. It works by supplying testosterone to replace the testosterone that is normally produced naturally in the body. Testosterone is a hormone produced by the body that contributes to the growth, development, and functioning of the male sexual organs and typical male characteristics. When used to treat breast cancer, testosterone works by blocking the release of estrogen to stop or slow the growth of breast cancer..\nHow should this medicine be used?\nFluoxymesterone comes as a tablet to take by mouth.
