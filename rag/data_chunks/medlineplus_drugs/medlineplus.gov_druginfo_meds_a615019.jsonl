Olodaterol oral inhalation is in a class of medications called long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs). It works by relaxing and opening air passages in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nOlodaterol inhalation comes as a solution to inhale by mouth using a special inhaler. It is usually used once a day. Inhale olodaterol at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use olodaterol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nDo not use olodaterol inhalation to treat sudden attacks of COPD . Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting beta agonist medication such as albuterol (Accuneb, Proair, Proventil, Ventolin) to use during attacks."}

Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting beta agonist medication such as albuterol (Accuneb, Proair, Proventil, Ventolin) to use during attacks. If you were using this type of medication on a regular basis before you began treatment with formoterol, your doctor will probably tell you to stop using it regularly but to continue to use it to treat attacks.\nOlodaterol inhalation should not be used to treat COPD that is quickly getting worse. Call your doctor or get emergency medical help if your breathing problems worsen, if you have to use your short-acting inhaler to treat attacks of COPD more often, or if your short-acting inhaler does not relieve your symptoms.\nBe careful not to spray olodaterol inhalation into your eyes.\nOlodaterol inhalation helps to controls COPD but does not cure it. Continue to use olodaterol inhalation even if you feel well. Do not stop using olodaterol inhalation without talking to your doctor."}
