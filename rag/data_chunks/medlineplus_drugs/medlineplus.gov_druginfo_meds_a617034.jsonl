Neratinib is used along with capecitabine (Xeloda) to treat a certain type of advanced hormone receptor-positive breast cancer or breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body after treatment with at least two other medications. Neratinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of an abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps slow or stop the spread of cancer cells.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nNeratinib comes as a tablet to take by mouth. When neratinib is taken alone to treat breast cancer, it is usually taken with food once daily for one year. When neratinib is taken with capecitabine to treat advanced breast cancer or breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body, it is usually taken once daily with food on days 1 to 21 of a 21-day cycle until your condition worsens or you develop serious side effects. Take neratinib at around the same time every day."}
