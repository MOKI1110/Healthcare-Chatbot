Estrogen vaginal rings are usually inserted in the vagina and left in place for 3 months. After 3 months, the ring is removed, and a new ring may be inserted if treatment is still needed. Vaginal estrogen inserts are usually inserted once daily at the same time for 2 weeks, then used once every 3 to 4 days (twice weekly) as long as treatment is needed. Estrogen vaginal tablets are usually inserted once a day for the first 2 weeks of treatment and then are inserted twice a week as long as treatment is needed.
