Penicillin V potassium is in a class of medications called penicillins. It works by killing bacteria.\nAntibiotics such as penicillin V potassium will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nPenicillin V potassium comes as a tablet and as an oral solution (liquid) to take by mouth. For the treatment of infections, it is usually taken every 6 hours (four times a day) or every 8 hours (three times a day). For the prevention of rheumatic fever, it is usually taken twice a day. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection that you have. Take penicillin V potassium at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take penicillin V potassium exactly as directed."}
