Lansoprazole is in a class of medications called proton pump inhibitors. Clarithromycin and amoxicillin are in a class of medications called antibiotics.

These medications are usually taken before a meal twice a day. To help you take the right number of capsules and tablets at each dose, the medication is packaged in dosing cards. Each dosing card contains all of the medication needed for both daily doses.
