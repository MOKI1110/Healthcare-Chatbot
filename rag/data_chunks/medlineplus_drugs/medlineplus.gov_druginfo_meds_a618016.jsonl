Glycopyrrolate is in a class of medications called anticholinergics."}

Glycopyrrolate is in a class of medications called anticholinergics. It works by relaxing the muscles around the airways in your lungs, making it easier to breathe.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nGlycopyrrolate oral inhalation comes as a powder-filled capsule to inhale by mouth using a special inhaler and as a solution (liquid) to inhale by mouth using a special nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled). It is usually inhaled twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. Inhale glycopyrrolate at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use glycopyrrolate exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nDo not swallow gylcopyrrolate capsules or nebulizer solution.\nDo not use glycopyrrolate oral inhalation during a sudden COPD attack."}

Continue to use glycopyrrolate even if you feel well. Do not stop using glycopyrrolate without talking to your doctor.
