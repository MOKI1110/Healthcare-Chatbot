Doripenem injection is in a class of medications called carbapenem antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria.\nAntibiotics such as doripenem injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nDoripenem injection comes as a liquid to be injected intravenously (into a vein). It is usually given every 8 hours. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection being treated. After your condition improves, your doctor may switch you to another antibiotic that you can take by mouth to complete your treatment. You may receive doripenem injection in a hospital or you may administer the medication at home. If you are using doripenem injection at home, use it at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use doripenem injection exactly as directed."}
