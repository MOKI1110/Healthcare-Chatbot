Treprostinil injection is also used to treat PAH when another medication (epoprostenol) did not help or could not be tolerated. Treprostinil may improve the ability to exercise and slow the worsening of symptoms in patients with PAH. Treprostinil is in a class of medications called vasodilators and platelet-aggregation inhibitors. It works by relaxing the blood vessels, including those in the lungs, and improving blood flow.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nTreprostinil injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be continuously injected subcutaneously (under the skin). Treprostinil injection is usually used with an external subcutaneous infusion pump for continuous delivery of the medication. Treprostinil injection may also be given as a continuous intravenous (into a vein) infusion. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use treprostinil injection exactly as directed."}
