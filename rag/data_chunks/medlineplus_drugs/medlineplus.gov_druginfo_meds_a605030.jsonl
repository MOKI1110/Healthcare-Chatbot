Peginterferon alfa-2b is in a class of medications called interferons. Peginterferon alpha-2b is a combination of interferon and polyethylene glycol, which helps the interferon stay active in your body for a longer period of time. Peginterferon alpha-2b works by decreasing the amount of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the body. Peginterferon alfa-2b may not cure hepatitis C or prevent you from developing complications of hepatitis C such as cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver, liver failure, or liver cancer."}

It is usually injected once a week on the same day of the week, at or around the same time of day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use peginterferon alfa-2b exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of this medication or use it more often or for a longer period of time than prescribed by your doctor.\nPeginterferon alfa-2b controls hepatitis C but may not cure it.
