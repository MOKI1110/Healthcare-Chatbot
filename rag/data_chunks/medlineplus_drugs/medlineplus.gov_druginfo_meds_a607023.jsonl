It is caused by a virus. Rabies is mainly a disease of animals. Humans get rabies when they are bitten by infected animals.\nAt first there might not be any symptoms. But weeks, or even years after a bite, rabies can cause pain, fatigue, headaches, fever, and irritability. These are followed by seizures, hallucinations, and paralysis. Rabies is almost always fatal.\nWild animals, especially bats, are the most common source of human rabies infection in the United States. Skunks, raccoons, dogs, and cats can also transmit the disease.\nHuman rabies is rare in the United States. There have been only 55 cases diagnosed since 1990."}

Skunks, raccoons, dogs, and cats can also transmit the disease.\nHuman rabies is rare in the United States. There have been only 55 cases diagnosed since 1990. However, between 16,000 and 39,000 people are treated each year for possible exposure to rabies after animal bites. Also, rabies is far more common in other parts of the world, with about 40,000 to 70,000 rabies-related deaths each year. Bites from unvaccinated dogs cause most of these cases. Rabies vaccine can prevent rabies.\nRabies vaccine\nRabies vaccine is given to people at high risk of rabies to protect them if they are exposed. It can also prevent the disease if it is given to a person\nafter\nthey have been exposed.\nRabies vaccine is made from killed rabies virus."}

Ask your doctor for details.\nAnyone who has been bitten by an animal, or who otherwise may have been exposed to rabies, should see a doctor immediately. The doctor will determine if they need to be vaccinated.\nA person who is exposed and has never been vaccinated against rabies should get 4 doses of rabies vaccine--one dose right away, and additional doses on the 3rd, 7th, and 14th days. They should also get another shot called Rabies Immune Globulin at the same time as the first dose.\nA person who has been previously vaccinated should get 2 doses of rabies vaccine--one right away and another on the 3rd day."}
