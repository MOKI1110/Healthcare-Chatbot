It is caused by bacteria called\nSalmonella\nTyphi. Typhoid causes a high fever, fatigue, weakness, stomach pains, headache, loss of appetite, and sometimes a rash. If it is not treated, it can kill up to 30% of people who get it. Some people who get typhoid become ''carriers,'' who can spread the disease to others. Generally, people get typhoid from contaminated food or water. Typhoid is rare in the U.S., and most U.S. citizens who get the disease get it while traveling."}

Generally, people get typhoid from contaminated food or water. Typhoid is rare in the U.S., and most U.S. citizens who get the disease get it while traveling. Typhoid strikes about 21 million people a year around the world and kills about 200,000.\nWhat typhoid vaccines are available?\nTyphoid vaccine can prevent typhoid. There are two vaccines to prevent typhoid. One is an inactivated (killed) vaccine given as a shot. The other is a live, attenuated (weakened) vaccine which is taken orally (by mouth).\nWho should get typhoid vaccine and when?\nRoutine typhoid vaccination is not recommended in the United States, but typhoid vaccine is recommended for:\nTravelers to parts of the world where typhoid is common. (NOTE: typhoid vaccine is not 100% effective and is not a substitute for being careful about what you eat or drink).\nPeople in close contact with a typhoid carrier.\nLaboratory workers who work with\nSalmonella\nTyphi bacteria.\nInactivated typhoid vaccine (shot)\nOne dose provides protection."}

The last dose should be given at least 1 week before travel to allow the vaccine time to work.\nSwallow each dose about an hour before a meal with a cold or lukewarm drink.\nDo not chew the capsule.\nA booster dose is needed every 5 years for people who remain at risk. Either vaccine may safely be given at the same time as other vaccines.\nWho should not get typhoid vaccine or should wait?\nInactivated typhoid vaccine (shot)\nShould not be given to children younger than 2 years of age.\nAnyone who has had a severe reaction to a previous dose of this vaccine should not get another dose.\nAnyone who has a severe allergy to any component of this vaccine should not get it."}
