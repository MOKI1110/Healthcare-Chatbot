Choose an area that is comfortable, not rubbed by tight clothing, and covered by clothing to protect it from the sun. Do not put the patch on the same spot more than once a week. Avoid putting it on skin that has cuts, rashes, folds, or that's oily or irritated. Don't use lotion, oil, or powder on the skin before applying the patch. Make sure the skin is clean and dry.\nDo not cut or divide the patch into pieces. Do not use if it is damaged.\nKeep the oxybutynin patch on until it is time to change it."}
