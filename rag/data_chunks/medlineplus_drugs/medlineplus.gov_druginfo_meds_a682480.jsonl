It is also used to slow down movement in the digestive system during certain X-ray lab tests. Glucagon is in a class of medications called glycogenolytic agents. It works by causing the liver to release stored sugar to the blood."}

Glucagon is in a class of medications called glycogenolytic agents. It works by causing the liver to release stored sugar to the blood. It also works by relaxing digestive muscles for X-ray lab testing.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nGlucagon comes as a solution (liquid) in a prefilled syringe, an auto-injector device, and a vial to inject subcutaneously (just under the skin). It also comes as a powder to be mixed with a provided liquid to be injected subcutaneously, intramuscularly (into the muscle), or intravenously (into a vein). Inject as needed to treat very low blood sugar. To slow down the digestive system during X-ray lab tests, it is injected by a doctor or nurse in a medical facility.\nInject at the first sign of severe hypoglycemia  (low blood sugar). After the injection, turn the patient onto their side to prevent choking if they vomit. Immediately contact a doctor and get emergency medical treatment. An unconscious person with hypoglycemia will usually wake up within 15 minutes. If the person does not awaken within 15 minutes after an injection, inject one more dose."}

If you have low blood sugar often, keep glucagon injection with you at all times. You  and a family member or friend should be able to recognize some of the signs and symptoms of low blood sugar (i.e., shakiness, dizziness or lightheadedness, sweating, confusion, nervousness or irritability, sudden changes in behavior or mood, headache, numbness or tingling around the mouth, weakness, pale skin, sudden hunger, clumsy or jerky movements)."}
