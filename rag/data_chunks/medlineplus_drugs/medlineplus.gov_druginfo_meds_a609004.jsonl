Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nTalk to your doctor about how you should use your other oral and inhaled medications for asthma during your treatment with ciclesonide inhalation. If you are using any other inhaled medications, ask your doctor if you should inhale these medications a certain amount of time before and after you inhale ciclesonide inhalation."}
