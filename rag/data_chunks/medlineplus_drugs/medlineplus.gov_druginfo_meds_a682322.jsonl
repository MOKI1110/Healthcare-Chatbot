It works by killing the organisms that cause malaria.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nQuinine comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It usually is taken with food three times a day (every 8 hours) for 3 to 7 days. Take quinine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take quinine exactly as directed."}

This could be a sign that you are experiencing a second episode of malaria.\nTake quinine until you finish the prescription, even if you feel better. If you stop taking quinine too soon or if you skip doses, your infection may not be completely treated and the organisms may become resistant to antimalarials.\nOther uses for this medicine\nQuinine is also sometimes used to treat babesiosis (a serious or life-threatening illness that is transmitted from animals to humans by ticks)."}
