Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nSwallow the tablets and capsules whole; do not chew, split, open, or crush them.\nIf you are taking the oral solution, use a dose measuring spoon or oral syringe to measure the correct amount of liquid needed for each dose.
