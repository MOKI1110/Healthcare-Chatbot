Arformoterol is in a class of medications called long-acting beta agonists (LABAs). It works by relaxing and opening air passages in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nArformoterol comes as a solution (liquid) to inhale by mouth using a nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled). It is usually inhaled twice a day in the morning and the evening. Inhale arformoterol at around the same times every day, and space your doses about 12 hours apart. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use arformoterol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nDo not swallow or inject arformoterol inhalation.\nDo not use arformoterol inhalation to treat sudden attacks of COPD. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting beta agonist medication such as albuterol (Accuneb, Proair, Proventil, Ventolin) to use during attacks."}

Do not use extra doses of arformoterol. Call your doctor right away.\nArformoterol controls the symptoms of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease but does not cure the condition. Continue to use arformoterol even if you feel well. Do not stop using arformoterol without talking to your doctor."}
