It is usually given in a doctor's office once every 2 to 8 weeks, more often in the beginning of your treatment and less often as your treatment continues. Vedolizumab injection also comes as a prefilled syringe and prefilled pen to be given subcutaneously (under the skin). Your doctor may switch you from intravenous to subcutaneous injection at 6 weeks after 2 previous doses of intravenous vedolizumab given at weeks 0 and 2."}
