Apomorphine is in a class of medications called dopamine agonists. It works by acting in place of dopamine, a natural substance produced in the brain that is needed to control movement.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nApomorphine comes as a sublingual film to take under the tongue. Apomorphine sublingual is usually used when needed, according to your doctor's directions."}

Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use apomorphine sublingual exactly as directed.

This medication will help decrease your chance of developing nausea and vomiting while you are using apomorphine, especially during the beginning of treatment. Your doctor will probably tell you to begin taking trimethobenzamide 3 days before you begin to use apomorphine, and to continue taking it for up to 2 months."}
