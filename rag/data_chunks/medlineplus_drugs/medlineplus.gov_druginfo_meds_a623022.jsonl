The combination of budesonide and formoterol is also used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary (COPD; a group of diseases that affect the lungs and airways, that includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema) in adults. Budesonide is in a class of medications called steroids. It works by reducing swelling in the airways. Formoterol is in a class of medications called long-acting beta agonists (LABAs). It works by relaxing and opening air passages in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nThe combination of budesonide and formoterol comes as an aerosol to inhale by mouth using an inhaler. It is usually taken as 2 puffs twice a day, in the morning and the evening, about 12 hours apart. Inhale budesonide and formoterol at about the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use budesonide and formoterol exactly as directed."}
