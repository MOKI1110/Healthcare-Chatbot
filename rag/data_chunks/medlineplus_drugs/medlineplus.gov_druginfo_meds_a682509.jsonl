When used to help prevent nausea and vomiting caused by motion sickness, apply the patch at least 4 hours before its effects will be needed and leave in place for up to 3 days. If treatment is needed for longer than 3 days to help prevent nausea and vomiting caused by motion sickness, remove the current patch and apply a new patch behind the other ear. When used to prevent nausea and vomiting from medications used with surgery, apply the patch as directed by your doctor and leave it in place for 24 hours after your surgery.\nTo apply the patch, follow these instructions:\nAfter washing the area behind the ear, wipe the area with a clean, dry tissue to ensure that the area is dry."}
