Solriamfetol is also used along with breathing devices or other treatments to prevent excessive daytime sleepiness caused by obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS; a sleep disorder in which the patient briefly stops breathing or breathes shallowly many times during sleep and therefore doesn't get enough restful sleep). Solriamfetol is in a class of medications called wakefulness promoting agents. It works by increasing the amounts of certain natural substances in the brain that controls sleep and wakefulness.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nSolriamfetol comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day with or without food as soon as you wake up in the morning. Take solriamfetol at the same time every day. Do not take solriamfetol within 9 hours before you plan to go to bed because it may cause difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep. Do not change the time of day that you take solriamfetol without talking to your doctor."}
