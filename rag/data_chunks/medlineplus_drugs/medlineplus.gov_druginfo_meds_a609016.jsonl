It works by increasing the amount of serotonin and norepinephrine, natural substances that change pain signals in the brain.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nMilnacipran comes as a tablet to be taken by mouth. Take the first dose once on day 1 of therapy. Then take it two times a day. Take with or without food, but taking it with food will decrease  stomach upset. Take milnacipran at around the same times every day.\nTake milnacipran exactly as directed."}
