Pilocarpine ophthalmic is also used to prevent or reduce increased pressure in the eye during and after certain types of laser eye surgery. It is also used during an eye exam to constrict (close) the pupil (the black part of the eye through which you see). Pilocarpine ophthalmic (Vuity, Qlosi) is used to treat presbyopia (a condition in which the lens of the eye loses its ability to focus making hard to see objects up close) in adults. Pilocarpine is in a class of medications called miotics. Pilocarpine ophthalmic treats glaucoma and ocular hypertension by allowing excess fluid to drain from the eye. Pilocarpine ophthalmic treats presbyopia by reducing the size of the pupils which helps to see objects up close.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nPilocarpine ophthalmic comes as a 0.4, 1, 1.25, 2, and 4% solution (liquid) to instill in the eyes.  For the treatment of glaucoma or ocular hypertension, one drop of the 1, 2, or 4% solution is usually into the affected eye(s) up to four times daily."}

For the treatment of presbyopia, one drop of the 1.25% solution (Vuity) is usually instilled into the affected eyes once a day or one drop of the 0.4% solution (Qlosi) into the affected eyes up to twice a day (eye drop can be repeated after 2 to 3 hours for an effect of 8 hours) as needed to control symptoms.
