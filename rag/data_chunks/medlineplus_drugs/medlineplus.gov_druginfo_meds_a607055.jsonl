Lapatinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of the abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps stop or slow the spread of cancer cells.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nLapatinib comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day, at least 1 hour before or 1 hour after a meal. When lapatinib is used to treat advanced or metastatic breast cancer, it is usually given once daily on days 1 to 21 (along with capecitabine on days 1 to 14) of a 21-day cycle. The cycle may be repeated as recommended by your doctor. When lapatinib is used to treat breast cancer in postmenopausal women, it is usually given once daily along with letrozole. Take all of the lapatinib tablets for your daily dose at one time each day; do not divide the tablets to take as separate doses. Take lapatinib at around the same time every day."}
