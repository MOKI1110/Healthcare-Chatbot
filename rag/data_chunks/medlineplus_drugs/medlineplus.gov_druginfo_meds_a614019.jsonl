Umeclidinium is in a class of medications called anticholinergics. Vilanterol is in a class of medications called long-acting beta-agonists (LABAs). These medications work by relaxing and opening air passages in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nThe combination of umeclidinium and vilanterol comes as a powder to inhale by mouth using a special inhaler. It is usually inhaled once a day. Inhale umeclidinium and vilanterol at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use umeclidinium and vilanterol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nDo not use umeclidinium and vilanterol inhalation to treat sudden attacks of COPD."}

If you were using this type of medication on a regular basis before you began treatment with umeclidinium and vilanterol, your doctor will probably tell you to stop using it regularly but to continue to use it to treat attacks.\nUmeclidinium and vilanterol inhalation should not be used to treat COPD that is quickly getting worse. Call your doctor or get emergency medical help if your breathing problems worsen, if you have to use your short-acting inhaler to treat attacks of COPD more often, or if your short-acting inhaler does not relieve your symptoms.\nUmeclidinium and vilanterol inhalation controls COPD but does not cure it.
