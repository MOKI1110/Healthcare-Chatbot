If it isn't treated quickly, it can lead to dehydration and even death. About 100,000-130,000 people are thought to die from cholera each year, almost all of them in countries where the disease is common.\nCholera is caused by bacteria and spread through contaminated food or water. It isn't usually spread directly from person to person, but it can be spread through contact with the feces of an infected person.\nCholera is very rare among U.S. citizens. It is a risk mostly to people traveling in countries where the disease is common (mainly Haiti, and parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific)."}

It is a risk mostly to people traveling in countries where the disease is common (mainly Haiti, and parts of Africa, Asia, and the Pacific). It has also occurred in the United States among people eating raw or undercooked seafood from the Gulf Coast.\nBeing careful about what you eat and drink while traveling and practicing good personal hygiene, can help prevent waterborne and foodborne diseases, including cholera. For someone who has been infected, rehydration (replacing water and chemicals lost through diarrhea or vomiting) can greatly reduce the chance of dying. Vaccination can reduce the risk of getting sick from cholera.\nCholera vaccine\nThe cholera vaccine used in the United States is an oral (swallowed) vaccine. Only one dose is needed. Booster doses are not recommended at this time.\nMost travelers do not need cholera vaccine.\nIf you are an adult 18 through 64 years old traveling to an area where people are getting infected with cholera, your health care provider might recommend the vaccine for you.\nIn clinical studies, cholera vaccine was very effective in preventing severe or life-threatening cholera."}

However, it is not 100% effective against cholera and does not protect from other foodborne or waterborne diseases. Cholera vaccine is not a substitute for being careful about what you eat or drink.\nWho should not receive the cholera vaccine?\nTell the person who is giving you the vaccine:\nIf you have any severe, life-threatening allergies.\nIf you have ever had a life-threatening allergic reaction after a previous dose of any cholera vaccine, or if you have a severe allergy to any ingredient in this vaccine, you should not get the vaccine.\nTell your health care provider if you have any severe allergies that you know of.\nHe or she can tell you about the vaccine's ingredients.\nIf you are pregnant or breastfeeding.\nNot much is known about the potential risks of this vaccine for a pregnant or breastfeeding woman.

It is best to wait at least 10 days after the vaccine to take antimalaria drugs.\nAlways wash your hands thoroughly after using the bathroom and before preparing or handling food. Cholera vaccine can be shed in feces for at least 7 days.\nIf you have a mild illness, like a cold, you can probably get the vaccine today. If you are moderately or severely ill, your doctor might recommend waiting until you recover.\nWhat are the risks of a vaccine reaction?\nWith any medicine, including vaccines, there is a chance of reactions."}
