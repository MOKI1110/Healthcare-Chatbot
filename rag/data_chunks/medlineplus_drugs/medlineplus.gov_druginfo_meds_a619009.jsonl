Revefenacin is in a class of medications called anticholinergics. It works by relaxing the muscles around the airways in your lungs which makes it easier to breathe.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nRevefenacin comes as a solution (liquid) to inhale by mouth using a nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled). It is usually inhaled once a day. Inhale revefenacin at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use revefenacin exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nAlways look at revefenacin nebulizer solution before you inhale it. It should be clear and colorless. Do not use the solution if it is colored, cloudy, or contains solid particles, or if the expiration date on the vial has passed.\nDo not use revefenacin during a sudden COPD attack."}
