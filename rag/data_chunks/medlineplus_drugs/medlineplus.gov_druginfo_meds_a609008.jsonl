Romiplostim is in a class of medications called thrombopoietin receptor agonists. It works by causing the bone marrow to produce more platelets.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nRomiplostim injection comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid to be injected subcutaneously (under the skin) by a doctor or nurse in a medical office. It is injected once a week in people with ITP. It is given as single dose in people who have been exposed to high levels of radiation.\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of romiplostim injection and adjust your dose, not more than once every week. At the beginning of your treatment, your doctor will order a blood test to check your platelet level once every week. Your doctor may increase your dose if your platelet level is too low. If your platelet level is too high, your doctor may decrease your dose or may not give you the medication at all.  After your doctor has found the dose that works for you, your platelet level will be checked once every month."}
