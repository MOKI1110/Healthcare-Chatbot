Collagenase\nClostridium histolyticum\ninjection (Xiaflex) is also used to treat Peyronie's disease (a thickening of tissue [plaque] inside the penis that causes the penis to curve). Collagenase\nClostridium histolyticum\ninjection (QWO) is also used to treat cellulite (fat deposit beneath the skin) in the buttocks of adult women."}

Collagenase\nClostridium histolyticum\ninjection (QWO) is also used to treat cellulite (fat deposit beneath the skin) in the buttocks of adult women. Collagenase\nClostridium histolyticum\ninjection is in a class of medications called enzymes. In people with Dupuytren's contracture, it works by helping to break down the cord of thickened tissue and allows the finger(s) to be straightened. In people with Peyronie's disease, it works by helping to break down the plaque of thickened tissue and allows the penis to be straightened. In women with cellulite, it works by releasing fibrous bands, redistributing fat cells, and stimulating the growth of new collagen.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nCollagenase\nClostridium histolyticum\ninjection comes as a powder to be mixed with a liquid and injected by a doctor. If you are receiving collagenase\nClostridium histolyticum\ninjection (Xiaflex) to treat Dupuytren's contracture, your doctor will inject the medicine into a cord just under the skin in the affected hand."}
