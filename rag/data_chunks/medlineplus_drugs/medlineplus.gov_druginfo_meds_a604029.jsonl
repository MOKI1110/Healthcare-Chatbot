Lack of vitamin B\n12\ncan cause anemia (condition in which the red blood cells do not bring enough oxygen to the organs) and permanent damage to the nerves. This anemia must be treated with vitamin B\n12\ninjections. After the red blood cells have returned to normal, cyanocobalamin nasal gel can be used to stop anemia and other symptoms of lack of vitamin B\n12\nfrom coming back. Cyanocobalamin nasal gel is also used to supply extra vitamin B\n12\nto people who need unusually large amounts of this vitamin because they are pregnant or have certain diseases. Cyanocobalamin nasal gel is in a class of medications called vitamins. It enters the bloodstream through the nose, so it can be used to supply vitamin B\n12\nto people who cannot take in this vitamin through the intestine.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nCyanocobalamin comes as a gel to apply to the inside of the nose. It is usually used once a week."}
