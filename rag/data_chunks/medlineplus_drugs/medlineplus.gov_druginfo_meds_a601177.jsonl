However, polio vaccine can be given if a pregnant woman is at increased risk for infection and requires immediate protection.\nYour health care provider can give you more information.\nWhat are the risks from IPV?\nA sore spot with redness, swelling, or pain where the shot is given can happen after polio vaccination.\nPeople sometimes faint after medical procedures, including vaccination."}
