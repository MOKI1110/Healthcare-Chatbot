The delayed-release tablets are usually taken once a week in the morning, immediately after breakfast. The tablets are usually taken on an empty stomach once a day in the morning, once a week in the morning, once monthly in the morning, or once monthly for two mornings in a row depending on your condition and the dosage prescribed by your doctor."}
