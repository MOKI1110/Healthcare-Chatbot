Nalmefene also comes as an autoinjector (a pre-filled syringe that can be available for quick and easy administration) to be injected intramuscularly or subcutaneously. It is usually given as needed to treat opiate overdoses.\nTo safely administer nalmefene using the autoinjector, inspect solution in the window of the autoinjector every 30 days. If the solution is discolored, cloudy or has particles floating in it, do not use it and obtain a new autoinjector, Nalmefene autoinjector should be stored in a place where it can be obtained easily. If a person is unresponsive and an overdose on opiates is known or suspected, give nalmefene via the autoinjector directly into the outer thigh. Press the needle directly into the injection site (through clothing, if needed) and then firmly press and hold the button at the other end for 3 seconds. Once all of the nalmefene has been given, the viewing window on the autoinjector will turn orange."}
