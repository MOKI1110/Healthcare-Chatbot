Imipenem is in a class of medications called carbapenem antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria. Cilastatin is in a class of medications called dehydropeptidase inhibitors. It works by helping imipenem stay active in your body for a longer period of time.\nAntibiotics such as imipenem and cilastatin injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nImipenem and cilastatin injection comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid to be injected intravenously (into a vein) or intramuscularly (into a muscle). When imipenem and cilastatin is injected intravenously, it is usually infused (injected slowly) over a period of 20 minutes to 1 hour every 6 or 8 hours. When imipenem and cilastatin is given intramuscularly, it is injected into the muscles of the buttocks or thigh once every 12 hours. The length of treatment depends on the type of infection being treated."}
