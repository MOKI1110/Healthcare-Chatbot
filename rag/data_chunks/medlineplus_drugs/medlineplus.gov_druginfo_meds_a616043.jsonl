Doxercalciferol is in a class of medications called vitamin D analogs. It works by helping the body to use more of the calcium found in foods or supplements and by regulating the body's production of parathyroid hormone.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nDoxercalciferol comes as a capsule to take by mouth. For people receiving dialysis treatments, it is usually taken three times weekly at dialysis sessions. For people with chronic kidney disease who are not receiving dialysis treatments, it is usually taken once daily. Take doxercalciferol at around the same time on the appropriate days. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take doxercalciferol exactly as directed."}
