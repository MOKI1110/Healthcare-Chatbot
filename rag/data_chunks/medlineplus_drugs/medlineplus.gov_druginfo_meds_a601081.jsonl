You must use acceptable birth control during your treatment, and for 6 weeks after you stop taking mycophenolate. Your doctor will tell you which forms of birth control are acceptable for you to use. Mycophenolate may decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives (birth control pills), so it is especially important to use a second form of birth control along with this type of contraceptive.\nIf you are a male with a female partner who may become pregnant, you should use acceptable birth control during treatment and for at least 90 days after your last dose."}

These infections may need to be treated in a hospital and may cause death. Tell your doctor if you have any type of infection or if you think you may have any type of infection now.

Your doctor will order certain lab tests to check your body's response to mycophenolate.\nTalk to your doctor about the risks of taking mycophenolate.\nWhy is this medication prescribed?\nMycophenolate is used to prevent transplant organ rejection (attack of the new organ by the immune system) in people who have received kidney, heart, or liver transplants. Mycophenolate is in a class of medications called immunosuppressive agents. It works by weakening the body's immune system so it will not attack and reject the transplanted organ.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nMycophenolate comes as a capsule, a tablet, a delayed-release (releases the medication in the intestine) tablet, and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day on an empty stomach (1 hour before or 2 hours after eating or drinking), unless your doctor tells you otherwise. Take mycophenolate at about the same times every day, and try to space your doses about 12 hours apart."}

If you do get the suspension on your skin, wash the area well with soap and water. If you get the suspension in your eyes, rinse with plain water.
