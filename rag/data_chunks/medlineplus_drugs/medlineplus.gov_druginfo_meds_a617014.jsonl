Aspirin is in a class of medications called antiplatelet agents. It works by preventing platelets (a type of blood cell) from collecting and forming clots that may cause a heart attack or stroke.

It works by decreasing the amount of acid made in the stomach.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nThe combination of aspirin and omeprazole comes as a delayed-release tablet (releases the medication in the intestine to prevent damage to the stomach) to take by mouth."}
