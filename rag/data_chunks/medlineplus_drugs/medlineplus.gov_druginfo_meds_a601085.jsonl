Nitroglycerin transdermal patches can only be used to prevent attacks of angina; they cannot be used to treat an attack of angina once it has begun."}

Nitroglycerin transdermal patches can only be used to prevent attacks of angina; they cannot be used to treat an attack of angina once it has begun. Nitroglycerin is in a class of medications called vasodilators. It works by relaxing the blood vessels so that the heart does not need to work as hard and therefore does not need as much oxygen.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nTransdermal nitroglycerin comes as a patch to apply to the skin. It is usually applied once a day, worn for 12 to 14 hours, and then removed. Apply nitroglycerin patches at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use nitroglycerin patches exactly as directed. Do not apply more or fewer patches or apply the patches more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nChoose a spot on your upper body or upper arms to apply your patch. Do not apply the patch to your arms below the elbows, to your legs below the knees, or to skin folds. Apply the patch to clean, dry, hairless skin that is not irritated, scarred, burned, broken, or calloused."}

Different brands of nitroglycerin patches may be applied in slightly different ways, so be sure to follow the directions included with your patches:\nWash your hands.\nHold the patch so that the plastic backing is facing you.\nBend the sides of the patch away from you and then toward you until you hear a snap.\nPeel off one side of the plastic backing.\nUse the other side of the patch as a handle, and apply the stick half to your skin in the spot you have chosen.\nPress the sticky side of the patch against the skin and smooth it down.\nFold back the other side of the patch."}

If your angina attacks happen more often, last longer, or become more severe at any time during your treatment, call your doctor.\nNitroglycerin patches help prevent attacks of angina but do not cure coronary artery disease. Continue to use nitroglycerin patches even if you feel well.
