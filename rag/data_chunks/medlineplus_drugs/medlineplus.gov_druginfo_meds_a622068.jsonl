You must use acceptable birth control during your treatment, and for 6 weeks after you stop taking mycophenolate. Your doctor will tell you which forms of birth control are acceptable for you to use. Mycophenolate may decrease the effectiveness of oral contraceptives (birth control pills), so it is especially important to use a second form of birth control along with this type of contraceptive.\nIf you are a male with a female partner who may become pregnant, you should use acceptable birth control during treatment and for at least 90 days after your last dose."}
