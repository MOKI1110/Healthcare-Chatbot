Prescription fluticasone nasal spray is used to relieve symptoms of nonallergic rhinitis such as sneezing and runny or stuffy nose which are not caused by allergies. Prescription fluticasone nasal spray (Xhance) is used to treat chronic rhinosinusitis with or without nasal polyps (ongoing runny nose, sinus swelling and/or nasal congestion, with or without a reduced sense of smell or pain and pressure in the face). Fluticasone nasal spray should not be used to treat symptoms (e.g., sneezing, stuffy, runny, itchy nose) caused by the common cold. Fluticasone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids. It works by blocking the release of certain natural substances that cause allergy symptoms.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nFluticasone comes as a (prescription and nonprescription) liquid to spray in the nose. When nonprescription fluticasone nasal spray is used to relieve hay fever and other allergy symptoms, it is usually sprayed in each nostril once daily."}
