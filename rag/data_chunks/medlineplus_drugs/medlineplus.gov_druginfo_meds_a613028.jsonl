Dimethyl fumarate is in a class of medications called Nrf2 activators. It works by decreasing inflammation and preventing nerve damage that may cause symptoms of multiple sclerosis.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nDimethyl fumarate comes as a delayed-release (releases the medication in the intestine to prevent break-down of the medication by stomach acids) capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken twice a day. Take dimethyl fumarate at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take dimethyl fumarate exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nDimethyl fumarate may be taken with or without food."}
