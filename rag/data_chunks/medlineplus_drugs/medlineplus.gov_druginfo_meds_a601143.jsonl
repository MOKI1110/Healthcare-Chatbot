Fluconazole is also used to treat meningitis (infection of the membranes covering the brain and spine) caused by fungus.

The length of your treatment depends on your condition and on how well you respond to fluconazole injection. Your doctor will tell you how long to use fluconazole injection.\nYour doctor may tell you to use a higher dose of fluconazole injection on the first day of your treatment."}
