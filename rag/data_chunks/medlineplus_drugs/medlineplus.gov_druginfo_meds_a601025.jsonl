Benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide may harm the fetus.\nWhy is this medication prescribed?\nThe combination of benazepril and hydrochlorothiazide is used to treat high blood pressure. Benazepril is in a class of medications called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. It works by decreasing certain chemicals that tighten the blood vessels, so blood flows more smoothly. Hydrochlorothiazide is in a class of medications called diuretics ('water pills'). It works by causing the kidneys to get rid of unneeded water and salt from the body into the urine.\nHigh blood pressure is a common condition, and when not treated it can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of the body.\nDamage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems.\nIn addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure.\nThese changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.\nHow should this medicine be used?"}
