If you have asthma, use of salmeterol may increase the chance that you will experience serious or fatal asthma problems.\nYour doctor will only prescribe salmeterol if your asthma is so severe that two medications are needed to control it. You should never use salmeterol alone; you must always use it along with an inhaled steroid medication. Children and teenagers who need to be treated with salmeterol will probably be treated with a product that combines salmeterol and an inhaled steroid medication in a single inhaler to make it easier for them to use both medications as prescribed.\nBecause of the risks of using salmeterol, you should only use salmeterol as long as it is needed to bring your asthma symptoms under control."}

Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions.

It is also is used to prevent bronchospasm (breathing difficulties) during exercise in adults and children 4 years of age and older. Salmeterol is in a class of medications called long-acting beta agonists (LABAs). It works by relaxing and opening air passages in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nSalmeterol comes as a dry powder to inhale by mouth using a specially designed inhaler. When salmeterol is used to treat asthma or COPD, it is usually used twice a day, in the morning and evening, about 12 hours apart. Use salmeterol at around the same times every day. When salmeterol is used to prevent breathing difficulties during exercise, it is usually used at least 30 minutes before exercise but not more often than once every 12 hours."}

Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use salmeterol exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nDo not use salmeterol to treat sudden attacks of asthma or COPD. Your doctor will prescribe a short-acting beta agonist medication such as albuterol (Accuneb, Proair, Proventil, Ventolin) to use during attacks. If you were using this type of medication on a regular basis before you began treatment with salmeterol, your doctor will probably tell you to stop using it regularly but to continue to use it to treat sudden attacks of asthma symptoms.
