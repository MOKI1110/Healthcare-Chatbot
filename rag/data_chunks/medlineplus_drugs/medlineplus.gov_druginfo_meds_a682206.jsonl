These conditions include certain types of arthritis; severe allergic reactions; lupus (a disease in which the body attacks many of its own organs); and certain conditions that affect the lungs, skin, eyes, kidneys, blood, thyroid, stomach, and intestines. It is also sometimes used to treat the symptoms of certain types of cancer. Hydrocortisone is in a class of medications called corticosteroids.
