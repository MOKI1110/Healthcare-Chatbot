Pancrelipase tablets are used along with another medication (proton pump inhibitor; PPI) to improve digestion of foods in adults who cannot digest food normally because they have chronic pancreatitis (swelling of the pancreas) or have had surgery to remove the pancreas. Pancrelipase is in a class of medications called enzymes.  Pancrelipase acts in place of the enzymes normally made by the pancreas.  It works to decrease fatty bowel movements and to improve nutrition by breaking down fats, proteins, and starches from food into smaller substances that can be absorbed from the intestine.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nPancrelipase comes as a tablet and a delayed-release (releases the medication in the intestine where its effects are needed) capsule to take by mouth. It is taken with plenty of water with every meal or snack, usually 5 to 6 times per day."}

Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nPancrelipase is sold under several different brand names, and there are differences among the brand name products.

You may be able to mix the capsule contents with certain other foods. Ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.

After you swallow the mixture, drink a full glass of water or juice right away to wash down the medication.\nIf you are giving the delayed release capsules to a baby, you may open the capsule, sprinkle the contents on a small amount of a soft, acidic food such as jarred baby applesauce, and feed it to the baby right away.
