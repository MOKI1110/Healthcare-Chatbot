When calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate is used to treat cataplexy and excessive daytime sleepiness in patients with cataplexy, it is usually taken twice each night because calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate wears off after a short time, and the effects of one dose will not last for the entire night. When calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium oxybate is used to treat idiopathic hypersomnia, it is usually taken once or twice each night. The first dose is taken at bedtime, and a second dose is taken 2 1/2 to 4 hours after the first dose."}
