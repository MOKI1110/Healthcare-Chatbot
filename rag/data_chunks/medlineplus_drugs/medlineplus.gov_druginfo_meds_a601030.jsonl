Budesonide nasal spray is in a class of drugs called corticosteroids. It works by blocking the release of certain natural substances that cause allergy symptoms.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nBudesonide comes as a suspension (liquid) (prescription and nonprescription) to spray in the nose. Budesonide nasal spray is usually sprayed in each nostril once daily. If you are an adult, you will begin your treatment with a higher dose of budesonide nasal spray and then decrease your dose when your symptoms improve. If you are giving budesonide nasal spray to a child, you will begin treatment with a lower dose of the medication and increase the dose if the child's symptoms do not improve. Decrease the dose when the child's symptoms improve. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use budesonide exactly as directed."}
