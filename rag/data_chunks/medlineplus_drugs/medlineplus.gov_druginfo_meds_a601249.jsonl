Telmisartan may cause death or serious injury to the fetus when taken in the last 6 months of pregnancy.\nWhy is this medication prescribed?\nTelmisartan is used to treat high blood pressure. Telmisartan is also used to decrease the chance of heart attack, stroke, or death in people 55 years of age or older who are at high risk for cardiovascular disease. Telmisartan is in a class of medications called angiotensin II receptor antagonists. It works by blocking the action of certain natural substances that tighten the blood vessels, allowing the blood to flow more smoothly and the heart to pump more efficiently.\nUntreated high blood pressure can damage the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body.\nThis damage may cause heart disease, a heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems.\nAlong with medication, making the following changes will also help to control your blood pressure:  eating a diet low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nTelmisartan comes as a tablet to take by mouth."}
