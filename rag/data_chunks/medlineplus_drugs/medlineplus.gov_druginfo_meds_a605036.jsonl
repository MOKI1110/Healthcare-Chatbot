Children, teenagers, and young adults who take antidepressants to treat depression or other mental illnesses may be more likely to become suicidal than children, teenagers, and young adults who do not take antidepressants to treat these conditions. However, experts are not sure about how great this risk is and how much it should be considered in deciding whether a child or teenager should take an antidepressant. Children younger than 18 years of age should not normally take isocarboxazid, but in some cases, a doctor may decide that isocarboxazid is the best medication to treat a child's condition.\nYou should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways when you take isocarboxazid or other antidepressants even if you are an adult over 24 years of age.

Isocarboxazid is in a class of medications called monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors. It works by increasing the amounts of certain natural substances in the brain that help maintain mental balance.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nIsocarboxazid comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken between two and four times a day. Take isocarboxazid at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take isocarboxazid exactly as directed.\nSwallow the tablets with water or another liquid. If you are unable to swallow the tablets, you can crumble them and swallow the crumbled tablets with food or liquid.\nIsocarboxazid may be habit-forming."}

It may take 3 to 6 weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of isocarboxazid. Tell your doctor if your symptoms do not improve during the first 6 weeks of your treatment with isocarboxazid.
