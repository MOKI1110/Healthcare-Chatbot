It works to prevent bone loss by blocking a certain receptor in the body to decrease bone breakdown. It works to treat GCTB by blocking a certain receptor in the tumor cells which slows the tumor growth. It works to treat high calcium levels by decreasing bone breakdown as the breakdown of bones releases calcium.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nDenosumab injection come as a solution (liquid) to be injected subcutaneously (under the skin) in your upper arm, upper thigh, or stomach area.
