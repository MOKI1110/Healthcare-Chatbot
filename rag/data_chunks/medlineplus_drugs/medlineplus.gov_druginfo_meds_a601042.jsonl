It works by preventing the release of substances that cause inflammation (swelling) in the air passages of the lungs.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nCromolyn oral inhalation comes as a solution (liquid) to inhale by mouth using a special nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled). When the nebulizer is used to prevent symptoms of asthma, it is usually used 4 times a day. When the nebulizer is used to prevent breathing difficulty caused by exercise, cold and dry air, or by inhaling a substance (trigger), it is usually used 10 to 15 minutes before exercise or before you come into contact with the trigger. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use cromolyn exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nCromolyn controls asthma but does not cure it."}

Do not stop using cromolyn without talking to your doctor.\nCromolyn oral inhalation helps to prevent asthma attacks (sudden episodes of shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing) but will not stop an asthma attack that has already started.
