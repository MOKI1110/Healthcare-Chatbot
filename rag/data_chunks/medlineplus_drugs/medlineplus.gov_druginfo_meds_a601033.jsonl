Candesartan may cause death or serious injury to the fetus when taken in the last 6 months of pregnancy.\nWhy is this medication prescribed?\nCandesartan is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure. Candesartan is also used alone or in combination with other medications to treat congestive heart failure (a condition when your heart can not pump enough blood to the other parts of the body). Candesartan is in a class of medications called angiotensin II receptor antagonists. It works by blocking the action of certain natural substances that tighten the blood vessels, allowing the blood to flow more smoothly and the heart to pump more efficiently.\nHigh blood pressure is a common condition, and when not treated it can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys, and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems."}
