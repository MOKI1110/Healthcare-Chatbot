Isosorbide extended-release (long-acting) tablets and extended-release capsules are used for the management of chest pain in people who have coronary artery disease. Isosorbide can only be used to prevent angina; it cannot be used to treat an episode of angina once it has begun. Isosorbide is in a class of medications called vasodilators. It works by relaxing the blood vessels so the heart does not need to work as hard and therefore does not need as much oxygen.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nIsosorbide comes as a tablet, an extended-release (long-acting) tablet, and an extended-release capsule to take by mouth. The tablet usually is taken two or three times daily. The extended-release tablet usually is taken once daily in the morning. The extended-release capsule usually is taken once daily.\nSwallow the extended-release tablets or capsules whole; do not crush, chew, or divide them. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take isosorbide exactly as directed."}
