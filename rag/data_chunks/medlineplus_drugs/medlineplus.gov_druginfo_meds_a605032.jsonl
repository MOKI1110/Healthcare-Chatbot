Sodium oxybate is in a class of medications called central nervous system depressants.

Sodium oxybate (Lumryz\n®\n) comes as an extended-release (long-acting) powder for oral suspension to be mixed with water and take by mouth. Sodium oxybate (Xyrem\n®\n) immediate-release oral solution is usually taken twice each night because sodium oxybate wears off after a short time, and the effects of one dose will not last for the entire night. The first dose is taken at bedtime, and the second dose is taken 2 1/2 to 4 hours after the first dose. Sodium oxybate (Lumryz\n®\n) extended-release powder for oral suspension is usually taken once daily at bedtime. Sodium oxybate must be taken on an empty stomach, so the first dose should be taken at least 2 hours after eating. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand.\nDo not take your bedtime dose(s) of sodium oxybate until you or your child are in bed and are ready to go to sleep for the night."}
