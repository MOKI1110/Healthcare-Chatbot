Vardenafil is in a class of medications called phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors. It works by increasing blood flow to the penis during sexual stimulation. This increased blood flow can cause an erection. Vardenafil does not cure erectile dysfunction or increase sexual desire."}

Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nIf you are taking the rapidly disintegrating tablet, check the blister pack before you take your first dose."}
