Eltrombopag is also used in combination with other medications to treat aplastic anemia (condition in which the body does not make enough new blood cells) in adults and children 2 years of age and older. It is also used to treat aplastic anemia in adults who have not been helped with other medications. Eltrombopag is used to increase the number of platelets enough to decrease the risk of bleeding in people with ITP or aplastic anemia, or to allow treatment with interferon and ribavirin in people with hepatitis C.

Eltrombopag is in a class of medications called thrombopoietin receptor agonists. It works by causing the cells in the bone marrow to produce more platelets.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nEltrombopag comes as a tablet and as a powder for oral suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken once a day on an empty stomach, at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after eating. Take eltrombopag at around the same time every day.
