Mexiletine should be used only to treat people with life-threatening arrhythmias.\nTalk to your doctor about the risks of taking mexiletine.\nWhy is this medication prescribed?\nMexiletine is used to treat certain types of ventricular arrhythmias (abnormal heart rhythms). Mexiletine is in a class of medications called antiarrhythmics. It works by blocking certain electrical signals in the heart to stabilize the heart rhythm.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nMexiletine comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken three times a day, every 8 hours. Some people may take it twice daily, every 12 hours, once their arrhythmias have been controlled with mexiletine. Mexiletine should be taken with food or an antacid to prevent stomach upset. Take mexiletine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take mexiletine exactly as directed."}
