It is usually taken once a day for 3 to 6 weeks, but sometimes may be taken intermittently, as a single dose once every 2 weeks, or as a single dose once a month. The length of treatment depends on the types of drugs you are taking, how well your body responds to them, and the type of cancer you have. Take chlorambucil at around the same time every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take chlorambucil exactly as directed."}
