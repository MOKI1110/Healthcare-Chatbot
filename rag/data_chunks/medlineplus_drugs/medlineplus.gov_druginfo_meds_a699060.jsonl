Rabeprazole is used to treat damage from GERD, allow the esophagus to heal, and prevent further damage to the esophagus in adults. Rabeprazole is also used to treat conditions in which the stomach produces too much acid, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome in adults. Rabeprazole is used to treat ulcers (sores in the lining of the stomach or intestine) and is used in combination with other medications to eliminate\nH. pylori\n(a bacteria that causes ulcers) in adults. Rabeprazole is in a class of medications called proton-pump inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of acid made in the stomach.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nRabeprazole comes as a delayed-release (releases the medication in the intestine to prevent break-down of the medication by stomach acids) tablet to take by mouth. The delayed-release tablets are usually taken once a day. When used to treat ulcers, rabeprazole tablets are taken after the morning meal. When used in combination with other medications to eliminate\nH. pylori\n, rabeprazole tablets are taken twice a day, with the morning and evening meals, for 7 days."}
