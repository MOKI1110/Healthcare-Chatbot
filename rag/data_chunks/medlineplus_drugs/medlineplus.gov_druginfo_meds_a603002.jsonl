It works by relaxing the muscles in the airways and tightening the blood vessels.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nEpinephrine injection comes as a prefilled automatic injection device containing a solution (liquid) and in vials to inject subcutaneously (under the skin) or intramuscularly (into the muscle) to treat life-threatening allergic reactions.
