When used to treat lice, it is usually applied to the scalp and hair in one or sometimes two treatments. If live lice are seen one week after the first treatment, then a second treatment of spinosad suspension should be applied. When used to treat scabies, it is usually applied to the skin in one treatment. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use spinosad suspension exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nIf used to treat lice, your hair length will determine how much suspension to use for each treatment. If you have long hair or thick, medium length hair, you may need to use the entire bottle."}
