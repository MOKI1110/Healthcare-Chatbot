Atezolizumab and hyaluronidase-tqjs injection is also used in combination with other chemotherapy medications to treat certain types of small cell lung cancer (SCLC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC; a type of liver cancer), and melanoma (a type of skin cancer). Atezolizumab is also used alone to treat certain types of alveolar soft tissue sarcomas (cancer that forms in muscles, fat, or nerves). Atezolizumab is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It works by blocking the action of a certain protein in cancer cells. This helps the person's immune system to fight against the cancer cells, and helps to slow tumor growth.  Hyaluronidase-tqus is an endoglycosidase. It helps to keep atezolizumab in the body longer so that the medication will have a greater effect.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nAtezolizumab and hyaluronidase-tqjs injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected under the skin in the thigh over approximately 7 minutes."}
