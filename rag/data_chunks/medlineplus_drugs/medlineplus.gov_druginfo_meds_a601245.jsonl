Oxcarbazepine is in a class of medications called anticonvulsants. It works by decreasing abnormal electrical activity in the brain.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nOxcarbazepine comes as a tablet, an extended-release tablet, and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. The tablet and suspension are usually taken every 12 hours (twice a day) with or without food. The extended-release tablet is usually taken once a day on an empty stomach, 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal. Take oxcarbazepine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take oxcarbazepine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nShake the suspension well right before each use to mix the medication evenly. Use the oral dosing syringe that came with the medication to withdraw the right amount of suspension from the bottle."}

Wash the syringe with warm water and allow it to dry thoroughly after use.\nSwallow the extended-release tablets whole with water or another liquid; do not split, chew, or crush them.\nYour doctor will probably start you on a low dose of oxcarbazepine and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every 3 days. If you were taking another medication to treat your seizures and are switching to oxcarbazepine, your doctor may gradually decrease your dose of the other medication while increasing your dose of oxcarbazepine. Follow these directions carefully and ask your doctor if you are not sure how much medication you should take.\nOxcarbazepine may help control your seizures but will not cure your condition. Continue to take oxcarbazepine even if you feel well."}
