Liothyronine is ineffective for weight reduction in normal thyroid patients and may cause serious or life-threatening toxicity, especially when taken with amphetamines. Talk to your doctor about the potential risks associated with this medication.\nWhy is this medication prescribed?\nLiothyronine is used to treat hypothyroidism (a condition where the thyroid gland does not produce enough thyroid hormone). Liothyronine is also used to treat a goiter (an enlarged thyroid gland) and to test for hyperthyroidism (a condition where the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone). Liothyronine is in a class of medications called thyroid agents. It works by supplying the thyroid hormones normally produced by the body.\nCurrently, there is not enough evidence from clinical studies to support the use of liothyronine, alone or in combination with other medications, as the first choice of therapy to treat hypothyroidism.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nLiothyronine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It usually is taken once daily."}
