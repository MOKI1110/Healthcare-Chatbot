PEG-ES is in a class of medications called osmotic laxatives. It works by causing watery diarrhea so that the stool can be emptied from the colon. The medication also contains electrolytes to prevent dehydration and other serious side effects that may be caused by fluid loss as the colon is emptied.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nPolyethylene glycol-electrolyte solution (PEG-ES) comes as a powder to mix with water and take by mouth. Certain PEG-ES products may also be given through a nasogastric tube (NG tube; a tube that is used to carry liquid nutrition and medication through the nose to the stomach for people who cannot eat enough food by mouth). It is usually taken the evening before and/or the morning of the procedure. Your doctor will tell you when you should begin taking PEG-ES, and whether you should take all of the medication at one time or take it as two separate doses."}

Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take PEG-ES exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it than prescribed by your doctor.\nYou may not eat any solid foods or drink milk before and during your treatment with PEG-ES. You should only have clear liquids. Your doctor will tell you when to begin the clear liquid diet and can answer any question about which liquids are allowed. Examples of clear liquids are water, light colored fruit juice without pulp, clear broth, coffee or tea without milk, flavored gelatin, popsicles, and soft drinks. Do not drink any liquid that is red or purple. You will need to drink a certain amount of clear liquids during your treatment to decrease the chance that you will become dehydrated as your colon is emptied."}

Read the directions that come with your medication to see how much water you should add to the powder and whether you should mix it in the container it came in or in another container. Follow these directions carefully and be sure to shake or stir the mixture so that the medication is mixed evenly. If your medication comes with flavor packets, you may add the contents of one packet to the medication to improve the taste, but you should not add any other flavorings to the medication. Do not mix your medication with any liquid other than water, and do not try to swallow the medication powder without mixing it with water.

You will probably be told to drink one 8 ounce (240 mL) glass of PEG-ES every 10 or 15 minutes, and to continue drinking until your liquid bowel movements are clear and free of solid material. It is best to drink each glass of medication quickly instead of sipping it slowly. Dispose of any leftover medication that you use for this treatment.\nYou will have many bowel movements during your treatment with PEG-ES. Be sure to stay close to a toilet from the time you take your first dose of the medication until the time of your colonoscopy appointment. Ask your doctor about other things you can do to stay comfortable during this time.\nYou may experience stomach pain and bloating while you are taking your medication.
