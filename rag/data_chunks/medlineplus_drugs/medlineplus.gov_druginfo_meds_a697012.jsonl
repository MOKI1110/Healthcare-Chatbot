Topiramate is also used with other medications to control seizures in people who have Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (a disorder that causes seizures and developmental delays). Topiramate is also used to prevent migraine headaches but not to relieve the pain of migraine headaches when they occur in adults and children 12 years of age and older. Topiramate is in a class of medications called anticonvulsants. It works by decreasing abnormal excitement in the brain.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nTopiramate comes as a tablet, a sprinkle capsule (capsule that contains small beads of medication that can be sprinkled on food), an extended-release (long-acting) capsule and solution (liquid) to take by mouth.  The tablets, sprinkle capsules, and solution are usually taken with or without food once or twice a day. The extended-release capsules are usually taken with or without food once a day. Take topiramate at around the same time(s) every day."}
