Zolmitriptan is in a class of medications called selective serotonin receptor agonists.

Zolmitriptan does not stop migraine attacks from coming or reduce the number of headaches you have.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nZolmitriptan comes as a spray to inhale through the nose. Use at the first sign of a migraine headache. If your symptoms improve after you use zolmitriptan but return after 2 hours or longer, you may use a second dose of zolmitriptan. However, if your symptoms do not improve after you use zolmitriptan, do not use a second dose without talking to your doctor.  Use zolmitriptan exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nIf you use zolmitriptan more often or for longer than the recommended period of time, your headaches may get worse or may occur more frequently."}
