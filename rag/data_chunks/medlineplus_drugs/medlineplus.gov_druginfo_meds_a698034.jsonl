Because this drug is no longer available in the US market, the material in this monograph is no longer updated. If this drug is used in countries other than the U.S., it is essential that the manufacturers' labeling be consulted for more recently available information.\nWhy is this medication prescribed?\nPalivizumab injection is used to help prevent respiratory syncytial virus (RSV; common virus that can cause serious lung infections) in children less than 24 months old who are at high risk for getting RSV. Children at high risk for RSV include those who were born prematurely or have certain heart or lung diseases. Palivizumab injection is not used to treat the symptoms of RSV disease once a child already has it. Palivizumab injection is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It works by helping the immune system to slow or stop the spread of the virus in the body.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nPalivizumab injection comes as a liquid to be injected into the muscles of the thigh by a doctor or nurse."}

The first dose of palivizumab injection is usually given before the beginning of RSV season, followed by a dose every 28 to 30 days throughout RSV season. RSV season usually starts in the fall and continues through spring (November through April) in most parts of the United States but may be different where you live. Talk to your doctor about how many shots your child will need and when they will be given.\nIf your child has surgery for certain types of heart disease, your healthcare provider may need to give your child an additional dose of palivizumab injection soon after surgery, even if it has been less than 1 month from the last dose.\nYour child may still get severe RSV disease after receiving palivizumab injection. Talk to your child's healthcare provider about the symptoms of RSV disease."}
