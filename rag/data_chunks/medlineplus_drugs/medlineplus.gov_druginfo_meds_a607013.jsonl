It is caused by bacteria called\nBacillus anthracis\n. People can get anthrax from contact with infected animals, wool, meat, or hides.\nCutaneous Anthrax.\nIn its most common form, anthrax is a skin disease that causes skin ulcers and usually fever and fatigue. Up to 20% of these cases are fatal if untreated.\nGastrointestinal Anthrax.\nThis form of anthrax can result from eating raw or undercooked infected meat. Symptoms can include fever, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, abdominal pain and swelling, and swollen lymph glands."}

Symptoms can include fever, nausea, vomiting, sore throat, abdominal pain and swelling, and swollen lymph glands. Gastrointestinal anthrax can lead to blood poisoning, shock, and death.\nInhalation Anthrax.\nThis form of anthrax occurs when\nB. anthracis\nis inhaled, and is very serious. The first symptoms can include a sore throat, mild fever and muscle aches. Within several days these symptoms are followed by severe breathing problems, shock, and often meningitis (inflammation of the brain and spinal cord covering). This form of anthrax requires hospitalization and aggressive treatment with antibiotics. It is often fatal.\nWhat is anthrax vaccine?\nAnthrax vaccine protects against anthrax disease. The vaccine used in the United States does not contain\nB. anthracis\ncells and it does not cause anthrax."}

The vaccine used in the United States does not contain\nB. anthracis\ncells and it does not cause anthrax. Anthrax vaccine was licensed in 1970 and relicensed in 2008.\nBased on limited but sound evidence, the vaccine protects against both cutaneous (skin) and inhalational anthrax.\nWho should get anthrax vaccine and when?\nAnthrax vaccine is recommended for certain people 18 through 65 years of age who might be exposed to large amounts of\nB. anthracis\nbacteria on the job, including:\ncertain laboratory or remediation workers\nsome people handling animals or animal products\nsome military personnel, as determined by the Department of Defense\nThese people should get five doses of vaccine (in the muscle): the first dose when risk of a potential exposure is identified, and the remaining doses at 4 weeks and 6, 12, and 18 months after the first dose.\nAnnual booster doses are needed for ongoing protection.\nIf a dose is not given at the scheduled time, the series does not have to be started over."}

These people should get three doses of vaccine (under the skin), with the first dose as soon after exposure as possible, and the second and third doses given 2 and 4 weeks after the first.\nWho should not get anthrax vaccine or should wait?\nAnyone who has had a serious allergic reaction to a previous dose of anthrax vaccine should not get another dose.\nAnyone who has a severe allergy to any vaccine component should not get a dose.

Nursing mothers may safely be given anthrax vaccine.\nWhat are the risks from anthrax vaccine?\nLike any medicine, a vaccine could cause a serious problem, such as a severe allergic reaction.\nAnthrax is a very serious disease, and the risk of serious harm from the vaccine is extremely small.\nTenderness on the arm where the shot was given (about 1 person out of 2)\nRedness on the arm where the shot was given (about 1 out of 7 men and 1 out of 3 women)\nItching on the arm where the shot was given (about 1 out of 50 men and 1 out of 20 women)\nLump on the arm where the shot was given (about 1 out of 60 men and 1 out of 16 women)\nBruise on the arm where the shot was given (about 1 out of 25 men and 1 out of 22 women)\nMuscle aches or temporary limitation of arm movement (about 1 out of 14 men and 1 out of 10 women"}
