It is also used to treat repeat outbreaks of herpes virus cold sores or fever blisters in people with a normal immune system. Famciclovir is used to treat repeat outbreaks and to prevent further outbreaks of genital herpes (a herpes virus infection that causes sores to form around the genitals and rectum from time to time) in people with a normal immune system. Famciclovir is also used to treat returning herpes simplex infections of the skin and mucus membranes (mouth, anus) in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Famciclovir is in a class of medications called antivirals. It works by stopping the spread of the herpes virus in the body. Famciclovir does not cure herpes infections and may not stop the spread of herpes virus to other people. However, it may decrease the symptoms of pain, burning, tingling, tenderness, and itching; help sores to heal; and prevent new sores from forming.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nFamciclovir comes as a tablet to take by mouth with or without food."}

When famciclovir is used to treat shingles, it is usually taken every 8 hours (three times a day) for 7 days, starting within 3 days after the rash begins to appear. When famciclovir is used to treat cold sores and fever blisters, it is usually taken as one dose at the earliest sign or symptom (tingling, itching, or burning) of a cold sore. When famciclovir is used to treat repeat outbreaks of genital herpes, it is usually taken twice a day for one day, starting within 6 hours of the first sign or symptom of the condition. To keep genital herpes from returning, famciclovir is usually taken twice a day for up to 1 year. When famciclovir is used to treat herpes infection in people infected with HIV, it is usually taken twice a day for 7 days.
