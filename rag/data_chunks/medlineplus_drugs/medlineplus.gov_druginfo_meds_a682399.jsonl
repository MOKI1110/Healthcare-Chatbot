This may cause mild diarrhea or may cause a life-threatening condition called colitis (inflammation of the large intestine). Clindamycin is more likely to cause this type of infection than many other antibiotics, so it should only be used to treat serious infections that cannot be treated by other antibiotics."}

Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had colitis or other conditions that affect your stomach or intestines.\nYou may develop these problems during your treatment or up to several months after your treatment has ended.

Using antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nClindamycin comes as a capsule and a solution (liquid) to take by mouth. It is usually taken three to four times a day. The length of your treatment depends on the type of infection you have and how well you respond to the medication. Take clindamycin at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take clindamycin exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nSwallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.\nTake the capsules with a full glass (6 to 8 ounces [180 to 240 mL]) of water so that the medication will not irritate your throat."}
