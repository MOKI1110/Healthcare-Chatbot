Ropinirole is also used to treat restless legs syndrome (RLS; a condition that causes discomfort in the legs and a strong urge to move the legs, especially at night and when sitting or lying down).

When ropinirole is used to treat restless legs syndrome, take the regular tablet once a day, 1 to 3 hours before bedtime.
