Lack of vitamin B\n12\nmay cause anemia (condition in which the red blood cells do not bring enough oxygen to the organs) and permanent damage to the nerves. Cyanocobalamin injection also may be given as a test to see how well the body can absorb vitamin B\n12\n. Cyanocobalamin injection is in a class of medications called vitamins. Because it is injected straight into the bloodstream, it can be used to supply vitamin B\n12\nto people who cannot absorb this vitamin through the intestine.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nCyanocobalamin comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected into a muscle or just under the skin. It is usually injected by a healthcare provider in an office or clinic. You will probably receive cyanocobalamin injection once a day for the first 6-7 days of your treatment."}

It is usually injected by a healthcare provider in an office or clinic. You will probably receive cyanocobalamin injection once a day for the first 6-7 days of your treatment. As your red blood cells return to normal, you will probably receive the medication every other day for 2 weeks, and then every 3-4 days for 2-3 weeks. After your anemia has been treated, you will probably receive the medication once a month to prevent your symptoms from coming back.\nCyanocobalamin injection will supply you with enough vitamin B\n12\nonly as long as you receive injections regularly. You may receive cyanocobalamin injections every month for the rest of your life. Keep all appointments to receive cyanocobalamin injections even if you feel well. If you stop receiving cyanocobalamin injections, your anemia may return and your nerves may be damaged.\nOther uses for this medicine\nCyanocobalamin injection is also sometimes used to treat inherited conditions that decrease the absorption of vitamin B\n12\nfrom the intestine."}
