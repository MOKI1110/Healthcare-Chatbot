A small number of children, teenagers, and young adults (up to 24 years of age) who took antidepressants ('mood elevators') such as bupropion during clinical studies became suicidal (thinking about harming or killing oneself or planning or trying to do so). Children, teenagers, and young adults who take antidepressants to treat depression or other mental illnesses may be more likely to become suicidal than children, teenagers, and young adults who do not take antidepressants to treat these conditions. The combination of dextromethorphan and bupropion is not approved for use in children under 18 years of age.\nYou should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways when you take the combination of dextromethorphan and bupropion even if you are an adult over 24 years of age.
