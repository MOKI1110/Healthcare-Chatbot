Aztreonam injection also may be used before, during, and sometimes for a brief period after surgery in order to prevent the patient from getting an infection. It is also used for the prevention of infections following colorectal surgery. Aztreonam is in a class of medications called monobactam antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria.\nAntibiotics such as aztreonam injection will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nAztreonam injection comes as a powder to be mixed with liquid to be injected intravenously (into a vein) or intramuscularly (into a muscle). When aztreonam is injected intravenously, it is usually infused (injected slowly) over a period of 20 minutes to 1 hour. When aztreonam is given intramuscularly, it is injected into the muscles of the buttocks or thighs. How often you receive aztreonam injection and the length of your treatment depends on the type of infection you have and how your body responds to the medication."}
