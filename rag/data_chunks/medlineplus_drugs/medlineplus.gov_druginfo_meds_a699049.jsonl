Becaplermin cannot be used to treat ulcers that have been stitched or stapled. Becaplermin is a human platelet-derived growth factor, a substance naturally produced by the body that helps in wound healing. It works by helping to repair and replace dead skin and other tissues, attracting cells that repair wounds, and helping to close and heal the ulcer.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nBecaplermin comes as a gel to apply to the skin. It is usually applied once a day to the ulcer. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use becaplermin gel exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor. Using more gel than your doctor prescribed will not help your ulcer heal faster.\nYour doctor will show you how to measure becaplermin gel and will tell you how much gel to apply. The amount of gel you will need depends on the size of your ulcer."}
