Olmesartan may cause death or serious injury to the fetus when taken in the last 6 months of pregnancy.\nWhy is this medication prescribed?\nOlmesartan is used alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure in adults and children 6 years of age and older. Olmesartan is in a class of medications called angiotensin II receptor antagonists. It works by blocking the action of certain natural substances that tighten the blood vessels, allowing the blood to flow more smoothly and the heart to pump more efficiently.\nHigh blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems.
