Ulipristal should not be used to prevent pregnancy on a regular basis. This medication is to be used as an emergency contraceptive or backup in case regular birth control fails or is used incorrectly."}

This medication is to be used as an emergency contraceptive or backup in case regular birth control fails or is used incorrectly. Ulipristal is in a class of medications called progestins. It works by preventing or delaying the release of an egg from the ovary. It also may work by changing the lining of the uterus (womb) to prevent development of a pregnancy. Ulipristal may prevent pregnancy, but it will not prevent the spread of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, the virus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]) and other sexually transmitted diseases.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nUlipristal comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food as soon as possible after unprotected sexual intercourse or suspected failure of a hormonal contraceptive (such as birth control pills, rings or patches). Ulipristal may be taken up to 120 hours (5 days) after unprotected sexual intercourse, but the sooner it is taken, the more likely that it will prevent pregnancy."}

Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take ulipristal exactly as directed.\nUlipristal may be used at any time during the menstrual cycle. However, it should not be used more than once during the same menstrual cycle.\nIf you vomit less than 3 hours after you take ulipristal, call your doctor. You may need to take another dose of this medication.\nBecause you can become pregnant right after treatment with ulipristal, you should use a barrier method (condom or diaphragm with spermicide) every time you have sex until your next menstrual period. Using hormonal contraceptives within 5 days of taking ulipristal may make both medications less effective. You may begin or resume using hormonal contraceptives at least 5 days after taking ulipristal, but you must continue to also use a barrier method to prevent pregnancy until after you have your next period."}
