Talk to your doctor about the risks and benefits of using this medicine for your condition.\nThis medication should not be used when you first begin your treatment. You should take this medication only after the appropriate dosages of spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide are individually established by your doctor.\nWhy is this medication prescribed?\nThe combination of spironolactone and hydrochlorothiazide is used to treat high blood pressure. This medication is also used to treat patients with edema (fluid retention) caused by various conditions, including heart, liver, or kidney disease. Spironolactone is in a class of medications called aldosterone receptor antagonists. It causes the kidneys to eliminate unneeded water and sodium from the body into the urine, but reduces the loss of potassium from the body. Hydrochlorothiazide is in a class of medications called diuretics (''water pills''). It works by causing the kidneys to get rid of unneeded water and salt from the body into the urine.\nHigh blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body."}
