Prescription lansoprazole is used to allow the esophagus to heal and prevent further damage to the esophagus in adults with GERD. Prescription lansoprazole is also used to treat ulcers (sores in the lining of the stomach or intestine), to prevent more ulcers from developing in adults whose ulcers have already healed, and to decrease the risk that adults who are taking nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) will develop ulcers. Prescription lansoprazole is also used to treat conditions where the stomach produces too much acid, such as Zollinger-Ellison syndrome in adults. Prescription lansoprazole is also used in combination with other medications to treat and prevent stomach ulcers caused by a certain type of bacteria (\nH. pylori\n) in adults."}

Lansoprazole is in a class of medications called proton pump inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of acid made in the stomach.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nPrescription lansoprazole comes as a delayed-release (releases the medication in the intestine to prevent break-down of the medication by stomach acids) capsule and as a delayed-release orally disintegrating (dissolving) tablet to take by mouth. Nonprescription lansoprazole comes as a delayed-release capsule to take by mouth. Prescription lansoprazole is usually taken once a day, before a meal. When taken in combination with other medications to eliminate\nH. pylori\n, prescription lansoprazole is taken twice a day (every 12 hours) or three times a day (every 8 hours), before a meal, for 10 to 14 days."}
