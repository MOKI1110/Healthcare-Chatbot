Miglustat is also used in combination with another medication known as cipaglucosidase alfa-atga (Pombilti) to treat late onset Pompe disease (a genetic condition that causes deficiency in lysosomal acid alpha-glucosidase, which can lead to muscle weakness and wasting) in adult patients who weigh 92 pounds (40 kg) or more and who have not been improving on their enzyme therapy. Miglustat is in a class of medications called enzyme inhibitors. It works by preventing the body from producing the fatty substance so that less of it will build up in the body and cause symptoms.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nMiglustat comes as a capsule to take by mouth. For treatment of Gaucher disease (Zavesca), it is usually taken with or without food and with plenty of water up to three times a day. For treatment of Pompe disease (Opfolda), it is usually taken every other week approximately 1 hour before the planned administration of cipaglucosidase alfa-atga (Pombilti)."}
