Aclidinium is in a class of medications called bronchodilators. It works by relaxing and opening the air passages to the lungs to make breathing easier.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nAclidinium comes as a dry powder in an inhalation device to inhale by mouth. It is usually inhaled twice a day, once every 12 hours. Inhale aclidinium at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Inhale aclidinium exactly as directed. Do not inhale more or less of it or inhale it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nDo not use aclidinium to treat a sudden attack of wheezing or shortness of breath. Your doctor will prescribe a rescue medication to treat sudden attacks of symptoms. Keep this rescue medication with you at all times in case you have sudden difficulty breathing.\nYour condition may worsen over time during your treatment with aclidinium."}

Keep this rescue medication with you at all times in case you have sudden difficulty breathing.\nYour condition may worsen over time during your treatment with aclidinium. Do not take extra doses of aclidinium if this happens. Call your doctor or get emergency medical help if your breathing problems worsen, you need to use your rescue medication to treat sudden attacks more often, or your rescue medication does not relieve your symptoms as well as it did in the past.\nAclidinium can help control your symptoms but does not cure COPD. You may notice some improvement in your symptoms the first day that you use aclidinium, but it may take longer for you to feel the full benefit of the medication. Continue to use aclidinium even if you feel well. Do not stop using aclidinium without talking to your doctor.\nBefore you use your aclidinium inhalation device for the first time, read the manufacturer's directions for use carefully. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you how to use the device and practice using it while he or she watches.\nBe careful not to get aclidinium powder in your eyes."}
