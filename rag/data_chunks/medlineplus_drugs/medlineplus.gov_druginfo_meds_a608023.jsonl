This type of bleeding may occur during or after heart or liver surgery; in people who have certain bleeding disorders; in people who have cancer of the prostate (a male reproductive gland), lung, stomach, or cervix (opening of the uterus); and in pregnant women experiencing placental abruption (placenta separates from the uterus before the baby is ready to be born). Aminocaproic acid is also used to control bleeding in the urinary tract (the organs in the body that produce and excrete urine) that may occur after prostate or kidney surgery or in people who have certain types of cancer. Aminocaproic acid should not be used to treat bleeding that is not caused by faster than normal clot breakdown, so your doctor may order tests to find the cause of your bleeding before you begin your treatment. Aminocaproic acid is in a class of medications called hemostatics."}

Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nShake the liquid well before each use to mix the medication evenly.\nYour doctor may start you on a high dose of aminocaproic acid and gradually decrease your dose as the bleeding is controlled.\nOther uses for this medicine\nAminocaproic acid is also sometimes used to treat bleeding in the eye that was caused by an injury."}
