It works by drawing water into the large intestine to produce a soft bowel movement.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nRectal sodium phosphate comes as an enema to insert in the rectum. It is usually inserted when a bowel movement is desired. The enema usually causes a bowel movement within 1 to 5 minutes. Follow the directions on the package label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use rectal sodium phosphate exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than directed on the package label. Do not use more than one enema in 24 hours even if you have not had a bowel movement.  Using too much rectal sodium phosphate may cause serious damage to the kidneys or heart and possibly death.\nRectal sodium phosphate is available in a regular- and large-size enema for adults and a small-size enema for children. Do not give the adult-size enema to a child. If you are giving the child-size enema to a child who is 2 to 5 years of age, you should give half of the contents. To prepare this dose, unscrew the cap of the bottle and remove 2 tablespoons of liquid using a measuring spoon."}
