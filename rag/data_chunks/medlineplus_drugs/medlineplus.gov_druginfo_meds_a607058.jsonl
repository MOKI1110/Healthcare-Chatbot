These biosimilar products are highly similar to pegfilgrastim injection and work the same way as pegfilgrastim injection in the body. Therefore, the term pegfilgrastim injection products will be used to represent these medications in this discussion.\nWhy is this medication prescribed?\nPegfilgrastim injection products are used to reduce the chance of infection in people who have certain types of cancer and are receiving chemotherapy medications that may decrease the number of neutrophils (a type of blood cell needed to fight infection). Pegfilgrastim injection (Neulasta, Stimufend, Udenyca, Ziextenzo) is also used to increase the chance of survival in people who have been exposed to harmful amounts of radiation, which can cause severe and life-threatening damage to bone marrow. Pegfilgrastim is in a class of medications called colony stimulating factors. It works by helping the body make more neutrophils.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nPegfilgrastim injection products come as a solution (liquid) in prefilled injection syringes and a prefilled autoinjector to inject subcutaneously (under the skin)."}

Pegfilgrastim injection products (Neulasta, Udneyca) also come in a prefilled on-body injector to apply to the skin. If you are using a pegfilgrastim injection product to decrease the risk of infection during chemotherapy, it is usually given as a single dose for each chemotherapy cycle, no sooner than 24 hours after the last dose of chemotherapy of the cycle is given and more than 14 days before beginning the next chemotherapy cycle. If you are using pegfilgrastim injection because you have been exposed to harmful amounts of radiation, it is usually given as 2 single doses, 1 week apart. Your doctor will tell you exactly when you should use pegfilgrastim injection products.\nPegfilgrastim injection products may be given to you by a nurse or other healthcare provider, you may be told to inject the medication yourself at home, or you may receive a prefilled on-body injector by the nurse or healthcare provider that will inject the medication automatically for you at home."}
