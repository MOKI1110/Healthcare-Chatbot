Hydrochlorothiazide is in a class of medications called diuretics ('water pills'). It works by causing the kidneys to get rid of unneeded water and salt from the body into the urine.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nThe combination of valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide comes as a tablet to take by mouth. Take once a day with or without food. Take valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide at around the same time every day.\nTake valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide exactly as directed."}
