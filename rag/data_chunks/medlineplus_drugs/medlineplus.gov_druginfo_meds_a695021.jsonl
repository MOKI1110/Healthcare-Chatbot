Ipratropium is in a class of medications called bronchodilators. It works by relaxing and opening the air passages to the lungs to make breathing easier.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nIpratropium comes as a solution (liquid) to inhale by mouth using a nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled) and as an aerosol to inhale by mouth using an inhaler. The nebulizer solution is usually used three or four times a day, once every 6 to 8 hours. The aerosol is usually used four times a day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use ipratropium exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nTalk to your doctor about what you should do if you experience symptoms such as wheezing, difficulty breathing, or chest tightness."}

Your doctor will probably give you a different inhaler that acts more quickly than ipratropium to relieve these symptoms. Your doctor may also tell you to use additional puffs of ipratropium along with other medications to treat these symptoms. Follow these directions carefully and be sure you know when you should use each of your inhalers. Do not use extra puffs of ipratropium unless your doctor tells you that you should. Never use more than 12 puffs of ipratropium inhalation aerosol in a 24-hour period.\nCall your doctor if your symptoms worsen or if you feel that ipratropium inhalation no longer controls your symptoms. Also call your doctor if you were told to use extra doses of ipratropium and you find that you need to use more doses than usual.\nIf you are using the inhaler, your medication will come in canisters. Each canister of ipratropium aerosol is designed to provide 200 inhalations."}

Each canister of ipratropium aerosol is designed to provide 200 inhalations. After the labeled number of inhalations has been used, later inhalations may not contain the correct amount of medication. You should keep track of the number of inhalations you have used. You can divide the number of inhalations in your inhaler by the number of inhalations you use each day to find out how many days your inhaler will last. Dispose of the canister after you have used the labeled number of inhalations even if it still contains some liquid and continues to release a spray when it is pressed. Do not float the canister in water to see if it still contains medication.\nBe careful not to get ipratropium into your eyes. If you are using the inhaler, keep your eyes closed when you use the medication. If you are using the nebulizer solution, you should use a nebulizer with a mouthpiece instead of a face mask. If you must use a face mask, ask your doctor how you can prevent the medication from leaking."}
