In addition to the rash, shingles can cause fever, headache, chills, or upset stomach. More rarely, shingles can lead to pneumonia, hearing problems, blindness, brain inflammation (encephalitis), or death.\nThe most common complication of shingles is long-term nerve pain called postherpetic neuralgia (PHN). PHN occurs in the areas where the shingles rash was, even after the rash clears up. It can last for months or years after the rash goes away."}

PHN occurs in the areas where the shingles rash was, even after the rash clears up. It can last for months or years after the rash goes away. The pain from PHN can be severe and debilitating.\nAbout 10 to 18% of people who get shingles will experience PHN. The risk of PHN increases with age. An older adult with shingles is more likely to develop PHN and have longer lasting and more severe pain than a younger person with shingles.\nShingles is caused by the varicella zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. After you have chickenpox, the virus stays in your body and can cause shingles later in life. Shingles cannot be passed from one person to another, but the virus that causes shingles can spread and cause chickenpox in someone who had never had chickenpox or received chickenpox vaccine.\nShingles vaccine (recombinant)\nRecombinant shingles vaccine provides strong protection against shingles."}

It is given as a two-dose series.\nThis vaccine is also recommended for people who have already gotten another type of shingles vaccine, the live shingles vaccine."}

Symptoms usually went away on their own in 2 to 3 days.\nYou should still get the second dose of recombinant zoster vaccine even if you had one of these reactions after the first dose.\nPeople sometimes faint after medical procedures, including vaccination.
