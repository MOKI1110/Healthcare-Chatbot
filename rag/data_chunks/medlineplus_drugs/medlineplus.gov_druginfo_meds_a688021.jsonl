The delayed-release tablets (Lialda) are usually taken with food once a day by adults and children. The delayed-release tablets (Asacol HD) are usually taken on an empty stomach three times a day (1 hour before or 2 hours after meals) by adults. The extended-release capsules (Apriso) are usually taken with or without food once a day in the morning by adults. The extended-release capsules (Pentasa) are usually taken with or without food four times a day by adults."}
