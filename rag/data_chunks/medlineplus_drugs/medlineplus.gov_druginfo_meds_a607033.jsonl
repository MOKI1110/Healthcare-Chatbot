It is also used to treat people with type 2 diabetes (condition in which the blood sugar is too high because the body does not produce or use insulin normally) who need insulin to control their diabetes. In patients with type 1 diabetes, insulin glulisine is usually used with another type of insulin, unless it is used in an external insulin pump. In patients with type 2 diabetes, insulin glulisine also may be used with another type of insulin or with oral medication(s) for diabetes. Insulin glulisine is a short-acting, synthetic version of human insulin. Insulin glulisine works by replacing the insulin that is normally produced by the body and by helping move sugar from the blood into other body tissues where it is used for energy. It also stops the liver from producing more sugar.\nOver time, people who have diabetes and high blood sugar can develop serious or life-threatening complications, including heart disease, stroke, kidney problems, nerve damage, and eye problems."}

Using medication(s), making lifestyle changes (e.g., diet, exercise, quitting smoking), and regularly checking your blood sugar may help to manage your diabetes and improve your health. This therapy may also decrease your chances of having a heart attack, stroke, or other diabetes-related complications such as kidney failure, nerve damage (numb, cold legs or feet; decreased sexual ability in men and women), eye problems, including changes or loss of vision, or gum disease. Your doctor and other healthcare providers will talk to you about the best way to manage your diabetes.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nInsulin glulisine comes as a solution (liquid) to inject subcutaneously (under the skin). It is usually injected up to 15 minutes before a meal or within 20 minutes after starting a meal. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use insulin glulisine exactly as directed."}

A doctor or nurse will carefully monitor you for side effects.\nNever use insulin glulisine when you have symptoms of hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) or if you have checked your blood sugar and found it to be low.\nInsulin glulisine controls diabetes but does not cure it. Continue to use insulin glulisine even if you feel well. Do not stop using insulin glulisine without talking to your doctor.
