Your doctor will order certain tests before and during treatment to check your body's response to amikacin.\nWhy is this medication prescribed?\nAmikacin oral inhalation is used in combination with other antibiotics to treat\nMycobacterium avium\ncomplex lung disease (MAC; a bacterial infection that may cause serious symptoms) that has not responded well to other antibiotics. Amikacin is in a class of medications called aminoglycoside antibiotics. It works by killing bacteria.\nAntibiotics such as amikacin oral inhalation will not work for colds, flu, or other viral infections. Taking antibiotics when they are not needed increases your risk of getting an infection later that resists antibiotic treatment.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nAmikacin oral inhalation comes as a suspension to inhale by mouth using a special nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled). It is usually inhaled once a day. Use amikacin oral inhalation at around the same time every day."}
