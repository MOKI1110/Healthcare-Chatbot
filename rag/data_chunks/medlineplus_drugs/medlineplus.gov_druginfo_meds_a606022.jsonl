Ondansetron is in a class of medications called serotonin 5-HT\n3\nreceptor antagonists. It works by blocking the action of serotonin, a natural substance that may cause nausea and vomiting.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nOndansetron comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected intravenously (into a vein) or intramuscularly (into a muscle) by a health care provider in a hospital or clinic. When ondansetron is used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy, it is usually given 30 minutes before the start of chemotherapy. Additional doses may be given 4 hours after the first dose of ondansetron and 8 hours after the first dose of ondansetron, if needed. When ondansetron is used to prevent nausea and vomiting caused by surgery, it is usually given just before the surgery. Ondansetron is also sometimes given after surgery to patients who are experiencing nausea and vomiting and who did not receive ondansetron before surgery.\nThis medication may be prescribed for other uses."}
