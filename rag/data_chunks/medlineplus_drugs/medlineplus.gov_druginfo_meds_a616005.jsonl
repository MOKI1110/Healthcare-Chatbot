Osimertinib is also used to treat a certain type of NSCLC that  has spread to nearby tissues and cannot be removed surgery in people who have responded to chemotherapy and radiation treatments. It is also used alone and in combination with other chemotherapy medications as a first treatment for a certain type of NSCLC that has spread to nearby tissues or to other parts of the body in adults. Osimertinib is also used to treat certain types of NSCLC that has spread to other parts of the body in people who could not be treated successfully with other similar chemotherapy medications. Osimertinib is in a class of medications called kinase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of the abnormal protein that signals cancer cells to multiply. This helps stop or slow the spread of cancer cells and may help shrink tumors.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nOsimertinib comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is usually taken with or without food once a day. The length of your treatment depends on how well this medication works for you and the side effects that you experience.
