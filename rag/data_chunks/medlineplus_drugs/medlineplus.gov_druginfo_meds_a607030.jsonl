It is given as a single shot. For people who remain at risk, a booster dose is recommended every 10 years.\nYellow fever vaccine may be given at the same time as most other vaccines.\nHow can I prevent yellow fever?\nYellow fever vaccine can prevent yellow fever. Yellow fever vaccine is given only at designated vaccination centers. After getting the vaccine, you should be given a stamped and signed ''International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis'' (yellow card). This certificate becomes valid 10 days after vaccination and is good for 10 years.\nYou will need this card as proof of vaccination to enter certain countries.\nTravelers without proof of vaccination could be given the vaccine upon entry or detained for up to 6 days to make sure they are not infected. Discuss your itinerary with your doctor or nurse before you get your yellow fever vaccination."}
