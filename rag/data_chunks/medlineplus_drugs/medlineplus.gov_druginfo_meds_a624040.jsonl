Ensifentrine is in a class of medications called phosphodiesterase inhibitors. It works by blocking the action of certain natural substances in the body that cause inflammation and muscle tightness in the lungs, which results in relaxing and opening air passages in the lungs, making it easier to breathe.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nEnsifentrine comes as a suspension (liquid) to inhale by mouth using a nebulizer (machine that turns medication into a mist that can be inhaled). It is usually inhaled twice a day, in the morning and in the evening. Inhale ensifentrine at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use ensifentrine exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nDo not use ensifentrine during a sudden COPD attack."}

If you stop using ensifentrine, your symptoms may get worse.\nBefore you use ensifentrine for the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or respiratory therapist to show you how to use the nebulizer and compressor. Practice using the nebulizer and compressor while he or she watches.\nEnsifentrine oral inhalation should be used only in a standard jet nebulizer with a mouthpiece connected to an air compressor.
