Amphotericin B injection is in a class of medications called antifungals. It works by slowing the growth of fungi that cause infection.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nAmphotericin B injection comes as a solid powder cake to be made into a solution and then injected intravenously (into a vein) by a nurse or a doctor.

Before you receive your first dose, you may receive a test dose over 20 to 30 minutes to see if you can tolerate the medication. The length of your treatment depends on your general health, how you tolerate the medication, and the type of infection you have.\nYou may experience a reaction while you receive a dose of amphotericin B injection. These reactions usually happen 1 to 3 hours after starting your infusion and are more severe with the first few doses.
