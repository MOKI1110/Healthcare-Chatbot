If you take too much dexmethylphenidate, you may continue to feel a need to take large amounts of the medication, and you may experience unusual changes in your behavior. You or your caregiver should tell your doctor immediately, if you experience any of the following symptoms: fast, pounding, or irregular heartbeat; sweating; dilated pupils; abnormally excited mood; restlessness; difficulty falling sleeping or staying asleep; hostility; aggression; anxiety; loss of appetite; loss of coordination; uncontrollable movement of a part of the body; flushed skin; vomiting; stomach pain; or thinking about harming or killing oneself or others or planning or trying to do so."}

Also, tell your doctor if you drink or have ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, use or have ever used street drugs, or have overused prescription medications.\nDo not stop taking dexmethylphenidate without talking to your doctor, especially if you have overused the medication. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually and monitor you carefully during this time. You may develop severe depression if you suddenly stop taking dexmethylphenidate after overusing it. Your doctor may need to monitor you carefully after you stop taking dexmethylphenidate, even if you have not overused the medication, because your symptoms may worsen when treatment is stopped.\nDo not sell, give away, or let anyone else take your medication. Selling or giving away dexmethylphenidate is against the law and may harm others. Store dexmethylphenidate in a safe place where no one else can take it accidentally or on purpose."}
