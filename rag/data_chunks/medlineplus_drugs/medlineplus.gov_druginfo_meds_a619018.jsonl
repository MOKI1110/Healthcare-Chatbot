Levodopa inhalation will not work to prevent ''off'' episodes but will help to control symptoms when an ''off'' episode has already begun. Levodopa is in a class of medications called dopamine agonists. Levodopa works by mimicking the action of dopamine, a natural substance in the brain that is lacking in patients with PD.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nLevodopa inhalation comes as a capsule to use with a specially designed oral inhaler. You will use the inhaler to breathe in the dry powder contained in the capsules. It is usually inhaled when needed. You will need to orally inhale the contents of two capsules for a full dose. Do\nnot\ninhale more than one dose (2 capsules) per \"off\" period. Do\nnot\ninhale more than 5 doses in one day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use levodopa inhalation exactly as directed."}
