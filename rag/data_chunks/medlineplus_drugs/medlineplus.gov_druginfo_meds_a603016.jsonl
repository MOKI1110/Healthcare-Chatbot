You can also visit\nhttps://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm\nto obtain the Medication Guide.\nWhy is this medication prescribed?\nGlatiramer injection is used to treat various forms of multiple sclerosis (MS; a disease that damages  nerves and can cause  weakness, numbness, trouble walking or talking, vision changes, and other problems).\nGlatiramer is in a class of medications called immunomodulators. It works by stopping the body from damaging its own nerve cells (myelin).\nHow should this medicine be used?\nGlatiramer comes as a solution to inject subcutaneously (under the skin). Depending on your dose, it is usually injected either once a day or three days every week (with at least 48 hours between doses, for example every Monday, Wednesday, Friday). To help you remember to inject glatiramer, inject it around the same time every day.\nUse glatiramer exactly as directed."}
