Rectal mesalamine is in a class of medications called anti-inflammatory agents. It works by stopping the body from producing a certain substance that may cause inflammation.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nRectal mesalamine comes as a suppository and an enema to use in the rectum. The suppository and the enema are usually used once a day at bedtime. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Use rectal mesalamine exactly as directed. Do not use it more or less of it or use it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nYou should begin to feel better during the first few days or weeks of your treatment with rectal mesalamine. Continue to use rectal mesalamine until you finish your prescription, even if you feel better at the beginning of your treatment. Do not stop using rectal mesalamine without talking to your doctor.\nMesalamine suppositories and enemas may stain clothing and other fabrics, flooring, and painted, marble, granite, enamel, vinyl, and other surfaces."}
