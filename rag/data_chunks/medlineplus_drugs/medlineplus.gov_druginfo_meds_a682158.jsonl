Children, teenagers, and young adults who take antidepressants to treat depression or other mental illnesses may be more likely to become suicidal than children, teenagers, and young adults who do not take antidepressants to treat these conditions. However, experts are not sure about how great this risk is and how much it should be considered in deciding whether a child or teenager should take an antidepressant. Children younger than 18 years of age should not normally take maprotiline, but in some cases, a doctor may decide that maprotiline is the best medication to treat a child's condition.\nYou should know that your mental health may change in unexpected ways when you take maprotiline or other antidepressants even if you are an adult over 24 years of age.
