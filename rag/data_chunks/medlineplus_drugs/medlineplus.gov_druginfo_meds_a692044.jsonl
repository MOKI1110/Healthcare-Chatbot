Amlodipine is in a class of medications called calcium channel blockers. It lowers blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels so the heart does not have to pump as hard."}

Amlodipine is in a class of medications called calcium channel blockers. It lowers blood pressure by relaxing the blood vessels so the heart does not have to pump as hard. It controls chest pain by increasing the supply of blood to the heart. If taken regularly, amlodipine controls chest pain, but it does not stop chest pain once it starts. Your doctor may prescribe a different medication to take when you have chest pain.\nUntreated high blood pressure can damage the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body. This damage may cause heart disease, a heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. Along with medication, making the following changes will also help to control your blood pressure:  eating a diet low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nAmlodipine comes as a tablet, an oral solution (liquid), and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth. Take once a day with or without food. Take amlodipine around the same time every day.\nTake amlodipine exactly as directed."}
