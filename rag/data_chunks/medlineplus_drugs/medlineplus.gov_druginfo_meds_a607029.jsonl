It can also cause fever, tiredness, loss of appetite, and headache. It can lead to skin infections, pneumonia, inflammation of the blood vessels, swelling of the brain and/or spinal cord covering, and infections of the bloodstream, bone, or joints."}

Some people who get chickenpox get a painful rash called \"shingles\" (also known as herpes zoster) years later.\nChickenpox is usually mild, but it can be serious in infants under 12 months of age, adolescents, adults, pregnant women, and people with a weakened immune system. Some people get so sick that they need to be hospitalized. It doesn't happen often, but people can die from chickenpox.\nMost people who are vaccinated with 2 doses of varicella vaccine will be protected for life.\nVaricella vaccine\nChildren need 2 doses of varicella vaccine, usually:\nFirst dose: 12 through 15 months of age\nSecond dose: 4 through 6 years of age\nOlder children, adolescents, and adults also need 2 doses of varicella vaccine if they are not already immune to chickenpox.\nVaricella vaccine may be given at the same time as other vaccines."}

People who are moderately or severely ill should usually wait until they recover before getting varicella vaccine.\nYour health care provider can give you more information.\nRisks of a vaccine reaction\nSore arm from the injection, redness or rash where the shot is given, or fever can happen after varicella vaccination.\nMore serious reactions happen very rarely. These can include pneumonia, infection of the brain and/or spinal cord covering, or seizures that are often associated with fever.\nIn people with serious immune system problems, this vaccine may cause an infection that may be life-threatening. People with serious immune system problems should not get varicella vaccine.\nIt is possible for a vaccinated person to develop a rash. If this happens, the varicella vaccine virus could be spread to an unprotected person. Anyone who gets a rash should stay away from infants and people with a weakened immune system until the rash goes away."}

Talk with your health care provider to learn more.\nSome people who are vaccinated against chickenpox get shingles (herpes zoster) years later. This is much less common after vaccination than after chickenpox disease.\nPeople sometimes faint after medical procedures, including vaccination. Tell your provider if you feel dizzy or have vision changes or ringing in the ears.\nAs with any medicine, there is a very remote chance of a vaccine causing a severe allergic reaction, other serious injury, or death.\nWhat if there is a serious problem?\nAn allergic reaction could occur after the vaccinated person leaves the clinic. If you see signs of a severe allergic reaction (hives, swelling of the face and throat, difficulty breathing, a fast heartbeat, dizziness, or weakness), call 9-1-1 and get the person to the nearest hospital.\nFor other signs that concern you, call your health care provider.\nAdverse reactions should be reported to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS)."}
