Sumatriptan is in a class of medications called selective serotonin receptor agonists. It works by narrowing blood vessels in the head, stopping pain signals from being sent to the brain, and stops the release of certain natural substances that cause pain, nausea, and other symptoms of migraines. Sumatriptan does not stop migraine attacks from coming or reduce the number of headaches you have.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nSumatriptan comes as a tablet to take by mouth. Take at the first sign of a migraine headache. If your symptoms improve after you take sumatriptan but return after 2 hours or longer, you may take a second tablet. However, if your symptoms do not improve after you take sumatriptan, do not take a second tablet without calling your doctor. Your doctor will tell you the maximum number of tablets you may take in a 24-hour period. Take sumatriptan exactly as directed."}
