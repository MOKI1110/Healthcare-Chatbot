Boceprevir is in a class of medications called protease inhibitors. It works by decreasing the amount of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the body. Boceprevir may not prevent the spread of hepatitis C to other people.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nBoceprevir comes as a capsule to take by mouth. It is usually taken with a meal or light snack three times a day (every 7 to 9 hours). Take boceprevir at around the same times every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand. Take boceprevir exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nYou will take peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for 4 weeks before you begin treatment with boceprevir. Then you will take all three medications for 12 to 44 weeks. After this time, you will stop taking boceprevir, but you may continue to take peginterferon alfa and ribavirin for an additional number of weeks."}
