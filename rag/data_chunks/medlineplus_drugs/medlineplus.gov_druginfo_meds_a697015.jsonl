Do not take valsartan if you are pregnant. If you become pregnant while you are taking valsartan, stop taking valsartan and call your doctor immediately. Valsartan may cause death or serious injury to the fetus when taken in the last 6 months of pregnancy.\nWhy is this medication prescribed?\nValsartan is used in adults and in children 1 year of age and older alone or in combination with other medications to treat high blood pressure.  It is also used in adults to treat heart failure (condition in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood to the rest of the body) and to improve survival after a heart attack. Valsartan is in a class of medications called angiotensin II receptor antagonists. It works by blocking the action of certain natural substances that tighten the blood vessels, allowing the blood to flow more smoothly and the heart to pump more efficiently.\nHigh blood pressure is a common condition and when not treated, can cause damage to the brain, heart, blood vessels, kidneys and other parts of the body."}

Damage to these organs may cause heart disease, a heart attack, heart failure, stroke, kidney failure, loss of vision, and other problems. In addition to taking medication, making lifestyle changes will also help to control your blood pressure. These changes include eating a diet that is low in fat and salt, maintaining a healthy weight, exercising at least 30 minutes most days, not smoking, and using alcohol in moderation.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nValsartan comes as a tablet and a suspension (liquid) to take by mouth.  For the treatment of high blood pressure, the tablet or suspension is usually taken once a day with or without food.  For the treatment of heart failure or heart attack, it is usually taken twice a day with or without food. To help you remember to take valsartan, take it at around the same time(s) every day. Follow the directions on your prescription label carefully, and ask your doctor or pharmacist to explain any part you do not understand."}
