Pimozide should only be used to treat severe tics that stop the person from learning, working, or performing daily activities.\nPimozide is in a class of medications called conventional antipsychotics. It works by decreasing abnormal excitement in the brain.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nPimozide comes as a tablet to take by mouth.
