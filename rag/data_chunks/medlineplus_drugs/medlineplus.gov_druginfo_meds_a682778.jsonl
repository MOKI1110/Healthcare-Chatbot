Keep this product out of the reach of children. In case of an accidental overdose, call your doctor or a poison control center immediately.\nWhy is this medication prescribed?\nIron (as ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate, or ferrous sulfate) is used to treat or prevent anemia (a lower-than-normal number of red blood cells) when the amount of iron taken in from your diet is not enough. Iron is a mineral that is available as a dietary supplement. It works by providing iron to help the body to produce red blood cells.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nIron supplements (as ferrous fumarate, ferrous gluconate, ferrous sulfate) come as regular, film-coated, and extended-release (long acting) tablets; capsules, and an oral liquid (drops and elixir) to take by mouth. Iron is usually taken with food or immediately after a meal once daily or as directed by your doctor. Take iron at around the same time(s) every day.\nTake iron supplements exactly as directed."}
