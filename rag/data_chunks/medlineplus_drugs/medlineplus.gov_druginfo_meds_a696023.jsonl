Sumatriptan is in a class of medications called selective serotonin receptor agonists."}

Sumatriptan is in a class of medications called selective serotonin receptor agonists. It works by narrowing blood vessels in the brain, stopping pain signals from being sent to the brain, and stops the release of certain natural substances that cause pain, nausea, and other symptoms of migraine or cluster headaches. Sumatriptan does not stop migraine attacks from coming or reduce the number of headaches you have.\nHow should this medicine be used?\nSumatriptan injection comes as a solution (liquid) to inject subcutaneously (just under your skin). Use at the first sign of a migraine headache. If your symptoms improve after you use sumatriptan but return after 1 hour or longer, you may use a second dose. However, if your symptoms do not improve after you use sumatriptan, do not use a second injection without talking to your doctor. Use sumatriptan exactly as directed. Do not use more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.\nSumatriptan injection comes in a pre-filled auto-injection device and in vials to be used with disposable syringes."}
