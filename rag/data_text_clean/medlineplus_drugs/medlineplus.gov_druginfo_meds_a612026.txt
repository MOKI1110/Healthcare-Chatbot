IMPORTANT WARNING:
If you have an epidural or spinal anesthesia or a shot in your spine while using a 'blood thinner' such as fondaparinux injection, you could get a blood clot near your spine that can cause paralysis. Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had spinal surgery, problems with medication given through the spine, a spinal deformity, or if you have bleeding problems. Tell your doctor and pharmacist if you are taking other anticoagulants ('blood thinners') such as warfarin, anagrelide, aspirin or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, naproxen), cilostazol, clopidogrel, dipyridamole, eptifibatide, prasugrel, ticlopidine, and tirofiban. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: muscle weakness, numbness or tingling (especially in your legs), or not being able to move your legs.
Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor may order certain tests to check your body's response to fondaparinux injection.
Talk to your doctor about the risk of using fondaparinux injection.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Fondaparinux injection is used to:
prevent deep vein thrombosis (DVT; a blood clot, usually in the leg) in certain conditions.
treat DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE; a blood clot in the lung).
Fondaparinux injection is in a class of medications called factor Xa inhibitors. It works by slowing down and stopping blood from clotting.
How should this medicine be used?
Fondaparinux injection comes as a solution (liquid) to be injected subcutaneously (under the skin).   It is given one time a day. Use fondaparinux injection at around the same time every day.
Use fondaparinux injection exactly as directed. Do not inject more or less of it or inject it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
If you will continue to use fondaparinux after your hospital stay, you or a caregiver can inject fondaparinux. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you or the caregiver how to inject it. Before you use fondaparinux injection yourself the first time, read the Patient Information that comes with it. This information includes directions for how to use and inject fondaparinux prefilled safety syringes. Be sure to ask your pharmacist or doctor if you have any questions about how to inject this medication.
Each syringe has enough medication in it for one shot. Do not use the syringe and needle more than one time. Your doctor, pharmacist, or healthcare provider will tell you how to dispose of used needles and syringes safely.
Do not mix fondaparinux injection with other medications or solutions.
