IMPORTANT WARNING:
Important warning for older adults with dementia:
Older adults with dementia (loss of memory and brain function) may have an increased chance of death if treated with an antipsychotic medication such as brexpiprazole. Older adults with dementia may also have an increased risk of having a stroke or ministroke during treatment with antipsychotics.
Brexpiprazole is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of psychosis (loss of touch with reality) without agitation in older adults with dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. Talk to the doctor who prescribed this medication if you, a family member, or someone you care for has dementia and is taking brexpiprazole.
Important warning for people who have depression:
Children, teenagers, and young adults who take antidepressants to treat depression or other mental illnesses have a greater risk of becoming suicidal. This is especially of concern at the beginning of your treatment and any time that your dose is changed. You, your family, or your caregiver should call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: new or worsening depression; new or worsening anxiety; thinking about harming or killing yourself, or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; panic attacks; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; aggressive behavior; irritability; acting without thinking; severe restlessness; and mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood). Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to seek treatment on your own.
