Why is this medication prescribed?
Levomilnacipran is used to treat depression. Levomilnacipran is in a class of medications called selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs). It works by increasing the amount of serotonin and norepinephrine, natural substances in the brain that helps maintain mental balance.
How should this medicine be used?
Levomilnacipran comes as an extended-release (long-acting) capsule to take by mouth. Take once daily with or without food. Take levomilnacipran at around the same time every day.
Take levomilnacipran exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Swallow the capsules whole; do not open, chew, or crush them.
Your doctor may start you on a low dose of levomilnacipran and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every 2 days.
Levomilnacipran controls depression but does not cure it. It may take several weeks or longer before you feel the full benefit of levomilnacipran. Continue to take levomilnacipran even if you feel well. Do not stop taking levomilnacipran without talking to your doctor. Your doctor will probably decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking levomilnacipran, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as mood changes, agitation, irritability, dizziness, ringing in the ears, shock-like sensations, anxiety, confusion, tiredness, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, numbness or tingling in the arms, legs, hands, or feet, headache, increased sweating, seizures, or nausea.
