Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking clonazepam.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Clonazepam is used to control certain types of seizures. It is also used to treat panic attacks (sudden, unexpected attacks of extreme fear and worry about these attacks). Clonazepam is in a class of medications called benzodiazepines. It works by decreasing abnormal electrical activity in the brain.
How should this medicine be used?
Clonazepam comes as a tablet and an orally disintegrating tablet (tablet that dissolves quickly in the mouth) to take by mouth. It is taken one to three times a day with or without food. Take clonazepam at around the same time(s) every day.
Take lorazepam exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Do not try to push the orally disintegrating tablet through the foil. Instead, use dry hands to peel back the foil packaging. Place the tablet in your mouth immediately. The tablet will quickly dissolve and can be swallowed with or without liquid.
Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of clonazepam and gradually increase your dose, not more often than once every 3 days.
Other uses for this medicine
Clonazepam is also used to treat symptoms of akathisia (restlessness and a need for constant movement) that may occur as a side effect of treatment with antipsychotic medications (medications for mental illness) and to treat acute catatonic reactions (state in which a person does not move or speak at all or moves or speaks abnormally). Talk to your doctor about the possible risks of using this medication for your condition.
This medication is sometimes prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.

drugs, foods or substances. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about the allergy and what

There is a chance that you may experience changes in your mental health if you take a medication such as clonazepam, but there may also be a risk that you will experience changes in your mental health if your condition is not treated.
Call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: panic attacks; agitation or restlessness; new or worsening irritability, anxiety, or depression; acting on dangerous impulses; difficulty falling or staying asleep; aggressive, angry, or violent behavior; mania (frenzied, abnormally excited mood), talking or thinking about wanting to hurt yourself or end your life, withdrawing from friends and family; preoccupation with death and dying, giving away prized possessions, or any other unusual changes in behavior or mood.
Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to do so.
