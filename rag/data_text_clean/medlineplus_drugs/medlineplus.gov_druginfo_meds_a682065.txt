IMPORTANT WARNING:
Codeine may be habit forming. Take codeine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it, take it more often, stop taking it suddenly, or take it in a different way than directed by your doctor.  Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family drinks or has ever drunk large amounts of alcohol, uses or has ever used street drugs, or has overused prescription medications, or has had an overdose, or if you have or have ever had depression or another mental illness.
Codeine may cause serious or life-threatening breathing problems, especially during the first 24 to 72 hours of your treatment and any time your dose is increased.  If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately or get emergency medical treatment: slowed breathing, long pauses between breaths, or shortness of breath.
Codeine may harm or cause death to other people who take your medication, especially children. Store codeine in a safe place so that no one else can take it accidentally or on purpose.
Taking certain medications, drinking alcohol, or using street drugs during your treatment with codeine may increase the risk that you will experience breathing problems or other serious, life-threatening breathing problems, sedation, or coma. Tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take. Your doctor may need to change the dosages of your medications and will monitor you carefully.
Tell your doctor if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant. If you take codeine regularly during your pregnancy, your baby may experience life-threatening withdrawal symptoms after birth.
Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the Medication Guide. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit
https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm085729.htm
to obtain the Medication Guide.
Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking codeine.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Codeine is used to relieve pain. It is also used to relieve cough. Codeine belongs to a class of medications called opiate (narcotic) analgesics and to a class of medications called antitussives. When codeine is used to treat pain, it works by changing the way the brain and nervous system respond to pain. When codeine is used to reduce coughing, it works by decreasing the activity in the part of the brain that causes coughing.
Codeine is also available in combination with acetaminophen and aspirin, and as an ingredient in many cough and cold medications. This monograph only includes information about the use of codeine. If you are taking a codeine combination product, be sure to read information about all the ingredients in the product you are taking and ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
How should this medicine be used?
Codeine comes as an immediate-release tablet, an extended-release tablet, a solution (liquid), and syrup to take by mouth.
Take every 4 hours as needed for pain. Take codeine solution or syrup  every 4 to 6 hours as needed to relieve cough.
Take codeine extended-release tablets every 12 hours as needed to relieve cough.
If you are taking codeine to relieve pain, your doctor may adjust your dose during your treatment, depending on how well your pain is controlled and on the side effects that you experience. Talk to your doctor about how you are feeling during your treatment with codeine. Tell your doctor if you feel that your pain is not controlled or if your pain increases, becomes worse, or if you have new pain or an increased sensitivity to pain during your treatment with codeine. Do not take more of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist about access to rescue medicines, naloxone or nalmefene,
while taking codeine. Rescue medications can reverse the life-threatening effects of an
opioid overdose and are available over the counter or with a prescription. Make sure that you
and your family members and people usually around you know how to recognize an overdose,
how to use naloxone or nalmefene, and what to do until emergency medical help arrives. Your
doctor or pharmacist will show you and others how to use it. If symptoms of an overdose occur,
they should give the first dose of naloxone, call 911 immediately, and stay with you and watch
you closely until emergency medical help arrives. If your symptoms return, the person should
give you another dose of the rescue medication. Additional doses may be given every 2 to 3
minutes, if symptoms return before medical help arrives.
If you have taken codeine for several weeks or longer, do not stop taking the medication without talking to your doctor. Your doctor may decrease your dose gradually. If you suddenly stop taking codeine, you may experience withdrawal symptoms such as restlessness, widened pupils (black circles in the center of the eyes), teary eyes, irritability, anxiety, runny nose, difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, yawning, sweating, fast breathing, fast heartbeat, chills, hair on your arms standing on end, nausea, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, stomach cramps, muscle aches, or backache.
If you are taking codeine oral solution or syrup, do not use a household spoon to measure your dose. Use the measuring cup or spoon that came with the medication or use a spoon that is made especially for measuring medication. Ask your pharmacist if you have any question about how much medication you should take or how to use the dosing cup or syringe.
