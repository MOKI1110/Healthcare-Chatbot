IMPORTANT WARNING:
For all patients:
Thioridazine can cause a serious type of irregular heartbeat that may cause sudden death.  Tell your doctor if you have or have ever had long QT syndrome (condition that increases the risk of developing an irregular heartbeat that may cause loss of consciousness or sudden death), a slow or irregular heartbeat, high or low blood pressure, or heart disease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, call your doctor immediately: fast, irregular, or pounding heartbeat; dizziness; lightheadedness; or fainting.
Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking thioridazine.
For older adults:
Older adults with dementia (loss of memory and brain function) may have an increased chance of death if treated with antipsychotic medications such as thioridazine.
Thioridazine is not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of behavior problems in older adults with dementia. Talk to the doctor who prescribed this medication if you, a family member, or someone you care for has dementia and is taking thioridazine.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Thioridazine is used to treat schizophrenia (a mental illness that affects how a person thinks, feels and behaves).  Thioridazine is in a group of medications called antipsychotics. It works by decreasing abnormal excitement in the brain.
How should this medicine be used?
Thioridazine comes as a tablet to take by mouth. It is taken two to four times a day. Take thioridazine at around the same times every day.
Take thioridazine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of thioridazine and gradually increase your dose until your symptoms are controlled. Once your symptoms have been controlled for some time, your doctor may decrease your dose. Be sure to tell your doctor how you are feeling during your treatment with thioridazine.
Thioridazine may help to control your symptoms but will not cure your condition. Continue to take thioridazine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking thioridazine without talking to your doctor.
Other uses for this medicine
This medication should not be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?

tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to this drug, any part of this drug, or any other
drugs, foods or substances. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about the allergy and what

Your doctor will tell you if these activities are safe for you and may increase the dose of your medication very gradually so that your body can adjust to these side effects.
