IMPORTANT WARNING:
Medications such as nefazodone may increase the risk of suicidal thoughts and actions. This increase was found in children, teenagers, and young adults (less than 24 years of age). The risk may be more likely with the first few months of treatment and when the dose is increased.
Call your doctor right away if you experience any of the following symptoms: new or worsening depression; thinking about harming or killing yourself, or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; panic attacks; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; aggressive behavior; irritability; acting without thinking; severe restlessness; and frenzied abnormal excitement. Be sure that your family or caregiver knows which symptoms may be serious so they can call the doctor if you are unable to do so.
The doctor or pharmacist will give you the Medication Guide. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You also can obtain the Medication Guide:

Keep all appointments with your doctor and the laboratory. Your doctor may order certain tests to check your body's response to nefazodone.
Talk to your doctor about the risks of taking nefazodone.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Nefazodone is used to treat depression. Nefazodone is in a class of medications called serotonin modulators. It works by increasing the amounts of certain natural substances in the brain that are needed to maintain mental balance.
How should this medicine be used?
Nefazodone comes as a tablet to take by mouth. Take two times a day with or without food. Take nefazodone at around the same times every day.
Take nefazodone exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Your doctor may start you on a low dose of nefazodone and gradually increase your dose, not more than once every week.
It may take several weeks or longer for you to feel the full benefit of nefazodone. Continue to take nefazodone even if you feel well. Do not stop taking nefazodone without talking to your doctor. If your doctor tells you to stop taking nefazodone, your doctor will probably want to decrease your dose gradually.
