IMPORTANT WARNING:
Studies have shown that children and teenagers with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD; more difficulty focusing, controlling actions, and remaining still or quiet than other people who are the same age) who take viloxazine are more likely to think about killing themselves than children and teenagers with ADHD who do not take viloxazine.
Watch your child's behavior very carefully, especially at the beginning of treatment and any time his or her dose is increased or decreased.  Ask other people who spend a lot of time with your child, such as brothers, sisters, and teachers to tell you if they notice changes in your child's behavior. Call your child's doctor right away if your child experiences any of these symptoms: acting more subdued or withdrawn than usual; feeling helpless, hopeless, or worthless; new or worsening depression; thinking or talking about harming or killing him- or herself or planning or trying to do so; extreme worry; agitation; panic attacks; difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep; irritability; aggressive or violent behavior; acting without thinking; extreme increase in activity or talking; frenzied, abnormal excitement; or any other sudden or unusual changes in behavior.
Talk to your doctor about the risks of giving viloxazine to your child.
Why is this medication prescribed?
Viloxazine is used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Viloxazine is in a class of medications called selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors. It works by increasing the levels of norepinephrine, a natural substance in the brain that is needed to control behavior.
How should this medicine be used?
Viloxazine comes as a capsule to take by mouth. Take once a day with or without food. Take viloxazine at around the same time every day.
Take viloxazine exactly as directed. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
Swallow the capsules whole; do not split, chew, or crush them.
If the capsules cannot be swallowed whole, open the capsule and sprinkle the contents onto a teaspoonful of applesauce. Swallow all of the mixture right away; do not chew the mixture. Swallow the mixture within two hours of mixing; do not store the mixture for future use.
Your doctor will probably start you on a low dose of viloxazine and increase your dose after at least 7 days.
Viloxazine may help to control the symptoms of ADHD but will not cure the condition. Continue to take viloxazine even if you feel well. Do not stop taking viloxazine without talking to your doctor.
Your doctor or pharmacist will give you the Medication Guide. Read the information carefully and ask your doctor or pharmacist if you have any questions. You can also visit
