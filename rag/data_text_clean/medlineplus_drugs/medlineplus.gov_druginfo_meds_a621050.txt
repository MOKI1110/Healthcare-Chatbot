Why is this medication prescribed?
Ofatumumab injection is used for treatment of certain types of  multiple sclerosis (MS; a disease in which the nerves do not function properly and people may experience weakness, numbness, loss of muscle coordination, and problems with vision, speech, and bladder control).
Ofatumumab is in a class of medications called monoclonal antibodies. It works by stopping certain cells of the immune system from reaching the brain and spinal cord and causing damage.
How should this medicine be used?
Ofatumumab injection comes as a solution (liquid) in a prefilled dosing pen and a prefilled syringe to inject subcutaneously (under the skin) into your stomach, thigh, or upper arm. Inject once a week for the first 3 doses and then once monthly starting at week 4 of treatment for as long as your doctor recommends that you receive treatment.
Use ofatumumab injection exactly as directed. Do not inject more or less of it or inject it more often than prescribed by your doctor.
You will receive your first subcutaneous dose of ofatumumab injection in your doctor's office. After that, your doctor may allow you to inject ofatumumab or have a caregiver perform the injections. Before you use ofatumumab injection yourself the first time, read the written instructions that come with it. Ask your doctor or pharmacist to show you or the person who will be injecting the medication how to inject it.
Inject ofatumumab into the thigh or stomach area, except the area 2 inches (5 centimeters) around your navel. If a caregiver is giving you the injection, that person can also inject the medication into your upper arms. Use a different site for each injection. Do not inject into an area where the skin is tender, bruised, red, or hard or where you have scars, moles, or stretch marks.
Remove the prefilled dosing pens or prefilled syringes from the refrigerator 15 to 30 minutes before you are ready to inject the medication. Do not remove the needle cover from the prefilled syringe during this time. Check  that the expiration date printed on the package has not passed. The liquid should be clear and colorless to slightly brownish-yellow and should not be cloudy or discolored or contain particles. Call your pharmacist if you notice any problems.
Do not shake the dosing pen or syringe. Be careful not to drop the medication onto a hard surface because this may damage the syringe or needle.
Never reuse or share dosing pens or syringes. Dispose of pens and syringes in a puncture-resistant container. Ask your doctor or pharmacist how to dispose of the puncture resistant container.
You may experience a reaction, usually within 24 hours after your injection. This reaction is most likely to occur after your first injection, but could happen at any time during your treatment. Call your doctor if you experience any of the following symptoms during or after your injection: bruising, pain, redness, swelling, or tenderness at the injection site; fever; headache; muscle pain; chills; or tiredness.
Other uses for this medicine
Ofatumumab is also used and available through a special access program for chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).
This medication may be prescribed for other uses; ask your doctor or pharmacist for more information.
What special precautions should I follow?
Before receiving ofatumumab,
tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are allergic to this drug, any part of this drug, or any other
drugs, foods or substances. Tell your doctor or pharmacist about the allergy and what
symptoms you had.
tell your doctor and pharmacist what other prescription and nonprescription medications, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products you are taking or plan to take while receiving ofatumumab injection. Your doctor may need to change the doses of your medications or monitor you carefully for side effects.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had hepatitis B infection (swelling of the liver caused by a virus). Your doctor will probably tell you not to use ofatumumab injection.
tell your doctor if you have or have ever had liver disease.
tell your doctor if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or are breastfeeding.  If you become pregnant while receiving ofatumumab, call your doctor immediately.
you should use birth control during your treatment with ofatumumab injection and for 6 months after the final dose. Talk to your doctor about what birth control is right for you.
check with your doctor to see if you need to receive any vaccinations before receiving ofatumumab. Tell your doctor if you have received a vaccine within the past 4 weeks. Do not have any vaccinations without talking to your doctor during your treatment.
using ofatumumab injection may decrease your ability to fight infection and increase the risk that you will get a serious or life-threatening infection. Tell your doctor if you have an infection now or if you have any signs of infection such as fever, chills, or flu-like symptoms. If you experience any of the following symptoms during your treatment with ofatumumab, call your doctor: fever; chills; cough; flu-like symptoms; painful, difficult, or frequent urination; or other signs of infection.
What special dietary instructions should I follow?
Unless your doctor tells you otherwise, continue your normal diet.
What should I do if I forget a dose?
If you miss a dose during the first 3 weeks of treatment, talk to your doctor. If you miss a monthly dose of ofatumumab injection, inject it as soon as possible and then continue giving your doses a month apart.
What side effects can this medication cause?
