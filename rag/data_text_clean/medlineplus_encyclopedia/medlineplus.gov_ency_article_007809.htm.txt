Neuromyelitis optica
Neuromyelitis optica
Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a disorder of the
central nervous system
. The central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord. NMO causes inflammation and damage to the optic nerve and spinal cord. The optic nerve sends signals from the back of the eye (retina) to the brain. In some cases, NMO also may affect the brain.
Causes
NMO is a type of autoimmune disorder.
Autoimmune disorders
are conditions where the body's immune system destroys healthy cells and tissues.
NMO causes damage to a type of nerve cell called astrocytes as well as the myelin sheath of nerve cells. This sheath is the protective covering that surrounds nerve cells. When this nerve covering is damaged, nerve signals slow or stop. This can occur anywhere along the optic nerve and spinal cord.
NMO is often confused with and misdiagnosed as
multiple sclerosis
(MS) because they have similar symptoms. However, the two conditions are different and have different treatments.
There is no identifiable cause for NMO. The disease tends to develop in childhood or in a person's 40s. It may occur after an infection. People with a personal or family history of autoimmune disorders may also be at risk.
There are two main types of NMO:
Relapsing NMO is the most common form. It has flare-ups that occur between periods of recovery. Women are more likely to get this form of NMO.
Monophasic NMO is much less common and affects men and women equally. It involves a single attack that may last for 1 to 2 months and does not recur.
Symptoms
NMO may cause different symptoms that range in severity.
One main symptom is inflammation of one or both optic nerves (
optic neuritis
). Optic nerves transmit images from the eyes to the brain. Swelling and inflammation of the optic nerve may cause eye problems such as:
Eye pain
Blurred vision
Partial vision loss
Blindness in one or both eyes
Other symptoms include:
Inflammation of the spinal cord (
myelitis
)
Pain around the chest and waist
Unexplained hiccups
Persistent nausea or vomiting
Uncontrollable itching
Difficulty in swallowing (
dysphagia
)
Respiratory disorders
Problems with movement and coordination (motor or sensory dysfunction)
Inability to hold stool or urine (
bowel
or
bladder incontinence
)
Brain damage (encephalopathy)
Double vision
Sleep disorders such as disturbed sleep, decreased sleep quality, or restless legs syndrome
Sexual dysfunction
Recurrent attacks of visual, motor, and sensory dysfunction
Weakness, numbness, or paralysis of the arms and legs
Exams and tests
Your health care provider will do a physical exam and ask about your symptoms and medical history.
Various tests are needed to distinguish NMO from other central nervous system diseases such as multiple sclerosis.
Blood tests may include:
Complete blood count
(CBC)
Liver function tests
(LFTs)
Thyroid tests
You may have a blood test to detect aquaporin-4 (AQP4) antibodies or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) antibodies. The presence of these antibodies in the blood is a specific sign of NMO and can help distinguish it from MS. However, not everyone with NMO has these antibodies.
Other tests may include:
Magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI) to detect lesions of the optic nerves, brain, and spinal cord
Computed tomography
(CT)
Eye tests and retinal scans
Lumbar puncture
(spinal tap)
Neurological exams may be done to assess your motor or sensory reflexes:
Limb movement and coordination
Thinking and memory
Speech
Hearing
Swallowing
Taste
Vision
Treatment
There is no cure for NMO. Treatment is focused on relieving symptoms, preventing damage, and preventing attacks long-term.
Treatment during attacks involves:
Anti-inflammatory medicines such as corticosteroids to treat pain and inflammation during NMO attacks
Plasma exchange (plasmapheresis) to remove antibodies from the blood if corticosteroids don't work or attacks are severe
Long-term management helps suppress the disease and prevent attacks:
Monoclonal antibody medicines help prevent attacks of the disease
Immunosuppressive drugs help prevent attacks
You will also receive therapy to help you manage any lasting effects of the disease such as vision loss and paralysis.

Outlook (Prognosis)
NMO is a chronic disease.
Most people experience recurring NMO attacks (relapsing) while some people may get a one-time attack (monophasic).
Early diagnosis and timely treatment with immunosuppressive drugs improve the outlook. Medicines and therapies can ease the symptoms and people with NMO may live for many years.
People who have monophasic NMO have a better prognosis than those with relapsing NMO.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Severe optic nerve damage leading to vision loss or blindness
Permanent limb disability
Paralysis
Acute respiratory failure
When to Contact a Medical Professional
If you are diagnosed with NMO you should remain in touch with your provider to avoid any further progression in the condition.
Contact your provider immediately if you experience:
Blurred vision
Numb limbs
Severe headache
Immobility
Depression
Prevention
There is no known preventive treatment available.
