IgA nephropathy
IgA nephropathy
IgA nephropathy is a kidney disorder in which antibodies (called IgA) build up in kidney tissue. Nephropathy is damage, disease, or other problems with the kidney.
IgA nephropathy is also called Berger disease.
Causes
IgA is a protein, called an
antibody
, that helps the body fight infections. IgA nephropathy occurs when too much of this protein is deposited in the kidneys. IgA builds up inside the small blood vessels of the kidney. Structures in the kidney called glomeruli become inflamed and damaged.
The disorder can appear suddenly (
acute
), or get worse slowly over many years (chronic
glomerulonephritis
).
Risk factors include:
A personal or family history of IgA nephropathy or Henoch-SchÃ¶nlein
purpura
, a form of
vasculitis
that affects many parts of the body
White or Asian ethnicity
IgA nephropathy can occur in people of all ages, but it most often affects males in their teens to late 30s.
Symptoms
There may be no symptoms for many years.
When there are symptoms, they may include:
Bloody urine that starts during or soon after a respiratory infection
Repeated episodes of dark or bloody urine
Swelling of the hands and feet
Symptoms of
chronic kidney disease
Exams and Tests
IgA nephropathy is most often discovered when a person with no other symptoms of kidney problems has one or more episodes of dark or bloody urine.
There are no specific changes seen during a physical examination. Sometimes, the blood pressure may be high or there may be swelling in parts of the body.
Tests include:
Blood urea nitrogen
(BUN) test to measure kidney function
Creatinine blood test
to measure kidney function
Kidney biopsy
to confirm the diagnosis
Urinalysis
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent or delay
chronic renal failure
.
The treatment may include:
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) to control high blood pressure and swelling (
edema
)
Corticosteroids, other medicines that suppress the immune system
Fish oil
Medicines to lower cholesterol
Salt and fluid intakes may be restricted to control swelling. A low-to-moderate
protein
diet may be recommended in some cases.
Eventually, many people must be treated for chronic kidney disease and may need
dialysis
.
Outlook (Prognosis)
IgA nephropathy gets worse slowly. In many cases, it does not get worse at all. Your condition is more likely to get worse if you have:
High blood pressure
Large amounts of
protein in the urine
Increased BUN or creatinine levels
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if you have bloody urine or if you are producing less urine than usual.
