Leukemoid reaction
Leukemoid reaction
A leukemoid reaction is an increase in the white blood cell count, which can mimic
leukemia
. The reaction is actually due to an infection or another disease and is not a sign of cancer.
Blood counts often return to normal when the underlying condition is treated.
