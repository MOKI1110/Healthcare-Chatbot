Mental status testing
Mental status testing
Mental status testing is done to check a person's thinking ability and to determine if any problems are getting better or worse. It is also called neurocognitive testing.
How the Test is Performed
Your health care provider will ask a number of questions. The test can be done in the home, in an office, nursing home, or hospital. Sometimes, a psychologist with special training will do more detailed tests.
Common tests used are the:
Mini-mental state examination (MMSE) or Folstein test
MontrÃ©al cognitive assessment (MoCA)
Mental status testing looks at the following factors:
APPEARANCE
Your provider will check your physical appearance, including:
Age
Clothing
General level of comfort
Sex
Grooming
Height/weight
Expression
Posture
Eye contact
ATTITUDE
Friendly or hostile
Cooperative or ambivalent (uncertain)
ORIENTATION
Your provider will ask questions such as:
What is your name?
How old are you?
Where do you work?
Where do you live?
What day and time is it?
What season is it?
PSYCHOMOTOR ACTIVITY
Are you calm or irritable and anxious
Do you have a normal expression and body movement (affect) or display a flat and depressed affect
ATTENTION SPAN
Attention span may be tested earlier, because this basic skill can influence the rest of the tests.
Your provider will check:
Your ability to complete a thought
Your ability to think and problem solve
Whether you are easily distracted
You may be asked to do the following:
Start at a certain number, and then begin to subtract backwards by 7s.
Spell a word forward and then backward.
Repeat up to 7 numbers forward, and up to 5 numbers in reverse order.
RECENT AND PAST MEMORY
Your provider will ask questions related to recent people, places, and events in your life or in the world.
You may be shown 3 items and asked to say what they are, and then recall them after 5 minutes.
Your provider will ask about your childhood, school, or events that occurred earlier in life.
LANGUAGE FUNCTION
Your provider will determine if you can express your ideas clearly. Your provider will note if you repeat yourself or repeat what your provider says. Your provider will also find out if you have trouble expressing or understanding (aphasia).
Your provider will point to everyday items in the room and ask you to name them. Or you may be asked to name less common items.
You may be asked to say as many words as possible in one minute that:
Start with a certain letter
Are in a certain category
You may be asked to read or write a sentence.
JUDGMENT AND INTELLIGENCE
This part of the test looks at how well you solve a problem or situation. You may be asked questions such as:
"If you found a driver's license on the ground, what would you do?"
"If a police car with lights flashing came up behind your car, what would you do?"
Some tests that screen for language problems do not account for people who do not read or write. If you know that the person being tested cannot read or write, tell the provider before the test.
If your child is having the test, it is important to help them understand the reason for the test.
Normal Results
Most tests are divided into sections, each with its own score. The results help show which part of someone's thinking and memory may be affected.
What Abnormal Results Mean
A number of health conditions can affect mental status. Your provider will discuss these with you. An abnormal mental status test alone does not diagnose the cause. However, doing poorly on such tests can be due to medical illness, brain disease such as dementia,
Parkinson disease
, or to mental illness. Even when the cause is known, tests may be repeated over time to see if treatment is working.
