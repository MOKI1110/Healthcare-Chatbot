Vitamin B12
Vitamin B12
Vitamin B12 is a water-soluble vitamin. Water-soluble vitamins dissolve in water. After the body uses what it needs of these vitamins, leftover amounts leave the body through the urine.
The body stores vitamin B12 in the liver. It can store a few years' worth of the needed amount.
Function
Vitamin B12, like the other B vitamins, is important for protein
metabolism
. It helps in the formation of red blood cells and in the maintenance of the
nervous system
.
Food Sources
Vitamin B12 is naturally found in animal foods such as fish, meat, poultry, eggs, milk, and milk products. Vitamin B12 is not present in plant foods unless fortified. Fortified breakfast cereals are a readily available source of vitamin B12. These cereals can be a good source of vitamin B12 for vegetarians. Some nutritional yeast products also contain vitamin B12.
You can get the recommended amounts of vitamin B12 by eating a variety of the foods including:
Organ meats (beef liver)
Shellfish (clams)
Meat, poultry, eggs, milk and other dairy foods
Some fortified breakfast cereals and nutritional yeasts
To find out if vitamin B12 has been added to a food product, check the nutrition fact panel on the food label. The vitamin B12 used to fortify foods is very easy to absorb into the body.
Side Effects
Vitamin
B12 deficiency
occurs when the body does not get or is not able to absorb the amount of the vitamin that the body needs.
Deficiency is most common in people who:

Follow a vegetarian or vegan diet
Have had stomach or intestinal surgery, such as weight loss surgery
Have digestive system conditions such as
celiac disease

Anemia
Loss of balance
Numbness or tingling
in the arms and legs
Weakness

Recommendations
Recommendations for vitamin B12, as well as other nutrients, are provided in the Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs) developed by the Food and Nutrition Board at the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. DRI is a term for a set of reference intakes that are used to plan and assess the nutrient intakes of healthy people. These values, which vary by age and sex, include:
Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)
: The average daily level of intake that is enough to meet the nutrient needs of nearly all (97% to 98%) healthy people. An RDA is an intake level based on scientific research evidence.
Adequate Intake (AI)
: This level is established when there is not enough scientific research evidence to develop an RDA. It is set at a level that is thought to ensure enough nutrition.
Dietary reference intakes for vitamin B12:
Infants (AI)
0 to 6 months: 0.4 micrograms per day (mcg/day)
7 to 12 months: 0.5 mcg/day
Children (RDA)
1 to 3 years: 0.9 mcg/day
4 to 8 years: 1.2 mcg/day
9 to 13 years: 1.8 mcg/day
Adolescents and Adults (RDA)
Males and females age 14 and older: 2.4 mcg/day
Pregnant teens and women: 2.6 mcg/day
Breastfeeding teens and women: 2.8 mcg/day
The best way to meet your body's vitamin B12 needs is to eat a wide variety of animal products.
Supplemental vitamin B12 can be found in the following:
Almost all multivitamins or in B12 pills. Vitamin B12 is better absorbed by the body when it is taken along with other B vitamins, such as

,
riboflavin
, and
