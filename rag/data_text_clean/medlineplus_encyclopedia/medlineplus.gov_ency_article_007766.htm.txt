Transverse myelitis
Transverse myelitis
Transverse myelitis is a condition caused by inflammation of the spinal cord. As a result, the covering (
myelin
sheath) around the nerve cells is damaged. This disturbs the signals between spinal nerves and rest of the body.
Transverse myelitis can cause pain, muscle weakness, paralysis, and bladder or bowel problems.
Causes
Transverse myelitis is a rare nervous system disorder. In many cases, the cause is unknown. However, certain conditions may lead to transverse myelitis:
Bacterial, viral, parasitic, or fungal infection, such as HIV,
syphilis
, varicella zoster (
shingles
), West Nile virus,
Zika virus
, enteroviruses, and
Lyme disease
Immune system disorders, such as
multiple sclerosis (MS)
,
SjÃ¶gren syndrome
, and
lupus
Other inflammatory disorders, such as
sarcoidosis
, or a connective tissue disease called
scleroderma
Blood vessel disorders that affect the spine
Transverse myelitis affects men and women of all ages and races.
Symptoms
Symptoms of transverse myelitis may develop within a few hours or days. Or, they may develop over 1 to 4 weeks. Symptoms can quickly become severe.
Symptoms tend to occur at or below the damaged area of the spinal cord. Both sides of the body are often affected, but sometimes only one side is affected.
Symptoms include:
Abnormal sensations:
Numbness
Pricking
Tingling
Coldness
Burning
Sensitivity to touch or temperature
Bowel and bladder symptoms:
Constipation
Inability to urinate
Frequent need to urinate
Difficulty holding urine
Urine leakage (incontinence)
Pain:
Sharp or blunt
May start in your lower back
May shoot down your arms and legs or wrap around your trunk or chest
Muscle weakness:
Loss of balance
Difficulty walking (stumbling or dragging your feet)
Partial loss of function, which may develop into paralysis
Sexual dysfunction:
Difficulty having an orgasm (men and women)
Erectile dysfunction in men
Other symptoms can include loss of appetite, fever, and respiratory problems. Depression and anxiety can occur as a result of dealing with chronic pain and illness.
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will take your medical history and ask about your symptoms. The provider will also do a nervous system examination to check for:
Weakness or loss of muscle function, such as muscle tone and reflexes
Pain level
Abnormal sensations
Tests to diagnose transverse myelitis and to rule out other causes include:
MRI
of the spinal cord to check for inflammation or abnormalities
Spinal tap (lumbar puncture)
Blood tests
Treatment
Treatment for transverse myelitis helps to:
Treat an infection that caused the condition
Reduce inflammation of the spinal cord
Relieve or reduce symptoms
You may be given:
Steroid medicines through a vein (IV) to decrease inflammation.
Plasma exchange therapy. This involves removing the liquid part of your blood (plasma) and replacing it with plasma from a healthy donor or with another fluid.
Medicines to suppress your immune system.
Medicines to control other symptoms such as pain, spasm, urinary problems, or depression.
Your provider may recommend:
Physical therapy to help improve muscle strength and balance, and the use of walking aids
Occupational therapy to help you learn new ways to do daily activities
Counseling to help you cope with the stress and emotional issues from having transverse myelitis
Support Groups
You can ease the stress of illness by joining a support group. Sharing with others who have common experiences and problems can help you not feel alone.

Outlook (Prognosis)
The outlook for people with transverse myelitis varies. Most recovery occurs within 3 months after the condition occurs. For some, healing may take months to years. About a third of people with transverse myelitis recover completely. Some people recover with moderate disabilities, such as bowel problems and trouble walking. Others have permanent disability and need help with daily activities.
Those who may have poor chance of recovery are:
People who have rapid onset of symptoms
People whose symptoms do not improve within the first 3 to 6 months
Transverse myelitis usually only occurs once in most people. It may recur in some people with an underlying cause, such as MS. People who have involvement of only on one side of the spinal cord may be more likely to develop MS in the future.
Possible Complications
Ongoing health problems from transverse myelitis may include:
Constant pain
Partial or complete loss of muscle function
Weakness
Muscle tightness and spasticity
Sexual problems
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
You notice a sudden, sharp pain in your back that shoots down your arms or legs or wraps around your trunk
You develop sudden weakness or numbness of arm or leg
You have loss of muscle function
You have bladder problems (frequency or incontinence) or bowel problems (constipation)
Your symptoms get worse, even with treatment
