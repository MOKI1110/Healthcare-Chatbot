Sclera
The sclera is the white outer coating of the eye. It is tough, fibrous tissue that extends from the cornea (the clear front section of the eye) to the optic nerve at the back of the eye. The sclera gives the eyeball its white color. The cornea and sclera are made of the same type of collagen fibers. In the cornea, the fibers are arranged in sheets and layers which makes the cornea clear. In the sclera, the fibers are arranged randomly.
