WBC count
WBC count
A WBC count is a blood test to measure the number of white blood cells (WBCs) in the blood. It is a part of a complete blood count (CBC).
WBCs are also called leukocytes. They help fight infections. There are
five major types of white blood cells
:
Basophils
Eosinophils
Lymphocytes (T cells, B cells, and Natural Killer cells)
Monocytes
Neutrophils
How the Test is Performed
blood sample
is needed.
How to Prepare for the Test
Most of the time, you do not need to take special steps before this test. Tell your health care provider the medicines you are taking, including the ones without a prescription. Some medicines may change the test results.
How the Test will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.
Why the Test is Performed
You will have this test to find out how many WBCs you have. Your provider may order this test to help diagnose conditions such as:
An infection
Allergic reaction
Inflammation
Blood cancer such as
leukemia
or lymphoma
Normal Results
The normal number of WBCs in the blood is 4,500 to 11,000 WBCs per microliter (4.5 to 11.0 Ã 10
9
/L).
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or may test different specimens. Talk to your provider about your test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
LOW WBC COUNT
A low number of WBCs is called leukopenia. A count less than 4,500 cells per microliter (4.5 Ã 10
9
/L) is below normal.
Neutrophils are one type of WBC. They are important for fighting infections.
A lower than normal WBC count may be due to:
Bone marrow deficiency or failure (for example, due to infection, tumor, or abnormal scarring)
Cancer treating medicines, or other medicines (see list below)
Certain autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus (
SLE
)
Disease of the liver or spleen
Radiation treatment
for
cancer
Certain viral illnesses, such as
mononucleosis (mono)
Cancers that damage the bone marrow
Very severe bacterial infections
Severe emotional or physical stress (such as from an injury or surgery) - however this usually elevates the white blood cell count
An ethnic/genetic trait (not uncommon in African Americans)
HIGH WBC COUNT
A higher than normal WBC count is called leukocytosis. It may be due to:
Certain drugs or medicines (see list below)
Cigarette smoking
After
spleen removal surgery
Infections, most often those caused by bacteria
Inflammatory disease (such as
rheumatoid arthritis
or allergy)
Leukemia
or
Hodgkin disease
Tissue damage (for example, burns)
Pregnancy
Severe emotional or physical stress (such as from an injury or surgery)
There may also be less common reasons for abnormal WBC counts.
Medicines that may lower your WBC count include:
Antibiotics
Anticonvulsants
Antithyroid medicines
Arsenicals
Captopril
Chemotherapy
medicines
Chlorpromazine
Clozapine
Diuretics (water pills)
Histamine-2 blockers
Sulfonamides
Quinidine
Terbinafine
Ticlopidine
Medicines that may increase WBC counts include:
Beta adrenergic agonists (for example, albuterol)
Corticosteroids
Epinephrine
Granulocyte colony stimulating factor
Heparin
Lithium
Risks
There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:
Excessive bleeding
Fainting or feeling lightheaded
Multiple punctures to locate veins
Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
Alternative Names
Leukocyte count; White blood cell count; White blood cell differential; WBC differential; Infection - WBC count; Cancer - WBC count
