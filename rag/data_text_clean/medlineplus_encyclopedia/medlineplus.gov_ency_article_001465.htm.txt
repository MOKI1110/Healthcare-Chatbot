Tinea versicolor
Tinea versicolor
Tinea versicolor is a common
fungal infection
of the outer layer of the skin.
Causes
Tinea versicolor is fairly common. It is caused by a type of fungus called
Malassezia
. This fungus is normally found on human skin. It only causes a problem in certain settings.
The condition is most common in adolescents and young adults. It typically occurs in warm and humid climates. It does not spread person to person.
Symptoms
The main symptom is
patches
of discolored skin that:
Have sharp borders (edges) and fine scales
Are often lighter or darker than the surrounding skin
Are found on the back, underarms, upper arms, chest, and neck
Are found on the forehead (in children)
Do not darken in the sun, so may appear lighter than the surrounding healthy skin
African Americans and other people of color may have a loss of skin color or an increase in skin color.
Other symptoms include:
Increased sweating
Mild itching
Mild swelling
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will examine a
skin scraping
under a microscope to look for the fungus. A
skin biopsy
may also be performed with a special stain called PAS to identify fungus and yeast.
Treatment
The condition is treated with antifungal medicine that is either applied to the skin or taken by mouth.
Applying over-the-counter dandruff shampoo containing selenium sulfide or ketoconazole to the skin for 10 minutes each day in the shower is another treatment option.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The fungus that causes tinea versicolor is often easy to treat. But, changes in skin color may last for months. The condition may come back during warm weather.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you develop symptoms of tinea versicolor.
Prevention
Avoid excessive heat or sweating if you have had this condition in the past. You can also use anti-dandruff shampoo on your skin every month to help prevent the problem.
