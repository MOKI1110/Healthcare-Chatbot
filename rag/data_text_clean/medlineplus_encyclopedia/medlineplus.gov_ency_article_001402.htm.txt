Polio
Polio
Polio is a viral disease that can affect nerves and can lead to partial or full
paralysis
. The medical name for polio is poliomyelitis.
Causes
Polio is a disease caused by infection with the poliovirus. The virus spreads by:
Direct person-to-person contact
Contact with infected mucus or phlegm from the nose or mouth
Contact with infected feces
The virus enters through the mouth and nose, multiplies in the throat and intestinal tract, and then is absorbed and spread through the blood and
lymph system
. The time from being infected with the virus to developing symptoms of disease (incubation) ranges from 5 to 35 days (average 7 to 14 days). Most people do not develop symptoms.
Risks factors include:
Lack of immunization against polio
Travel to an area that has had a polio outbreak
As a result of a global vaccination campaign over the past 25 years, polio has largely been eliminated. The disease still exists in some countries (such as Pakistan and Afghanistan), with outbreaks occurring in groups of people who have not been vaccinated.

Symptoms
There are four basic patterns of polio infection:
Inapparent infection
Abortive disease
Nonparalytic
Paralytic
INAPPARENT INFECTION
Most people infected with poliovirus have inapparent infections. They usually do not have symptoms. The only way to know if someone has the infection is by performing a blood test or other tests to find the virus in the stool or throat.
ABORTIVE DISEASE
People who have abortive disease develop symptoms about 1 to 2 weeks after getting infected with the virus. Symptoms may include:
Fever
for 2 to 3 days
General discomfort or uneasiness (
malaise
)
Headache
Sore throat
Vomiting
Loss of appetite
Belly pain
These symptoms last up to 5 days and people recover completely. They have no signs of
nervous system
problems.
NONPARALYTIC POLIO
People with this form of polio have signs of abortive polio and their symptoms are more intense. Other symptoms may include:
Stiff and sore muscles at the back of the neck, trunk, arms, and legs
Urinary problems and constipation
Changes in muscle reaction (
reflexes
) as the disease progresses
PARALYTIC POLIO
This form of polio develops in a small percentage of people who are infected with the polio virus. Symptoms include those of abortive and nonparalytic polio. Other symptoms may include:
Muscle weakness, paralysis, loss of muscle tissue
Breathing that is weak
Difficulty swallowing
Drooling
Hoarse voice
Severe constipation and urinary problems
Exams and Tests
During a physical examination, your health care provider may find:
Abnormal reflexes
Back stiffness
Difficulty lifting your head or legs when lying flat on your back
Stiff neck
Trouble bending your neck
Tests that may be done include:
Cultures of throat washings, stools, or spinal fluid
Spinal tap and examination of the spinal fluid (
CSF examination
) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
Test for levels of
antibodies
to the polio virus
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to control symptoms while the infection runs its course. There is no specific treatment for this infection.
People with severe cases may need lifesaving measures, such as help with breathing.
Symptoms are treated based on how severe they are. Treatment may include:
Antibiotics for
urinary tract infections
Moist heat (heating pads, warm towels) to reduce muscle pain and spasms
Painkillers to reduce headache, muscle pain, and spasms (narcotics are not usually given because they increase the risk of breathing trouble)
Physical therapy, braces or corrective shoes, or orthopedic surgery to help recover muscle strength and function
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outlook depends on the form of the disease and the body area affected. Most of the time, complete recovery is likely if the spinal cord and brain are not involved.
Brain or spinal cord involvement is a medical emergency that may result in paralysis or death (usually from
breathing
problems).
Disability is more common than death. Infection that is located high in the spinal cord or in the brain increases the risk of breathing problems.
Possible Complications
Health problems that may result from polio include:
Aspiration pneumonia
Cor pulmonale
(a form of heart failure found on the right side of the circulation system)
Lack of movement
Lung problems
Myocarditis
(inflammation of the heart muscle)
Paralytic ileus
(loss of intestinal function)
Permanent muscle paralysis, disability, deformity
Pulmonary edema
(abnormal buildup of fluid in the lungs)
Shock
Urinary tract infections
Post-polio syndrome is a complication that develops in some people, usually 30 or more years after they are first infected. Muscles that were already weak may get weaker. Weakness may also develop in muscles that were not affected before.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
Someone close to you has developed poliomyelitis and you haven't been vaccinated.
You develop symptoms of poliomyelitis.
Your child's polio immunization (vaccine) is not up to date.
Prevention
Polio immunization (
vaccine
) prevents poliomyelitis in most people (over 90% effective).
Alternative Names
Poliomyelitis; Infantile paralysis; Post-polio syndrome
