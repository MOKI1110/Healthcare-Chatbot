Stimulants
Stimulants are chemicals (usually drugs or medicines that increase your heart rate, breathing rate, and brain function. Some stimulants affect only a specific organ, such as the heart, lungs, brain, or nervous system.
Epinephrine is a stimulant. It is given during
cardiac arrest
to stimulate the heart and help restore the heartbeat.
Other times, stimulants can cause unwanted side effects. For example, pseudoephedrine found in some cold medicines can increase the heart rate. Caffeine, found in many beverages, may also increase the heart rate or cause a tremor.
