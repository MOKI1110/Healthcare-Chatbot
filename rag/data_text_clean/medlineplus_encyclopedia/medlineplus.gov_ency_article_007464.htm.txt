Health screenings for men ages 18 to 39
You should visit your health care provider regularly, even if you feel healthy. The purpose of these visits is to:
Screen for medical issues
Assess your risk for future medical problems
Encourage a healthy lifestyle
Update vaccinations and other preventive care services
Help you get to know your provider in case of an illness
Information
Even if you feel fine, you should still see your provider for regular checkups. These visits can help you avoid problems in the future. For example, the only way to find out if you have
high blood pressure
is to have it checked regularly. High blood sugar and
high cholesterol
level also may not have any symptoms in the early stages. Simple blood tests can check for these conditions.
There are specific times when you should see your provider or receive specific health screenings. The US Preventive Services Task Force publishes a list of recommended screenings. Below are screening guidelines for men ages 18 to 39.
BLOOD PRESSURE SCREENING
Your blood pressure should be checked at least once every 3 to 5 years if:
Your
blood pressure
is in the normal range (top number less than 120 mm Hg and bottom number less than 80 mm Hg)
You don't have risk factors for high blood pressure
Ask your provider if you need your blood pressure checked more often if:
The top number is from 120 to 129 mm Hg or the bottom number is from 70 to 79 mm Hg
You have
diabetes
,
heart disease
,
kidney problems
, are overweight, or have certain other health conditions
You have a first-degree relative with high blood pressure
You are Black
If the top number is 130 mm Hg or greater or the bottom number is 80 mm Hg or greater, this is considered stage 1 hypertension. Schedule an appointment with your provider to learn how you can reduce your blood pressure.
Watch for blood pressure screenings in your neighborhood or workplace. Ask your provider if you can stop in to have your blood pressure checked.
CHOLESTEROL SCREENING
Cholesterol screening
should begin at:
Age 35 for men with no known risk factors for coronary heart disease
Age 20 for men with known risk factors for coronary heart disease
Repeat cholesterol screening should take place:
Every 5 years for men with normal cholesterol levels
More often if changes occur in lifestyle (including weight gain and diet)
More often if you have diabetes, heart disease, kidney problems, or certain other conditions
DIABETES SCREENING
You should be screened for
diabetes
starting at age 35 and then repeated every 3 years if you have no risk factors for diabetes.
Screening may need to start earlier and be repeated more often if you have other risk factors for diabetes, such as:
You have a first degree relative with diabetes.
You are overweight or have obesity.
You have high blood pressure, prediabetes, or a history of heart disease.
DENTAL EXAM
Go to the dentist once or twice every year for an exam and cleaning. Your dentist will evaluate if you have a need for more frequent visits.
EYE EXAM
Have an eye exam every 5 to 10 years before age 40.
If you have vision problems, have an eye exam every 2 years, or more often if recommended by your provider.
Have an eye exam that includes an examination of your retina (back of your eye) at least every year if you have diabetes.
IMMUNIZATIONS
Commonly needed vaccines include:
Flu
shot
: get one every year.
COVID-19 vaccine:
ask your provider what is best for you.
Tetanus-diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap)
vaccine
: have one at or after age 19 as one of your tetanus-diphtheria vaccines if you did not receive it as an adolescent.
Tetanus-diphtheria
: have a booster (or Tdap) every 10 years.
Varicella vaccine
: receive two doses if you never had
chickenpox
or the varicella vaccine.
Hepatitis B vaccine
: receive 2, 3, or 4 doses, depending on your exact circumstances.
Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR)
vaccine
: receive one to two doses if you are not already immune to MMR. Your doctor can tell you if you are immune
Ask your provider about the
human papillomavirus (HPV)
vaccine if you have:
Not received the HPV vaccine in the past
Not completed the full vaccine series (you should catch up on this shot)
Ask your provider if you should receive other immunizations if you have certain medical conditions, such as diabetes or are at increased risk for some diseases such as pneumonia.
INFECTIOUS DISEASE SCREENING
All adults ages 18 to 79 should get a one-time test for
hepatitis C
.
All people ages 15 to 65 should get a one-time test for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)
Depending on your lifestyle and medical history, you may need to be screened for infections such as syphilis, chlamydia, and other infections.
PHYSICAL EXAM
All adults should visit their provider from time to time, even if they are healthy. The purpose of these visits is to:
Screen for diseases
Assess risk of future medical problems
Encourage a healthy lifestyle
Update vaccinations and other preventive care services
Maintain a relationship with a provider in case of an illness
Your height, weight, and
BMI
should be checked at every exam.
During your exam, your provider may ask you about:
Depression
and anxiety
Diet and exercise
Alcohol and tobacco use
Safety, such as use of seat belts and smoke detectors
Your medicines and risk for interactions
TESTICULAR EXAM
The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends against performing testicular self-exam. Doing testicular exams has been shown to have little to no benefit.
SKIN SELF-EXAM
Your provider may check your skin for signs of
skin cancer
, especially if you're at high risk, such as if you have had skin cancer before.
Have close relatives with skin cancer.
Have a weakened immune system.
