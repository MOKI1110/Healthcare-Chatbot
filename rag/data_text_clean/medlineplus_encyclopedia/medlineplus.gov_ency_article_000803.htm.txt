Idiopathic hypersomnia
Idiopathic hypersomnia
Idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) is a sleep disorder in which a person is excessively sleepy (
hypersomnia
) during the day and has great difficulty being awakened from sleep. Idiopathic means there is not a clear cause.
Causes
IH is similar to
narcolepsy
in that you are extremely sleepy. It is different from narcolepsy because IH doesn't usually involve suddenly falling asleep (sleep attacks) or losing muscle control due to strong emotions (cataplexy). Also, unlike narcolepsy, naps in IH are usually not refreshing.
Symptoms
Symptoms often develop slowly during the teens or young adulthood. They include:
Daytime naps that do not relieve drowsiness
Difficulty waking from a long sleep -- may feel confused or disoriented (''sleep drunkenness'')
Increased need for sleep during the day -- even while at work, or during a meal or conversation
Increased sleep time -- up to 14 to 18 hours a day
Other symptoms may include:
Anxiety
Feeling irritated
Loss of appetite
Low energy
Restlessness
Slow thinking or
speech
Trouble remembering
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will ask about your sleep history. The usual approach is to consider other possible causes of excessive daytime sleepiness.
Other sleep disorders that may cause daytime sleepiness include:
Narcolepsy
Obstructive sleep apnea
Restless leg syndrome
Other causes of excessive sleepiness include:
Depression
Certain medicines
Drug and
alcohol use
Low thyroid function
Previous head injury
Tests that may be ordered include:
Multiple-sleep latency test (a test to see how long it takes you to fall asleep during a daytime nap)
Sleep study (
polysomnography
, to identify other sleep disorders)
A mental health evaluation for depression may also be done.
Treatment
Your provider will likely prescribe stimulant medicines such as amphetamine, methylphenidate, or modafinil. These medicines may not work as well for this condition as they do for narcolepsy.
Other medicines for idiopathic hypersomnia, which are also commonly used for narcolepsy, include sodium oxybate (or oxybate salts) and newer wake-promoting agents such as pitolisant and solriamfetol.
Lifestyle changes that can help ease symptoms and prevent injury include:
Avoid alcohol and medicines that can make the condition worse
Avoid operating motor vehicles or using dangerous equipment
Avoid working at night or social activities that delay your bedtime
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Discuss your condition with your provider if you have repeated episodes of daytime sleepiness. They may be due to a medical problem that needs further testing.
