Supernumerary nipples
Supernumerary nipples
Supernumerary nipples  are the presence of extra nipples.
Considerations
Extra nipples are fairly common. They are generally unrelated to other conditions or syndromes. The extra nipples usually occur in a line below the normal nipples. They are usually not recognized as extra nipples because they tend to be small and not well-formed.
Causes
Common causes of supernumerary nipples are:
Variation of normal development
Some rare genetic syndromes may be associated with supernumerary nipples
Home Care
Most people do not need treatment. The extra nipples do NOT develop into breasts at puberty. If you want them removed, the nipples can be removed by surgery.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Talk to your health care provider if there are extra nipples on an infant. Tell the provider if there are other symptoms.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
The provider will do a physical exam. The provider may ask questions about the person's medical history. The number and location of extra nipples will be noted.
