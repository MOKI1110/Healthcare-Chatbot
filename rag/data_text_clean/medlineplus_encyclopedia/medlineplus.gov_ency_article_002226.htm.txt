Auscultation
Auscultation is listening to the sounds of the body during a
physical examination
.
Information
Auscultation is usually done using a tool called a stethoscope. Health care providers routinely listen to a person's lungs, heart, and intestines to evaluate these things about the sounds:
Frequency
Intensity
Duration

Quality
Providers also use auscultation to listen to the heart sounds of unborn infants. This can be done with a stethoscope or with sound waves (called Doppler ultrasound).
Auscultation can also be used to hear pulses in the arms and legs.
