Lichen simplex chronicus
Lichen simplex chronicus
Lichen simplex chronicus (LSC) is a skin condition caused by
chronic
itching and scratching.
Causes
LSC may occur in people who have:
Skin allergies
Eczema
(atopic dermatitis)
Psoriasis
Nervousness, anxiety, depression, and other emotional problems
The problem is common in adults but may also be seen in children.
Symptoms
LSC leads to scratching, which then causes more itching. It often follows this pattern:
It may start when something rubs, irritates, or scratches the skin, such as clothing.
The person begins to rub or scratch the itchy area. Constant scratching (often during sleep) causes the skin to thicken.
The thickened skin itches, and this leads to more scratching. This then causes more thickening of the skin.
The skin may become leathery and brownish in the affected area.
Symptoms include:
Itching
of the skin that may be long-term (chronic), intense, and that increases with stress
Leathery texture to the skin
Raw areas of skin
Scaling
Skin lesion
, patch, or plaque with sharp borders and a leathery texture, located on the ankle, wrist, back of the neck, rectum, anal area, forearms, thighs, lower leg, back of the knee, and inner elbow
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will look at your skin and ask if you have had chronic itching and scratching in the past. A
skin lesion biopsy
may be done to confirm the diagnosis.
Treatment
The main treatment is to reduce the itch.
You may need to use these medicines on your skin:
Lotion or steroid cream on the area to calm itching and irritation
Numbing medicine
Peeling ointments containing salicylic acid, lactic acid, or urea on patches of thick skin
You may need to use dressings that moisturize, cover, and protect the area. These may be used with or without medicated creams. They are left in place for a week or more at a time. Wearing cotton gloves at night may prevent skin damage from scratching.
To control itching and stress due to it, you may need to take medicines by mouth, such as:
Antihistamines
Other oral medicines that control itch or pain
Steroids may be injected directly into the skin lesions to reduce itching and irritation.
You may need to take antidepressants and tranquilizers if the cause of your itching is emotional. Other measures include:
Counseling to help you realize the importance of not scratching
Stress management
Behavior modification
Outlook (Prognosis)
You can control LSC by reducing itch and controlling scratching. While the condition can be treated, it often returns. The condition may return or move to different areas on the skin. Ongoing management can help relieve symptoms.
Possible Complications
These complications of LSC can occur:
Bacterial or fungal skin infection
Permanent changes in skin color
Permanent scar
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
Symptoms get worse
You develop new symptoms, especially signs of skin infection such as pain, redness, drainage from the area, or fever
Alternative Names
LSC; Neurodermatitis circumscripta
