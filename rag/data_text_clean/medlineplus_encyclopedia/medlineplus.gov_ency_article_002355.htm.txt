Eschar
Eschar is a layer of dead tissue that commonly forms over a wound or burn.
Eschars can be caused by anything that destroys healthy skin, such as burns, trauma, infections, insect bites, pressure ulcers, and diabetic foot ulcers.
An escharotic is a substance (such as acids, alkalis, carbon dioxide, or metallic salts) that leads to eschar formation.
Eschars may require treatment to allow healing or to prevent or treat infection.
Alternative Names
Necrotic tissue
