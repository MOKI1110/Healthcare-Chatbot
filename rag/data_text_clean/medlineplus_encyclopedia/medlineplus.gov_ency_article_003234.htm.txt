Pustules
Pustules
Pustules are small, inflamed, pus-filled, blister-like sores (lesions) on the skin surface.
Considerations
Pustules are common in people with
acne
or
folliculitis
(inflammation of the hair follicle). They may occur anywhere on the body, but are most commonly seen in these areas:
Back
Face
Over the breastbone
Shoulders
Sweaty areas, such as the groin or armpit
Pustules may be a sign of an infection. In some cases, they are non-infectious and associated with inflammation in the skin or taking certain medicines. They should be checked by a health care provider and may need to be tested (
cultured
) for bacteria or fungus.
