Antibody
Antibody
An antibody is a protein produced by the body's immune system when it detects harmful substances, called
antigens
. Examples of antigens include microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses) and chemicals.
Antibodies may be produced when the immune system mistakenly considers healthy tissue a harmful substance. This is called an
autoimmune disorder
.
Each type of antibody is unique and defends the body against one specific type of antigen.
