Bronchiectasis
Bronchiectasis
Bronchiectasis is a disease in which the large airways in the lungs are damaged. This causes the airways to become permanently wider.
Bronchiectasis can be present at birth or infancy, which is rare, or develop later in life.
Causes
Bronchiectasis is often caused by inflammation or an infection of the airways that keeps coming back.
Sometimes it begins in childhood after having a severe lung infection or
inhaling a foreign object
. Breathing in food particles can also lead to this condition.
Other causes of bronchiectasis can include:
Cystic fibrosis
, a disease that causes thick, sticky mucus to build up in the lungs
Autoimmune disorders, such as
rheumatoid arthritis
,
SjÃ¶gren syndrome
, or inflammatory bowel disease
Allergic lung diseases
Leukemia
and related
cancers
Immune deficiency syndromes
Primary ciliary dyskinesia (another congenital disease)
Infection with non-tuberculous mycobacteria
As a complication of bronchiolitis obliterans
Asthma
or
chronic obstructive lung disease
(uncommon)
Symptoms
Symptoms develop over time. They may occur months or years after the event that causes the bronchiectasis.
Long-term (chronic) cough with large amounts of foul smelling sputum is the main symptom of bronchiectasis. Other symptoms may include:
Breath odor
Coughing up blood
(less common in children)
Fatigue
Paleness
Shortness of breath
that gets worse with exercise
Weight loss
Wheezing
Low grade fever and night sweats
Clubbing
of fingers (rare, depends on the cause)
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will perform a physical exam. When listening to the chest with a stethoscope, your provider may hear small clicking, bubbling, wheezing, rattling, or other sounds, usually in the lower lungs.
Tests that may be done include:
Aspergillosis precipitin
test (to check for signs of an allergic reaction to Aspergillus fungus)
Alpha-1 antitrypsin blood test
Chest x-ray
Chest CT
Sputum culture
Complete blood count
(CBC)
Genetic testing, including
sweat test
for cystic fibrosis and tests for other diseases (like primary ciliary dyskinesia)
PPD skin test
to check for a past tuberculosis infection
Serum immunoglobulin electrophoresis
to measure proteins called immunoglobulins in the blood
Lung function tests
to measure breathing and how well the lungs are functioning
Immune deficiency workup
Treatment
Treatment is aimed at:
Reducing infections and sputum
Relieving airway blockage
Preventing the problem from becoming worse
Treating the underlying cause (for example modulator therapy for people with cystic fibrosis)
Daily drainage to remove sputum is part of treatment. A respiratory therapist can show the person coughing exercises that will help.
Medicines are often prescribed. These include:
Antibiotics to treat infections
Bronchodilators to open up airways
Expectorants to help loosen and cough up thick sputum
Surgery to remove (
resect
) the lung may be helpful if medicine does not work and the disease is in a small area, or if the person has a lot of bleeding in the lungs. It is more commonly considered if there is no genetic or acquired predisposition to bronchiectasis (for example, more likely to consider if there is bronchiectasis in one segment of the lung only because of prior obstruction).
In severe cases, lung transplantation might be needed.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The outlook depends on the specific cause of the disease. With treatment, most people live without major disability and the disease progresses slowly.
Possible Complications
Complications of bronchiectasis may include:
Cor pulmonale
Coughing up blood
Low oxygen levels (in severe cases)
Recurrent
pneumonia
Depression
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
You have
chest pain
or shortness of breath that gets worse
There is a change in the color or amount of phlegm you cough up, or if it is bloody
Other symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment
Prevention
You can reduce your risk by promptly treating lung infections.
Childhood
vaccines
a yearly
flu vaccine
, and
COVID-19 vaccines
help reduce the chance of some infections. Avoiding upper respiratory infections, smoking, and pollution may also reduce your risk of getting this infection.
