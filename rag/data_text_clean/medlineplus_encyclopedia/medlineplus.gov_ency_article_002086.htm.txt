Aging spots - should you be concerned?
Aging spots - should you be concerned?
Aging spots, also called
liver spots
or solar lentigos, are very common. They are most often not a cause for worry. They typically develop in people with fair complexions, but people with darker skin can also get them.
Aging spots are flat and oval and tan, brown, or black marks. They appear on skin that has been the most exposed to sun over the years, such as the backs of hands, tops of feet, face, shoulders, and upper back.
Always let your health care provider know if you have any new or unusual spots, and have them checked. Skin cancers may have many different appearances. Spots or sores related to skin cancers can be:
Small, shiny, or waxy
Scaly and rough
Firm and red
Crusty or bleeding
Skin cancers can also have other features.
