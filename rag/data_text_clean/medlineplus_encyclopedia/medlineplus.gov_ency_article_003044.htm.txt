Hearing loss
Hearing loss
Hearing loss is being partly or totally unable to hear sound in one or both ears.
Considerations
Symptoms of hearing loss may include:
Certain sounds seem overly loud in one ear
Difficulty following conversations when two or more people are talking
Difficulty hearing in noisy areas
Trouble telling high-pitched sounds (such as "s" or "th") from one another
Less trouble hearing men's voices than women's voices
Hearing voices as mumbled or slurred
Associated symptoms may include:
Feeling of being off-balance or dizzy (more common with
MÃ©niÃ¨re disease
and
acoustic neuroma
)
Feeling of pressure in the ear (usually due to fluid behind the eardrum)
Ringing or buzzing sound in the ears (
tinnitus
)
Causes
Conductive hearing loss (CHL) occurs because of a mechanical problem in the outer or middle ear. This may be because:
Sound is not reaching the eardrum.
The eardrum is not vibrating in response to sound.
The 3 tiny bones of the ear (ossicles) are not conducting sound properly.
Causes of conductive hearing loss can often be treated. They include:
Buildup of wax in the ear canal
Damage to the very small bones (ossicles) that are right behind the eardrum
Fluid remaining in the ear
after an
ear infection
Foreign object that is stuck in the ear canal
Hole in the eardrum
Scar on the eardrum from repeated infections
Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) occurs when the tiny hair cells (nerve endings) that detect sound in the inner ear are injured, diseased, do not work correctly, or have died. This type of hearing loss often cannot be reversed.
Sensorineural hearing loss is commonly caused by:
Acoustic neuroma
Age-related hearing loss
Childhood infections, such as
meningitis
,
mumps
,
scarlet fever
, and
measles
MÃ©niÃ¨re disease
Regular exposure to loud noises (such as from work or recreation)
Use of certain medicines
Hearing loss may be present at birth (congenital) and can be due to:
Birth defects that cause changes in the ear structures
Genetic conditions (more than 400 are known)
Infections the mother passes to her baby in the womb, such as
toxoplasmosis
,
rubella
, or
herpes
The ear can also be injured by:
Pressure differences between the inside and outside of the eardrum
, often from scuba diving
Skull fractures (can damage the structures or nerves of the ear)
Trauma
from explosions, fireworks, gunfire, rock concerts, and earphones
Home Care
You can often flush wax buildup out of the ear (gently) with ear syringes (available in drug stores) and warm water. Wax softeners (like Cerumenex) may be needed if the wax is hard and stuck in the ear.
Take care when removing foreign objects from the ear. Unless it is easy to get to, have your health care provider remove the object. Don't use sharp instruments to remove foreign objects.
See your provider for any other hearing loss.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
Hearing problems interfere with your lifestyle.
Hearing problems do not go away or become worse.
The hearing is worse in one ear than the other.
You have sudden, severe hearing loss or ringing in the ears (tinnitus).
You have other symptoms, such as
ear pain
, along with hearing problems.
You have new headaches, weakness, or numbness anywhere on your body.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
The provider will take your medical history and do a physical exam.
Tests that may be done include:
Audiometric testing
(hearing tests used to check the type and amount of hearing loss)
CT
or
MRI scan of the head
(if a tumor or fracture is suspected)
Tympanometry
The following surgeries may help some types of hearing loss:
Eardrum repair
Placing tubes in the eardrums
to remove fluid
Repair of the small bones in the middle ear (ossiculoplasty)
The following may help with long-term hearing loss:
Assistive listening devices
Safety and alert systems for your home
Hearing aids
Cochlear implant
Learning techniques to help you communicate
Sign language (for those with severe hearing loss)
Cochlear implants are only used in people who have lost too much hearing to benefit from a hearing aid.
