Soluble vs. insoluble fiber
Soluble vs. insoluble fiber
There are 2 different types of
fiber
-- soluble and insoluble. Both are important for health, digestion, and preventing diseases.
Soluble fiber
attracts water and turns to gel during digestion. This slows digestion. Soluble fiber is found in oat bran, barley, nuts, seeds, beans, lentils, peas, and some fruits and vegetables. It is also found in psyllium, a common fiber supplement. Some types of soluble fiber may help lower risk of heart disease.
Insoluble fiber
is found in foods such as wheat bran, vegetables, and whole grains. It adds bulk to the stool and appears to help food pass more quickly through the stomach and intestines.
Alternative Names
Insoluble vs. soluble fiber; Fiber - soluble vs. insoluble
