Episcleritis
Episcleritis
Episcleritis is irritation and inflammation of the episclera, a thin layer of tissue covering the white part (sclera) of the eye. It is not an infection.
Causes
Episcleritis is a common condition. In most cases the problem is mild and vision is normal.
The cause is often unknown. But, it may occur with certain diseases, such as:
Herpes zoster virus
Rheumatoid arthritis
SjÃ¶gren syndrome
Syphilis
Tuberculosis
Symptoms
Symptoms include:
A pink or purple color to the normally white part of the eye
Eye pain
Eye tenderness
Sensitivity to light
Tearing of the eye
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider or eye doctor will do an eye exam to diagnose the disorder. Most of the time, no special tests are needed.
Treatment
The condition most often goes away on its own in 1 to 2 weeks. Using corticosteroid eye drops may help ease the symptoms faster.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Episcleritis most often improves without treatment. However, treatment may make symptoms go away sooner.
Possible Complications
In some cases, the condition may return. Rarely, irritation and inflammation of the white part of the eye may develop. This is called scleritis.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of episcleritis that last for more than 2 weeks. Get checked again if your pain gets worse or you have problems with your vision.
