Peristalsis
Peristalsis is a series of muscle contractions. These contractions occur in your digestive tract. Peristalsis is also seen in the tubes that connect the kidneys to the bladder.
Peristalsis is an automatic and important process. It moves:
Food through the digestive system
Urine from the kidneys into the bladder
Bile
from the gallbladder into the
duodenum
Peristalsis is a normal function of the body. It can sometimes be felt in your belly (abdomen) as gas moves along.
