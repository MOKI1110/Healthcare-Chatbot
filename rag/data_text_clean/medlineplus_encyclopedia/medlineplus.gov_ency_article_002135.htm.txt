Skin sagging treatment - underarms
Skin sagging treatment - underarms
Loose skin and tissue under the upper arms is common. It may be caused by aging, weight loss, or other reasons. There is no medical need for treatment. However, if you are bothered by the appearance of the skin, there are treatments that may help.
The muscles in the back of your arms are called the triceps. To tone these muscles, try push-ups or other triceps-building exercises. If this does not work, you may want to talk to your health care provider about cosmetic treatment options.
Non-surgical options include laser treatments to stimulate collagen production and tighten the skin. Fillers can also be used to stimulate collagen production. If you are considering arm-lift surgery, consult with a surgeon. Surgery will leave a scar.
Be sure to discuss the risks and benefits of treatments for sagging skin with your provider.
