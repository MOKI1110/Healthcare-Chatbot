Electrocauterization
Electrocauterization
Electrocauterization is the process of heating tissue with electricity.
Information
Electrocauterization (or electrocautery) is often used during surgery to remove unwanted or harmful tissue. It can also be used to burn and thus seal blood vessels. This helps reduce or stop bleeding during surgery or after an injury. It is a safe procedure.
A small probe with an electric current running through it is used to burn or destroy the tissue. A grounding pad is placed on the body (usually the thigh) before the surgery to protect the person from the harmful effects of the electricity.
