Upper airway biopsy
Upper airway biopsy
Upper airway biopsy is surgery to remove a small piece of tissue from the nose, mouth, and throat area. The tissue will be examined under the microscope by a pathologist.
How the Test is Performed
The surgeon will spray a numbing medicine in your mouth and throat. A metal tube is inserted to hold your tongue out of the way.
Another numbing medicine flows through the tube down the back of the throat. This may cause you to cough at first. When the area feels thick or swollen, it is numb.
The test may also be performed under general anesthesia, so that you will be asleep and not feel pain.
The surgeon looks at the abnormal area, and removes a small piece of tissue. It is sent to the laboratory for examination.
How to Prepare for the Test
DO NOT eat for 6 to 12 hours before the test.
Tell your surgeon if you take a blood thinner, such as aspirin, clopidogrel, or warfarin, when you schedule the biopsy. You may need to stop taking them for a little while. Never stop taking any medicines without first talking to your surgeon or health care provider.
How the Test will Feel
As the area is being numbed, you may feel like there is fluid running down the back of your throat. You may feel the need to cough or gag. And you may feel pressure or mild tugging.
When the numbness wears off, your throat may feel scratchy for several days. After the test, the cough reflex will return in 1 to 2 hours. Then you may eat and drink normally.
Why the Test is Performed
This test may be done if your provider thinks there is a problem with your upper airway. It may also be done with a
bronchoscopy
.
