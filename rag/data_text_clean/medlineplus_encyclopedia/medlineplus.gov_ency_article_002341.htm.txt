Vital signs
Vital signs reflect essential body functions, including your heartbeat rate, breathing rate, temperature, and blood pressure. Your health care provider may measure, or monitor your vital signs to check your level of physical functioning.
Normal vital signs change with age, sex, weight, exercise capability, and overall health.
Normal vital sign ranges for the average healthy adult while resting are:
Blood pressure: between 90/60 mmHg and 120/80 mmHg
Breathing: 12 to 18 breaths per minute
Pulse: 60 to 100 beats per minute
Temperature: 97.7 °F to 99.1 °F (36.5 °C to 37.3 °C); average 98.6 °F (37 °C)
