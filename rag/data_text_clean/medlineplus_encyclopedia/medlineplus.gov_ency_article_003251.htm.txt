Lichenified
Lichenified
Lichenified means the skin has become thickened and leathery. This often results from frequently rubbing or scratching the skin.
Chronic irritation due to conditions such as
eczema
can cause lichenified skin. Moisturizers and topical steroids are usually used to treat lichenified skin. Any underlying skin condition should also be treated.
