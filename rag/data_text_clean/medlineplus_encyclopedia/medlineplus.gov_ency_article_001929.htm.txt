Reportable diseases
Reportable diseases are diseases considered to be of great public health importance. In the United States, local, state, and national agencies (for example, county and state health departments or the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [CDC]) require that these diseases be reported when they are diagnosed by health care providers or laboratories.
Reporting allows for the collection of statistics that show how often the disease occurs. This helps researchers identify disease trends and track disease outbreaks. This information can help control future outbreaks.
Information
All US states have a reportable diseases list. It is the responsibility of your provider, not you, to report cases of these diseases. Many diseases on the list must also be reported to the CDC.
Reportable diseases are divided into several groups:
Mandatory written reporting: A report of the disease must be made in writing. Examples are
gonorrhea
and
salmonellosis
.
Mandatory reporting by telephone: The provider must make a report by phone. Examples are
rubeola
(measles) and
pertussis
(whooping cough).
Report of total number of cases. Examples are
chickenpox
and
influenza
.
Cancer. Cancer cases are reported to the state Cancer Registry.
Diseases reportable to the CDC include:

The county or state health department will try to find the source of many of these illnesses, such as food poisoning. In the case of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), the county or state will try to locate sexual contacts of infected people to make sure they are disease-free or are treated if they are already infected.
The information gained from reporting allows the county or state to make informed decisions and laws about activities and the environment, such as:
Animal control
Food handling
Immunization programs
Insect control
STD tracking
Water purification
The provider is required by law to report these diseases. By cooperating with state health workers, you can help them locate the source of an infection or prevent the spread of an epidemic.
