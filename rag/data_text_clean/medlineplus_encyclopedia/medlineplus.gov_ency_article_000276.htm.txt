Lactose intolerance
Lactose intolerance
Lactose is a type of sugar found in milk and other dairy products. An enzyme called lactase is needed by the body to digest lactose.
Lactose intolerance develops when the small intestine does not make enough of this enzyme.
Causes
Babies' bodies make the lactase enzyme so they can digest milk, including breast milk.
Babies born too early (premature) sometimes have lactose intolerance.
Children who were born at full term often do not show signs of the problem before they are 3 years old.
Lactose intolerance is very common in adults. It is rarely dangerous. About 30 million American adults have some degree of lactose intolerance by age 20.
In white people, lactose intolerance often develops in children older than age 5. This is the age when our bodies may stop making lactase.
In African Americans, the problem can occur as early as age 2.
The condition is very common among adults with Asian, African, or Native American heritage.
It is less common in people of northern or western European background, but still may occur.
An illness that involves or injures your small intestine may cause less of the lactase enzyme to be made. Treatment of these illnesses may improve the symptoms of lactose intolerance. These may include:
Surgery of the small intestine
Infections in the small intestine (this is most often seen in children)
Diseases that damage the small intestines, such as
celiac disease
or
Crohn disease
Any illness that causes diarrhea
Babies may be born with a genetic variant, which may make them unable to make any of the lactase enzyme.
Symptoms
Symptoms often occur 30 minutes to 2 hours after having milk products. Symptoms may be worse when you consume large amounts.
Symptoms include:
Abdominal bloating
Abdominal cramps
Diarrhea
Gas (
flatulence
)
Nausea
Exams and Tests
Other intestinal problems, such as
irritable bowel syndrome
, may cause the same symptoms as lactose intolerance.
Tests to help diagnose lactose intolerance include:
Lactose-hydrogen breath test
Lactose tolerance test
Stool pH
Small intestine biopsies
Another method may be to challenge a patient with 25 to 50 grams of lactose in water. Symptoms are then assessed using a questionnaire.
A 1 to 2 week trial of a completely lactose-free diet is also sometimes tried.
Treatment
Cutting down your intake of milk products that contain lactose from your diet most often eases symptoms. Also look at food labels for hidden sources of lactose in non-milk products (including some beers) and avoid these.
Most people with a low lactase level can drink up to one half cup of milk at one time (2 to 4 ounces or 60 to 120 milliliters) without having symptoms. Larger servings (more than 8 ounces or 240 mL) may cause problems for people with lactase deficiency.
Milk products that may be easier to digest include:
Buttermilk and cheeses (these foods contain less lactose than milk)
Fermented milk products, such as yogurt
Goat's milk
Aged hard cheeses
Lactose-free milk and milk products
Lactase-treated cow's milk for older children and adults
Soy formulas for infants younger than 2 years
Soy or rice milk for toddlers
You can add lactase enzymes to regular milk. You can also take these enzymes as capsules or chewable tablets. There are also many lactose-free dairy products available.
Not having milk and other dairy products in your diet can lead to a shortage of calcium, vitamin D, riboflavin, and protein. You need 1,000 to 1,500 mg of calcium each day depending on your age and sex. Some things you can do to get more calcium in your diet are:
Take calcium supplements with Vitamin D. Talk to your health care provider about which ones to choose.
Eat foods that have more calcium (such as leafy greens, oysters, sardines, canned salmon, shrimp, and broccoli).
Drink orange juice with added calcium.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Symptoms most often go away when you remove milk, other dairy products, and other sources of lactose from your diet. Without dietary changes, infants or children may have growth problems.
If the lactose intolerance was caused by a temporary diarrheal illness, levels of lactase enzyme will return to normal within a few weeks.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if:
You have an infant younger than 2 or 3 years old who has symptoms of lactose intolerance.
Your child is growing slowly or not gaining weight.
You or your child has symptoms of lactose intolerance and you need information about food substitutes.
Your symptoms get worse or do not improve with treatment.
You develop new symptoms.
Prevention
There is no known way to prevent lactose intolerance. You can prevent symptoms by avoiding foods with lactose.
