Toxins
Toxins are substances created by germs, plants, and animals that are poisonous (toxic) to humans. Toxins may also include some medicines that are helpful in small doses, but poisonous in large amounts.
Most toxins that cause problems in humans come from germs such as bacteria. For example, the symptoms of
cholera
are caused by a toxin made by cholera bacteria.
Other toxins that may cause problems include metals, such as lead, and certain chemicals in the environment.
