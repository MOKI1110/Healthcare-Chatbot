Collagen vascular disease
Collagen vascular disease
In a class of diseases known as
autoimmune disorders
, the body's immune system attacks its own tissues. Some of these diseases are similar to each other. They may involve arthritis and inflammation of arteries in the tissues. People who developed these disorders were previously said to have "connective tissue" or "collagen vascular" disease. We now have names for many specific conditions such as:
Ankylosing spondylitis
Dermatomyositis
Polyarteritis nodosa
Polymyositis
Psoriatic arthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis
Scleroderma
Systemic lupus erythematosus
Mixed connective tissue disease
Relapsing polychondritis
Vasculitis
When a specific disease cannot be diagnosed, more general terms may be used. These are called undifferentiated systemic rheumatic (connective tissue) diseases or overlap syndromes.
