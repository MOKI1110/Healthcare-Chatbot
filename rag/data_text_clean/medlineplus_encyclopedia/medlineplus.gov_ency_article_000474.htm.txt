Bilateral hydronephrosis
Bilateral hydronephrosis
Bilateral hydronephrosis is the enlargement of the parts of the kidney that collect urine. Bilateral means both sides.
Causes
Bilateral hydronephrosis occurs when urine is unable to drain from the kidney into the bladder. Hydronephrosis is not itself a disease. It occurs as a result of a problem that prevents urine from draining out of the kidneys, ureters, and bladder.
Disorders linked with bilateral hydronephrosis include:
Acute bilateral obstructive uropathy -- sudden blockage of the kidneys
Bladder outlet obstruction
-- blockage of the bladder, which does not allow drainage
Chronic bilateral obstructive uropathy -- a gradual blockage of both kidneys is most often from a common singular obstruction
Neurogenic bladder
-- poorly functional bladder
Posterior urethral valves -- flaps on the urethra that causes poor emptying of the bladder (in boys)
Prune belly syndrome
-- poorly emptying bladder that causes distention of the belly
Retroperitoneal fibrosis
-- abnormal scar tissue that blocks the ureters
Ureteropelvic junction obstruction
-- blockage of the kidney at the point where the ureter enters the kidney
Vesicoureteric reflux
-- backup of the urine from the bladder up to the ureter or kidney
Uterine prolapse
-- when the uterus drops down and presses into the vaginal area. This causes a kink in the urethra, which prevents the urine from emptying out of the bladder
Symptoms
In a baby, signs of a problem are often found before birth during a pregnancy ultrasound.
urinary tract infection
in a newborn baby can signal a blockage in the kidney. An older child who gets repeat urinary tract infections should also be checked for blockage.
A higher than normal number of urinary tract infections is often the only symptom of the problem.
Common symptoms in adults may include:
Back pain
Nausea, vomiting
Fever
Need to urinate often
Decreased urine output
Blood in the urine
Urinary incontinence
Exams and Tests
The following tests can show bilateral hydronephrosis:
CT scan of the abdomen
or kidneys
Intravenous pyelogram
(IVP), used less often
Pregnancy (fetal) ultrasound
Renal scan
Ultrasound of the abdomen
or kidneys
Treatment
Placing a tube into the bladder (Foley catheter) may open the blockage. Other treatments include:
Draining the bladder
Relieving pressure by placing tubes in the kidney through the skin
Placing a tube (stent) through the ureter to allow urine to flow from the kidney to bladder
The underlying cause of the blockage needs to be found and treated once the buildup of urine is relieved.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Surgery performed while the baby is in the womb or shortly after birth can have good results in improving kidney function.
Return of renal function can vary, depending on how long the blockage is present.
Possible Complications
Irreversible kidney damage may result from conditions that cause hydronephrosis.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
This problem is often found by the health care provider.
Prevention
An ultrasound during pregnancy can show a blockage in the baby's urinary tract. This allows the problem to be treated with early surgery.
Other causes of blockage, such as
kidney stones
, can be detected early if people notice warning signs of kidney problems.
It is important to pay attention to general problems with urination.
