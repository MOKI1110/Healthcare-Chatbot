Liquid nitrogen
Liquid nitrogen is a chemical that is extremely cold, about -328 °F (-164 °C).
Liquid nitrogen will instantly freeze anything it touches. It is used to kill cells that make up diseased or cancerous tissue. Tissue that has been frozen dies, may blister and then falls off. New tissue then replaces it.
