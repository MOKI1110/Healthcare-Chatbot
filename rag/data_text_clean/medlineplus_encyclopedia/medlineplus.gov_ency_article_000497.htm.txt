Proximal renal tubular acidosis
Proximal renal tubular acidosis
Proximal renal tubular acidosis is a disease that occurs when the kidneys don't properly remove acids from the blood into the urine. As a result, too much acid remains in the blood (called
acidosis
).
Causes
When the body performs its normal functions, it produces acid. If this acid is not removed or neutralized, the blood will become too acidic. This can lead to
electrolyte
imbalances in the blood. It can also cause problems with normal function of some cells.
The kidneys help control the body's acid level by removing acid from the blood and excreting it into the urine. Acidic substances in the body are neutralized by alkaline substances, mainly bicarbonate.
Proximal renal tubular acidosis (type II RTA) occurs when bicarbonate is not properly reabsorbed by the kidney's filtering system.
Type II RTA is less common than type I RTA. Type I is also called
distal renal tubular acidosis
. Type II most often occurs during infancy and may go away by itself.
Causes of type II RTA include:
Cystinosis (body is unable to break down the substance cysteine)
Drugs such as ifosfamide (a chemotherapy drug), certain antibiotics that are no longer used much (tetracycline), or acetazolamide
Fanconi syndrome
, a disorder of the kidney tubes in which certain substances normally absorbed into the bloodstream by the kidneys are released into the urine instead
Inherited fructose intolerance
, a disorder in which there is a lack of the protein needed to break down the fruit sugar fructose
Multiple myeloma
, a type of blood cancer
Primary hyperparathyroidism
, a disorder in which the parathyroid glands in the neck produce too much parathyroid hormone
SjÃ¶gren syndrome
, an autoimmune disorder in which the glands that produce tears and saliva are destroyed
Wilson disease
, an inherited disorder in which there is too much copper in the body's tissues
Vitamin D deficiency
Symptoms
Symptoms of proximal renal tubular acidosis include any of the following:
Confusion
or
decreased alertness
Dehydration
Fatigue
Increased breathing rate
Osteomalacia
(softening of the bones)
Muscle pain
Weakness
Other symptoms can include:
Decreased urine output
Increased
heart rate
or
irregular heartbeat
Muscle cramps
Pain in the bones, back, flank, or abdomen
Skeletal deformities
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will perform a physical exam and ask about the symptoms.
Tests that may be ordered include:
Arterial
blood gas
Blood chemistry
Blood pH level
Urine pH
and
acid-loading test
Urinalysis
Treatment
The goal is to restore normal acid level and electrolyte balance in the body. This will help correct bone disorders and reduce the risk for osteomalacia and
osteopenia
in adults.
Some adults may need no treatment. All children need alkaline medicine such as potassium citrate and sodium bicarbonate. This is medicine that helps correct the acidic condition of the body. The medicine helps prevent bone disease caused by too much acid, such as
rickets
, and to allow normal growth.
Thiazide diuretics are also frequently used to preserve bicarbonate in the body.
The underlying cause of proximal renal tubular necrosis should be corrected if it can be found.
Vitamin D
and calcium supplements may be needed to help reduce skeletal deformities resulting from osteomalacia.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Although the underlying cause of proximal renal tubular acidosis may go away by itself, the effects and complications can be permanent or life threatening. Treatment is usually successful.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of proximal renal tubular acidosis.
Get medical help right away if any of the following emergency symptoms develop:
Decreased alertness or
disorientation
Decreased consciousness
Seizures
Prevention
Most of the disorders that cause proximal renal tubular acidosis are not preventable.
