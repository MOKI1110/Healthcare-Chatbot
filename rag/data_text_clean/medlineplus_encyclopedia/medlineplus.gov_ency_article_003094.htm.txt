Heat intolerance
Heat intolerance
Heat intolerance is a feeling of being overheated when the temperature around you rises. It can often cause heavy sweating.
Heat intolerance usually comes on slowly and lasts for a long time, but it may also occur quickly and be due to a serious illness.
Causes
Heat intolerance may be caused by different factors:
Some types of medicines may make you less tolerant to heat. Not all medicines will affect everyone the same. If you have questions about any medicines you take, contact your health care provider. The types of medicines that may increase your risk of heat intolerance include:
Antihistamines
Amphetamines or other stimulants, including those found in drugs that suppress your appetite
Antibiotics
Antidepressants
Antipsychotic medicines
Blood pressure medicines
Cholesterol medicines (statins)
Decongestants
Diabetes medicines
Overactive bladder medicines
Pain relievers (non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, also called NSAIDs)
Parkinson disease medicines
Certain health conditions may make you less tolerant to heat. This can be due to the condition itself or any medicine you may take to manage it:
Cystic fibrosis
Diabetes
Cardiovascular disease
Graves disease
Mental health conditions
Multiple sclerosis
Obesity
Too much thyroid hormone (
thyrotoxicosis
)
Other issues and conditions can make you more likely to have heat intolerance. These include:
Alcohol use
Bacterial or viral infection
Having had heat exhaustion or heat stroke before
Illegal drug use (opioids, cocaine, methamphetamines)
Lack of physical fitness
Menopause
Pregnancy
Age can also be a factor. Young children and older adults are less able to adjust to temperature extremes. Older adults are also more likely to be taking medicine that increases the risk for heat intolerance.
