Placenta abruption - definition
The placenta is the organ that supplies nutrients and oxygen to the baby during pregnancy.
Placental abruption
occurs when the placenta detaches from the wall of the womb (uterus) before delivery. The most common symptoms are vaginal bleeding and painful uterine contractions. Blood and oxygen supply to the baby may also be adversely affected, leading to fetal distress. The cause is unknown, but high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, cocaine or alcohol use, injury to the mother, and having multiple pregnancies increase the risk for the condition. Treatment depends on the severity of the condition and can range from bed rest to emergency C-section.
