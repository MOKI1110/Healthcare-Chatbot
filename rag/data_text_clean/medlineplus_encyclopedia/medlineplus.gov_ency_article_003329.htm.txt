B and T cell screen
B and T cell screen
B and T cell screen is a lab test to determine the amount of B and T lymphocytes in the blood.
How the Test is Performed
blood sample is needed
.
Blood could also be obtained by
capillary sample
(fingerstick or heel stick in infants).
After the blood is drawn, it goes through a two-step process. First, the lymphocytes are separated from other blood parts. Once the cells are separated, identifiers are added to distinguish between T and B cells.
How to Prepare for the Test
Tell your health care provider if you have had any of the following, which might affect your T and B cell count:
Chemotherapy
HIV/AIDS
Radiation therapy
Recent or current infection
Steroid therapy
Stress
Surgery
How the Test will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain, while others feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.
Why the Test is Performed
Your provider may order this test if you have signs of certain diseases that weaken the immune system. It may also be used to distinguish between cancerous and noncancerous disease, particularly
cancers
that involve the blood and bone marrow.
Also, the test may be used to determine how well treatment for certain conditions such as HIV/AIDS is working.
Normal Results
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Abnormal B and T cell counts may suggest a possible disease. Further testing is needed to confirm a diagnosis.
An increased T cell count may be due to:
Cancer of white blood cells, called lymphoblasts (
acute lymphoblastic leukemia
)
Cancer of white blood cells, called lymphocytes (
chronic lymphocytic leukemia
)
A viral infection called
infectious mononucleosis
Blood cancer that starts in the plasma cells in the bone marrow (
multiple myeloma
)
Syphilis
, a sexually transmitted disease (STD)
Toxoplasmosis
, an infection due to a parasite
Tuberculosis
An increased B cell count may be due to:
Chronic lymphocytic leukemia
DiGeorge syndrome
Multiple myeloma
WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia
A decreased T cell count may be due to:
Congenital T-cell deficiency disease, such as Nezelof syndrome, DiGeorge syndrome, or Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome
Acquired T-cell deficiency states, such as HIV infection or HTLV-1 infection
B cell proliferative disorders, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia or WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia
A decreased B cell count may be due to:
HIV/AIDS
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia
Immunodeficiency disorders
Treatment with certain medicines
Risks
Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Obtaining a blood sample from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight but may include:
Excessive bleeding
Fainting or feeling lightheaded
Hematoma (blood accumulating under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
Alternative Names
E-rosetting; T and B lymphocyte assays; B and T lymphocyte assays
