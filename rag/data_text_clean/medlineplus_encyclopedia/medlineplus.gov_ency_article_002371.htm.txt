Genes
Genes
A gene is a short piece of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). Genes tell the body how to build specific
proteins
. There are about 20,000 genes in each cell of the human body. Together, they make up the blueprint for the human body and how it works.
A person's genetic makeup is called a genotype.
Information
Genes are made of DNA. Strands of DNA make up part of your
chromosomes
. Chromosomes have matching strands of DNA that make specific genes. Except for the sex chromosomes (X and Y), chromosomes are paired so there are 2 genes, 1 on each chromosome. The gene occurs in the same position on each chromosome.
Genetic traits, such as eye color, are dominant or recessive:
Dominant traits are controlled by 1 gene in the pair of chromosomes.
Recessive traits need both genes in the gene pair to work together.
Many personal characteristics, such as height, are determined by more than 1 gene. However, some diseases, such as
sickle cell anemia
, can be caused by a
change in a single gene
.
