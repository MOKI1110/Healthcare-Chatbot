Pentazocine overdose
Pentazocine overdose
Pentazocine is a medicine used to treat moderate to severe pain. It is one of a number of chemicals called opioids or opiates, which were originally derived from the poppy plant and used for pain relief or their calming effects. Pentazocine overdose occurs when someone takes more than the recommended amount of this medicine.

What to Expect at the Emergency Room
The health care provider will measure and monitor the person's vital signs, including temperature, pulse, breathing, and blood pressure.
Symptoms will be treated as appropriate. The person may receive:
Activated charcoal
Airway support, including oxygen, breathing tube through the mouth (intubation), and breathing machine (ventilator)
Blood and urine tests
Chest x-ray
CT scan
ECG (
electrocardiogram
), or heart tracing
Fluids through a vein (intravenous or IV)
Laxative
Medicines to treat symptoms, including naloxone, an antidote to help reverse the effect of the poison; multiple doses may be needed
Outlook (Prognosis)
Pentazocine overdose is usually much less serious than other opioid medicine overdoses, such as heroin and morphine. In rare cases, antidotes need to be used. There may be a more serious outcome if there has been prolonged coma or respiratory depression, or shock (extremely low blood pressure, leading to damage to multiple internal organs). Although deaths have been reported, most people who receive prompt treatment recover well.
