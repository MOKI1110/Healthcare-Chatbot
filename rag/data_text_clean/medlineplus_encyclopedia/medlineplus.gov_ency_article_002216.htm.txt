Aspiration
Aspiration
Aspiration means to draw in or out using a sucking motion. It has two meanings:
Breathing in a foreign object
(for example, sucking food into the airway).
A medical procedure that removes something from an area of the body. These substances can be air, body fluids, or bone fragments. An example is removing
ascites
fluid from the belly area.
Aspiration as a medical procedure may also be used to remove tissue samples for a
biopsy
. This is sometimes called a needle biopsy or aspirate. For example, the aspiration of a breast lesion.
