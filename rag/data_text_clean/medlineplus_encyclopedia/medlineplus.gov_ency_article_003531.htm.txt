Anti-smooth muscle antibody
Anti-smooth muscle antibody
Anti-smooth muscle antibody is a blood test that detects the presence of
antibodies
against smooth muscle. The antibody is useful in making a diagnosis of autoimmune hepatitis.
How the Test is Performed
A blood sample is needed. This may be taken through a vein. The procedure is called a
venipuncture
.
How to Prepare for the Test
No special steps are needed to prepare for this test.
How the Test will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others may feel only a prick or stinging sensation. Afterward, there may be some throbbing.
Why the Test is Performed
You may need this test if you have signs of certain liver diseases, such as
hepatitis
and
cirrhosis
. These conditions can trigger the body to form antibodies against smooth muscle.
Anti-smooth muscle antibodies are not often seen in diseases other than
autoimmune hepatitis
. Therefore, it is helpful to make the diagnosis. Autoimmune hepatitis is treated with immunosuppressive medicines. People with autoimmune hepatitis often have other autoantibodies. These include:
Antinuclear antibodies.
Anti-actin antibodies.
Anti-soluble liver antigen/liver pancreas (anti-SLA/LP) antibodies.
Other antibodies may be present, even when the anti-smooth muscle antibodies are absent.
The diagnosis and management of autoimmune hepatitis may require a liver biopsy.
Normal Results
Normally, there are no antibodies present.
Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
A positive test may be due to:
Chronic active autoimmune hepatitis
Cirrhosis
Infectious mononucleosis
The test also helps distinguish
autoimmune hepatitis
from
systemic lupus erythematosus
.
Risks
Risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:
Excessive bleeding
Fainting
or feeling lightheaded
Hematoma
(blood accumulating under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
