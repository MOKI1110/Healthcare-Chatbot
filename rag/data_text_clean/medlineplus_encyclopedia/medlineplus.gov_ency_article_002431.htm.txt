Irradiated foods
Irradiated foods are foods that are sterilized using x-rays or radioactive materials that kill bacteria. The process is called irradiation. It is used to remove germs from food. It does not make the food itself radioactive.
The benefits of irradiating food include the ability to control insects and bacteria, such as salmonella. The process can give foods (especially fruits and vegetables) a longer shelf life, and it reduces the risk for
food poisoning
.
Food irradiation is used in many countries. It was first approved in the United States to prevent sprouts on white potatoes, and to control insects on wheat and in certain spices and seasonings.
The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) have all long-approved the safety of irradiated food.
Foods that may undergo irradiation include:
Beef, pork, poultry
Eggs in shells
Shellfish, such as shrimp, lobster, crab, oysters, clams, mussels, scallops
Fresh fruits and vegetables, including seeds for sprouting (such as alfalfa sprouts)
Spices and seasonings
