Quantitative immunoglobulins
Quantitative immunoglobulins
The quantitative immunoglobulins test measures the levels of proteins called gamma globulins in the fluid part of a blood sample. This fluid is called serum.
How the Test is Performed
blood sample
is needed.
In the lab, the technician places the blood sample on special paper and applies an electric current. The proteins move on the paper and form bands that show the amount of each protein.
How to Prepare for the Test
Follow instructions on whether or not you need to fast before this test.
Certain medicines may affect the results of this test. Your health care provider will tell you if you need to stop taking any medicines. Do not stop any medicine before talking to your provider.
How the Test will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or a slight bruise. This soon goes away.
Why the Test is Performed
This test is done to look at gamma globulin protein levels in the blood. Identifying the levels of gamma globulins can help diagnose certain medical issues.
Gamma globulins include various types of antibodies such as immunoglobulins (Ig) M, G, and A.
Certain diseases are associated with producing too many immunoglobulins. For example,
WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia
is a cancer of certain white blood cells. It is linked with producing too many IgM antibodies.
Normal Results
Normal value ranges are:
Serum globulin: 2.0 to 3.5 grams per deciliter (g/dL) or 20 to 35 grams per liter (g/L)
IgM component: 120 to 400 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) or 1.2 to 4 g/L
IgG component:  800 to 1600 mg/dL or 8 to 16 g/L
IgA component:  40 to 220 mg/dL or 0.4 to 2.2 g/L
Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. Talk to your provider about the meaning of your specific test results.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Increased gamma globulin proteins may indicate:
Acute
infection
Blood and bone marrow cancers including
multiple myeloma
, and some lymphomas and leukemias
Immune deficiency disorders
Long-term (
chronic
) inflammatory disease (for example,
rheumatoid arthritis
and
systemic lupus erythematosus
)
WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia
Risks
There is very little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another, and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:
Excessive bleeding
Fainting
or feeling lightheaded
Multiple punctures to locate veins
Hematoma
(blood buildup under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
