Cerebral amyloid angiopathy
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy
Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) is a condition in which proteins called amyloid build up on the walls of the arteries in the brain. CAA causes bleeding into the brain (
hemorrhagic stroke
) and
dementia
.
Causes
People with CAA have deposits of amyloid protein in the walls of blood vessels in the brain. The protein is usually not deposited anywhere else in the body.
The major risk factor is increasing age. CAA is more often seen in people older than 55. Sometimes, it is passed down through families.
Symptoms
CAA can cause bleeding into the brain. Bleeding often occurs in the outer parts of the brain, called the cortex, and not the deep areas. Symptoms occur because bleeding in the brain harms brain tissue. Some people have gradual memory problems. When a CT scan is done, there are often signs that they have had bleeding in the brain that they may not have realized.
If there is a lot of bleeding, immediate symptoms occur and resemble a stroke. These symptoms include:
Drowsiness
Headache
(usually in a certain part of the head)
Nervous system changes that may start suddenly, including
confusion
,
delirium
,
double vision
, decreased vision, sensation changes, speech problems,
weakness
, or
paralysis
Seizures
Stupor or
coma
(rarely)
Vomiting
If bleeding is not severe or widespread, symptoms can include:
Episodes of confusion
Headaches that come and go
Loss of mental function (dementia)
Weakness or unusual sensations that come and go, and involve smaller areas
Seizures
Exams and Tests
CAA is hard to diagnose with certainty without a sample of brain tissue. This is usually done after death or when a biopsy of the blood vessels of the brain is done.
A physical exam can be normal if the bleed is small. There may be some brain function changes. It is important for your health care provider to ask detailed questions about the symptoms and medical history. The symptoms and results of the physical exam and any imaging tests may cause your provider to suspect CAA.
Imaging tests of the head that may be done include:
CT scan
or
MRI scan
to check for bleeding in the brain
MRA scan
to check for large bleeds and rule out other causes of bleeding
PET scan
to check for amyloid deposits in the brain
Treatment
There is no known effective treatment. The goal of treatment is to reduce risk by modifying risk factors, such as hypertension, and to relieve symptoms. In some cases, rehabilitation is needed for weakness or clumsiness. This can include physical, occupational, or speech therapy.
Sometimes, medicines that help improve memory, such as those for
Alzheimer disease
, are used.
Seizures, also called amyloid spells, may be treated with anti-seizure medicines.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The disorder slowly gets worse.
Possible Complications
Complications of CAA may include:
Dementia
Hydrocephalus
(rarely)
Seizures
Repeated episodes of bleeding in the brain
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Go to the emergency room or call 911 or the local emergency number if you have sudden
loss of movement
, sensation, vision, or speech.
