Myotonia congenita
Myotonia congenita
Myotonia congenita is an inherited condition that affects muscle relaxation. It is congenital, meaning that it is present from birth. It occurs more frequently in northern Scandinavia.
Causes
Myotonia congenita is caused by a genetic change (genetic variant). It is passed down from either one or both parents to their children (inherited).
Myotonia congenita is caused by a problem in the part of the muscle cells that are needed for muscles to relax. Abnormal repeated electrical signals occur in the muscles, causing a type of muscle stiffness called myotonia.
Symptoms
The hallmark of this condition is myotonia. This means the muscles are unable to quickly relax after contracting. For example, after a handshake, the person is only very slowly able to open and pull away their hand.
Early symptoms may include:
Difficulty swallowing
Gagging
Stiff movements that improve when they are repeated
Shortness of breath or tightening of the chest at the beginning of exercise
Frequent falls
Difficulty opening eyes after forcing them closed or crying
Children with myotonia congenita often look muscular and well-developed. They may not have symptoms of myotonia congenita until age 2 or 3.
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider may ask if there is a family history of myotonia congenita.
Tests include:
Electromyography
(EMG) and
nerve conduction studies
(NCS)
Genetic testing
Muscle biopsy
Treatment
As cold and stress can worsen symptoms, management is first directed at avoiding these potential triggers. Some forms of exercise may also be beneficial. Mexiletine is a medicine that treats symptoms of myotonia congenita. Other treatments include:
Phenytoin
Procainamide
Quinine (rarely used now, due to side effects)
Carbamazepine

Outlook (Prognosis)
People with this condition can do well. Symptoms only occur when a movement is first started. After a few repetitions, the muscle relaxes and the movement becomes normal.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Aspiration pneumonia
caused by swallowing difficulties
Frequent choking, gagging, or trouble swallowing in an infant
Long-term (chronic) joint problems
Weakness of the abdominal muscles
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if your child has symptoms of myotonia congenita.
Prevention
Couples who want to have children and who have a family history of myotonia congenita should consider
genetic counseling
