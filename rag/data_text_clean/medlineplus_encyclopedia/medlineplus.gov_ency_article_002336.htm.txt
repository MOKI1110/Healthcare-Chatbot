Traction
Traction
Traction means pulling on part of the body.
Most often, traction uses devices such as weights and pulleys to put tension on a displaced bone or joint, such as a dislocated shoulder. The tension helps put the joint back in position and keep it still.
Traction is also used to keep a group of muscles (such as the neck muscles) stretched to reduce
muscle spasms
. This is called cervical traction.
Information
A traction treatment will involve a:
Certain amount of tension to pull the body part, which may move it into another position
Length of time to use the tension
Way to keep the tension steady at the desired amount, usually based on the weight applied to the traction device
