Body temperature norms
Body temperature norms
Normal body temperature varies by person, age, activity, and time of day. The average normal body temperature is generally accepted as 98.6 °F (37 °C). Some studies have shown that the normal body temperature can have a wide range, from 97 °F (36.1 °C) to 99 °F (37.2 °C).
A temperature over 100.4 °F (38 °C) most often means you have a fever caused by an infection or illness.
Body temperature normally changes throughout the day and in adults, it is lowest in the early morning.
