Breast ultrasound
Breast ultrasound
Breast ultrasound is a test that uses sound waves to examine the breasts.
How the Test is Performed
You will be asked to undress from the waist up. You will be given a gown to wear.
During the test, you will lie on your back on an examining table.
Your health care provider will place a gel on the skin of your breast. A handheld device, called a transducer, is moved over the breast area. You may be asked to raise your arms above your head and turn to the left or right.
The device sends sound waves to the breast tissue. The sound waves help create a picture that can be seen on a computer screen on the ultrasound machine.
The number of people involved in the test will be limited to protect your privacy.
How to Prepare for the Test
You may want to wear a two-piece outfit, so you do not have to completely undress.
A mammogram may be needed either before or after the exam. Do not use any lotion or powder on your breasts on the day of the exam. Do not use deodorant under your arms. Remove any jewelry from your neck and chest area.
How the Test will Feel
This test usually does not cause any discomfort, although the gel may feel cool.
Why the Test is Performed
Breast ultrasound is usually ordered when more information is needed after other tests are done or as a stand-alone test. These tests may include
mammogram
or
breast MRI
.
Your provider may order this test if you have:
breast lump
found during a breast exam
An abnormal mammogram
Clear or bloody
nipple discharge
A breast ultrasound can:
Help tell the difference between a solid mass or a
cyst
Help look for a growth if you have clear or bloody fluid coming from your nipple
Guide a needle during a
breast biopsy
Normal Results
A normal result means the breast tissue appears normal.
What Abnormal Results Mean
Ultrasound can help show noncancerous growths such as:
Cysts, which are fluid-filled sacs
Fibroadenomas
, which are noncancerous solid growths
Lipomas, which are noncancerous fatty lumps that can occur anywhere in the body, including the breasts
Breast cancers
can also be seen with ultrasound.
Follow-up tests to determine whether treatment may be needed include:
Open (surgical or excisional) breast biopsy
Stereotactic breast biopsy
(needle biopsy performed using a machine like a mammogram)
Ultrasound-guided breast biopsy
(needle biopsy performed using ultrasound)
Risks
There are no risks associated with breast ultrasound. There is no radiation exposure.
Alternative Names
