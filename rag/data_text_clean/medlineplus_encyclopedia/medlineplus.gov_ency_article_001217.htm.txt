McCune-Albright syndrome
McCune-Albright syndrome
McCune-Albright syndrome is a genetic disease that affects the bones, hormones, and color (pigmentation) of the skin.
Causes
McCune-Albright syndrome is caused by changes in the
GNAS
gene. A small number, but not all, of the person's cells contain this faulty gene (mosaicism).
This disease is not inherited.
Symptoms
The main symptom of McCune-Albright syndrome is early puberty in girls. Menstrual periods may begin in early childhood, long before the breasts or pubic hair develop (which normally occur first). The average age that symptoms appear is 3 years old. However, puberty and menstrual bleeding have occurred as early as 4 to 6 months in girls.
Early sexual development may also occur in boys, but not as often as in girls.
Other symptoms include:
Bone fractures
Deformities of the bones in the face
Gigantism
Irregular, large patchy
cafÃ© au lait spots
Exams and Tests
A physical examination may show signs of:
Abnormal bone growth in the skull
Abnormal heart rhythms (
arrhythmias
)
Acromegaly
Gigantism
Large cafe-au-lait spots on the skin
Liver disease, jaundice, fatty liver
Scar-like tissue in the bone (
fibrous dysplasia
)
Tests may show:
Adrenal
abnormalities
High level of parathyroid hormone (
hyperparathyroidism
)
High level of thyroid hormone (
hyperthyroidism
)
Adrenal hormone
abnormalities
Low level of phosphorous in the blood (
hypophosphatemia
)
Ovarian cysts
Pituitary
or
thyroid tumors
Abnormal
blood prolactin
level
Abnormal
growth hormone
level
Other tests that may be done include:
MRI of the head
X-rays of the bones
Genetic testing may be done to identify the gene variant responsible for the symptoms.
Treatment
There is no specific treatment for McCune-Albright syndrome. Medicines that block estrogen production, such as testolactone, have been tried with some success.
Adrenal abnormalities (such as
Cushing syndrome
) may be treated with surgery to remove the adrenal glands. Gigantism and pituitary adenoma will need to be treated with medicines that block hormone production, or with surgery.
Bone abnormalities (fibrous dysplasia) are sometimes removed with surgery.
Limit the number of x-rays taken of affected areas of the body.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Lifespan is relatively normal.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Blindness
Cosmetic problems from bone abnormalities
Deafness
Osteitis fibrosa cystica
Premature puberty
Repeated broken bones
Tumors of the bone (rare)
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your health care provider if your child starts puberty early, or has other symptoms of McCune-Albright syndrome. Genetic counseling, and possibly genetic testing, may be suggested if the disease is detected.
