Dry eye syndrome
Dry eye syndrome
You need tears to moisten your eyes and to wash away particles that have gotten into your eyes. A healthy tear film on the eye is necessary for good vision.
Dry eyes develop when the eye is unable to maintain a healthy coating of tears.
Causes
Dry eye syndrome commonly occurs in people who are otherwise healthy. It becomes more common with older age. This can occur due to hormonal changes that make your eyes produce fewer tears. Dry eye syndrome is sometimes caused or worsened by a condition called
meibomianitis
, which changes the normal tear film.
Other common causes of dry eyes include:
Dry environment or workplace (wind, air conditioning)
Sun exposure
Smoking or second-hand smoke exposure
Cold or allergy medicines
Wearing contact lenses
Dry eye syndrome can also be caused by:
Heat or chemical burns
Previous eye surgery
Use of eye drops for other eye diseases
An uncommon
autoimmune disorder
in which the glands that produce tears are destroyed (
SjÃ¶gren syndrome
)
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
Blurred vision
Burning, itching, or redness in the eye
Gritty or scratchy feeling in the eye
Sensitivity to light
Exams and Tests
Tests may include:
Visual acuity measurement
Slit lamp exam
Diagnostic staining of the cornea and tear film
Measurement of tear film break-up time (TBUT)
Measurement of rate of tear production (Schirmer test)
Measurement of concentration of tears (osmolality)
Treatment
The first step in treatment is artificial tears. These come as preserved (screw cap bottle) and unpreserved (twist open vial or multidose bottle). Preserved tears are more convenient, but some people are sensitive to preservatives. There are many brands available without a prescription.
Start using the drops at least 2 to 4 times per day. If your symptoms are not better after a couple of weeks of regular use:
Increase use (up to every 2 hours if using preservative free drops).
Change to unpreserved drops if you have been using the preserved type.
Try a different brand.
Talk to your health care provider if you cannot find a brand that works for you.
Other treatments for dry eyes may include:
Fish oil 2 to 3 times per day
Glasses, goggles or contact lenses that keep moisture in the eyes
Medicines such as cyclosporine (Restasis) or lifitegrast (Xiidra), corticosteroid eye drops, and oral tetracycline and doxycycline
Tiny plugs placed in the tear drainage ducts to help moisture stay on the surface of the eye longer
Other helpful steps include:
DO NOT smoke.
Avoid second-hand smoke, direct wind, and air conditioning.
Use a humidifier, particularly in the winter.
Limit allergy and cold medicines that may dry you out and worsen your symptoms.
Purposefully blink more often. Rest your eyes once in a while.
Clean eyelashes regularly and apply warm compresses.
Some dry eye symptoms are due to sleeping with the eyes slightly open. Lubricating ointments work best for this problem. You should use them only in small amounts since they can blur your vision. It is best to use them before sleep.
Surgery may be helpful if symptoms are because the eyelids are in an abnormal position.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Most people with dry eye syndrome have only discomfort, and no vision loss.
Possible Complications
In severe cases, the clear covering on the eye (cornea) may become damaged or infected.
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider right away if:
You have red or painful eyes.
You have flaking, discharge, or a sore on your eye or eyelid.
You have had an injury to your eye, or if you have a bulging eye or a drooping eyelid.
You have joint pain, swelling, or stiffness and a dry mouth along with dry eye symptoms.
Your eyes do not get better with self-care within a few days.
Prevention
Stay away from dry environments and things that irritate your eyes to help prevent symptoms.
