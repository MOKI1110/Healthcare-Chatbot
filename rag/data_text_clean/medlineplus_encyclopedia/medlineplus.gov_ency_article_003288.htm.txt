Arachnodactyly
Arachnodactyly
Arachnodactyly is a condition in which the fingers are long, slender, and curved. They look like the legs of a spider (arachnid).
Considerations
Long, slender fingers can be normal and not associated with any medical problems. In some cases, however, "spider fingers" can be a sign of an underlying disorder.
Causes
Causes may include:
Homocystinuria
Marfan syndrome
Other rare genetic disorders
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Some children are born with arachnodactyly. It may become more evident over time. Talk to your health care provider if your child has long, slender fingers and you are concerned that an underlying condition may exist.
What to Expect at Your Office Visit
The provider will perform a physical exam. You will be asked questions about the medical history. This includes:
When did you first notice the fingers being shaped like this?
Is there any family history of early death? Is there any family history of known hereditary disorders?
What other symptoms are present? Have you noticed any other unusual things?
Diagnostic tests are most often not necessary unless a hereditary disorder is suspected.
Alternative Names
Dolichostenomelia; Spider fingers; Achromachia
