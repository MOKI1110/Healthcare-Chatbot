Quantitative nephelometry test
Quantitative nephelometry test
Quantitative nephelometry is a lab test to quickly and accurately measure levels of certain proteins called immunoglobulins in the blood. Immunoglobulins are
antibodies
that help fight infection.
This test specifically measures the immunoglobulins IgM, IgG, and IgA.
How the Test is Performed
blood sample is needed
.
How to Prepare for the Test
You may be asked not to eat or drink anything for 4 hours before the test.
How the Test will Feel
When the needle is inserted to draw blood, some people feel moderate pain. Others feel only a prick or stinging. Afterward, there may be some throbbing or slight bruising. This soon goes away.
Why the Test is Performed
The test provides a rapid and accurate measurement of the amounts of the immunoglobulins IgM, IgG, and IgA.
Normal Results
Normal results for the three immunoglobulins are:
IgG: 700 to 1500 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 7.0 to 15.0 grams per liter (g/L)
IgM: 25 to 200 mg/dL, or 0.25 to 2.0 g/L
IgA: 40 to 350 mg/dL, or 0.4 to 3.5 g/L
The examples above show the common measurements for these test results. Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your health care provider about the meaning of your specific test results. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples.
What Abnormal Results Mean
An increased level of IgG may be due to:
Chronic
infection or inflammation
Hyperimmunization
(higher than normal number of specific antibodies)
IgG
multiple myeloma
(a type of blood
cancer
)
Liver disease
Rheumatoid arthritis
Decreased levels of IgG may be due to:
Agammaglobulinemia
(very low levels of immunoglobulins, a very rare disorder)
Leukemia
(blood cancer)
Multiple myeloma
(bone marrow cancer)
Preeclampsia
(high blood pressure during pregnancy)
Treatment with certain
chemotherapy
medicines
Increased levels of IgM may be due to:
Mononucleosis
Lymphoma (cancer of the lymph tissue)
WaldenstrÃ¶m macroglobulinemia
(cancer of the white blood cells)
Multiple myeloma
Rheumatoid arthritis
Infection
Decreased levels of IgM may be due to:
Agammaglobulinemia (very rare)
Leukemia
Multiple myeloma
Increased levels of IgA may be due to:
Chronic infections, especially of the gastrointestinal tract
Inflammatory bowel disease, such as
Crohn disease
and ulcerative colitis
Multiple myeloma
Decreased levels of IgA may be due to:
Agammaglobulinemia (very rare)
Hereditary IgA deficiency
Multiple myeloma
Gut disease that leads to protein loss
Other tests are needed to confirm or diagnose any of the conditions above.
Risks
There is little risk involved with having your blood taken. Veins and arteries vary in size from one person to another and from one side of the body to the other. Taking blood from some people may be more difficult than from others.
Other risks associated with having blood drawn are slight, but may include:
Excessive bleeding
Fainting
or feeling lightheaded
Multiple punctures to locate veins
Hematoma
(blood accumulating under the skin)
Infection (a slight risk any time the skin is broken)
