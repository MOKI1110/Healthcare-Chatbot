Muscle strain treatment
Question:
How do you treat a
muscle strain
?
Answer:
Rest the strained muscle and apply ice for the first few days after the injury. Anti-inflammatory medicines such as ibuprofen, naproxen, or acetaminophen (Tylenol) also help reduce pain and swelling. As the pain decreases, you can use heat on the muscle. Stretching and light exercises to bring blood to the injured area can also be useful. In general, stretching and warm compresses are helpful before exercises. Cooling down and icing the area after exercise can help.
Get medical help right away if:
You have a lot of swelling with the muscle strain.
You can't move your arms, legs, or joints.
You have swelling that is getting worse as time passes.
