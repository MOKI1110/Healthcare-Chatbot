Limited range of motion
Limited range of motion
Limited range of motion is a term meaning that a joint or body part cannot move through its normal range of motion.
Considerations
Motion may be limited because of  a problem within the joint,
swelling
of tissue around the joint,  stiffness of the ligaments and muscles, or  pain.
Causes
A sudden loss of range of motion may be due to:
Dislocation
of a joint
Fracture
of an elbow or other joint
Infected joint
(hip is most common in children)
Legg-CalvÃ©-Perthes disease
(in boys 4 to 10 years old)
Nursemaid elbow
, an injury to the elbow joint in young children
Tearing of certain structures within the joint, such as the meniscus or cartilage
Lose bodies which have become stuck in the joint
Loss of motion may occur if you damage the bones within a joint. This may happen if you have:
Broken a joint bone in the past
Frozen shoulder
Osteoarthritis
Rheumatoid arthritis
Ankylosing spondylitis
(a specific form of arthritis)
Brain, nerve, or muscle disorders can damage the nerves, tendons, and muscles, and can cause loss of motion. Some of these disorders include:
Cerebral palsy
(group of disorders that involve brain and nervous system functions)
Congenital
torticollis
(wry neck)
Muscular dystrophy
(group of inherited disorders that cause muscle weakness)
Stroke
or brain injury
Volkmann contracture
(deformity of the hand, fingers, and wrist caused by injury to the muscles of the forearm)
Home Care
Your health care provider may suggest exercises to increase muscle strength and flexibility.
