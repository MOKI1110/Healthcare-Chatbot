Hypersensitivity vasculitis
Hypersensitivity vasculitis
Hypersensitivity vasculitis is an extreme reaction to a drug, infection, or foreign substance. It leads to inflammation and damage to blood vessels, mainly in the skin. The term is not used much currently because more specific names are considered more precise.
Causes
Hypersensitivity vasculitis, or cutaneous small vessel vasculitis, is caused by:
An
allergic reaction
to a drug or other foreign substance
A reaction to an infection
It usually affects people older than age 16.
Often, the cause of the problem cannot be found even with a careful study of the person's medical history.
Hypersensitivity vasculitis may look like systemic,
necrotizing vasculitis
, which can affect blood vessels throughout the body and not just in the skin. In children, it can look like Henoch-Schonlein purpura.
Symptoms
Symptoms may include:
New rash with tender, purple or brownish-red spots  over large areas
Skin sores mostly located on the legs, buttocks, or trunk
Blisters
on the skin
Hives (
urticaria
), may last longer than 24 hours
Open sores with dead tissue (necrotic
ulcers
)
Exams and Tests
The health care provider will base the diagnosis on symptoms. The provider will review any medicines or drugs you have taken and recent infections. You will be asked about cough, fever, or chest pain.
A complete physical exam will be done.
Blood and urine tests may be done to look for systemic disorders such systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, or hepatitis C. The blood tests may include:
Complete blood count with differential
C-reactive protein
Erythrocyte sedimentation rate
Chemistry panel with liver enzymes and creatinine
Antinuclear antibody (ANA)
Rheumatoid factor
Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA)
Complement levels
Cryoglobulins
Hepatitis B and C tests
HIV test
Urinalysis
Skin biopsy
shows inflammation of the small blood vessels.
Treatment
The goal of treatment is to reduce inflammation.
Your provider may prescribe aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), or corticosteroids to reduce inflammation of the blood vessels. (Do not give aspirin to children except as advised by your provider).
Your provider will tell you to stop taking medicines that could be causing this condition.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Hypersensitivity vasculitis most often goes away over time. The condition may come back in some people.
People with ongoing vasculitis should be checked for systemic vasculitis.
Possible Complications
Complications may include:
Lasting damage to the blood vessels or skin with scarring
Inflamed blood vessels affecting the internal organs
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if you have symptoms of hypersensitivity vasculitis.
Prevention
Do not take medicines that have caused an allergic reaction in the past.
