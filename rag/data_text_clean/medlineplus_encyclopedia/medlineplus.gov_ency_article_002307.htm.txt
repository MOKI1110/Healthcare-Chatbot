Spores
Spores
A spore is a cell that certain fungi, plants (moss, ferns), and bacteria produce.
Certain bacteria make spores as a way to defend themselves. Spores have thick walls. They can resist high temperatures, humidity, and other environmental conditions.
The bacteria
Clostridia
form spores. These spores create the bacteria that cause a rare condition called gas gangrene and a type of colitis that is linked to use of antibiotics.
Information
Chemical disinfectants can kill bacteria, but they do not destroy their spores.
A process called sterilization destroys spores and bacteria. It is done at high temperature and under high pressure. In health care settings, sterilization of instruments is usually done using a machine called an autoclave.
