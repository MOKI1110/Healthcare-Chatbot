Erythema multiforme
Erythema multiforme
Erythema multiforme (EM) is an acute skin reaction that comes from an infection or another trigger. EM is a self-limiting condition. This means it usually resolves on its own without treatment.
Causes
EM is a type of
allergic reaction
. In most cases, it occurs in response to an infection. In rare cases, it is caused by certain medicines or body-wide (systemic) illness.
Infections that may lead to EM include:
Viruses, such as
herpes simplex virus
(HSV) that cause cold sores and genital herpes (most common)
Bacteria, such as
Mycoplasma pneumoniae
that cause lung infection
Fungi, such as
Histoplasma capsulatum
, that cause
histoplasmosis
Medicines that may cause EM include:
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
Allopurinol (treats
gout
)
Certain antibiotics, such as sulfonamides and aminopenicillins
Anti-seizure medicines
Systemic illnesses that are associated with EM include:
Inflammatory bowel disease, such as
Crohn disease
Systemic lupus erythematosus
(SLE)
EM occurs mostly in adults 20 to 40 years old. People with EM may have family members who have had EM as well.
Symptoms
Symptoms of EM include:
Low-grade
fever
Headache
Sore throat
Cough
Runny nose
General ill feeling
Itchy
skin
Joint aches
Many
skin lesions
(sores or abnormal areas)
The skin rash may:
Start quickly
Come back
Spread
Be raised or discolored
Look like
hives
Have a central sore surrounded by pale red rings, also called a target, iris, or bulls-eye
Have liquid-filled bumps or blisters of various sizes
Be located on the upper body, legs, arms, palms, hands, or feet
Include the face or lips
Appear evenly on both sides of the body (symmetrical)
Other symptoms may include:
Bloodshot eyes
Dry eyes
Eye burning, itching, and discharge
Eye pain
Mouth sores
Vision problems
There are two forms of EM:
EM minor usually involves the skin and sometimes mouth sores.
EM major often starts with a fever and joint aches. Besides the skin sores and mouth sores, there may be sores in the eyes, genitals, lung airways, or gut.
Exams and Tests
Your health care provider will look at your skin to diagnose EM. You'll be asked about your medical history, such as recent infections or medicines you've taken.
Tests may include:
Skin lesion biopsy
Examination of skin tissue under a microscope
Treatment
EM usually goes away on its own with or without treatment.
Your provider will have you stop taking any medicines that may be causing the problem. But, don't stop taking medicines on your own without talking to your provider first.
Treatment may include:
Medicines, such as antihistamines, to control itching
Moist compresses applied to the skin
Pain medicines to reduce fever and discomfort
Mouthwashes to ease discomfort of mouth sores that interferes with eating and drinking
Antibiotics for skin infections
Corticosteroids to control inflammation
Medicines for eye symptoms
Good hygiene may help prevent
secondary infections
(infections that occur from treating the first infection).
Use of sunscreen, protective clothing, and avoiding excessive exposure to sun may prevent the recurrence of EM.
Outlook (Prognosis)
Mild forms of EM usually get better in 2 to 6 weeks, but the problem may return.
Possible Complications
Complications of EM may include:
Patchy skin color
Return of EM, especially with HSV infection
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider right away if you have symptoms of EM.
