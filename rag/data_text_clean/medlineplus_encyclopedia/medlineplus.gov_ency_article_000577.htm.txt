Fibrinolysis - primary or secondary
Fibrinolysis - primary or secondary
Fibrinolysis is a normal body process. It prevents blood clots that occur naturally from growing and causing problems.
Primary fibrinolysis refers to the normal breakdown of clots.
Secondary fibrinolysis is the breakdown of blood clots due to a medical disorder, medicine, or other cause. This may cause severe bleeding.
Causes
Blood clots form on a protein called fibrin. The breakdown of fibrin (fibrinolysis) can be due to:
Bacterial infections
Cancer
Intense exercise
Not enough oxygen to tissues
Your health care provider may give you medicines to help blood clots break down more quickly. This may be done if a blood clot causes a heart attack or other medical problem.
Alternative Names
Primary fibrinolysis; Secondary fibrinolysis
