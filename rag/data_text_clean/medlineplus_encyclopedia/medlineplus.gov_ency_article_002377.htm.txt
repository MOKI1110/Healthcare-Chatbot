Hypoventilation
Hypoventilation
Hypoventilation is breathing that is too shallow or too slow to meet the needs of the body.
If a person hypoventilates, the body's carbon dioxide level rises. This causes a buildup of acid and too little oxygen in the blood.
A person with hypoventilation might feel sleepy.
