Osmotic diuresis
Osmotic diuresis
Osmotic diuresis is increased urination due to the presence of certain substances in the fluid filtered by the kidneys. This fluid eventually becomes urine. The process of osmosis created by these substances causes additional water to come into the urine, increasing its amount.
Causes
Osmotic diuresis can be caused by:
High blood sugar (glucose)
Use of certain medicines, such as Mannitol
Images
Male urinary system
