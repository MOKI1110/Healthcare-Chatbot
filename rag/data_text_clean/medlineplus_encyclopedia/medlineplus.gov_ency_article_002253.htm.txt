Malignancy
Malignancy
The term malignancy refers to the presence of
cancerous cells
that have the ability to spread to other sites in the body (metastasize) or to invade nearby (locally) and destroy tissues. Malignant cells tend to have fast, uncontrolled growth and do not die normally due to changes in their genetic makeup.
Malignant cells that are resistant to treatment, such as
chemotherapy
or
radiation therapy
, may return after all detectable traces of them have been removed or destroyed.
