Vasoconstriction
Vasoconstriction
Vasoconstriction is the narrowing (constriction) of blood vessels by small muscles in their walls. When blood vessels constrict, blood flow is slowed or, in extreme cases, completely blocked.
Vasoconstriction may be slight or severe. It may result from disease, medicines, or psychological conditions. Medicines that cause vasoconstriction include:
Decongestants, including pseudoephedrine
Cough and cold combinations
Medicines may be used to increase or reduce vasoconstriction in very ill people.
