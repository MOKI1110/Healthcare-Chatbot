Congenital nephrotic syndrome
Congenital nephrotic syndrome
Congenital nephrotic syndrome is a disorder that is passed down through families in which a baby develops protein in the urine and swelling of the body.
Causes
Congenital nephrotic syndrome is an
autosomal recessive genetic
disorder. This means that each parent must pass on a copy of the defective gene in order for the child to have the disease.
Although congenital means present from birth, with congenital nephrotic syndrome, symptoms of the disease occur in the first 3 months of life.
Congenital nephrotic syndrome is a very rare form of nephrotic syndrome.
Nephrotic syndrome is defined by a set of abnormal findings that include:
Protein in the urine
Low blood protein levels in the blood
High cholesterol levels
High triglyceride levels
Swelling
Children with this disorder have an abnormal form of a protein called nephrin. The kidney's filters (glomeruli) need this protein to function normally.
Symptoms
Symptoms of nephrotic syndrome include:
Cough
Decreased urine output
Foamy appearance of urine
Low birth weight
Poor appetite
Swelling
(total body)
Exams and Tests
An ultrasound done on the pregnant mother may show a larger-than-normal placenta. The placenta is the organ that develops during pregnancy to feed the growing baby.
Pregnant mothers may have a screening test done during pregnancy to check for this condition. The test looks for higher-than-normal levels of alpha-fetoprotein in a sample of amniotic fluid. Genetic tests are then used to confirm the diagnosis if the screening test is positive.
After birth, the infant will show signs of severe fluid retention and swelling. The health care provider will hear abnormal sounds when listening to the baby's heart and lungs with a stethoscope. Blood pressure may be high. There may be signs of malnutrition.
urinalysis
reveals fat and large amounts of protein in the urine.
Total protein
in the blood may be low.
Treatment
Early and aggressive treatment is needed to control this disorder.
Treatment may involve:
Antibiotics to control infections
Blood pressure medicines called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) to reduce the amount of protein leaking into the urine
Diuretics ("water pills") to remove excess fluid
NSAIDs, such as indomethacin, to reduce the amount of protein leaking into the urine
Fluids may be limited to help control swelling.
The provider may recommend removing the kidneys to stop protein loss. This may be followed by
dialysis
or a
kidney transplant
.
Outlook (Prognosis)
The disorder often leads to infection, malnutrition, and kidney failure. It can lead to death by age 5, and many children die within the first year. Congenital nephrotic syndrome may be controlled in some cases with early and aggressive treatment, including an early kidney transplant.
Possible Complications
Complications of this condition include:
Acute kidney failure
Blood clots
Chronic kidney failure
End-stage kidney disease
Frequent, severe infections
Malnutrition and related diseases
When to Contact a Medical Professional
Contact your provider if your child has symptoms of congenital nephrotic syndrome.
