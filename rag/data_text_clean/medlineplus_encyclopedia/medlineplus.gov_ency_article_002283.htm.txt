Potential acuity meter
A potential acuity meter is an instrument used to examine the eyes. Your health care provider can use this tool to predict how well you may see after eye surgery. People who have reduced vision due to cataracts may also have other reasons for poor vision. The potential acuity meter will help predict what their vision will be after the cataracts are removed. If cataracts are severe, the instrument may not give useful information.
